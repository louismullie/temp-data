A 22-year-old who reports a solitary salmon colored patch a Harold patch on the trunk that enlarges over a few days is fall by a pattern of smaller lesions on the chest, abdomen and back over the coming weeks

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 22-year-old with a herald patch — a solitary salmon-colored trunk lesion that enlarges over a few days — followed by a pattern of smaller lesions on the chest, abdomen, and back over the coming weeks, focusing on diagnosis, differential, workup, management, prognosis, and special situations in pityriasis rosea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the morphology and chronology fit classic pityriasis rosea. Then, I should verify key differentials that can mimic this pattern and how to exclude them. Next, I will consider what evaluation is warranted, including when to test for syphilis or do KOH or biopsy. After that, I will outline evidence-based management for mild to severe disease, including whether antivirals help. Finally, I need to review prognosis, follow-up, special populations like pregnancy, and PR-like drug eruptions, ensuring the references support each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. The described solitary salmon-colored patch on the trunk that enlarges over days, followed by a wave of smaller oval scaly plaques on the chest, abdomen, and back over subsequent weeks, is prototypical for pityriasis rosea with a herald patch leading a secondary "Christmas tree" exanthem along cleavage lines on the trunk, especially in young adults such as this 22-year-old patient. Wait, I should verify the terminology — "Harold patch" in the trace is a typographical error; it should be "herald patch", which classically measures 2–10 cm and precedes the secondary eruption by days to two weeks [^112uqL6p] [^114gZC76].

> Hold on, let me align this with established diagnostic features. Classic PR shows a single, large, pink-to-salmon oval plaque with collarette scale (the herald patch), followed by multiple smaller oval plaques that orient parallel to Langer lines on the trunk, producing a "Christmas tree" pattern; this age group of adolescents and young adults is the epidemiologic peak, and trunk distribution with relative sparing of face, palms, and soles is expected. I should confirm that collarette scaling and cigarette paper–like central wrinkling are consistent descriptors here, which they are for PR, making this presentation clinically diagnostic in most cases [^112uqL6p] [^114gZC76] [^111UtYyW].

> Next, I should review the key differentials and actively exclude them. Guttate psoriasis can mimic the trunk distribution with raindrop papules, but it typically lacks a herald patch and shows thicker, silvery scale; dermoscopy often reveals regular dotted vessels in guttate psoriasis versus patchy dotted vessels and yellow-white scale in PR — wait, let me double-check that dermoscopic distinction, which supports PR here. Secondary syphilis must be considered because it can be papulosquamous and widespread with palm/sole involvement and lymphadenopathy; an RPR is essential if features are atypical or risk is present. Tinea corporis can produce annular plaques with peripheral scaling and central clearing; a KOH can clarify if fungal elements are suspected. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica presents as persistent papules in different stages without a herald patch. Erythema multiforme is targetoid and often mucosal. In this vignette, the herald patch followed by classic trunk distribution makes these less likely, but I should not dismiss syphilis testing if any atypical sign is present [^113jmgF9] [^116wdZGm].

> I will now examine whether any atypical features are suggested. About 20% of PR cases are atypical in morphology or distribution, and a herald patch can be absent; variants include vesicular, purpuric, inverse/flexural, acral/palmar-plantar, unilateral, Blaschkoid, or limb-girdle patterns, sometimes with mucosal involvement. Let me reconsider the vignette — no face, palm, sole, or mucosal involvement is reported, and the age and distribution are classic, so atypical PR seems unlikely here, but I should keep in mind that absence of a herald patch would not exclude PR in other cases [^116c4nVw] [^114NUWXm] [^112sJrgp].

> I need to check the appropriate evaluation. For classic cases, diagnosis is clinical and no labs are required. If features are atypical or there is risk for sexually transmitted infection or palm/sole involvement, I should confirm with nontreponemal testing (e.g. RPR) to exclude secondary syphilis. KOH preparation is reasonable when tinea corporis is suspected. Biopsy is generally unnecessary in classic PR; when done, histology demonstrates a subacute spongiotic dermatitis pattern with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, parakeratosis, mild spongiosis, extravasated erythrocytes, and a T cell–predominant infiltrate, which are supportive but not pathognomonic — let me verify that these findings align, and they do [^1158uASm] [^113jmgF9] [^117SWeRz] [^1119QddJ].

> Now, management — hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Most PR is self-limited and needs only reassurance and symptom relief. I should confirm the expected course: resolution in 6–8 weeks for over 80% of patients, usually without scarring, though pruritus can be moderate and worse with heat. First-line symptomatic care includes topical corticosteroids for itch or inflammation, oral antihistamines, soothing lotions like calamine, and emollients; these improve pruritus without clearly shortening disease. Narrow-band UVB phototherapy can be considered for severe pruritus or extensive disease, though logistical burden is notable. This all aligns with standard primary care and dermatology guidance [^112g2LA6] [^1158uASm] [^113EwEb3] [^116aM8rj].

> But wait, what if symptoms are severe or the eruption is extensive or highly bothersome? Antiviral therapy can be considered; evidence (largely small trials and case series) suggests acyclovir or valacyclovir started earlier may shorten the disease course and reduce symptom burden. Let me double-check doses: acyclovir 400 mg three times daily for 7 days can be as effective as higher-dose regimens, and valacyclovir 1 g three times daily for 7 days has shown improvement and resolution in cases, though I should acknowledge the self-limited nature of PR and case series limitations. I need to ensure patients are counseled that data quality is limited and to weigh benefits against costs and pill burden [^113EwEb3] [^111F7yrR] [^11739hXw] [^116py2kS].

> Hmm, wait a minute — are macrolides helpful? Early reports with erythromycin suggested benefit, but azithromycin has not shown efficacy and should not be used for PR with the intent to cure. I should correct any tendency to prescribe macrolides here; supportive care and, when indicated, antivirals are more appropriate paths [^115kvudz].

> Next, I should review prognosis and follow-up. PR is benign and self-resolving, generally clearing within 6–8 weeks without scarring, though the herald patch can linger longer; recurrence is uncommon but documented, and when it happens, lesions are usually fewer and smaller. I should confirm that follow-up at 2–4 weeks is reasonable to monitor symptom trajectory, ensure no atypical evolution, and provide ongoing reassurance or escalate therapy for bothersome pruritus or extensive disease [^112g2LA6] [^111Xb9fW] [^111F7yrR].

> I need to ensure I address special situations. In pregnancy — especially first trimester — some reports link PR to higher risks of adverse outcomes, although more recent data suggest lower risk than older studies, with risk higher when onset is early and disease extensive or systemic. I should counsel pregnant patients carefully, consider closer obstetric follow-up, and weigh antiviral therapy on a case-by-case basis after discussing the limited evidence and risk–benefit profile. Let me verify those risk gradients and the nuance of more recent data — they are indeed more reassuring but still call for vigilance [^1168oMvo] [^117THvRp].

> Hold on, I should verify medication-related mimics. PR-like drug eruptions can resemble classic PR but behave as hypersensitivity reactions; a careful medication history is crucial, including agents such as imatinib, biologics, ACE inhibitors, antidepressants, and others. Distinguishing true PR (often associated with HHV-6/7 reactivation) from PR-like eruption has clinical implications for whether to continue the inciting medication; proposed criteria include clinical, histopathologic, and virologic features, though these are not always checked in practice. If suspicion for PR-like drug eruption is high, discontinuation of the culprit drug is usually preferred when feasible, while classic PR does not mandate stopping necessary therapies [^113dD2RZ] [^112LWdwM] [^111NWAUq] [^111oHSBz].

> Final check and synthesis: The 22-year-old patient's solitary herald patch on the trunk followed by a generalized, salmon-colored, scaly, cleavage line–oriented eruption over weeks is most consistent with classic pityriasis rosea. Diagnosis is clinical; no routine labs are needed unless features are atypical or risk factors suggest testing (e.g. RPR) or other etiologies (KOH for tinea) are suspected. Management focuses on reassurance and pruritus control with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines; consider narrow-band UVB for severe itch and a short course of acyclovir or valacyclovir for severe or highly symptomatic cases after shared decision-making, while avoiding macrolides like azithromycin. Follow-up in 2–4 weeks to ensure expected trajectory is prudent, with counseling on the self-limited nature and rare recurrence, and special consideration in pregnancy or suspected drug-induced PR-like eruptions. Let me confirm there are no red flags here that would change course — none are apparent in the vignette, supporting this plan [^112uqL6p] [^113jmgF9] [^1158uASm] [^111F7yrR] [^115kvudz].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **pityriasis rosea**, a self-limited papulosquamous eruption that begins with a herald patch [^112uqL6p] and is followed by smaller lesions in a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk and proximal limbs [^113jmgF9]. The rash typically **resolves within 6–8 weeks** [^112g2LA6] without scarring, and management is supportive with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for pruritus [^1158uASm]; antivirals may be considered in severe or early cases [^113EwEb3] [^111F7yrR]. Key differentials include **secondary syphilis, tinea corporis, guttate psoriasis, and drug eruptions**, which should be excluded with serology, KOH prep, and clinical correlation [^113jmgF9].

---

## Clinical features of pityriasis rosea

- **Herald patch**: A single, oval, salmon-colored lesion with a collarette of scale, typically 2–10 cm, appearing on the trunk or proximal limbs [^1158uASm].

- **Secondary eruption**: Multiple smaller, oval, pink or salmon-colored plaques with fine peripheral scaling, appearing 5–14 days after the herald patch [^112g2LA6].

- **Distribution**: Lesions align along cleavage lines, creating a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk and proximal limbs [^113jmgF9].

- **Pruritus**: Mild to moderate itching, worsened by heat or sweating, occurs in about 25% of cases.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Mild prodromal symptoms (sore throat, fever, malaise) may precede the rash [^112g2LA6].

- **Duration**: Self-limited, resolving within 6–8 weeks without scarring [^111UtYyW].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

Viral association involves reactivation of **HHV-6 and HHV-7** [^114gZC76], though the exact cause remains uncertain [^112uqL6p]. The **immune response** is predominantly T-cell-mediated [^1119QddJ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key mimics of **pityriasis rosea** to consider include:

| **Condition** | **Distinguishing features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|
| Secondary syphilis | - Generalized rash including palms/soles <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - No herald patch | Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test [^113jmgF9] |
| Tinea corporis | Annular lesions with central clearing | KOH preparation [^1158uASm] |
| Guttate psoriasis | - Small, drop-like lesions <br/> - Thicker silvery scales | - Clinical history <br/> - Biopsy [^116wdZGm] |
| Drug eruption | - Recent medication use <br/> - Atypical distribution | - Medication history <br/> - Clinical correlation [^113dD2RZ] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on the characteristic herald patch followed by typical secondary lesions [^112uqL6p] [^1158uASm]. Laboratory tests are not routinely required; obtain an RPR or perform a KOH prep if the presentation is atypical [^113jmgF9]. Histopathology is rarely needed. When performed, it shows focal parakeratosis, mild acanthosis, and a lymphocytic infiltrate [^1119QddJ].

---

## Management and treatment

- **Supportive care**: Topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines for pruritus [^1158uASm] [^116aM8rj].

- **Antivirals**: Acyclovir or valacyclovir may shorten duration in severe or early cases [^113EwEb3] [^111F7yrR] [^112EzdgL] [^11739hXw].

- **Phototherapy**: Narrow-band UVB for severe or persistent cases [^1158uASm] [^113EwEb3].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent** [^111UtYyW], with resolution within 6–8 weeks without scarring [^112g2LA6]. Complications are **rare**; post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may occur, especially in darker skin tones [^112sJrgp].

---

## Patient education and counseling

- **Self-limited nature**: Reassure patients that the condition resolves spontaneously [^1158uASm] [^112uqL6p].

- **Non-contagious**: PR is not contagious [^1158uASm].

- **Symptom management**: Advise on topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and avoiding heat/sweating [^113EwEb3].

- **Follow-up**: Schedule follow-up to monitor resolution and address concerns [^112uqL6p].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **pityriasis rosea**, characterized by a herald patch followed by a "Christmas tree" pattern of lesions. It is self-limited, resolving in 6–8 weeks, and managed with supportive care; antivirals may be used in severe cases [^113jmgF9].

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of Pityriasis rosea [^112uqL6p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is often clinically identified by the presence of a "herald patch", which is typically a single, large, slightly raised, oval or round erythematous scaly patch that appears on the trunk or neck. This patch is usually pink or salmon-colored and ranges from 2 to 10 centimeters in diameter. It is observed in 50–90% of patients.

Within a few days to 2 weeks after the herald patch appears, multiple smaller scaly, oval, pink, or salmon-colored plaques with fine scaling edges develop. These secondary lesions often align along the cleavage lines of the trunk and limbs, creating a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern. While the rash primarily affects the trunk and limbs, it can also appear on the neck, arms, and legs, though it rarely involves the face, palms, or soles.

These lesions present as elliptical or oval macules and papules, exhibiting fine scaling and a central wrinkling that resembles cigarette paper. A distinctive feature of PR is the collarette scale appearance, where the scale is attached at the periphery but lifted near the center. The distribution of lesions is generally bilateral and diffuse, with the long axis parallel to the skin tension lines.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^11739hXw]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an acute, self-resolving exanthem that often does not necessitate treatment. However, in some cases, it can be very symptomatic and cover a large body surface area, thus necessitating effective and fast-acting treatment options. We presented the cases of three patients with PR who were treated with antivirals (valacyclovir and acyclovir). All cases resolved in two to three weeks when watchful management led to worsening symptoms. Larger studies are warranted to further elucidate antiviral efficacy and optimal timing of use — early versus late in the course of the disease — as well as the effect on pregnancy outcomes in patients with PR. The findings of this study suggest that the use of antivirals could be a cost-effective first-line treatment option for patients with severe or recalcitrant PR and an option for those with early signs and symptoms to shorten the course of the disease.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^113EwEb3]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Symptomatic treatment options for pityriasis rosea (PR) often include oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or topical calamine, and possibly phototherapy. Although treatment with oral antihistamines or topical corticosteroids/calamine alone does not seem to impact the trajectory of the eruption, these were shown to improve symptoms such as pruritus. Phototherapy with narrow-band UV-B has also been proposed as a possible treatment option; however, this may require three sessions per week for at least one month, which would be inconvenient and costly for many patients. Thus, although these options remain important and cost-effective adjuncts for the treatment of PR, they may not adequately halt the spread of the eruption.

Although antivirals have been shown to have efficacy and alter the course of PR, they are often overlooked as an initial treatment option. In multiple studies, acyclovir led to improvement over placebo in erythema during the first four weeks of follow-up, scaling during the first three weeks, and symptoms during the first two weeks. Specifically, it is hypothesized that during the initial stages of the eruption, the viral replicative activity is highest, thus emphasizing the importance and efficacy of an earlier intervention. When choosing a dosing regimen, it has been shown that low-dose acyclovir (400 mg three times daily for seven days) was as effective in decreasing rash duration and pruritus as high-dose acyclovir (800 mg three times daily for seven days or 400 mg five times daily for seven days). In fact, when examining complete regression after seven days, some studies found that the low-dose regimen was…

### Dermoscopic characterization of guttate psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, and pityriasis lichenoides chronica in dark skin phototypes: An observational study [^116wdZGm]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Dermoscopy as a diagnostic tool is gaining momentum in the field of inflammatory dermatoses, with the cumulative description of characteristic findings in most dermatoses sometimes eliminating the need for a biopsy. In this retrospective observational study, 20 histopathology-confirmed cases each of pityriasis rosea (PR), guttate psoriasis (GP), and pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) observed over a period of 3 years were included. Dermoscopy images were extracted from photographic archives for evaluation, and three lesions from each patient (totaling 60 lesions each) were analyzed. The comparison of dermoscopic characteristics was conducted among PR, GP, and PLC in pairs using the chi-square test, with a P-value of less than .05 considered significant.

- **Background color**: The most common background color in PR (86.7%) and PLC (96.7%) was yellow to yellow-orange, while in GP, it was dull red to pink (70%).

- **Vessel patterns**: Vessels were visualized in all lesions of GP, with the most characteristic pattern being regular (93.3%) dotted vessels (95%). In PR, 63.3% of lesions had dotted vessels, mostly in a patchy distribution (56.7%).

- **Scale color**: The most prominent scale color in PR was yellow-white (88.3%), while in GP, it was white-gray (80%). In PLC, varying colors were observed, the most prominent being brown (53.3%).

Characteristic findings seen only in PLC included hypopigmented areas (13.3%), brown dots and globules (53.3%), and orange-yellow structureless areas (61.7%). GP, PR, and PLC reveal specific dermoscopic findings that can assist in differentiating these conditions. Furthermore, the known dermoscopic criteria for GP, PR, and PLC also apply to dark skin phototypes.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^112g2LA6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal lesions can occur in up to 28% of patients with pityriasis rosea (PR). These lesions are painless and typically associated with the exanthem of PR. The most frequently observed patterns include petechial, macular, and papular lesions. Petechial enanthem has been predominantly associated with persistent PR and pediatric PR, while macular and papular lesions are seen across various forms of the disease, including relapsing PR and classic PR. It is important to examine the oropharyngeal mucosa in patients with PR, as the presence of these lesions can help distinguish PR from other mucosal diseases and may indicate a more atypical course of the disease, such as persistent or relapsing forms.

Some patients may experience mild prodromal symptoms before the appearance of the herald patch, including a sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbances, fever, and arthralgia. Although the rash may be asymptomatic, some individuals may experience mild to moderate itching, which can worsen with heat or sweating. Severe itching occurs in about 25% of cases. Occasionally, patients may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, or slight enlargement of lymph nodes. The rash of pityriasis rosea typically resolves within 6 to 8 weeks in more than 80% of patients, though it may persist longer in some cases. It usually resolves spontaneously without leaving scars, and the herald patch may last longer than the secondary lesions.

### Pityriasis rosea: Diagnosis and treatment [^1158uASm]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common self-limiting rash that usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the Langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs. The diagnosis is based on clinical and physical examination findings. The herald patch is an erythematous lesion with an elevated border and depressed center.

The generalized rash usually presents two weeks after the herald patch. Patients can develop general malaise, fatigue, nausea, headaches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and sore throat before or during the course of the rash.

- **Differential diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis includes secondary syphilis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, tinea corporis, viral exanthems, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruption associated with certain medications.

- **Treatment**: Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and consists of corticosteroids or antihistamines. In some cases, acyclovir can be used to treat symptoms and reduce the length of the disease. Ultraviolet phototherapy can also be considered for severe cases.

Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy has been linked to spontaneous abortions.

### Localized pityriasis rosea [^112GraBu]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a relatively common skin disorder. In its typical form, it is easily recognizable; however, atypical forms can pose diagnostic problems. We report a 44-year-old woman with an acute onset of a localized eruption on her left breast. The morphology of the rash and the time course were typical of pityriasis rosea. Localized pityriasis rosea is an unusual variant, which has been described previously.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114gZC76]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a prevalent dermatological condition characterized by a distinctive herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions, often forming a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains uncertain, with hypotheses pointing to both infectious and noninfectious origins. Human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated, with evidence suggesting viral reactivation as a potential trigger.

Epidemiologically, PR affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. The condition is observed globally, with varying incidence rates and seasonal variations suggesting an infectious component. While PR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort due to pruritus, and atypical presentations and recurrences complicate diagnosis and management.

This review evaluates the understanding of PR's pathogenesis, highlighting both infectious and noninfectious hypotheses, including viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. It also examines treatment options, such as antivirals and phototherapy, which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify etiological factors and to explore the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies, especially for atypical or recurrent cases.

### Prurigo pigmentosa: Case series and differentiation from confluent and reticulated papillomatosis [^112Su6Ej]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Prurigo pigmentosa (PP) is an uncommon, acquired inflammatory disorder with a predilection for young adults of Asian descent. This condition is manifested by highly pruritic, reticulated, and erythematous papules that resolve with hyperpigmentation. Multiple cases of PP have been reported since its initial description in 1971 by Nagashima et al; however, this dermatosis is still underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The most significant challenge limiting the identification of PP is the successful distinction from confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP). Herein, two patients with PP are described, with a focus on differentiating features from CARP.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug reaction to asenapine [^111NWAUq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a relatively common, benign skin disease of unknown etiology. In rare cases, medications can induce a morphologically similar eruption. We present a case of a PR-like drug eruption caused by the atypical antipsychotic asenapine. The clinical presentation consisted of a rapidly progressive, disseminated, and severely pruritic dermatitis comprised of ovoid, scaly, pink-violaceous plaques. The initial histopathologic specimen was consistent with PR, but upon re-sampling a week later, the findings favored a drug eruption. PR-like drug eruptions, though rare, can occur in response to a wide variety of medications. Because the findings may be only subtly different than those of typical PR, careful clinical and histopathological correlation must be sought. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a PR-like drug eruption to asenapine.

### Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography assessment of pityriasis rosea [^117SWeRz]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The histologic diagnosis revealed that the punch biopsy showed a subacute spongiotic process (Fig 4). Epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and mild spongiosis were present, with foci of parakeratosis featuring mild infiltration of mononuclear cells and extravasation of erythrocytes within the papillary dermis. These features of spongiotic dermatitis are consistent with pityriasis rosea (PR) based on the clinical presentation.

### Overview of atopic dermatitis [^115uGTFP]. The American Journal of Managed Care (2017). High credibility.

The disease atopic dermatitis can be associated with various symptoms and conditions, including allergic crease, skin thickening, and red to brownish-gray patches. It is also related to the Schultz-Larsen criteria, eczema herpeticum, skin dryness, and pityriasis alba. Patients may experience dry skin patches, nail pitting, scaly skin patches, and skin excoriations. There is a notable association with food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and increased serum IgE levels. The condition can manifest as skin rash, atopy, skin erythema, and skin papules. Additional features include the Dennie-Morgan fold, pruritus, oozing, keratosis pilaris, rough skin patches, and allergic reactions. Furthermore, the Hanifin and Rajka criteria may be considered in its evaluation. Atopic dermatitis can also contribute to difficulty sleeping and asthma.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113PcQiG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

While this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and differential diagnoses of pityriasis rosea (PR), it is subject to some limitations. The review relies on the available literature, and variations in study quality, sample sizes, and geographic differences may limit the generalizability of the conclusions. Additionally, publication bias may have led to an overrepresentation of unusual or positive findings. We also did not perform a systematic meta-analysis, which limits the ability to quantitatively synthesize the data. As PR research evolves, more rigorous studies and controlled trials are needed to further refine our understanding.

### Pityriasis rosea-like eruption during treatment with imatinib mesylate: Description of 3 cases [^112LWdwM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Imatinib mesylate (IM) represents the first-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We hereby relate three cases of an IM-induced pityriasis rosea (PR)-like cutaneous eruption. Patients developed an erythematous, slightly pruritic, macular skin eruption, with many lesions having a peripheral collarette of desquamation. These lesions were confined to the trunk, limbs, and arms with a vaguely dermatomal diffusion. The histologic findings suggested a reactive process to the drug. Full dermatological recovery was obtained after IM discontinuation, but lesions reappeared upon resuming therapy, suggesting the drug-related nature of the rash. To our knowledge, this is the first reported PR-like cutaneous eruption to IM.

### A herald patch almost encircling the trunk-extreme pityriasis rosea gigantea in a young child [^115aWvyN]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

An 18-month-old girl presented with pityriasis rosea gigantea, characterized by a herald patch almost encircling the entire trunk. The distribution of lesions on the trunk and proximal aspects of the limbs, along with the collarette scaling and the orientation of some lesions along the skin crease lines, supported the diagnosis. Additionally, biopsy findings further substantiated the diagnosis.

### The pathophysiology of pityriasis alba: Time-dependent histologic changes [^112u26NA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Although pityriasis alba is a common dermatologic condition, its pathogenesis is poorly understood, and there are many discrepancies in the literature. To assess the effect of the duration of disease on the histologic findings, a search of cases labeled "pityriasis alba" was performed on any cases submitted to our dermatopathology laboratory. Of 179 cases of pityriasis alba, five cases identified the duration of the disease when the biopsy was taken. A biopsy for a lesion of only 1-month duration demonstrated groups of large, prominent melanocytes heaped up upon one another. Compared with biopsies from patients who had the lesions for increasingly longer periods of time, it was apparent that the melanocytes became progressively less abundant and smaller with less prominent dendritic processes. The time that the biopsy is taken may affect the histologic findings of pityriasis alba. Additionally, an abundance of melanosomes was observed between the melanocytes in all sections examined, which may reflect a problem with the transfer of melanosomes into keratinocytes in this condition.

We report the case of a 16-year-old Indian girl who presented with multiple small papular lesions and larger erythema multiforme-like plaques in a Christmas tree pattern over her body for 3 weeks. Histopathologic examination was performed, and she was diagnosed with pityriasis rosea presenting with two atypical morphological variants: generalized papular and erythema multiforme-like. A brief review of the literature on these two rare types is also presented.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^112EzdgL]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on 9 patient cases from 2 clinical dermatology sites: 1 academic center and 1 private practice, both located in New Jersey. The patients, aged 22 to 72 years, were evaluated between 2018 and 2022. Follow-up evaluations occurred weeks to months after treatment, documenting improvements in rash appearance and symptoms, along with any medication adverse events or intolerance. Clinical photographs monitored progress.

- **Response to treatment**: Response was characterized in three tiers:
	1. **None**: Defined as lack of response or persistence of lesions and symptoms after the full treatment course.
	2. **Significant improvement**: Improvement in the appearance and symptoms of primary lesions, but without complete clearance.
	3. **Resolved**: Clearance of primary lesions with the absence of residual symptoms, with either the absence or presence of mild postinflammatory secondary changes.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114NUWXm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Atypical variants of pityriasis rosea account for approximately 20% of all cases. These variants can differ significantly from the classical presentation — owing to morphology, size, distribution, course, or symptoms — making diagnosis more challenging. Research suggests that children are more predisposed to atypical variants of PR in comparison with adults, with atopy playing a possible role.

Atypical pityriasis rosea (PR) can present in diverse forms, deviating from the classic herald patch followed by smaller lesions. It may include vesicular, purpuric, urticarial, or papulovesicular lesions and, rarely, erythema multiforme-like or targetoid lesions. The size of these lesions varies, with some significantly smaller or larger than the typical 2–10 cm diameter. Unlike the usual "Christmas tree" pattern, atypical lesions may appear in unusual locations such as the face, palms, soles, or mucous membranes, which are generally spared in classic cases. The rash duration can also differ, sometimes lasting longer than the typical 6–8 weeks or resolving more quickly. While classic PR is often asymptomatic or mildly itchy, atypical forms may present with more severe symptoms, including significant pruritus, especially upon contact with sweat, leading to excoriations, pain, or systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.

### Follicular psoriasis: Differentiation from pityriasis rubra pilaris-an illustrative case and review of the literature [^113LBToY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The follicular presentation of psoriasis is a well-described but uncommon variant. In some cases, follicular psoriasis may clinically and histopathologically mimic pityriasis rubra pilaris. Several reports discuss the resemblance of widespread follicular psoriasis in children to pityriasis rubra pilaris. We describe a case of follicular psoriasis in a 16-year-old Black girl with acrally distributed follicular hyperkeratotic papules and associated keratoderma of her plantar surfaces resembling pityriasis rubra pilaris.

### Relapsing pityriasis rosea with HHV-7 reactivation in an 11-year-old girl [^111Xb9fW]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) usually presents as acute exanthema with oval erythematous-squamous lesions localized on the trunk, arms, and legs, with spontaneous remission. We present an unusual case of PR with frequent relapses over a period of 7 years. An 11-year-old white female patient presented with many pruritic erythematous oval lesions on her trunk. A second episode followed 2 years later, with several pruritic erythematous lesions on her lower limbs. During the subsequent 5 years, the patient experienced several relapses per year, with 1 to 3 lesions appearing in varying locations. PR was diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and detection of human herpesvirus 7 DNA. Spontaneous remission occurred without treatment in each episode. Relapsing PR is a rare form of PR, characterized by fewer and smaller lesions compared to the classic form. Pediatricians should consider the diagnosis of relapsing PR even if only a single or few erythematous lesions are present.

### Azithromycin does not cure pityriasis rosea [^115kvudz]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common skin disorder in children. Its cause is unknown. A recent publication reported a 73% cure rate in patients with PR after treatment with erythromycin. To duplicate this result using a drug with fewer adverse effects and a greater biological half-life, we set out to study the effect of azithromycin on PR. Azithromycin is an azalide antibiotic with a spectrum of antimicrobial activity very similar to that of erythromycin.

- **Design**: We randomly assigned 49 children with PR to receive either azithromycin (12 mg/kg per day, up to a maximum of 500 mg/day) for 5 days or a similar-appearing placebo. Study physicians were blinded to the patients' treatment type. Two pediatricians had to agree on the diagnosis of PR before patients could be enrolled. Subjects were seen at follow-up visits 1, 2, and 4 weeks after starting treatment.

- **Outcome measures**: We measured the appearance of new lesions and resolution of lesions.

- **Results**: Rates of cure and of partial resolution were similar in the azithromycin and placebo groups.

- **Conclusion**: Azithromycin does not cure PR.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Several conditions may mimic pityriasis rosea (PR) and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:

- **Secondary syphilis**: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR. However, it usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution. Lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.

- **Tinea corporis**: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.

- **Erythema multiforme**: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.

- **Guttate psoriasis**: Characterized by small, rain-drop patterned, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR. It often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis. The scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.

- **Pityriasis lichenoides chronica**: Chronic, scaly, red-brown papules may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, with one or more showing a darker center and a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.

- **Pityriasis alba**: Hypopigmented.

### Pityriasis rosea-like cutaneous eruption as a possible dermatological manifestation after Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine: Case report and brief literature review [^113uk3Jj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) has been manifested in patients suffering from COVID-19 as well as after vaccine protocols against SARS-CoV-2. It has a possible association with the HHV-6B virus (roseola infantum) and can be controlled by antivirals such as acyclovir, as well as by the amino acid l-Lysine, which showed a positive result in reducing the number of lesions and healing time. The aim of this study was to report a case of PR following a second dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca, the adopted therapy, and a brief literature review.

A 53-year-old woman, phototype II, presented with an erythematous lesion on the posterior right thigh 15 days after the second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Eight days after the initial injury, new injuries appeared on the calf, buttocks, and thighs. The diagnosis was PR with a 5-week eruption cycle. The treatment consisted of the use of l-Lysine, with a 3-gram loading dose and 500 mg for 30 days, and moisturizing/healing lotion, starting 14 days after the herald patch. After the 5th week of the disease cycle, there were no new eruptions, and the repair cycle continued for up to 8 weeks, leaving some residual skin spots.

It is concluded that the patient may be a carrier of a latent virus, HHV-6, and that the vaccine administration, with immune system stimulation, would have activated the virus causing PR. l-Lysine helped to control the manifestation by limiting the number of lesions and their location, which were restricted to the legs, thighs, and buttocks.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^115CkZd1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

In cases of atypical pityriasis rosea (PR), particularly when systemic symptoms are present or when the herald patch is absent and the exanthem is widespread, it is essential to consider other infectious exanthems in the differential diagnosis. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Parvovirus B19 are two potential infectious agents that can present with exanthems similar to PR.

EBV, a herpesvirus, can cause a variety of dermatological manifestations, including morbilliform, papulovesicular, and petechial eruptions during systemic infection. In some cases, EBV can lead to a florid morbilliform eruption or other atypical exanthems, which may resemble PR. EBV-associated exanthems may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fatigue, which can overlap with the prodromal symptoms of PR. A thorough clinical history, including serological testing for EBV (e.g. positive viral capsid antigen IgM in acute infection), can help differentiate EBV-related exanthems from PR in patients presenting with systemic signs.

Similarly, Parvovirus B19 should be considered in patients with an atypical PR-like presentation and systemic involvement. Parvovirus B19 is known to cause erythema infectiosum, which can mimic PR with its characteristic facial rash ('slapped cheek' appearance) and systemic symptoms, such as fever and arthralgia. In some cases, Parvovirus B19 infection can present with a widespread, nonspecific exanthem that can be confused with PR.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bacterial keratitis, particularly in relation to history and physical examination, the AAO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining fluorescein or rose bengal/lissamine green staining of the cornea. This provides additional information about other factors, such as the presence of dendrites, pseudodendrites, loose or exposed sutures, foreign bodies, and any epithelial defect. It is important to differentiate between epithelium staining and stain pooling in an area of corneal thinning.

### Pityriasis rosea and pityriasis rosea-like eruptions: How to distinguish them [^113dD2RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We appreciate the article from Bitar et al. on ibrutinib-associated pityriasis rosea (PR)-like rash, which allows us to share our experience and make some observations. Recently, we proposed criteria to distinguish PR from PR-like eruptions (Table I). In fact, distinguishing them is of paramount importance, as typical PR may develop during, but independently from, a therapy. During PR, a self-limiting exanthematous disease associated with the endogenous systemic reactivation of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and/or HHV-7, the drug (if indispensable for the health of the patient, except for immunosuppressive therapies that can favor viral reactivation) may be cautiously continued.

When the skin rash is diagnosed as a drug reaction with morphological features similar to genuine PR (a PR-like eruption), it is preferable to stop the drug immediately to prevent more dangerous drug reactions. Indeed, the interesting case described by Bitar et al. has some characteristics of PR-like eruptions, such as the presence of itch on the lesions, the dusky-red color of the lesions, and the superficial and perivascular eosinophil infiltration in the dermis. However, it is uncommon after several months to have resolution of the eruption without interruption of the drug. In fact, this course of the disease is more typical for PR. Unfortunately, the authors did not investigate potential signs of HHV-6 and HHV-7 reactivation, such as detection of HHV-6/7 DNA in plasma and detection of positive IgM antibodies against HHV-6/7 in serum.

### Alopecia areata: Disease characteristics, clinical evaluation, and new perspectives on pathogenesis [^117XccQW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, inflammatory, nonscarring type of hair loss. Significant variations in the clinical presentation of AA have been observed, ranging from small, well-circumscribed patches of hair loss to a complete absence of body and scalp hair. Patients affected by AA encompass all age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, and may experience frustration with the unpredictable nature of their disease, for which there is currently no definitive treatment. The cause of AA remains incompletely understood, though it is believed to result, at least in part, from a loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle, autoimmune-mediated hair follicle destruction, and the upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Patients with AA frequently experience marked impairment in psychological well-being and self-esteem and may be more likely to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. Part one of this two-part continuing medical education series describes the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, prognosis, and recent advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AA.

### Pityriasis rosea, pityriasis rosea-like eruptions, and herpes zoster in the setting of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination [^116PRChK]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR), PR-like eruptions (PR-LE), and herpes zoster have been frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and following COVID-19 vaccination. PR is a self-limiting exanthematous disease, and herpes zoster is a treatable condition; therefore, their occurrence does not require discontinuation of the vaccination schedule. PR-LE is a hypersensitivity reaction and is, therefore, less predictable in its course.

In the case of a booster dose, the clinical manifestation may not recur, may be different from PR-LE, or may present with systemic symptoms; however, in the case of PR-LE, the possibility of mild and predominantly cutaneous adverse events should not discourage all eligible candidates from receiving and completing the COVID-19 vaccination program, as such adverse reactions represent a small risk considering the possible severe and fatal outcome of COVID-19.

We emphasize the relevance of looking for any viral reactivation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have skin eruptions. The search for viral reactivations could be useful not only for distinguishing between PR and PR-LE but also because viral reactivations may contribute to a patient's systemic inflammation and influence the course of the disease.

A 72-year-old man presented with a 4-week history of a rash diagnosed clinically as pityriasis rosea (PR). He was started on valacyclovir 1 g taken orally three times daily for 7 days. No other topical or oral treatments were prescribed. On follow-up 4 weeks after the initial presentation, his rash had resolved. He reported no side effects from the valacyclovir. The total time from onset to follow-up after treatment was 8 weeks.

A 27-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of a rash diagnosed clinically as PR. He was started on valacyclovir 1 g taken orally three times daily for 7 days and was also prescribed topical triamcinolone 0.1% cream. On follow-up 2 weeks after the initial presentation, his rash had significantly improved. He reported no side effects from the valacyclovir. The total time from onset to follow-up after treatment was 2 weeks and 3 days.

A 67-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of a rash diagnosed clinically as PR. She was started on valacyclovir 1 g taken orally three times daily for 7 days and was also prescribed topical triamcinolone 0.1% cream. On follow-up 2 weeks after the initial presentation, her rash was resolved. She reported no side effects from the valacyclovir. The total time from onset to follow-up after treatment was 3 weeks.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris type 1 spontaneously resolving after 20 years [^115verpj]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is an uncommon, idiopathic, papulosquamous eruption. We report a longitudinal study of a patient with PRP type 1 who was treated with retinoid therapy for 9 years and whose symptoms resolved spontaneously after 20 years. There are no data in the literature on the disease course of PRP type 1 persisting beyond the usual 3 years. This case highlights both the extreme chronicity of PRP and the possibility of remission after many years of active disease.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris-like eruption in the setting of transient acantholytic dermatosis [^1149YNw4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

TAD is characterized by discrete, pruritic erythematous papules and papulovesicles, commonly found on the trunk of older white men. Lesions can vary from a few to several dozen and may be transient or chronic. Histologically, TAD presents as acantholysis frequently associated with dyskeratosis and may mimic Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, or pemphigus. The exact etiology of TAD is unknown, but it can be associated with excessive heat, perspiration, ultraviolet exposure, and malignancy.

PRP is a rare condition with a similarly unknown etiology. The classic type (type 1) presents as pruritic follicular keratotic papules that coalesce into erythematous or salmon-colored plaques with intervening areas of uninvolved skin. The lesions usually start on the face and scalp and progress caudally, and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles may develop. The condition frequently progresses to erythroderma. Histopathologic findings of PRP often include psoriasiform hyperplasia with alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in both vertical and horizontal directions and follicular plugging. Acantholytic dyskeratosis in PRP was first described in 1989 by Kao and Sulica, and has increasingly been reported as a potential histological feature of PRP. As in TAD, variable patterns of acantholysis, including suprabasal, midepidermal, subcorneal, and follicular, with or without dyskeratosis, have been reported, often in cases of PRP that were originally diagnosed as a different disease.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^116py2kS]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The study has several limitations. One limitation is the number of cases included in the series. Another issue is that pityriasis rosea (PR), often diagnosed clinically, was not confirmed through biopsies. All patients in the study received topical steroids, and one patient was also prescribed doxycycline alongside antivirals, which could lead to confounding results. Finally, considering that PR is a self-resolving condition, the natural progression of the disease might have contributed to some of the patients' improvements.

### Pityriasis rosea during omalizumab treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^116tdKGY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an exanthematous disease whose etiology is related to the reactivation of human herpesviruses 6 (HHV-6) and 7 (HHV-7). We observed two cases of PR arising during omalizumab therapy for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Here, we report for the first time PR occurring during omalizumab treatment. After PR diagnosis, viral serology was performed. Data in the literature about omalizumab's mechanism of action, PR, and HHV-6/7 infection were analyzed to identify possible correlations. In both of our cases, IgM against HHV-6 and HHV-7 were negative. The first patient presented altered IgG titers for both viruses (1:160 and 1:80, respectively), while only HHV-6 IgG (1:320) were detected in the second patient. From data in the literature, we consider it presumable that apoptotic immune cells due to omalizumab immunomodulation could release viral proteins produced from integrated DNA. This could elicit cutaneous cross-reactivity and PR onset.

In conclusion, we think there is a link between omalizumab therapy and PR occurring in patients with CSU. Our case history is too small to draw firm conclusions. Data collection of similar cases could be helpful to improve our knowledge.

### Relaxed constraint and functional divergence of the progesterone receptor (PGR) in the human stem-lineage [^115TcTNb]. PLoS Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

While isoform switching is ancestral in primates and rodents and thus did not evolve to initiate parturition, there is evidence supporting its role in the initiation of human labor. Furthermore, the role of progesterone in the maintenance of pregnancy up to term is supported by studies showing that disruption of progesterone signaling by the PR-A/PR-B antagonist RU486 at any stage of pregnancy results in myometrial contractions and the initiation of labor in rodents and primates, including humans. Our observation that the human PR-A is a weaker trans-repressor of PR-B suggests that if isoform switching plays a role in the initiation or progression of parturition, this function may have changed in the human lineage.

For example, if repression of PR-B mediated progesterone signaling by PR-A is important for initiating parturition at term, as proposed by the isoform switching hypothesis, then human PR-A may be less effective at inhibiting progesterone signaling and initiating parturition than PR-A of other species. We note, however, that PRs regulate the expression of genes without canonical progesterone response elements in their promoters, which may restrict the ability of PR-A to trans-repress PR-B.

- **Figure explanation**: Progesterone signaling through PR-B promotes the maintenance of pregnancy and inhibits parturition, while PR-A induces the cessation of pregnancy and parturition by repressing the actions of PR-B. PR-B evolved stronger trans-activation ability in the human lineage.

### Phase III randomized trial of maintenance taxanes versus surveillance in women with advanced ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancer: A Gynecologic Oncology Group 0212: NRG Oncology Study [^113Spjq3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare taxane maintenance chemotherapy, using paclitaxel (P) and paclitaxel poliglumex (PP), with surveillance (S) in women with ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube (O/PC/FT) cancer who achieved a clinical complete response following first-line platinum-taxane therapy.

- **Methods**: Women diagnosed with O/PC/FT cancer, who achieved clinical complete response after first-line platinum-taxane-based chemotherapy, were randomly allocated 1:1:1 to S or maintenance therapy with P at 135 mg/m² every 28 days for 12 cycles, or PP at the same dose and schedule. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS).

- **Results**: Between March 2005 and January 2014, 1,157 individuals were enrolled. Grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were more frequent among those treated with taxanes (PP: 20%, P: 27% vs. S: 11%). Grade 2 or worse neurological adverse events also occurred more often with taxane treatment (PP: 46%, P: 36% vs. S: 14%). At the fourth scheduled interim analysis, both taxane regimens passed the OS futility boundary, and the Data Monitoring Committee approved an early release of results. With a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 653 deaths were reported, none attributed to the study treatment. Median survival durations were 58.3, 56.8, and 60.0 months for S, P, and PP, respectively. Relative to S, the hazard of death was 1.091 (95% CI, 0.911 to 1.31; p = 0.343) for P and 1.033 (95% CI, 0.862 to 1.24; p = 0.725) for PP. The median times to first progression or death (PFS) were 13.4, 18.9, and 16.3 months for S, P, and PP, respectively. Hazard ratio was 0.801 (95% CI, 0.684 to 0.938; p = 0.006) for the comparison.

### Overlapping signs and symptoms between recurrent varicella and pityriasis rosea Gibert [^113gfk5K]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea Gibert (PRG) has features similar to those of common infectious childhood diseases, suggesting a viral cause, but no agent has been identified at the time of writing. We describe four children with PRG and two with recurrent varicella who were studied using photochronography, virology, and immunology.

- **Methods**: The six patients with skin rashes visited our pediatric clinic from April 2012 to May 2016. Photographs of their skin lesions were taken; blood, skin lesions, and/or nasal lavage samples were collected to detect varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA and antibodies; and skin tests were carried out to measure cell-mediated immunity to VZV.

- **Results**: Herald patches were confirmed in two of four PRG patients. No specimen cultures were positive for infectious VZV; however, VZV-DNA was detected in the skin lesions of three PRG patients. During the acute phase, five patients had IgG antibodies to VZV, and skin-test reactions were positive in five patients.

- **Conclusions**: IgG antibody titers to VZV at rash onset were high, suggesting that they were already rising at the appearance of the rash and that reinfection with VZV must have occurred during the prodromal stage or several weeks before rash appearance in PRG patients whose immunity had declined below the threshold. Our study suggests a new pathogenesis of PRG that might help to address incongruities of past theories on PRG sites of viral entry and replication, incubation period, and variations in the clinical course of PRG from prodrome to healing.

### Reply: Commentary on letter to the editor from Drago et al [^116eWPwj]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the letter by Drago et al, regarding our recently published report, "Ibrutinib-associated pityriasis rosea-like rash".

The comments raised three important points regarding the differentiation between classic pityriasis rosea (PR) and PR-like eruption that were not detailed in our report. Human herpes viruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been linked to the pathogenesis of classic PR but not to PR-like eruptions. Unfortunately, we did not evaluate our patient for the presence of HHV-6/7 serum antibodies or plasma DNA during the acute phase of the eruption. Regarding peripheral eosinophilia, our patient had transient eosinophilia with an absolute eosinophil count of 880. The presence of eosinophilia might support a drug-induced eruption; however, most of the PR-like eruptions present with a normal eosinophil count. Drago et al also questioned the resolution of the eruption without discontinuation of the culprit medication. We did not advocate for discontinuation of the medication because the patient's chronic lymphocytic leukemia was responsive to ibrutinib. The risk of discontinuing ibrutinib outweighed the benefit. We appreciate the comparison table that outlines the clinical, histopathologic, and virologic criteria, which can serve as a guide when evaluating patients for suspected PR or PR-like eruptions caused by a drug.

### Rethinking pityriasis rubra pilaris as a paraneoplastic syndrome: Two cases of pityriasis rubra pilaris with concomitant underlying malignancy [^113PiGR3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The primary therapy for paraneoplastic PRP is the treatment of malignancy. One of our cases demonstrated notable improvement of cutaneous symptoms after surgical resection of the breast tumor, although residual flares of PRP were noted afterward. Excimer laser therapy was used due to its documented advantages in clearing persistent psoriatic plaques, with improvement after each treatment.

A review of most cases associated with neoplasms has begun to explore whether the diagnosis of PRP could be attributed to a true paraneoplastic cutaneous syndrome. Although rare, establishing PRP as a paraneoplastic process could aid clinicians in diagnosing underlying tumors when fulminant PRP exists.

The diagnosis of PRP is rare, particularly as a paraneoplastic process. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and histopathology. When PRP is recalcitrant to treatment, a paraneoplastic process should be considered, based on the patient's history and physical examination. Furthermore, we recommend that patients with adult-onset PRP undergo age-appropriate cancer screenings and obtain thorough skin examinations. Management of paraneoplastic PRP includes treatment of the malignancy and topical or systemic therapies if needed. Due to the significant symptomatology and chronicity, it is vital to recognize the need for further research in this field and delineate specific management protocols.

### Pityriasis rosea: An update with a critical appraisal of its possible herpesviral etiology [^116niysA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is an acute, self-healing exanthem characterized by oval erythematous-squamous lesions on the trunk and limbs, usually sparing the face, scalp, palms, and soles. Constitutional symptoms, which have the characteristics of true prodromes, clinical features resembling those of known exanthems, and various epidemiologic data all suggest an infectious origin. A range of infectious agents have been implicated; however, recent research has extensively studied human herpesvirus 6 and 7. This review aims to outline the epidemiologic, clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural features of pityriasis rosea, emphasizing its potential association with human herpesvirus. Additionally, insights are provided to aid the reader in navigating the complexities of virologic investigation.

### Influence of the occurrence and duration of partial remission on short-term metabolic control in type 1 diabetes: The DIABHONEY pediatric study [^116MBBth]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the residual effect of partial remission (PR) on immediate post-PR glycemic control according to its occurrence and duration in a cohort of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), values of glycemic control parameters (i.e. HbA1c, insulin dose-adjusted hemoglobin A1c (IDAA1c), glycemic target-adjusted HbA1c (GTAA1c)) and data from glucose monitoring devices from 189 pediatric patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes were collected retrospectively from 24 months. Patients were characterized according to their remission status (PR+ and PR-). PR+ patients were subdivided into three subgroups regarding PR duration: short (⩾3- ≤ 6 months), intermediate (> 6- ≤ 12 months), and long PR (> 12- ≤ 14 months). Glycemic control data from each PR+ subgroup at +6 and +12 months post-PR were compared with PR- patients at the same postdiagnosis time. Additionally, PR+ subgroups were compared with each other.

Results indicate that PR+ patients showed improved glycemic control (i.e. HbA1c, IDAA1c, and GTAA1c) at +6 months post-PR when compared with nonremitters (PR-), independently of the PR duration subgroups (p < 0.05). Interestingly, patients in the long PR+ subgroup exhibited a higher positive residual effect than the short PR+ subgroup, with lower GTAA1c scores (p = 0.02), better time in range (TIR) (p = 0.003), less time in hypoglycemia (10.45% versus 16.13%, p = 0.03), and less glycemic variability (83.1 mg/dl versus 98.84 mg/dl, p = 0.03). No significant differences were found for glucose control between PR+ and PR- patients at +12 months post-PR.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111UtYyW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common, self-limiting dermatological condition characterized by distinctive skin lesions. It presents with a herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions that often form a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains largely uncertain, with hypotheses suggesting both infectious and noninfectious origins. Notably, human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated in its pathogenesis, with evidence pointing to viral reactivation as a potential trigger for the condition.

Epidemiologically, PR predominantly affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence reported in females compared with males. The condition is observed worldwide, with varying incidence rates of around 0.5–2% or greater. In the United States, a study utilizing the All of Us database found that PR affects approximately 0.13% of the population, with a higher prevalence in females and individuals aged 10–29 years. This aligns with global patterns, where PR is more common in younger populations. Seasonal variations have also been noted, with some studies suggesting a higher incidence during the fall and winter months. In Eastern Anatolia, Turkey, a study analyzing 391 patients with PR from 1992 to 1995 reported an average annual incidence of 0.75 per 100 dermatologic patients, with a slightly higher prevalence in females and a peak incidence in the 20–29 year age group. The incidence was notably higher during the rainy and snowy months. In Kaduna, Nigeria, PR was found in approximately 2.4% of the population.

### Dupilumab-induced pityriasis rosea in a 28-year-old male with atopic dermatitis [^113M733a]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We read with great interest the report by Zabel et al. on dupilumab-induced pityriasis rosea (PR). We aim to expand on this finding with our case of dupilumab-induced PR in a 28-year-old male with atopic dermatitis (AD).

A 28-year-old male with a past medical history of asthma and AD presented with diffuse, frequent pruritic flares that did not fully respond to topical steroids, tacrolimus, and ruxolitinib. Given his partial improvement, he was started on dupilumab, the United States Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for AD, with a 600 mg subcutaneous injection followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks for maintenance. At his 2-week follow-up, the patient reported having a fever and headache, which was followed by the development of an enlarging, diffuse itchy rash that was different from his previous AD flares and did not respond to oral antihistamines. The patient denied any shortness of breath, recent travel, sick contacts, and medication changes.

Physical examination revealed diffuse erythematous papules coalescing into plaques scattered throughout the body (Fig 1). A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed subacute spongiotic dermatitis with lymphocytic exocytosis, and the periodic acid–Schiff stains were negative for fungi, consistent with a differential diagnosis of PR and AD (Fig 2). The patient was advised to hold the dupilumab and resume the previous topical treatments.

### HHV 6–7 reactivation causing pityriasis rosea and labyrinthitis: A case report [^111D6GGj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) and labyrinthitis are most commonly caused by viral infections. PR presents with a characteristic rash, while labyrinthitis presents with vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. However, the coexistence of PR and labyrinthitis remains an uncommon event. Human herpes virus (HHV) 6 and 7 are common infections in childhood, and their reactivation causes pityriasis rosea. However, these viruses are not known to have any involvement with the inner ear or the 8th cranial nerve (CN).

### Atypical forms of pityriasis versicolor: Case series and literature review [^113UHKWW]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, atypical forms of pityriasis versicolor (PV) are increasing, probably due to the tropicalization of the climate. Diagnosis of these forms is challenging because of the complex differential diagnosis that often requires exams such as culture and PCR, which are not easy to perform. Further studies are needed to improve the diagnostic capabilities for these forms and the use of the mentioned techniques.

### Real-life barriers to diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides: An international expert panel discussion [^113mSyyS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Early MF lesions can be highly variable in size, shape, thickness, scaling, and color. While they are more common in sanctuary sites, lesions can also appear in sun-exposed areas, such as the outer aspects of the upper limbs, head, and neck. Clinical manifestations often resemble common BIDs such as vitiligo, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and fungal infections. Suspected clinical presentations warrant thorough scrutiny of the entire skin surface. Experienced physicians may locate a subtle, previously undetected erythematous patch distant from the initial symptomatic site, providing crucial diagnostic information and informing biopsy site selection. Key lesions can be missed, and suboptimal biopsy sites chosen if patients do not undress completely for the physical examination.

Early histopathologic MF features can be variable or less specific. Classical histology reveals superficial lymphoid infiltrates accompanied by epidermotropism — neoplastic T cells trafficking into the epidermis manifesting as atypical lymphocytes within the epidermis and as lymphocyte tagging at the dermoepidermal junction. However, histopathologic findings of early-stage lesions often deviate from this classical pattern, with lymphocytes showing minimal or no atypical features and little evidence of epidermotropism. Features that overlap with spongiotic, psoriasiform, or lichenoid dermatitis may also be apparent. Further complicating MF diagnosis is the presence of disease variants, three of which are recognized by the World Health Organization: pagetoid reticulosis, granulomatous slack skin, and folliculotropic mycosis fungoides.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^116c4nVw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

- **Presence of the herald patch in PR variants**: The presence of a herald patch is a key feature of classic pityriasis rosea (PR), but it may be absent in atypical variants of the condition. In inverted PR, where the lesions predominantly involve the flexural areas, a herald patch may be less easily identified or entirely absent. Similarly, in localized PR, the exanthem may be confined to one area, and a distinguishable herald patch may not be present. Persistent PR and relapsing PR also tend to have more varied presentations, with a herald patch being less commonly reported.

In pediatric PR and PR associated with COVID-19, the presence of a herald patch is variable. Studies have suggested that in COVID-19-related PR-like eruptions, the exanthem may present without a classic herald patch, mimicking the morphology of viral exanthems. Identifying the herald patch can be crucial for diagnosis, but its absence should not rule out PR, particularly in atypical or variant forms, where the clinical course and morphology of lesions may differ.

### Characterization of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in herald patches and fully developed eruptions of pityriasis rosea [^1119QddJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common cutaneous papulosquamous disorder affecting young adults. Previous studies have suggested possibilities of a viral aetiology and the involvement of cell-mediated immunity, but these remain unproven at the time of writing.

- **Aim**: To elucidate the possible pathomechanisms in PR by characterizing the inflammatory cellular infiltrate in herald patches and fully developed PR eruptions.

- **Methods**: In total, 12 biopsy specimens from 6 patients diagnosed with PR were examined. For each patient, biopsies were taken from both a herald patch and a secondary patch. Specimens were processed for histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies.

- **Results**: Histopathologically, all specimens showed epidermal changes such as parakeratosis, orthokeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia, and spongiosis. Less common results included epidermal exocytosis and focal parakeratosis. In all biopsies, the dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes stained positively for monoclonal antibodies specific for T cells. The ratio of the CD4+ (helper) vs. CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells in the dermal infiltrate was increased in most specimens. Increased staining for Langerhans cells was seen within the dermis of lesional skin. There were no marked differences found in histopathology and immunohistochemistry between the herald patch and secondary lesions. Overall, there was a lack of natural killer cell and B-cell activities in PR lesions.

- **Conclusions**: Our results support a predominantly T-cell mediated immunity in the development of PR.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^112sJrgp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

An atypical herald patch may be absent in up to 20% of cases or may appear at unusual sites such as the face, scalp, or genitalia. Inverse PR primarily affects acral and flexural areas, including the axilla, groin, and face. Acral PR features lesions on the palms and soles, necessitating differentiation from conditions like erythema multiforme, syphilis, necrolytic acral erythema, and drug eruptions. Unilateral PR is an extremely rare form in which lesions appear only on one side of the body, observed in both children and adults. Blaschkoid PR follows the lines of Blaschko, which are thought to trace the path of embryonic ectodermal cell migration running along but not crossing the anterior truncal midline. Limb-girdle PR, also known as PR of Vidal, is confined to the shoulders or pelvic girdle, typically affecting the axilla and groins with larger, more annular lesions. Mucosal involvement in PR occurs in about 16% of patients, affecting the oral mucosa with punctate, erosive, bullous, or hemorrhagic lesions, often without symptoms. Localized PR presents with eruptions confined to a specific area of the body.

In individuals with darker skin tones, PR may present differently, more frequently involving the face and manifesting with papular lesions. Additionally, oral ulcers have been reported to occur more often in skin of color patients. These cases tend to be more pruritic, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common outcome.

Despite these variations, typical clinical features, such as a preceding prodrome, a primary lesion followed by secondary lesions, and coexistent symptoms, are observed.

### Epidemiologic, clinicopathologic, diagnostic, and management challenges of pityriasis rubra pilaris: A case series of 100 patients [^111S7AKg]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare papulosquamous disorder with limited epidemiologic and clinicopathologic data. There is little information on long-term outcomes, comorbidities, and treatment efficacy. This study aims to evaluate both objective and subjective disease experience metrics from the perspectives of patients and clinicians.

One hundred patients with a putative diagnosis of PRP, who elected to participate, completed a comprehensive survey. This was followed by the acquisition of their medical records, including histopathology slides and reports. Data were analyzed separately from both healthcare clinician and patient perspectives. Two academic dermatologists examined clinical notes, pathology reports, and photographs, confirming diagnoses via predetermined criteria. Patients were categorized into four levels of diagnostic certainty to allow stratification of the findings for subgroup analysis. Participants with a diagnosis of PRP were solicited through patient support organization websites.

The main outcomes and measures included clinical outcomes, unexpected associations of comorbidities, and the efficacy (or lack thereof) of various treatment modalities. Among the 100 participants, 50 were diagnosed as having classic, unquestionable PRP. The patients had a median age of 61 years (range, 5–87 years), and 46% were female. Among these, 50 were categorized as level 1 diagnostic certainty, 15 as level 2, 30 as level 3, and 5 as level 4. Of the level 1 patients, 13 (26%) were correctly diagnosed at initial presentation; however, diagnosis was delayed in other cases.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption secondary to deucravacitinib [^116RE6C6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The reintroduction of deucravacitinib after the pityriasis rosea-like eruption resolved was an option and would have permitted a drug "challenge"; however, our patient preferred to pursue an alternative treatment option, given the availability of other effective therapies. The precise mechanism by which deucravacitinib induced a rash in this patient remains uncertain. However, the recognition of a pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption in the context of TYK2 inhibition, coupled with previous reports associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and adalimumab, highlights the complex interplay between immune modulation and cutaneous manifestations.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111e5nQG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a prevalent dermatological condition characterized by a distinctive herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions that often form a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains uncertain, with hypotheses pointing to both infectious and noninfectious origins. Human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated, with evidence suggesting viral reactivation as a potential trigger. Epidemiologically, PR affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. The condition is observed globally, with varying incidence rates and seasonal variations, suggesting an infectious component.

While PR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort due to pruritus, and atypical presentations and recurrences complicate diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the understanding of PR's pathogenesis, highlighting both infectious and noninfectious hypotheses, including viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. It also examines treatment options, such as antivirals and phototherapy, which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify etiological factors and to explore the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies, especially for atypical or recurring cases.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption due to nortriptyline in a patient with vulvodynia [^111oHSBz]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Nortriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants are widely used in the treatment of depression. They are also used in chronic pain syndromes such as vulvodynia. We report a case of pityriasis rosea (PR)-like eruption in a young woman who was treated with oral nortriptyline for vulvodynia.

- **Case report**: The patient presented with photosensitivity and erythematous, well-defined, oval papules and patches, with fine collarettes of scale on the dorsal hands, upper arms, and trunk. She showed a complete resolution of her rash with discontinuation of nortriptyline, thereby supporting the diagnosis of a drug-induced reaction.

- **Comment**: Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruptions have been associated with numerous medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antirheumatic drugs, lithium, and, more recently, biologics such as imatinib, adalimumab, and etanercept. A literature review did not reveal an association between PR-like drug eruptions and tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline. We report a case of PR-like drug reaction to nortriptyline for clinical interest.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^117THvRp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy, although rare, has been associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly when it occurs in the first trimester. Earlier studies, such as those by Drago et al, reported a higher risk of miscarriage (up to 57–62%) in women who developed PR before the 15th week of gestation, particularly when the rash was extensive or accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and malaise. However, recent findings offer a more nuanced perspective. Wenger-Oehn et al. conducted a case series involving 46 pregnant women with PR and found a significantly lower rate of unfavorable outcomes (10.9%) compared with a pooled cohort of previous reports (39.6%). Their study highlighted that the timing of PR onset, rash distribution, and the presence of extracutaneous symptoms were key factors influencing pregnancy outcomes, with earlier onset and widespread rash being associated with higher risks.

Despite these concerns, the majority of pregnancies affected by PR result in healthy deliveries. Chuh et al. and other studies have also noted that PR occurring later in pregnancy is typically associated with more favorable outcomes. Given the variability in outcomes, pregnant women with PR, especially those in the early stages of gestation or presenting with widespread rashes or systemic symptoms, should be closely monitored by their healthcare providers.

- **Clinical, histologic, and molecular features of the herald patch**: The herald patch, a hallmark of classic pityriasis rosea (PR), is typically the first lesion to appear.

### Relaxed constraint and functional divergence of the progesterone receptor (PGR) in the human stem-lineage [^116HSEec]. PLoS Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The functional divergence of the human progesterone receptor has been a subject of significant interest. Regardless of the statistical evidence supporting positive selection or relaxed constraint, human PR-A and PR-B have diverged in function compared to the human-chimp ancestor. The trans-activation strength of the AncHuman PR-A is slightly weaker than the AncHominini PR-A, whereas the AncHuman PR-B more strongly trans-activates luciferase expression from the dPRL-332 promoter than the AncHominini PR-B.

In addition to acting as a ligand-activated transcriptional activator, PR-A also has the ability to trans-repress the transcriptional activity of PR-B and other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors, through its inhibitory function domain.

The most striking difference between the AncHuman and AncHominini isoforms is in the trans-repressive strength of PR-A on PR-B. The AncHominini PR-A can almost completely repress trans-activation by AncHominini PR-B, while the AncHuman PR-A's capacity to inhibit trans-activation by AncHuman PR-B is weakened compared to AncHominini PR-A. Thus, PR-B can still function as a trans-activator in the presence of stoichiometric ratios (1:1) of PR-A.

These results are consistent with a previous study which compared the trans-activation and trans-repressive strengths of modern human and mouse PR-A and PR-B and found that the human PR-A was a weaker trans-repressor of PR-B than the mouse PR-A.

### AfinitorDisperz [^114mibo8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the Afinitor arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the Afinitor arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition).

Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive Afinitor at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with Afinitor underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to Afinitor and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of Afinitor. The median duration of Afinitor treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with Afinitor had angiomyolipoma.

### Pityriasis rosea and other infectious eruptions during pregnancy: Possible life-threatening health conditions for the fetus [^1168oMvo]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Any infectious illness presenting with an eruption in a pregnant patient may be associated with an increased risk of fetal loss. The viruses that can infect the placenta during maternal infection and can be transmitted to the fetus, causing congenital disease, include the rubella virus, the measles virus, the varicella zoster virus, parvovirus B19, human cytomegalovirus, arboviruses, and hepatitis E virus type 1. Additionally, some bacteria responsible for exanthematous diseases, like Treponema pallidum, can be transmitted during pregnancy from the mother to the fetus, leading to fetal loss.

All these infectious agents can cause typical and/or atypical exanthems whose etiologic diagnosis is sometimes difficult but important to determine, especially in pregnant women, because of the potential risk to the fetus. Over the past 20 years, we have extensively studied pityriasis rosea from the clinical and laboratory perspectives, demonstrating the pathogenic role of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and -7.

- **Evidence synthesis**: PR may be associated with active HHV-6/7 infection and therefore with complications during pregnancy and fetal loss.

- **Emerging infectious illnesses**: We have also summarized the emerging infectious illnesses of dermatologic interest that may represent life-threatening health conditions for the fetus, including measles, rubella, arbovirus infection, and syphilis.

### Safety and immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine schedules for the post-eradication era: a randomised open-label, multicentre, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^11711U7s]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the immune response induced against poliovirus type 1 and type 2 — the two poliovirus types responsible for all cases of paralytic disease as wild polioviruses or circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses — was similar between infants who received vaccine schedules consisting of two or three doses of IPV or two or three doses of f-IPV. This was assessed 4 weeks after completing the primary series to determine the adequacy of immune protection provided in the community.

- **Co-primary outcomes**:
	- The study aimed to determine:
	1. If seroconversion rates at 40 weeks of age following a two-dose regimen of intradermally administered f-IPV were non-inferior to a corresponding two-dose regimen of intramuscular IPV.
	2. If seroconversion rates at 40 weeks of age following a two-dose IPV regimen were non-inferior to those following a three-dose IPV regimen.
	3. If seroconversion rates following a two-dose f-IPV regimen were non-inferior to those following a three-dose f-IPV regimen.

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- These included assessments of the superiority of seroconversion rates for poliovirus types 1 and 2 across the four regimens with different administration schedules, immunogenicity in terms of neutralizing antibody titers, and safety.

- **Exploratory outcomes**:
	- The study also applied primary and secondary outcomes for poliovirus type 1 and type 2 to poliovirus type 3.
