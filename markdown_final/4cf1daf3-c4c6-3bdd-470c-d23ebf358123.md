## Question

What is the typical duration of prednisone taper for sciatica?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical duration of a prednisone taper for sciatica. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which randomized trials actually defined a prednisone taper and how long it lasted. Then, I should verify whether any guidelines specify a standard taper duration. Next, I will check systematic reviews and meta-analyses for consensus on regimen length. After that, I need to consider whether tapering is even necessary for very short courses and what endocrine guidance says about tapering after brief exposure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats about evidence quality and alternatives to steroids.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality evidence. The pivotal randomized trial in acute sciatica used a 15-day taper: 60 mg daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 5 days, totaling 15 days and 600 mg cumulative dose; this is the most commonly cited regimen in contemporary discussions of oral steroids for sciatica [^662d786b].

> Wait, let me verify whether other trials used different durations. A smaller, earlier randomized study used a 9-day taper, but that trial was underpowered and is not the standard reference for practice; it does suggest that some clinicians have experimented with shorter tapers, though it does not establish a new standard of care [^5eb002ce].

> I should confirm whether any guideline endorses a specific taper length. The VA/DoD guideline recommends against systemic corticosteroids for low back pain with or without radicular symptoms, so it does not provide a taper duration; this underscores that even if a taper is used, it is not a recommended therapy for sciatica in that guideline framework [^93b685da].

> Next, I should review systematic reviews and meta-analyses to see if they converge on a typical regimen. Multiple high-quality reviews note that when oral steroids are studied for sciatica, they are generally given as short courses of about 1–2 weeks, often without specifying the exact taper, and they emphasize that benefits are modest at best and adverse effects are more common; this aligns with the 15-day regimen being the most detailed and reproducible protocol in the literature [^8b183c46] [^5ebe82c5] [^1cc6b0ba].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tapering itself. I need to check endocrine guidance on whether tapering is necessary after short courses. For glucocorticoid courses under about 3–4 weeks, current endocrine guidance suggests tapering is generally not required and abrupt cessation is acceptable, though some clinicians still taper to mitigate withdrawal symptoms; this applies when there is no ongoing need for steroids and the patient is not at high risk for adrenal suppression [^059648a4] [^4d409c54].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. The most typical, evidence-based prednisone regimen studied for acute sciatica is 15 days: 60 mg daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 5 days, totaling 15 days. Some clinicians use a 9-day taper, but that is less standard and supported by weaker evidence. Given the modest functional benefit and higher adverse event rates with steroids, many guidelines advise against routine use, so if a taper is chosen, it should be short, closely monitored, and individualized to risk profile and response [^662d786b] [^5eb002ce] [^93b685da] [^8b183c46].

> But wait, what if the course is even shorter, like 5–7 days at a fixed dose? I should double-check that nuance. For very brief courses under 2–3 weeks, tapering is not mandatory from an endocrine standpoint, though some clinicians still taper by halving the dose every few days; if a taper is used in that scenario, it is typically completed within 1–2 weeks, which is consistent with the principle of keeping steroid exposure minimal in sciatica where benefits are limited [^059648a4] [^4d409c54].

> I need to ensure I address alternatives and context. Given the small average benefit of oral steroids and the higher adverse event risk, nonpharmacologic care and, when appropriate, epidural steroid injections may be considered; epidural injections show small, short-term improvements in pain and disability and carry procedural risks, so shared decision-making is essential if steroids are contemplated at all for sciatica [^8074e303] [^0663443b].

---

The typical prednisone taper for sciatica is **15 days** [^662d786b]: 60 mg daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 5 days, totaling 600 mg. This regimen is supported by the largest RCT in acute sciatica [^662d786b] and is the most commonly used in practice. Shorter tapers (e.g. 9 days) have been studied [^5eb002ce] but are less standard. Tapering is not strictly required for courses under 3 weeks [^059648a4], but many clinicians taper to reduce withdrawal symptoms. The benefit is modest and short-term [^ac326097], so use should be individualized and limited to severe cases after weighing risks [^93b685da].

## Typical prednisone taper regimen for sciatica

The most commonly studied and used regimen is a **15-day taper** [^662d786b]:

| **Day** | **Prednisone dose** |
|-|-|
| Days 1–5 | 60 mg daily |
| Days 6–10 | 40 mg daily |
| Days 11–15 | 20 mg daily |

---

Total cumulative dose: 600 mg over 15 days. This regimen was used in the largest RCT of oral steroids for acute sciatica [^662d786b] and is the **standard reference** for practice.

---

## Alternative taper regimens

Alternative, less common regimens include a **9-day taper** [^5eb002ce] (e.g. 60 mg for 3 days, 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days) and fixed-duration courses without a formal taper (e.g. 60 mg daily for 5 days, then stop) [^notfound]. These alternatives are less standard and have less supporting evidence than the 15-day taper.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting taper duration

The 15-day taper is supported by a large RCT showing modest improvements in function at 3 weeks and 1 year, with **no significant reduction in leg pain** [^662d786b]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses report small, short-term benefits in pain and function, with effects diminishing over time [^ac326097] [^f8c75b66].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines generally advise against routine systemic corticosteroids for sciatica due to modest benefit and potential harms [^93b685da]. When used, the 15-day taper is the **most commonly referenced regimen**. Tapering is not strictly required for courses under 3 weeks [^059648a4], but many clinicians taper to mitigate withdrawal symptoms.

---

## Risks and benefits of tapering

Benefits include modest, short-term improvements in function and possibly faster symptom relief; risks include insomnia, mood changes, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and rare serious adverse events (e.g. infection, thromboembolism) [^662d786b] [^b8126712]. The risk–benefit balance favors **cautious, selective use** in severe cases after conservative measures fail.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing taper duration

Factors influencing taper choice include symptom severity, duration, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis), and prior steroid exposure. Longer tapers or lower starting doses may be appropriate for patients at higher risk of adverse effects or withdrawal symptoms [^4dd55e29].

## Summary of evidence

| **Taper regimen** | **Duration** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 15-day taper (60→40→20 mg) | 15 days | High (RCT) | Modest functional improvement; minimal pain benefit [^662d786b] |
| 9-day taper (60→40→20 mg) | 9 days | Moderate (small RCT) | Limited evidence; less standard [^5eb002ce] |
| Fixed 5-day course (60 mg daily) | 5 days | Low (expert opinion) | No taper; limited evidence |

---

The typical prednisone taper for sciatica is a **15-day regimen** (60→40→20 mg) [^662d786b], with modest, short-term functional benefits and minimal pain reduction. Use should be individualized, with tapering optional for courses under 3 weeks [^059648a4], and reserved for severe cases after conservative care.

### Oral steroids in initial treatment of acute sciatica [^5eb002ce]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Many physicians use prednisone to treat acute sciatica with the hope of speeding recovery. There is little clinical evidence to support this practice. Our objective was to determine whether early administration of oral prednisone affects parameters related to recovery from acute sciatica.

Methods

In this double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 27 patients were sequentially assigned to receive either a 9-day tapering course of prednisone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 14) within 1 week of developing sciatic symptoms. Patients and investigators were blinded to the drug administered. Follow-up assessment was done weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 5 months.

Results

Prednisone and control groups showed no statistically significant differences in physical findings, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic medications, or rates of patients returning to work at any time interval studied. Compared with controls, patients who received prednisone had more rapid rates of improvement from baseline in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. These changes were subtle but statistically significant. Patients who received prednisone tended to receive fewer epidural injections for pain.

Conclusions

Early administration of oral steroid medication in patients with acute sciatica had no significant effect on most parameters studied. It did, however, lead to slightly more rapid rates of improvement in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. The impact of oral steroids on other outcomes is suggested by this study, but its small sample size limited its statistical power.

### Oral steroids for acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk: a randomized clinical trial [^662d786b]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Oral steroids are commonly used to treat acute sciatica due to a herniated disk but have not been evaluated in an appropriately powered clinical trial.

Objective

To determine if oral prednisone is more effective than placebo in improving function and pain among patients with acute sciatica.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from 2008 to 2013 in a large integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. Adults (n=269) with radicular pain for 3 months or less, an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of 30 or higher (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate greater dysfunction), and a herniated disk confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging were eligible.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a tapering 15-day course of oral prednisone (5 days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg; total cumulative dose=600 mg; n=181) or matching placebo (n=88).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was ODI change at 3 weeks; secondary outcomes were ODI change at 1 year, change in lower extremity pain (measured on a 0-10 scale; higher scores indicate more pain), spine surgery, and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (0-100 scale; higher scores better).

Results

Observed baseline and 3-week mean ODI scores were 51.2 and 32.2 for the prednisone group and 51.1 and 37.5 for the placebo group, respectively. The prednisone-treated group showed an adjusted mean 6.4-point (95% CI, 1.9-10.9; P=.006) greater improvement in ODI scores at 3 weeks than the placebo group and a mean 7.4-point (95% CI, 2.2-12.5; P=.005) greater improvement at 52 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 0.3-point (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.0; P=.34) greater reduction in pain at 3 weeks and a mean 0.6-point (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.3; P=.15) greater reduction at 52 weeks. The prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 3.3-point (95% CI, 1.3-5.2; P=.001) greater improvement in the SF-36 PCS score at 3 weeks, no difference in the SF-36 PCS score at 52 weeks (mean, 2.5; 95% CI, -0.3 to 5.4; P=.08), no change in the SF-36 MCS score at 3 weeks (mean, 2.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to 4.8; P=.10), and an adjusted 3.6-point (95% CI, 0.6-6.7; P=.02) greater improvement in the SF-36 MCS score at 52 weeks. There were no differences in surgery rates at 52-week follow-up. Having 1 or more adverse events at 3-week follow-up was more common in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (49.2% vs 23.9%; P<.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk, a short course of oral steroids, compared with placebo, resulted in modestly improved function and no improvement in pain.

### Short-term efficacy of intravenous pulse glucocorticoids in acute discogenic sciatica. A randomized controlled trial [^009e6af4]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To test the short-term efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) pulse of glucocorticoids on the symptoms of acute discogenic sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of acute discogenic sciatica is controversial. A potential advantage of the IV pulse therapy is the ability to distribute high glucocorticoid concentrations to the area surrounding the prolapsed disc without the risks and inconveniences of an epidural injection.

Methods

Patients with acute sciatica (<6-week duration) of radiologically confirmed discogenic origin were randomized to receive either a single IV bolus of 500 mg of methylprednisolone or placebo. Clinical evaluation was performed in a double-blind manner on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, and 30. The primary outcome was reduction in sciatic leg pain during the first 3 days following the infusion; secondary outcomes were reduction in low back pain, global pain, functional disability, and signs of radicular irritation. The analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis using a longitudinal regression model for repeated measures.

Results

A total of 65 patients were randomized, and 60 completed the treatment and the follow-up assessments. A single IV bolus of glucocorticoids provided significant improvement in sciatic leg pain (P = 0.04) within the first 3 days. However, the effect size was small, and the improvement did not persist. IV glucocorticoids had no effect on functional disability or clinical signs of radicular irritation.

Conclusions

Although an IV bolus of glucocorticoids provides a short-term improvement in leg pain in patients with acute discogenic sciatica, its effects are transient and have small magnitude.

Placebo controlled trials

Fifteen randomised clinical trials compared drugs with placebo with individual effect sizes calculated for nine trials (fig 2). For five trials investigating NSAIDs,corticosteroids,antidepressants,and muscle relaxants,we did not calculate effect sizes as percentage of improved patients was reported as an outcome.

Strengths and limitations of review

The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a prespecified protocol, inclusion of trials published in languages other than English, and the use of a highly sensitive search strategy to identify trials for sciatica coupled with search terms related to the nine classes of drugs of interest. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro scale rather than the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool because the PEDro scale has been shown to have acceptable reliabilityand validity,whereas two studies have reported reliability limitations with the Cochrane tool.One limitation of our study is the possibility of publication bias as we did not attempt to identify unpublished trials that could be found in clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Another limitation is that we could accommodate trials in only four languages other than English.

A strength of our review over past reviews is that we located 24 randomised clinical trials relevant to our question compared with six,three,and twotrials included in the four previous reviews. Accordingly we provide more precise estimates of treatment effects, specifically for NSAIDs and corticosteroids, and a better description about tolerability of all classes of drug. Including more trials has allowed us to provide a more in-depth evaluation of the pharmacological treatments that have been tested for sciatica in primary care. For example, we have provided information on the efficacy of antidepressants and opioid analgesics whereas previous reviews did not cover these classes of drugs. Another strength of this review is that we quantitatively pooled trials where possible. This allowed us to explore the size of the treatment effect, which is not possible in a qualitative summary. In addition, we were able to assess the overall quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach. Although conclusions of previous reviews were based on a surprising paucity of evidence, our findings are likely to inform the direction of future research in this topic. In pharmacological trials for sciatica, we consider the priorities to include consideration of duration of symptoms, recruitment of large samples, and collection of outcomes relevant to patients. For instance, regarding duration of symptoms it would be reasonable to test corticosteroids and NSAIDs in trials in patients with acute sciatica, whereas given that chronic sciatica includes a neuropathic pain component, anticonvulsant and antidepressants might need to be tested in patients with a chronic condition.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^d455c47a]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy—intravenous glucocorticoids: VAS sciatic leg improvement of 5.7 cm occurred on day one, but no durable benefit was observed at day 30 with a single intravenous bolus of glucocorticoids for any outcome, and a glucocorticoid bolus had no effect on functioning or objective signs of radicular irritation. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that a single intravenous infusion of glucocorticoids provides only temporary (three days) relief of pain, with the authors concluding that a single intravenous pulse of glucocorticoid provides a small and transient improvement in sciatic leg pain.

### Efficacy and tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4382c3c8]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in sciatica is limited and the use of systemic steroids is still controversial. We aimed at evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases until February 2010. Randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and the tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica were included. Efficacy and tolerance were assessed using the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI with the inverse variance method (RR > 1 means that the event is more likely to occur in the steroid group). We explored the heterogeneity between the studies using subgroup analysis.

Results

Seven studies (383 patients) were included. The difference in the rate of responders between both groups was not statistically significant (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.96, 1.56). The rate of adverse events was 13.3% for the patients in the steroid group and 6.6% for the placebo group (RR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.06, 3.80). The number needed to harm was 20 (95% CI 10, ∞). Twenty (15.3%) patients in the steroid group and seven (5.7%) patients in the placebo group underwent surgery. A trend towards a higher requirement for spinal surgery was observed in the steroid group (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.74, 1.75). The methodological quality slightly influenced the results. We did not find any publication bias.

Conclusion

Steroid efficacy is not superior to the placebo in sciatica, but it has more side effects. The tolerance:efficacy ratio indicates against the use of systemic steroids in sciatica.

### The role of systemic steroids in sciatica due to herniated lumbar disc: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f8c75b66]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

Evaluate the role of systemic steroids in treating patients with sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation (LDH).

Summary Of Background Data

The association between LDH and sciatica has been well described. The use of steroids seems logical in this context; however, their efficacy is not well described, and their use remains controversial.

Methods

A comprehensive search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases (up to February 15, 2022) was performed to identify randomized clinical trials that included patients with symptoms of sciatica due to LDH that were treated with systemic steroids. The risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias2 tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to estimate the between-group effect size for pain and functional outcomes. The risk of developing adverse events (AE) was computed using relative risks. All pooled results are reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and certainty of evidence analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework.

Results

Ten studies met inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 1017 participants: 540 in the treatment group and 477 in the control group. Steroid treatment was associated with a significant superior reduction of pain (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.08, weak effect, very-low certainty) and reduction in disability (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.10, weak effect, very-low certainty). Corticosteroid administration was associated with a significant increased risk of developing an AE (relative risks = 2.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.85, low certainty).

Conclusion

The use of systemic steroids in the treatment of sciatica due to LDH seems reasonable despite a 2-fold higher risk of developing mild AEs. However, the effect size is small for reducing pain in the short term and improving functional outcomes at long-term follow-up.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^7658129e]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy—single infusion intravenous (IV) glucocorticosteroids: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of a single infusion of IV glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence). In a randomized controlled trial of acute discogenic sciatica, of the 60 patients, 31 received an intravenous bolus of 500 mg of methylprednisolone and 29 received an injection of normal saline, with all patients also receiving standard medical therapy and physical therapy; outcomes were assessed at one, three, 10 and 30 days using VAS sciatica, low back pain and global pain, McGill pain scale, ODI and signs of radicular irritation.

Corticosteroids

Three trials in patients with acute sciatica tested the effect of corticosteroids compared with placebo.The individual studies provided imprecise estimates of treatment effect (fig 2). For the immediate term, pooling showed no effect of steroids on leg pain (mean difference −1.8, −11.1 to 7.5; P=0.71) with a GRADE classification of “moderate quality” of evidence (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3). For the short term, pooling showed a significant effect of steroids on pain (overall and leg pain) (mean difference −12.2, −20.9 to −3.4; P<0.01) and “moderate quality” of evidence according to the GRADE approach (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3).

Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics

Three trials investigated the efficacy of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics (fig 2).As these were single trials that investigated different classes of drugs or time points of assessment, pooling was not possible. Hence, the quality of evidence for all these medications was considered “low quality” (single studies)or “very low quality” (single study downgraded for limitation of study design)according to the GRADE approach.

Two trials investigated the effect of anticonvulsants in patients with chronic symptoms of sciatica. In one crossover trial,topiramate (50-400 mg/day) showed no better immediate effects than placebo for disability and leg or back pain. In contrast, data from another trialshowed significant overall pain relieving effect with the anticonvulsant gabapentin (900-3600 mg) in the short term (mean difference −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9; P<0.001) compared with placebo.

One crossover study with four periods investigated the relative efficacy of opioid analgesics (sustained release morphine 15 mg/day), antidepressants (nortriptyline 25 mg/day), and a combination of both and placebo in patients with chronic sciatica.In this trial, antidepressants, opioid analgesics, and a combination of both had no significant effect compared with placebo in the immediate term for disability or leg or back pain.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11b42a6c]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation.Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer.The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%.While there are a range of definitions of sciatica,the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica.Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only.Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants.While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain,this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Systemic corticosteroids for radicular and non-radicular low back pain [^ac326097]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are medications with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. Systemic corticosteroids administered through the oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes have been used to treat various types of low back pain, including radicular back pain (not due to spinal stenosis), non-radicular back pain, and spinal stenosis. However, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid for radicular low back pain, non-radicular low back pain, and symptomatic spinal stenosis in adults.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was September 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials in adults of systematic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. The major outcomes were pain, function, need for surgery, serious adverse effect, and presence of hyperglycemia. The minor outcomes were quality of life, successful outcomes, non-serious adverse events, and withdrawal due to adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Thirteen trials (1047 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Nine trials included participants with radicular low back pain, two trial with low back pain, and two trials with spinal stenosis. All trials blinded participants to receipt of systemic corticosteroids. Seven trials were at low risk of bias, five at unclear risk, and one at high risk of selection bias. Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy varied. Radicular low back pain For radicular low back pain, moderate-certainty evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly decrease pain versus placebo at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.56 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 0.04 on a 0 to 10 scale) and may slightly increase the likelihood of experiencing improvement in pain at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; absolute effect 5% better (95% CI 5% worse to 15% better). Systemic corticosteroids may not improve function at short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.14 better; range 0.49 better to 0.21 worse) and probably increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short-term follow-up (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91; absolute effect 19% better, 95% CI 8% better to 30% better). Systemic corticosteroids were associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo at long-term follow-up (MD -7.40, 95% CI -12.55 to -2.25 on the 0 to 100 Oswestry Disability Index) and greater likelihood of functional improvement (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.56), based on a single trial. There was no difference in likelihood of surgery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47). Evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single dose or as a short course of therapy) are not associated with increased risk of any adverse event, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or hyperglycemia, but estimates were imprecise as some trials did not report harms, and harms reporting was suboptimal in trials that did provide data. Limitations included variability across trials in interventions (e.g. corticosteroid used, dose and duration of treatment), clinical settings, and participants (e.g. duration of symptoms, methods for diagnosis); limited utility of subgroup analyses due to small numbers of trials; methodologic limitations or suboptimal reporting of methods by some trials; and too few trials to formally assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical tests for small sample effects. Non-radicular low back pain Evidence on systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for non-radicular pain was limited and suggested that systemic corticosteroids may be associated with slightly worse short-term pain but slightly better function. Spinal stenosis For spinal stenosis, limited evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids are probably no more effective than placebo for short-term pain or function.

Authors' Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids appear to be slightly effective at improving short-term pain and function in people with radicular low back pain not due to spinal stenosis, and might slightly improve long-term function. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in people with non-radicular low back pain are unclear and systemic corticosteroids are probably ineffective for spinal stenosis. A single dose or short course of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain does not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1cc6b0ba]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

There is at best only low quality evidence to judge the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care. The available evidence does not clearly show favourable effects of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, or opioid analgesics in the immediate term, even compared with placebo. Evidence from a single trial and one meta-analysis with two trials provides some limited support (“low quality” and “moderate quality” evidence) for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids to relieve pain in the short term in patients with acute sciatica. In one small sample trial there was also limited support (“low quality” evidence) for the short term relief of pain in chronic sciatica with an anticonvulsant drug. At present these data provide a lack of conclusive and high quality evidence to guide the prescription of these drugs for patients with sciatica in primary care.

Treatment

The goal of disease-modifying NS treatment is to reduce or prevent organ system damage from harmful effects of granulomatous inflammation (Table 4). In some circumstances, such as mild or transient disease, immunosuppression may not be necessary, but for most patients with CNS sarcoidosis and for many with large-fiber peripheral nervous system NS involvement, immunosuppression is indicated early to minimize neurologic injury and disability. Treatments focused on symptom management and rehabilitation are also important in the comprehensive care of patients with NS. When there is multisystem involvement, an interdisciplinary approach can be helpful to coordinate what is often complex care and decision making. No randomized trials exist yet to guide the treatment of NS; therefore, treatment is based on expert opinion and observations from case series and single reports.

Table 4 
Medications Commonly Used in the Treatment of Neurosarcoidosis

Treatment in NS should be individualized, weighing risks to benefit, with appropriate counseling to guide shared decision making about disease-modifying treatment, while also incorporating treatment considerations for sarcoidosis involving other organ systems as applicable. In general, glucocorticoids are standard first-line treatment. For more severely affected patients, consideration of initial IV or PO bioequivalent pulse dosing (e.g. 1 g IV methylprednisolone for 3–5 days) followed by a few month oral glucocorticoid taper (e.g. prednisone 1 mg/kg/d and tapering lower) would be typical, adjusting speed and taper duration based on severity, risk, tolerability, clinical, and imaging response. For patients with less severe disease, a moderate, shorter course of glucocorticoids may be sufficient with close monitoring. Given concerns about safety and toxicity associated with glucocorticoid exposure, early steroid-sparing therapy with methotrexate or azathioprine should be considered (typically reserving mycophenolate mofetil given data about comparative lesser efficacy in retrospective studies), although these can take several months to achieve clinical efficacy. In severer cases, when there is an incomplete response to glucocorticoids, or when there is particular concern about glucocorticoid toxicity risk, earlier use of TNF inhibitors is increasingly considered.

Results

Figure 1 outlines the flow of trials through the review. The initial electronic database search identified 2460 potential studies of interest. After screening citations by title and abstract, we considered 197 potentially eligible articles for inclusion and retrieved full articles. We included 23 published reports(reporting 24 different clinical trials, as onereported on two trials). Three trials reported in previous systematic reviewswere not included in this review because of unclear randomisation.

Fig 1 Selection process of trials examining pain relief in patients with sciatica

The included trials investigated six different classes of drugs: NSAIDs, antidepressants, corticosteroids, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants. The drugs investigated in the included trials were administered orally in 16 trialsand parenterally in five trials (four trialsinvestigated intramuscular injections and one trialinvestigated intravenous infusions). Three other trialsused mixed administration of a starting intramuscular dose and subsequent oral doses. One study compared oral versus parenteral administration.Table 2shows the characteristics of the included trials, and table 3presents details of methodological quality.

*Dreisser et al 28 reported on two clinical trials.

Duration of symptoms varied a lot across studies (table 2). Six trials specifically investigated patients with chronic symptomsand eight trials included patients with acute symptoms.In six trials, however, patients had mixed duration of symptoms; in two trials duration was not specified; and in two trials patients were reported to have acute symptoms but no information regarding duration was provided.Regarding the definition of sciatica, 15 trials used a definition based on clinical assessment alone,whereas nine trials also required concordant imaging evidence.Pooling of data via meta-analysis was possible only for comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo in pain intensity at immediate follow-up and for corticosteroids versus placebo in pain intensity at immediate and short term follow-up. Table 2 also presents the number of studies comparing each class of drug and control.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^803e54c5]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For radicular pain, whether from radiculitis or radiculopathy, we only recommend a short course of oral corticosteroids (such as a 6-day methylprednisolone taper) if a patient has incapacitating pain interfering with functioning and/or engaging in physical therapy. For lumbar disc herniation, oral corticosteroids have been shown to offer only modest improvement in function and have not been proven to reduce pain. In older adults, the systemic side effects are often limiting and should not be prescribed without carefully considering the risks and benefits and involving the patient and/or caregiver in the decision-making process.

Another treatment option for patients with incapacitating pain limiting function is fluoroscopically-guided epidural corticosteroid injections. Full discussion of the indications and expected efficacy of these injections is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is important to appreciate that these injections must be utilized thoughtfully because in an improperly selected older patient, there is a risk for significant side effects from the procedure itself and from epidural corticosteroid administration, potentially without a high likelihood for clinical improvement. Based on a modified Delphi method, our expert panel believes that best practice is for primary care clinicians who are considering the use of an injection to first refer the patient to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist (such as a physiatrist, anesthesia pain physician, or sports medicine physician), prior to ordering the injection, in order to evaluate for proper patient selection.

Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)

LSS is another common condition in older adults and can cause positional-dependent nerve root irritation due to degenerative changes resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal. The most common presenting symptom of LSS is progressive pain down the leg with continued walking that improves with sitting. In a study by Kalichman et al. up to 20% of 60–69-year-olds had CT-evidence of LSS, and while not everyone with the finding was symptomatic, people with imaging-diagnosed LSS were over three times more likely to have LBP. When symptomatic, 42% of patients with LSS present with lateral thigh pain. The diagnosis of LSS is important to consider when older adults present with lateral hip or thigh pain that improves by functionally increasing the spinal canal area with lumbar flexion. Management of LSS is discussed in Part VI of this series.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^0b152c8f]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and intensity of the conservative treatment is poorly described in the included studies. There are many treatment regimens and modalities available for conservative treatment of sciatica varying from steroids to traction to physiotherapy interventions. Evidence from systematic reviews of conservative interventions for sciatica fail to identify the effect of one intervention over the other, however, large studies with a low risk of bias are scarce. In order to make an informed decision about the clinical homogeneity of the included comparisons, detailed information about the treatments is essential and the denomination “conservative treatment” is not sufficient.

Three narrative reviews which examined choice of surgery or conservative care concluded that surgery is indicated in presence of persistent neuromotor deficit. Both Awad and Moskovich and Legrand et al. suggested to let the patient make an informed choice. The review of Awad and Moskovich was published before publication of three of the studies included in this review. Although the publication of Legrand et al. was in 2007, this study did not include two studies published before that date. Gregory et al. promoted surgery with persistent neuromotor deficit or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient’s examination findings. Although published in October 2008, this study did not include three studies published before that date. Both reviews did not describe their search strategy, selection methods or quality assessments of the included studies and are therefore, potentially, prone to bias.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^88327ad9]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

Outcome data were extracted for immediate term (two or fewer weeks after randomisation), short term (more than two weeks but less than three months), intermediate term (more than three months but less than12 months), and long term (12 months or more) follow-up evaluations. When multiple time points fell within the same category, we used the one closest to one week for the immediate term, eight weeks for the short term, six months for the intermediate term, and 12 months for the long term. Scores for pain intensity and disability were converted to a scale from 0 to 100. When more than one outcome measure was used to assess intensity of pain, disability, or work status, we included the outcome measure described as the primary outcome measure for the trial. Descriptive statistics were used to describe adverse events reported in each trial.

Trials that we considered clinically homogeneous were grouped according to class of drugs, comparison group, dose, outcomes (pain, disability, etc), and outcome assessment time points (immediate term, short term, intermediate term, and long term). Pooled estimates were obtained with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.2.04 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Pooled effects were calculated with a random effects model. For calculation of effect size (see appendix tables A and B on bmj.com), we pooled leg pain and overall pain, as leg pain is usually worse than pain in the back. When trials were not sufficiently homogeneous, pooling of data via meta-analysis was not performed and outcome measures of the individual studies were reported. We decided a priori that a sensitivity analysis would be conducted to investigate definitions of sciatica as possible sources of heterogeneity in effect size among included studies. The limited number of trials in the meta-analysis, however, prevented further investigation.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^9288900c]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:
|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4-8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and... [^b8126712]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses have suggested that corticosteroids may have a small benefit for acute cough and sore throat, but they included studies that were small or had a high risk of bias. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction. This was true even for patients with wheezing on initial presentation. Regarding back pain, a study randomized 269 adults with sciatica to a 15-day course of prednisone, 60 mg once daily tapering to 20 mg once daily, or placebo, and found no reduction in pain, function, or other outcomes.

7 However, adverse effects such as insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite were more common in the prednisone group. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone. The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies. Patients receiving an oral corticosteroid in the previous year and those receiving an inhaled or intranasal corticosteroid were excluded, as were organ transplant recipients and patients with malignancies. The researchers found a clinically and statistically significant increase in the risk of serious complications during the five to 30 days after the corticosteroid was prescribed; this risk declined over the subsequent two months. The relative risks over that initial month were 5.

3 for sepsis,
3. 3 for venous thromboembolism, and 1. 9 for fracture. The absolute increases were 0. 8 additional episodes of sepsis,
2. 2 additional episodes of venous thromboembolism, and 7. 1 additional fractures per 1, 000 person-years, or approximately one additional serious complication per 100 person-years. Because the greatest risk occurs in the first month after the corticosteroid is prescribed, this corresponds to roughly one additional serious complication per 1, 000 short courses of a corticosteroid.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^cab87be7]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica—glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses >30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

Polymyalgia rheumatica—glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

### Epidural steroids, etanercept, or saline in subacute sciatica: a multicenter, randomized trial [^2ad8e64e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Perineural inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor have recently generated intense interest as an alternative to epidural steroid injections for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Objective

To evaluate whether epidural steroids, etanercept, or saline better improves pain and function in adults with lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Design

A multicenter, 3-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 2008 to 2011. Randomization was computer-generated and stratified by site. Pharmacists prepared the syringes. Patients, treating physicians, and nurses assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00733096)

Setting

Military and civilian treatment centers.

Patients

84 adults with lumbosacral radiculopathy of less than 6 months' duration.

Intervention

2 epidural injections of steroids, etanercept, or saline, mixed with bupivacaine and separated by 2 weeks.

Measurements

The primary outcome measure was leg pain 1 month after the second injection. All patients had 1-month follow-up visits; patients whose condition improved remained blinded for the 6-month study period.

Results

The group that received epidural steroids had greater reductions in the primary outcome measure than those who received saline (mean difference, -1.26 [95% CI, -2.79 to 0.27]; P = 0.11) or etanercept (mean difference, -1.01 [CI, -2.60 to 0.58]; P = 0.21). For back pain, smaller differences favoring steroids compared with saline (mean difference, -0.52 [CI, -1.85 to 0.81]; P = 0.44) and etanercept (mean difference, -0.92 [CI,-2.28 to 0.44]; P = 0.18) were observed. The largest differences were noted for functional capacity, in which etanercept fared worse than the other treatments: steroids vs. etanercept (mean difference, -16.16 [CI, -26.05 to -6.27]; P = 0.002), steroids vs. saline (mean difference, -5.87 [CI, -15.59 to 3.85]; P = 0.23), and etanercept vs. saline (mean difference, 10.29 [CI, 0.55 to 20.04]; P = 0.04). More patients treated with epidural steroids (75%) reported 50% or greater leg pain relief and a positive global perceived effect at 1 month than those who received saline (50%) or etanercept (42%) (P = 0.09).

Limitation

Short-term follow-up, small sample size, and a possibly subtherapeutic dose of etanercept.

Conclusion

Epidural steroid injections may provide modest short-term pain relief for some adults with lumbosacral radiculopathy, but larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm their benefits.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^3ec557f0]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two trained independent raters assessed the quality of the trials’ methods using the PEDro scale.Disagreements were resolved by a third rater. Methodological quality was not an inclusion criterion.

Two independent reviewers extracted means (final scores or change score), standard deviations, and sample sizes from studies using a standardised data extraction form. When there was insufficient information in trial reports, we contacted authors or estimated data using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.Briefly, when the mean was not reported we used the median; when standard deviations could not be estimated, we adopted the standard deviation from the most similar study.

To evaluate the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation, we used the GRADE approach.We used an adapted version of the criteria advocated by the Cochrane Back Review Group.The quality of the evidence was downgraded by one level for each of four factors we encountered: limitations in the design (for instance, >25% of participants from studies with low quality methods—PEDro score <7 points); inconsistency of results (for instance, ≤75% of the participants report findings in the same direction); and imprecision (for instance, total number of participants <300 for each outcome). We did not assess publication bias with funnel plots as too few studies were included in the meta-analysis. We also did not assess indirectness as this review encompasses a specific population. Two reviewers judged whether these factors were present for each outcome. Single randomised studies (with under 300 participants) were considered inconsistent and imprecise (that is, sparse data) and provided “low quality evidence.” This could be further downgraded to “very low quality evidence” if there were also limitations in design. We applied the following definitions of quality of the evidence:

High quality—further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. There are no known or suspected reporting biases; all domains fulfilled
Moderate quality—further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and might change the estimate; one of the domains was not fulfilled
Low quality—further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; two of the domains were not fulfilled
Very low quality—we are uncertain about the estimate; three of the domains were not fulfilled.

A GRADE profile was completed for each pooled estimate and for single trials comparing drugs versus placebo.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^be2252bd]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design Systematic review.

Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain −12.2, 95% confidence interval −20.9 to −3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10-30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3-23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^146dc3cc]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune Modulation

Some evidence (level 2) suggests that very early initiation (after trauma) of steroid treatment (approximately 30 mg/day for 2–12 weeks, followed by a taper) may be effective. A systematic review evaluated one of these trials and found it to be low quality. Given the data, a short course of steroids may be indicated in early CRPS with prominent inflammation, but longer courses are unproven and there are numerous, serious contraindications to chronic steroid use In persistent CRPS, intermediate-dose steroids (1 g orally in total, taken over 2 weeks) are rarely effective and this treatment often causes side effects. High-dose pulsed treatment (3x1g iv) as used in autoimmune conditions has not been evaluated. A single intrathecal steroid injection was shown ineffective.

A randomized controlled trial (level 2) of low-dose (0.5 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment for persistent CRPS indicated efficacy. However, a subsequent larger trial was negative Although there is some anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of high-dose IVIG this has not been formally tested. The TNF-alpha blocker, infliximab, was ineffective in a preliminary RCT (level 3) which was stopped early. Treatment with lenalidomide which has strong anti-TNF activity was also not effective, having been assessed in one of the largest RCTs (level 2) in persistent CRPS conducted to date. A small, open-label randomized trial (level 3) of mycophenolate (1.5 g BID) suggested efficacy but a larger trial would be needed to confirm these findings. Plasma exchange has been reported effective (level 4) in several case series and consequently CRPS has been added to the list of possible indications by the international plasma exchange society (ASFA). In our clinical experience (level 4), plasma exchange treatment, although providing pain improvement in some cases, requires use of long repeat-exchange cycles (e.g. eight exchange treatments over 4 weeks) and is unfortunately complicated regularly by pain increase at the venous access site. A trial of low-dose naltrexone, an opioid-antagonist drug that has potential immune modulatory properties is currently recruiting (clinicaltrials.gov). Finally, in a small, preliminary trial (level 3), 4/7 included patients with CRPS appeared to have pain reduction after treatment with the epidermal growth factor inhibitor Cetuximab (2/7 had pain relief after placebo).

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^49304aeb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one.Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^5e96f950]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper—We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40-67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20-40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5-7.5 mg.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain [^8074e303]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbosacral radicular pain (commonly called sciatica) is a syndrome involving patients who report radiating leg pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections deliver a corticosteroid dose into the epidural space, with the aim of reducing the local inflammatory process and, consequently, relieving the symptoms of lumbosacral radicular pain. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review published in Annals of Internal Medicine in 2012. Some placebo-controlled trials have been published recently, which highlights the importance of updating the previous review.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection on pain and disability in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language limitations up to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Back and Neck group trial register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and two trial registers. We also performed citation tracking of included studies and relevant systematic reviews in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that compared epidural corticosteroid injections of any corticosteroid drug to placebo injections in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. We accepted all three anatomical approaches (caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal) to delivering corticosteroids into the epidural space. We considered trials that included a placebo treatment as delivery of an inert substance (i.e. one with no pharmacologic activity), an innocuous substance (e.g. normal saline solution), or a pharmacologically active substance but not one considered to provide sustained benefit (e.g. local anaesthetic), either into the epidural space (i.e. to mimic epidural corticosteroid injection) or adjacent spinal tissue (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, or interspinous tissue). We also included trials in which a local anaesthetic with a short duration of action was used as a placebo and injected together with corticosteroid in the intervention group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed the screening, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessments. In case of insufficient information, we contacted the authors of the original studies or estimated the data. We grouped the outcome data into four time points of assessment: immediate (≤ 2 weeks), short term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months), intermediate term (> 3 months but < 12 months), and long term (≥ 12 months). We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome and time point using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) investigating the effects of epidural corticosteroid injections compared to placebo in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. The included studies provided data for a total of 2470 participants with a mean age ranging from 37.3 to 52.8 years. Seventeen studies included participants with lumbosacral radicular pain with a diagnosis based on clinical assessment and 15 studies included participants with mixed duration of symptoms. The included studies were conducted mainly in North America and Europe. Fifteen studies did not report funding sources, five studies reported not receiving funding, and five reported receiving funding from a non-profit or government source. Eight trials reported data on pain intensity, 12 reported data on disability, and eight studies reported data on adverse events. The duration of the follow-up assessments ranged from 12 hours to 1 year. We considered eight trials to be of high quality because we judged them as having low risk of bias in four out of the five bias domains. We identified one ongoing trial in a trial registry. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing leg pain at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -4.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0 to 100 scale; 8 trials, n = 949; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). For disability, epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing disability at short-term follow-up (MD -4.18, 95% CI -6.04 to -2.17, on a 0 to 100 scale; 12 trials, n = 1367; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). The treatment effects are small, however, and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. MD lower than 10%). Most trials provided insufficient information on how or when adverse events were assessed (immediate or short-term follow-up) and only reported adverse drug reactions - that is, adverse events that the trialists attributed to the study treatment. We are very uncertain that epidural corticosteroid injections make no difference compared to placebo injection in the frequency of minor adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42; 8 trials, n = 877; very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision)). Minor adverse events included increased pain during or after the injection, non-specific headache, post-dural puncture headache, irregular periods, accidental dural puncture, thoracic pain, non-local rash, sinusitis, vasovagal response, hypotension, nausea, and tinnitus. One study reported a major drug reaction for one patient on anticoagulant therapy who had a retroperitoneal haematoma as a complication of the corticosteroid injection.

Authors' Conclusions

This study found that epidural corticosteroid injections probably slightly reduced leg pain and disability at short-term follow-up in people with lumbosacral radicular pain. In addition, no minor or major adverse events were reported at short-term follow-up after epidural corticosteroid injections or placebo injection. Although the current review identified additional clinical trials, the available evidence still provides only limited support for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in people with lumbosacral radicular pain as the treatment effects are small, mainly evident at short-term follow-up and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. mean difference lower than 10%). According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, suggesting that further studies are likely to play an important role in clarifying the efficacy and tolerability of this treatment. We recommend that further trials should attend to methodological features such as appropriate allocation concealment and blinding of care providers to minimise the potential for biased estimates of treatment and harmful effects.

### Periradicular infiltration for sciatica: a randomized controlled trial [^cbe4f4b7]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted.

Objectives

To test the efficacy of periradicular corticosteroid injection for sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

The efficacy of epidural corticosteroids for sciatica is controversial. Periradicular infiltration is a targeted technique, but there are no randomized controlled trials of its efficacy.

Methods

In this study 160 consecutive, eligible patients with sciatica who had unilateral symptoms of 1 to 6 months duration, and who never underwent surgery were randomized for double-blind injection with methylprednisolone bupivacaine combination or saline. Objective and self-reported outcome parameters and costs were recorded at baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and at 1 year.

Results

Recovery was better in the steroid group at 2 weeks for leg pain (P = 0.02), straight leg raising (P = 0.03), lumbar flexion (P = 0.05), and patient satisfaction (P = 0.03). Back pain was significantly lower in the saline group at 3 and 6 months (P = 0.03 and 0.002, respectively), and leg pain at 6 months (13.5, P = 0.02). Sick leaves and medical costs were similar for both treatments, except for cost of therapy visits and drugs at 4 weeks, which were in favor of the steroid injection (P = 0.05 and 0.005, respectively). By 1 year, 18 patients in the steroid group and 15 in the saline group underwent surgery.

Conclusions

Improvement during the follow-up period was found in both the methylprednisolone and saline groups. The combination of methylprednisolone and bupivacaine seems to have a short-term effect, but at 3 and 6 months, the steroid group seems to experience a "rebound" phenomenon.

### Short-term efficiency and tolerance of ketoprofen and methylprednisolone in acute sciatica: a randomized trial [^e09bad33]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in acute discogenic sciatica, data regarding their efficacy are scarce and controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous ketoprofen and methylprednisolone with placebo in sciatica.

Design

Multicenter, double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Subjects

Patients with confirmed discogenic acute sciatica, without neurologic deficit, were randomized into three arms.

Methods

Besides standard-of-care analgesic therapy, they received intravenous injections of methylprednisolone (60mg/d) or ketoprofen (200mg/d) or placebo for five days. The primary outcome was leg pain over five days. Secondary outcomes were clinical responses at days 3 and 5, lumbar pain, Straight Leg Raise Test and lumbar flexion index, analgesic consumption, realization of lumbar spine injections, and surgery during the study period.

Results

Fifty-four patients were randomized, and 50 completed the study. In patients admitted to the hospital for pain control with acute lumbar radicular pain due to intervertebral disc herniation and receiving an oral analgesic protocol including paracetamol, nefopam, tramadol, and morphine, there was no additional analgesic effect seen between groups. There was no significant difference in leg pain between the three groups over the study period. In the methylprednisolone group, however, we observed a higher rate of clinically relevant responses at day 3. No difference was observed on other secondary efficacy outcomes and safety.

Conclusion

No significant difference in leg pain was observed between groups. However, there was a higher proportion of patients relieved with intravenous methylprednisolone at day 3, compared with ketoprofen or placebo.

### Clinical course, therapeutic responses and outcomes in relapsing MOG antibody-associated demyelination [^c60ef132]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Acute corticosteroid usage and risk of relapse

Treatment data were available for 191/218 episodes; 181/191 episodes were treated with corticosteroids; 35/181 episodes were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone alone and 146/181 episodes were treated with oral steroids (following intravenous methylprednisolone, n=116; or solely as an oral taper, n=30). The median duration of the oral taper was 1.62 months. Following the 146 episodes treated with oral prednisolone taper, there were 103 subsequent episodes, most of which occurred towards the end of the taper (n=41 episodes; mean dose of oral prednisone at relapse 11.5 mg, median 10 mg, range 1.25–60 mg), or shortly after prednisone cessation (n=62 episodes; median duration after prednisone cessation 2 months, range 0–62) (figure 1C). The median length of a planned steroid taper was 1.5 months (mean 3, range 0.25–24) for all episodes followed by a relapse, compared with 5 months (mean 6.9, range 0.75–26) for all episodes not followed by a relapse.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^ad7040fe]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar facet joint corticosteroid injection randomized trial (Carette et al)—Patients were randomized to methylprednisolone acetate versus isotonic saline and 95% were followed for 6 months; after one month, none of the outcome measures differed clinically or statistically between groups, 42% of methylprednisolone recipients and 33% of placebo recipients reported marked or very marked improvement, and at 6 months only 11 patients or 22% in the methylprednisolone group and 5 patients or 10% in the placebo group had sustained improvement; the study failed to exclude placebo responders, the methylprednisolone group received a greater proportion of concurrent interventions, and the authors concluded there was no significant difference between the groups.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ebe82c5]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design

Systematic review. Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain -12.2, 95% confidence interval -20.9 to -3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief -26.6, -38.3 to -14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10-30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3-23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions

As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Tapering of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: an overview for daily practice [^91f5b322]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

In this Review, we discuss the possibility of drug tapering in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission or low disease activity, for glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We review international guidelines and recommendations, as well as remaining uncertainties, and provide an overview of the current literature. Three strategies of tapering are discussed: (1) tapering by discontinuation of one of the drugs in combination therapy regimens, (2) tapering by reducing the dose of one of the drugs in combination therapy regimens, and (3) tapering by dose reduction of monotherapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We discuss the outcomes and robustness of evidence of trials and observational cohorts, and we give a trajectory for further research and drug tapering in daily practice.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^9b1727d9]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines—comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

### Neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina: clinical course, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, response to treatment, and outcomes [^ed569059]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The median clinical follow-up duration was 22.5 months (interquartile range: 14.8–56.8 months, full range: range 0–295 months), and 2 patients were lost to follow-up. The final median mRS score at the last clinic follow-up visit was 3 (range 1–4). Weakness (9/14, 64.3%), ambulatory difficulties (8/14, 57.1%), numbness (7/14, 50%), and bladder disturbances (7/14, 50%) were the most common persistent neurologic sequelae. Per provider clinical perceptions at the last available clinical encounter, no patients experienced complete improvement, 9/14 (64.3%) partially improved, 2/14 (14.3%) stabilized, and 3/14 (21.4%) worsened. No patients died. Relapses of cauda equina disease were seen in 3 cases (3/14, 21.4%) at a median of 6 months. All relapses occurred in the setting of tapering prednisone; only 1 case was treated with another immunosuppressant (rituximab) at the time of the prednisone taper.

Median radiographic follow-up with MRI was 11 months (range 0–256 months). Of the 9 patients with available follow-up MRI data, at the time of last MRI, inflammation resolved in 5 cases (5/9, 55.6%), improved in 1 (1/9, 11.1%), stabilized in 1 (1/9, 11.1%), and worsened in 2 (2/9, 22.2%). Median duration to radiographic improvement or resolution was 10.5 months.

MRI outcomes generally correlated with clinical outcomes. In the 5 patients experiencing radiographic resolution of inflammation, 4 partially improved clinically, and 1 remained stable. One patient with partial improvement on MRI also partially improved clinically. One patient with stable MRI findings remained stable clinically. Both patients with worsening disease on MRI also worsened clinically.

### Optic perineuritis [^6a73fbe3]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Management

The main treatment for OPN is corticosteroid therapy, which causes rapid and dramatic improvement in signs and symptoms typically within hours or within a day. However, recurrence has been reported with a short course of treatment, thus requiring a longer course of treatment with very slow tapering of the dose. The dosage depends on the frequency and rate of recurrence.Few cases have been reported that showed no improvement in vision even with corticosteroid therapy.This was attributed to chronic inflammatory infiltration along with fibrous tissue deposition in the dural sheath causing compressive optic neuropathy and ischaemic infarction. 31 In a case study conducted by Purvin et al, indomethacin was used instead of steroids and was able to successfully treat two patients.Although steroids are the mainstay of OPN therapy, radiation therapy and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine have also been reported to be successful for refractory cases.

OPN is not self-limiting; that is, it does not resolve without treatment. Corticosteroid therapy improves final visual outcomes in OPN unlike in ON, while treatment with intravenous steroids only speeds up the visual recovery but does not affect final visual outcomes.Additionally, the dose and route of steroid administration differ. The preferred mode of treatment for OPN is oral and requires a higher dose of steroids (80 mg/day), whereas in ON, the preferred mode is intravenous since there is a higher risk of recurrence reported with the use of oral steroids in ON. A short course of treatment used in ON (approximately 2 weeks) is generally not long enough to achieve lasting remission in OPN.The relapse of symptoms after cessation of therapy is more common in OPN. Hence, if a patient treated for ON shows relapse after therapy, the possibility of OPN should be considered.

Table 5. 
Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and common underlying conditions

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration of time are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (Table 5).

Slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following a curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal, and symptoms worsened once total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (eg, 7.5 prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess, and may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with slower taper in patients with high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in patients with lower clinical severity score. In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily to the most recent dose prior to onset of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome will usually alleviate the symptoms.

R 2.4—We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

If the glucocorticoid dose is in the supraphysiologic range, suppression of the HPA axis is expected and it is unnecessary to test adrenal function. Similarly, testing is unnecessary in patients unable to stop glucocorticoid treatment, for example patients with organ transplants and in cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. These patients should be educated on management of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (see section R.3).

R 2.5—We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○)

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice—the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b007acff]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al,with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: a randomised, double blind, controlled clinical trial [^7660a3dd]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica.

Methods

Three epidural injections (two day intervals) of 2 ml prednisolone acetate (50 mg) or 2 ml isotonic saline were administered to patients with sciatica presumably due to a disk herniation lasting 15-180 days. Self evaluation was the main judgment criterion at day 20. Patients who recovered or showed marked improvement were considered as success. Pain measured by VAS, the SLR test, Schober's test, Dallas pain questionnaire, and the Roland-Morris index were evaluated at days 0, 5, 20, and 35. Only analgesics were authorised, patients requiring non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before day 20 were considered as failure.

Results

42 patients were included in the control group (CG), 43 in the steroid group (SG). On an intention to treat analysis 15/42 (36%) in the CG and 22/43 (51%) in the SG (p=0.15) were considered as success (difference 15.5%, 95% CI (-5.4 to 36.3)). Among the 48 failures, 14 patients (6 CG, 8 SG) required NSAIDs, 3 (2 CG, 1 SG) required surgery, and 7 (3 CG, 4 SG) other treatments. On analysis according to protocol, in 74 remaining patients 12/35 (34%) in the CG and 22/39 (56%) in the SG (p=0.057) were considered as success (difference 22.1%, 95% CI (0.0 to 44.2)). For all secondary end points intragroup improvement with time was significant, but intergroup differences were not.

Conclusion

The efficacy of isotonic saline administered epidurally for sciatica cannot be excluded, but epidural steroid injections provide no additional improvement.

### Continuing prednisone offers stable rheumatoid arthritis control (...) [^68d95db4]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, continuing low-dose glucocorticoids is safer and controls disease better than tapering them off, a trial in The Lancet concluded. At baseline, the study’s 259 participants were stable with tocilizumab and at least 24 weeks of low-dose prednisone treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to continue 5 mg of prednisone daily for 24 weeks or to taper off the drug by week 16. All patients continued taking tocilizumab during the 24-week study. .. .

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) corticosteroid duration—adults: The guideline panel recommends against a prolonged course (>6 weeks including treatment and taper) of prednisone and in favor of a short course (≤6 weeks) as initial treatment, issuing a strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence. Evidence review found no usable comparative ITP data because no studies had data on short courses of prednisone. Based on clinical experience, the panel agreed there was likely trivial benefit in continuing corticosteroids beyond 6 weeks; for the majority of patients, a visit 6 weeks after starting corticosteroids should determine remission versus need for additional therapy, and for patients who require additional therapy, consideration of alternative therapy is preferred over ongoing exposure to corticosteroids. The panel also agreed the risk of harm was large with courses >6 weeks and acknowledged that 6 weeks is not evidence based but represents a reasonable duration to permit a standard maximum 21 days of treatment plus taper.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: an abridged cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^0663443b]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic with meta-analysis OBJECTIVES.: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection in reducing leg pain and disability in patients with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative treatments, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, are typically the first treatment options for sciatica but the evidence to support their use is limited. The overall quality of evidence found by previous systematic reviews varies between moderate and high, which suggests that future trials may change the conclusions. New placebo-controlled randomized trials have been published recently which highlights the importance of an updated systematic review.

Methods

The searches were performed without language restrictions in the following databases from 2012 to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and trial registers. We included placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with sciatica. The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcomes were adverse events, overall pain, and back pain intensity. We grouped similar trials according to outcome measures and their respective follow-up time points. Short-term follow-up (>2 weeks but ≤3 months) was considered the primary follow-up time point due to the expected mechanism of action of epidural corticosteroid injection. Weighted mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and conducted the analyses using random effects.

Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) providing data for a total of 2470 participants with sciatica, an increase of six trials when compared to the previous review. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably more effective than placebo in reducing short-term leg pain (MD -4.93, 95% CI -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0-100 scale), short-term disability (MD -4.18, 95% CI: -6.04 to -2.17 on a 0-100 scale) and may be slightly more effective in reducing short-term overall pain (MD -9.35, 95% CI -14.05 to -4.65 on a 0-100 scale). There were mostly minor adverse events (i.e., without hospitalization) after epidural corticosteroid injections and placebo injections without difference between groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91-1.42). The quality of evidence was at best moderate mostly due to problems with trial design and inconsistency.

Conclusion

A review of 25 placebo-controlled trials provides moderate-quality evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections are effective, although the effects are small and short-term. There is uncertainty on safety due to very low-quality evidence.

### Corticosteroids in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: a retrospective, multicentre study, comparing efficacy and safety of daily prednisolone, pulsed dexamethasone, and pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone [^55df8409]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Adverse events

Moderate AE occurred in 8% of patients of whom two patients had an SAE. Most of these adverse events were seen in the prednisolone group, which was the largest group of the three treatment regimens. Another possible explanation for the number of adverse events in the prednisolone group was the higher cumulative dose of prednisolone. The number of mild AE, which did not lead to a change in dose or interval, was low. Given the retrospective nature of this study, we suspect that mild AE were underreported and, therefore, not representative for the true number of mild AE occurring during corticosteroid treatment.

A known and serious side effect from long-term use of corticosteroids is osteoporosis. The American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis recommends to treat all patients with calcium and vitamin D when starting long-term corticosteroid treatment. Patients in this study were all treated accordingly. No osteoporotic fractures occurred in our cohort, but DEXA scans were not performed routinely to check for the occurrence of osteoporosis.

### Repeat epidural injections of SP-102 (dexamethasone sodium phosphate injectable gel) in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy [^372a250a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbosacral radicular pain (also known as sciatica) has an estimated lifetime incidence of 13%–40% and annual incidence of 1%–5%.Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are commonly used for lumbosacral radicular pain when more conservative treatments, including analgesic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy, have been ineffective.ESI use has been associated with positive outcomes for patients in prospective randomized trials and retrospective studies, including reduced leg and back pain and avoidance of surgery.

In 2014 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a requirement that all injectable glucocorticoid product labels carry a warning, due to reports of serious and sometimes fatal neurological events with epidural administration.All recorded events that resulted in permanent disability or death were associated with injection of particulates containing (suspension) steroid formulations. In contrast, use of soluble glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, has been associated with fewer adverse reactions,resulting in their recommendation as first-choice steroid for ESIs by an expert panel.However, studies on dexamethasone ESIs have suggested that their analgesic effect has a shorter duration than particulate steroids.Given the safety concerns with particulate-containing ESIs, there is a clear need to extend the duration of the analgesic effect of dexamethasone.

SP-102 is a novel formulation of dexamethasone consisting of dexamethasone sodium phosphate equivalent to 10 mg dexamethasone in 2 mL injectable viscous gel designed to prolong residence at the site of injection. Data from a phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) bridging study indicate that this has been achieved, with epidural injections of SP-102 resulting in lower maximum plasma concentration and longer time to maximum plasma concentration of dexamethasone than intravenous administration of standard dexamethasone sodium phosphate solution (manuscript in preparation).

In clinical practice, it is common to administer repeat ESIs.However, prolonged systemic absorption of corticosteroids and associated suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis can result in susceptibility to infection, Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and loss of bone density.The duration of HPA suppression of any extended-release steroid formulation, such as SP-102, needs to be considered. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to characterize the repeat-dose PDs of epidural SP-102 with respect to HPA suppression in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy. Secondary objectives of the study were to determine the safety profile and assess the analgesic effects of single and repeat-dose epidural SP-102.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids (...) [^af48c402]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016 and includes recommendations for managing acute, subacute, and chronic pain. Unresolved acute pain or subacute pain can evolve into chronic pain. Chronic pain typically lasts >3 months and can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or unknown cause. 6, 17, 41– 46).

Partly because of these factors affecting access to a wide range of treatment modalities, for many years medications such as prescription opioids have been the mainstay to treat pain, despite very limited evidence to support their long-term benefits; most placebo-controlled trials have been <6 weeks in duration. Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite declines in the number of opioid prescriptions after 2012, intermediate-term and long-term outcomes of therapy involving opioids, effects of opioid plus nonopioid combination therapy, effects of tramadol, effects of naloxone coprescription, risks of coprescribed benzodiazepines, risks of coprescribed gabapentinoids, and effects of concurrent use of cannabis.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f0ff782d]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Other than radiographical evidence of disc herniation and corresponding signs or symptoms, the included studies varied in their method of identifying patients who would be considered for surgery. Differences were apparent in the requirement of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment,having incapacitating sciatica,or having persistent (>four months) sciatica.Seven (58.3%) of 12 trials did not specify how they identified patients.Thus, the study populations might vary across included trials. Also, participants were not typical patients with sciatica from the community because they were assessed for eligibility by surgeons.

Evidence update and meaning of the study

Compared with the most recent review, which only pooled data for disability within 24 months,our review provides results on leg pain, disability, back pain, and adverse events from the immediate term to five years after randomisation. Thus, unlike the equivocal benefits previously reported,we found that discectomy was initially beneficial but the effect declined over time, compared with either non-surgical care or epidural steroid injections. Generally, discectomy resulted in faster relief in pain and disability, but only up to 12 months. We also investigated the optimal timing of surgery for sciatica by conducting a subgroup analysis by symptom duration (less or greater than three months). Greater reductions in leg pain were reported in people with symptoms for less than three months at immediate and medium term, however, the differences were not significant. A post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment suggests that trials without specifying the non-surgical treatment in the inclusion criteria reported higher effects in reducing leg pain (immediate term) and improving disability (short term) than did trials with unsuccessful non-surgical treatment.

We presented discectomy primarily because this surgical treatment is the most widely used for lumbar disc herniation.Nevertheless, the choice of surgical treatment by surgeon varies between countries.Thus, in our review, we presented results for a broader range of surgical procedures. Plasma disc decompression showed a moderate effect on leg pain and disability when compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections. Similarly, chemonucleolysis with condoliase was shown to have moderate effects on leg pain and slight effects on disability.

Treatment

Treatment with 1 mg prednisone per kilogram bodyweight (60 mg) was initiated. The patient’s health condition improved slowly. A follow-up MRI showed a reduction in Pott’s disease and in bilateral paravertebral abscesses. After tapering steroids to 10 mg over a course of 2 months, B-symptoms reoccurred and a painful swelling on the left side on level T11/T12 was detected corresponding with a new abscess in the autochthonous back musculature in MRI. Dosage of steroids was increased again to the initial dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight for another 2 months. The patient’s health condition improved, and steroid therapy was slowly tapered to 20 mg over a course of 6 months.

Due to radiologically confirmed progression of Pott’s disease, treatment response was initially unclear, and ethambutol was given for a prolonged duration of 4 months, while pyrazinamide was given for 7 months. Rifampicin and isoniazid were continued for another 5 months. In total, antituberculosis therapy was administrated over an extended duration of 12 months. Steroid therapy was tapered to zero over a 3-month period after completion of antituberculosis therapy.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^95c1891b]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Limitations

This review has limitations. Although we included a larger number of trials compared with previous reviews,the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. High crossover rates from the non-surgical arm to the surgical arm (ranged from 30% to 54%) occurred in many trials, which means the effects of surgery on clinical outcomes could have been underestimated, particularly in the later time points. As mentioned previously, the included trials are underpowered and inappropriately designed to effectively evaluate adverse event occurrence.

Reporting of non-surgical comparators was generally poor, with most trials not describing what types of treatments participants received, who provided these treatments, how they were provided, and how much treatment they received. For example, the SPORT trial reported the type of non-surgical treatment received by participants (physical therapy (73% of patients), epidural injections (50%), and medical treatments (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; >50%) without specifying other details.Similarly Bailey and colleagues’ trial only reported that education, activity and exercise, oral analgesics, physiotherapy, and epidural glucocorticoid injection were used in the non-surgical group, without providing specific data on the proportion of patients receiving each of these non-surgical treatments.Furthermore, non-surgical treatments varied considerably within and between countries. For example, the use of epidural steroid injections varies widely among different US states, as do referrals to physiotherapy between Denmark and the Netherlands.The two included Chinese trials used traditional Chinese medicine in the non-surgical group, which lacks evidence supporting its effectiveness.In our review, we grouped all non-surgical interventions together, however, these interventions were not only poorly detailed but also highly heterogeneous. Therefore, questions remain as to whether non-surgical treatment provided in the control arms of many trials represents a suboptimal approach to treating sciatica, in addition to the ramifications that this uncertainty would have on its comparison to discectomy.However, evidence is scarce in supporting many non-surgical treatments for sciatica.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^4dd55e29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15-25 mg hydrocortisone, 4-6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4. 
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4-6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3—We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2c459eeb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (>2 weeks but ≤3 months) and long-term (≥12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

US recommendations

The 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for early and established RA recommend adding GCs to DMARDs during disease flares, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period possible.In contrast to the European recommendations, adding GCs when a csDMARD is initiated depends on disease activity.

Taken together, these international recommendations agree on the use of GCs for disease flare and possibly at the start of a new csDMARD. Specific advice concerning dosage, duration, route of administration and strategies is limited and less consensual, because reliable and detailed evidence is scarce. For US recommendations, a dose <10 mg/day is considered a low dose, and GCs should be tapered in less than 3 months, whereas for European recommendations, the threshold is 7.5 mg/day, and GCs could be prescribed in combination with csDMARDs for up to 6 months maximum, knowing that this duration is mainly expert-driven.Despite these differences, international guidelines underline the importance of GCs but also advocate the use of GCs at the lowest cumulative dose possible because of the high awareness of potentially associated adverse effects.

In these sets of recommendations as well as in this review, GCs dosages are expressed in prednisone equivalent.

Indications and frequency limits for injections—the document states these decisions have often relied on non-evidence-based assumptions. Over the years, some authors have recommended one injection for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes; others have preached 3 injections in a series irrespective of a patient’s progress or lack thereof; others suggest 3 injections followed by a repeat course of 3 injections after 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals; and some propose an unlimited number of injections. Dose caps such as a limitation of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid or 210 mg per year in an average person and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid also have been advocated; however, with no scientific basis.

### Role of neuraxial steroids in interventional pain management [^cea7263c]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical introduction of cortisone in 1949 revolutionized medical care of patients with a host of diseases. Soon after that, the first use of steroids in epidural injections was described in 1952 and 1953. A variety of corticosteroid agents (hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone) have been applied neuraxially to treat spinal pain and other types of painful conditions. The utilization of neuraxial steroids had its empirical beginning in the 1950s and 60's. When steroid administration seemingly was effective for management of low back pain and sciatica, the concept was adapted for other types of neural blockade, including facet joint injections. It is postulated that corticosteroids reduce inflammation by inhibiting either the synthesis or release of a number of pro-inflammatory substances and by causing a reversible local anesthetic effect. Multiple complications of corticosteroid administration are two-fold: those resulting from withdrawal of steroids and those resulting from continued use of large doses. These include neural toxicity, separation of pituitary-adrenal axis, weight gain, osteoporosis, as well as many other complications. However, a review of the literature on epidural steroids or other types of neuraxial blockade mentions very few complications that can be directly attributed either to the chemistry or the pharmacology of the steroids, except for reports of adrenal suppression. This review describes various aspects of neuraxial steroids including historical concepts, mechanism of action, pharmacological aspects, side effects, complications and their role in treatment.

Targeted interventional delivery of corticosteroids remains a mainstay of treatment for spinal pain syndromes because this approach has a wider therapeutic index than other approaches. The best evidence for analgesic efficacy is in subacute radicular syndromes associated with new-onset or recurrent lumbar radiculitis. Complications often relate to drug delivery technique as much as actions of the steroid itself and require careful consideration and vigilance by the administering physician. Considerable uncertainty persists concerning which patients with chronic pain are most likely to benefit from corticosteroid injections. Matching this treatment option with specific spinal pain syndromes remains a major challenge.

INTRODUCTION: CURRENT THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN SARCOIDOSIS

Corticosteroids have been used for sarcoidosis for over 70 years. Even now, they remain the most commonly used medication for systemic management. Corticosteroids are highly effective, inexpensive, easily titrated, work quickly, are perceived to require less monitoring than other agents and are familiar to patients as well as prescribers. They have the added advantage in some patients of increasing energy, sense of wellbeing and ameliorating nonspecific symptoms such as arthralgias, at least when first prescribed. In addition, corticosteroids have been studied in various sarcoidoses over the past 6 decades. As such, corticosteroids are still deemed by expert opinion to be the first-line therapy for all forms of sarcoidosis that require systemic treatment [▪▪]. It should be noted that these opinions are based not on controlled data but rather on the absence of head-to-head comparisons between corticosteroids and other agents.

Although sarcoidosis experts typically advocate for earlier inclusion of steroid-sparing agents in treatment algorithms, in practice steroid-sparing agents are prescribed for much less than half of treatment-requiring patients. Long-term management typically entails higher prednisone doses than the commonly referenced prednisone goal of less than 10 mg/day; for example the mean daily dose in two randomized pulmonary sarcoidosis trials was approximately 13 mg/day. In an unselected cohort from our institution, the median treatment duration among all treated patients was 8 months. These data accord with a multicenter prospective observational study in the United States that demonstrated that the likelihood of requiring treatment after 2 years in patients requiring treatment is approximately 50%. In corticosteroid-treated patients, relapses after tapering of corticosteroids have been noted in 20–74%. For those individual requiring tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the likelihood of very early relapse after stopping therapy is especially high. Taken as a whole, the available data paint a picture of frequent treatment initiation with corticosteroids but a failure of clinicians to reduce the corticosteroid dose by sufficiently aggressive use of steroid-sparing medications. This practice gap is likely due to uneven implementation of recommended steroid-sparing strategies, patient preference, access to medication, lack of knowledge, or the absence of sufficiently effective steroid-sparing agents.

### Clinicopathology conference: 41-year-old woman with chronic relapsing meningitis [^04abaab8]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

In April 2007, she had a laminectomy and biopsy at L5/S1. The dura was thick, and there were adhesions within the thecal sac and scar tissue surrounding the nerve roots. Histology showed lymphohistiocytic inflammation and a poorly formed non‐necrotizing granuloma. Mycobacterial cultures were negative. There was concern that premature discontinuation of INH in 2002 may have led to incomplete treatment of TBM, so she was again treated empirically for TB with rifampin, INH, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and moxifloxacin for 1 year, as well as 3 weeks of prednisone 60 mg daily followed by a 3‐week prednisone taper. This time, pyrazinamide was stopped early due to transaminitis and nausea, and ethambutol was stopped after several months when her CSF profile improved. Repeat lumbar punctures (LPs) showed normalization of protein and glucose with mild residual CSF pleocytosis (5–10 WBC/μl). Her symptoms improved significantly, and she resumed her daily activities. However, she continued to have intermittent mild low back pain, sometimes accompanied by chills.

### Infliximab plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone for the initial treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica: a randomized trial [^db41b2cd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A reliable alternative to steroids for treating polymyalgia rheumatica has not yet been identified. Although infliximab has been used occasionally in steroid-resistant cases, its efficacy has not been demonstrated in a controlled study.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of prednisone plus infliximab with that of prednisone plus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

7 rheumatology clinics in Italy.

Patients

51 patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica. Patients with associated giant cell arteritis and those who had been previously treated with steroids or biological or immunosuppressive agents were excluded.

Intervention

Initial therapy with oral prednisone tapered from 15 mg/d to 0 mg/d over 16 weeks according to a standard protocol, plus infusions of placebo or infliximab, 3 mg/kg of body weight, at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22.

Measurements

The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients without relapse or recurrence through week 52. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients no longer taking prednisone, the number of relapses and recurrences, the duration of prednisone therapy, and the cumulative prednisone dose.

Results

Four patients (3 in the infliximab group and 1 in the placebo group) did not complete the trial. The proportion of patients who were free of relapse and recurrence at 52 weeks did not differ between groups (6 of 20 patients [30%] in the infliximab group vs. 10 of 27 patients [37%] in the placebo group; adjusted risk difference, -3 percentage points [95% CI, -31 to 24 percentage points]; P = 0.80). In a sensitivity analysis that included dropouts, the best-case scenario yielded a difference of 5 percentage points (CI, -21 to 31 percentage points) between the groups. The secondary outcomes at weeks 22 and 52 did not differ between the groups.

Limitations

The study had a small sample and a short follow-up. A low dosage of infliximab was used, and the prednisone dosage was rapidly tapered.

Conclusions

Although too small to be definitive, the trial provides evidence that adding infliximab to prednisone for treating newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica is of no benefit and may be harmful. If there is benefit, it is unlikely to be large. Australian Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN012606000205538.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines—corticosteroid mechanisms and experimental effects: Earlier studies observed a consistent reduction in swelling of involved nerve roots coincidental with improvement in sciatic symptoms with steroid administration, and it is postulated that corticosteroids reduce inflammation either by inhibiting the synthesis or release of a number of pro-inflammatory substances or by causing a reversible local anesthetic effect. Described modes of action include membrane stabilization, inhibition of neural peptide synthesis or action, blockade of phospholipase A2 activity, prolonged suppression of ongoing neuronal discharge, and suppression of ectopic discharges from focally demyelinated axons. In experimental models, epidural betamethasone showed a significant effect on thermal hyperalgesia, intravenous methylprednisolone significantly reduced nerve root injury in a pig model of epidural autologous nucleus pulposus application, and lipopolysaccharide accelerated disc resorption whereas high-dose steroids suppressed this process. Local methylprednisolone depressed heat hyperalgesia and mechano-allodynia but not mechano-hyperalgesia, with effects remaining during the 11 day test period, and chronic steroid treatment prevented neuropathic edema and completely blocked neurogenic extravasation while not affecting nociceptive thresholds in normal or neuropathic hyperalgesic rats.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^6090c109]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions—short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of <3-4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4-6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1071100c]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We prospectively registered this review on PROSPERO (CRD42021269997) and have followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from their database inception to June 2022 (supplemental file 1). We also tracked citations on relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, then full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (supplemental file 2).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults with sciatica of any duration due to a herniated disc (diagnosed through radiological examination). Eligible interventions were any surgical treatment using any approach, including open, micro, or endoscopic discectomy; percutaneous (plasma) disc decompression; and chemonucleolysis. Comparators were any non-surgical treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, interventional treatments (eg, epidural injection), or combinations of these. We deemed studies using placebo or sham surgeries as comparators as also eligible.Trials that reported data for pain, disability, or other outcomes of interest (see outcomes section for full details) were included. We did not restrict by language, geography, or publication date.

We excluded studies with mixed populations (eg, lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis) if separate data for lumbar disc herniation could not be obtained. We also excluded studies that enrolled participants with lumbar disc herniation combined with spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis or with any serious spinal pathologies (eg, infection, tumour, fractures, major trauma, systemic inflammatory diseases, or pregnancy related sciatica).

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^a19ef6ac]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis—treatment recommendations state that patients with symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with β-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids should be used instead of NSAIDs when patients fail to respond or present with moderate to severe pain and/or thyrotoxic symptoms (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). β-blockers are used as needed to control thyrotoxic symptoms, and NSAIDs provide pain relief in patients with mild symptoms; with NSAIDs, the median time for resolution of pain is 5 weeks (range 1–20 weeks). Patients who do not respond to full doses of NSAIDs over several days should be treated instead with corticosteroid therapy, with standard recommendations of prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer; corticosteroids at similar doses had more rapid resolution of pain (median duration, 8 days) compared with NSAIDs (mean duration, 35 days). An effective alternative regimen reported is an initial daily dose of 15 mg of prednisone with tapering by 5 mg every 2 weeks, though 20% of patients required longer than 8 weeks to discontinue the glucocorticoid; levothyroxine may be employed during the hypothyroid stage but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months.

### Treatments for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP): an overview of systematic reviews [^ead7951c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic progressive or relapsing and remitting disease that usually causes weakness and sensory loss. The symptoms are due to autoimmune inflammation of peripheral nerves. CIPD affects about 2 to 3 per 100,000 of the population. More than half of affected people cannot walk unaided when symptoms are at their worst. CIDP usually responds to treatments that reduce inflammation, but there is disagreement about which treatment is most effective.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of any treatment for CIDP and to compare the effects of treatments.

Methods

We considered all systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment for any form of CIDP. We reported their primary outcomes, giving priority to change in disability after 12 months.Two overview authors independently identified published systematic reviews for inclusion and collected data. We reported the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. Two other review authors independently checked review selection, data extraction and quality assessments.On 31 October 2016, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (in theCochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus for systematic reviews of CIDP. We supplemented the RCTs in the existing CSRs by searching on the same date for RCTs of any treatment of CIDP (including treatment of fatigue or pain in CIDP), in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus.

Main Results

Five CSRs met our inclusion criteria. We identified 23 randomised trials, of which 15 had been included in these CSRs. We were unable to compare treatments as originally planned, because outcomes and outcome intervals differed. CorticosteroidsIt is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone improved impairment compared to no treatment because the quality of the evidence was very low (1 trial, 28 participants). According to moderate-quality evidence (1 trial, 41 participants), six months' treatment with high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone did not improve disability more than daily oral prednisolone. Observational studies tell us that prolonged use of corticosteroids sometimes causes serious side-effects. Plasma exchangeAccording to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 59 participants), twice-weekly plasma exchange produced more short-term improvement in disability than sham exchange. In the largest observational study, 3.9% of plasma exchange procedures had complications. Intravenous immunoglobulinAccording to high-quality evidence (5 trials, 269 participants), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) produced more short-term improvement than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo (high-quality evidence), but serious adverse events were not (moderate-quality evidence, 3 trials, 315 participants). One trial with 19 participants provided moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in short-term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange in comparison to IVIg. There was little or no difference in short-term improvement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone (moderate-quality evidence; 1 trial, 29 participants) or intravenous methylprednisolone (high-quality evidence; 1 trial, 45 participants). One unpublished randomised open trial with 35 participants found little or no difference in disability after three months of IVIg compared to oral prednisone; this trial has not yet been included in a CSR. We know from observational studies that serious adverse events related to IVIg do occur. Other immunomodulatory treatmentsIt is uncertain whether the addition of azathioprine (2 mg/kg) to prednisone improved impairment in comparison to prednisone alone, as the quality of the evidence is very low (1 trial, 27 participants). Observational studies show that adverse effects truncate treatment in 10% of people.According to low-quality evidence (1 trial, 60 participants), compared to placebo, methotrexate 15 mg/kg did not allow more participants to reduce corticosteroid or IVIg doses by 20%. Serious adverse events were no more common with methotrexate than with placebo, but observational studies show that methotrexate can cause teratogenicity, abnormal liver function, and pulmonary fibrosis.According to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 77 participants), interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) in comparison to placebo, did not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. According to moderate-quality evidence, serious adverse events were no more common with IFN beta-1a than with placebo.We know of no other completed trials of immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory agents for CIDP. Other treatmentsWe identified no trials of treatments for fatigue or pain in CIDP. Adverse effectsNot all trials routinely collected adverse event data; when they did, the quality of evidence was variable. Adverse effects in the short, medium, and long term occur with all interventions. We are not able to make reliable comparisons of adverse events between the interventions included in CSRs.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot be certain based on available evidence whether daily oral prednisone improves impairment compared to no treatment. However, corticosteroids are commonly used, based on widespread availability, low cost, very low-quality evidence from observational studies, and clinical experience. The weakness of the evidence does not necessarily mean that corticosteroids are ineffective. High-dose monthly oral dexamethasone for six months is probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone. Plasma exchange produces short-term improvement in impairment as determined by neurological examination, and probably produces short-term improvement in disability. IVIg produces more short-term improvement in disability than placebo and more adverse events, although serious side effects are probably no more common than with placebo. There is no clear difference in short-term improvement in impairment with IVIg when compared with intravenous methylprednisolone and probably no improvement when compared with either oral prednisolone or plasma exchange. According to observational studies, adverse events related to difficult venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes occur in 3% to17% of plasma exchange procedures.It is uncertain whether azathioprine is of benefit as the quality of evidence is very low. Methotrexate may not be of benefit and IFN beta-1a is probably not of benefit.We need further research to identify predictors of response to different treatments and to compare their long-term benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness. There is a need for more randomised trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, routes of administration, and treatments for symptoms of CIDP.

Initiation of a csDMARD without longer-term (≥3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management—taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4-6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4-6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3-7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3-7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4-6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

### Long-term follow-up of relapse and remission of CIDP in a Chinese cohort [^293656b7]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Steroids were used in most patients as maintenance treatment. Patients showed different responses to long-term steroid treatment, including no relapse after steroid cessation or with a small maintenance dosage of steroids, relapse at a high steroid dosage, relapse at a small steroid dosage and steroid ineffectiveness. The INCAT before treatment was significantly lower in those without relapse, indicating a higher risk of relapse in those with more clinical impairment before treatment. Regarding clinical subtypes, the relapse rate was higher in MADSAM and lower in pure motor and distal CIDP than in typical CIDP. However, this was not significantly different and should be confirmed with larger studies. These results might indicate that for patients with higher neurological function impairment and the MADSAM subtype, the risk of relapse is higher. Steroids might be reduced more slowly, and immunosuppressants are more likely to be added. In distal CIDP and pure motor CIDP responding to steroids, however, the risk of relapse is lower. Two out of the five pure motor CIDP patients responded to IVIg, indicating that not all pure motor CIDP must be treated with IVIg. This was consistent with previous studies.For the nine patients without relapse after cessation of steroids, the disease duration when treatment started was short, and INCAT before treatment was lower compared with those who had relapse. This indicates that earlier treatment and less severe clinical impairment might be related to a better prognosis.

Information about the best exact tapering strategy of steroids for CIDP is incomplete. Current recommendations are based on published case reports and personal experience. Wertman et al found that lowering steroids must be very gradual and that treatment for less than 6 months and rapid tapering off from steroids may increase the risk of relapse.van Schaik et al recommended starting prednisolone 60 mg/day for 4–8 weeks and tapering the dose over 52–104 weeks.Odaka recommended slowly reducing the steroid dose over a 12-month period.In our study, those who were stable without relapse had been treated for approximately 2 years before the cessation of steroids. Based on our results and experience, we recommend starting prednisone 60 mg/day or 1 mg/kg/day and slowly tapering to 20 mg/day in 6 months, then slowly tapering and maintaining for approximately 2 years. If relapse occurred when steroids were more than 20 mg/day, immunosuppressants could be added. IVIg could also be used during severe relapse.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^4d409c54]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5-7 or 10-14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1-24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1-24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2—Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4-6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

### Systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis: focus on giant cell arteritis [^90614d78]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The most effective GC tapering scheme was not specifically assessed in any study included in the SLRs. In the trial of TCZ in GCA (GiACTA),two standardised prednisone-taper protocols (52 week and 26 week taper) were tested in an RCT. Patients who enrolled in the placebo group with more rapid tapering protocol experienced more flares (68% vs 49%) and a greater need for prednisone escape therapy (74% vs 55%), with a comparable safety profile. Nevertheless, the cumulative GC dose was numerically lower for the group treated with a more rapid GC taper (3296 vs 3818 mg).

The safety of GC treatment was evaluated in a large nested case–control analysis demonstrating a strict correlation between prednisone dose (average daily GC dose >30 mg/day) and the development of diabetes with an adjusted OR of 4.7 (95% CI 2.8 to 78), glaucoma 3.5 (2.0–6.1), osteoporosis 1.9 (1.2–2.9), fractures 2.6 (1.6–4.3), serious infections 3.3 (2.2–5.2) and death 2.1 (1.3–3.5).Similar concerns regarding the significant rate of GC-related adverse events (AEs) were confirmed in a retrospective medical claims data analysis, reporting an increase in HR by 3% for every 1000 mg increase in prednisone-equivalent exposure.

Evidence for GC discontinuation and drug-free remission was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study demonstrating that the following factors were associated with higher chances of obtaining long-term remission: a lower number of flares, lower cumulative GC dose at 1 year, lower duration of GC treatment and more rapid achievement of low-dose GC.

In summary, the prompt initiation of GC therapy is consistently associated with a better outcome, including visual complications (LoE 4). Only low to moderate quality evidence with conflicting results exists on the most appropriate initial dose and route of administration (LoE 4). The most appropriate tapering scheme has not been standardised yet, with evidence from one high-quality RCT suggesting a higher risk of flares in more rapid tapering regimens (LoE 1b). Nevertheless, safety concerns related to GC are dose dependent (LoE 3b), underlying the need to optimise the dose and duration of GC treatment.

### Corticosteroids in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: a retrospective, multicentre study, comparing efficacy and safety of daily prednisolone, pulsed dexamethasone, and pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone [^2f99fed4]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and patients

Data were collected retrospectively from treatment naive CIDP patients from year 2000 onwards, in three large CIDP centres in Serbia, The Netherlands, and Italy using a predefined questionnaire. For screening of patients, we used only the periods in which corticosteroids were considered the first-line treatment according to local protocols. Patients needed to fulfil the definite, probable, or possible EFNS/PNS criteria for CIDP. Data were collected anonymously from CIDP databases and hospital charts. Approval by the ethics committee was not acquired under applicable national legislation.

Treatment protocols

In all three centres, corticosteroids were considered the first-line treatment. Patients with severe disability, contraindication for corticosteroids, or pure motor phenotype were treated with IVIg. In Italy, IVIg was also the preferred treatment in patients with fast progressive disease. There was no predefined cut of ‘severe disability’ of ‘fast progression’. In Serbia, IVIg could only be administered with special approval of the Serbian Health Fund. In The Netherlands, treatment protocol was changed in 2013 from dexamethasone to the combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone as the first-line treatment. Dutch patients who were treated after 2013 were, therefore, not screened for this study. Included patients were treated according to the following protocols:

Daily prednisone or prednisolone, starting with 1–1.5 mg/kg body weight during the first 6 weeks, tapering to zero during a period of at least 8 months, at discretion of the treating neurologist (Serbia and The Netherlands). Patients in The Netherlands who did not improve were switched to IVIg treatment, while different treatment modalities were used as rescue treatment in Serbia, dependent on availability. As prednisone is metabolized immediately to prednisolone, we will use the term prednisolone throughout for both formulations.
Oral pulsed dexamethasone 40 mg per day for 4 days consecutively each month, during 6 months (The Netherlands). In case of insufficient improvement, patient was switched to IVIg treatment.
Intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone, starting with 500 mg daily for 4 days (Italy). Patients who showed improvement after the first course of methylprednisolone were treated with at least two additional courses (with 1 or 2 g/month dependent on disease severity). Patients who did not improve were switched to IVIg treatment. All patients received osteoporosis prophylaxes, consisting of oral calcium and vitamin D, during corticosteroid treatment.
