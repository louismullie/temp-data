## Question

Of often can a UTI cause altered mentation in the elderly?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often a urinary tract infection (UTI) causes altered mentation in older adults, and what the evidence shows about that relationship and its clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define altered mentation in a clinically precise, geriatric context. Then, I should verify the epidemiology of UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults. Next, I will examine the direct evidence linking UTI to delirium or confusion, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check guideline positions on when to attribute delirium to UTI and when to treat. Finally, I will consider confounders, diagnostic pitfalls, and synthesize a cautious, clinically useful estimate with practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Altered mentation in older adults most often reflects delirium, an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating attention and awareness due to a medical precipitant, with multiple predisposing and precipitating factors identified, including infections such as UTI, medications, metabolic derangements, and neurologic disease [^113a379C] [^113pN9uD].

> I need to check the baseline epidemiology. UTIs are common in older adults, and asymptomatic bacteriuria is highly prevalent, especially in long-term care, where it ranges roughly 25–50% in women and 15–40% in men without catheters, which complicates attribution of mental status changes to UTI when bacteriuria is present [^113cR6bQ] [^116AYAwx]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic challenge: in nursing home residents with advanced dementia, only about 16% of suspected UTI episodes met minimum criteria for symptomatic UTI, yet most were treated, underscoring overdiagnosis and overtreatment risks [^113sSJ7m].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence linking UTI and delirium. A 2021 meta-analysis of 29 studies with 16,618 participants found a significant association between delirium and UTI with a pooled odds ratio around 2.67, which persisted across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, suggesting a real association, albeit with moderate-quality evidence and publication bias considerations [^114gzDFg] [^116DVWyk]. Wait, let me verify the directionality and causality. The authors note cross-sectional data cannot establish causality, and temporality is often unclear, so while association is consistent, causation remains uncertain in many cases [^114gzDFg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asymptomatic bacteriuria. I should confirm whether delirium correlates with bacteriuria alone. The same meta-analytic work found no significant association between delirium and asymptomatic bacteriuria in the only eligible study, reinforcing that bacteriuria without urinary symptoms should not be equated with UTI causing delirium [^116DVWyk] [^116PzTQ5]. Let me double-check guideline alignment: IDSA recommends against treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults with delirium or falls when there are no localizing urinary symptoms or systemic signs, precisely because benefit is unproven and harms are real [^117VPowJ] [^115B8tWu].

> I will now examine how often altered mentation accompanies UTI in clinical cohorts. In a large emergency department dataset, altered mental status was documented in 7% of older adults and 13% of the oldest adults diagnosed with UTI, with nursing home residence strongly associated with altered mental status, suggesting that when UTI is diagnosed, delirium is not rare, though ascertainment and diagnostic criteria vary [^111rzdke]. But wait, what if the mental status change is nonspecific and not due to infection at all? In ED cohorts, altered mental status or malaise only modestly increases the post-test probability of bacterial infection, and absence of fever does not reliably exclude infection, so mental status changes alone are insufficient to diagnose UTI [^112vHE6F].

> Let me consider confounders and indirect links. Frailty, dehydration, urinary retention, and medications with anticholinergic or sedative effects both predispose to delirium and are common in older adults with bacteriuria, creating a risk of misattribution when bacteriuria is present but symptoms are nonspecific [^116d8X3o] [^113pN9uD]. I should confirm that dehydration and retention independently modify the delirium–UTI association in meta-regression, which supports a careful search for non-urinary precipitants before labeling UTI as the cause of altered mentation [^116d8X3o].

> Next, I should review treatment data to avoid overinterpreting association as benefit. Observational inpatient data show that among older adults with delirium and positive urinalysis, antibiotics are frequently prescribed even without urinary symptoms, yet treatment was not associated with faster delirium resolution or improved 30-day outcomes, and a systematic review of antibiotic use for delirium with pyuria or bacteriuria likewise found no benefit and potential harm, aligning with guideline cautions against treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in this context [^116bJZ1g] [^116AXR2M] [^117VPowJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antibiotics might hasten recovery in all delirious patients with bacteriuria, but the data do not support that assumption, especially in the absence of systemic or localizing urinary signs [^116AXR2M].

> I should double-check the risk of overtreatment and its consequences. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria increases Clostridioides difficile infection, antimicrobial resistance, and length of stay without improving mortality or subsequent symptomatic episodes, reinforcing the need for diagnostic stewardship and restraint when mental status changes are isolated [^113cR6bQ] [^115QNZYr]. Let me verify that real-world audits show high rates of inappropriate testing and treatment driven by nonspecific symptoms, which they do, particularly in emergency and long-term care settings [^113XBv2i] [^116x2HUQ].

> Now, synthesizing a cautious estimate, I need to ensure I separate association from attributable causation. Given the meta-analytic OR of about 2.7 for delirium with UTI and ED data showing altered mental status in roughly 7–13% of UTI diagnoses in older adults, it is reasonable to say that among clinically diagnosed UTIs in older adults, altered mentation accompanies UTI in a meaningful minority, perhaps on the order of 5–15%, with higher rates in the oldest old and in nursing home residents, acknowledging substantial heterogeneity and risk of misclassification [^114gzDFg] [^111rzdke]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the caveat that many such cases reflect confounding or reverse causation; yes, methodological limitations and the high background prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria mean that only a subset of these associations represent true UTI-induced delirium, and many represent coincidental bacteriuria with alternative precipitants of delirium [^114gzDFg] [^113cR6bQ].

> Practically, I need to ensure a disciplined approach. First, confirm delirium using validated tools and screen for non-urinary precipitants such as medications, dehydration, electrolytes, hypoxia, and other infections, before attributing causation to UTI [^113pN9uD] [^113a379C]. Second, apply guideline-concordant diagnostic criteria: treat only when there are new localizing urinary symptoms or systemic signs of infection, and avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria even if delirium is present, reserving antibiotics for those with clear evidence of symptomatic UTI or an alternative infection source [^117VPowJ] [^115B8tWu]. Third, use diagnostic stewardship to avoid low-yield urine testing in the absence of compatible symptoms, and consider that procalcitonin has limited diagnostic value for UTI in this population, so clinical judgment and careful observation remain key [^113XBv2i] [^116ogibX].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. UTI can precipitate delirium in older adults, and observational data suggest an association with delirium in a minority of diagnosed UTI cases, but the evidence is largely observational, confounded, and vulnerable to overdiagnosis due to asymptomatic bacteriuria; therefore, the most defensible clinical stance is that altered mentation is a recognized but nonspecific manifestation that should prompt a thorough search for causes, with antibiotics reserved for patients who meet symptom- and sign-based criteria for symptomatic UTI rather than for bacteriuria alone [^114gzDFg] [^117VPowJ] [^116AXR2M].

UTIs can cause altered mental status in older adults, especially those with cognitive impairment or frailty, but **most cases are not due to UTI alone** [^113a379C]. Altered mentation is a nonspecific response to illness in the elderly and is often triggered by other causes (e.g. dehydration, medications, electrolyte disturbances, or other infections) [^113a379C] [^112vHE6F]. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria does not improve mental status and is discouraged by guidelines [^117VPowJ] [^113cR6bQ]. Clinicians should **confirm UTI with localizing symptoms or systemic signs** before attributing altered mentation to UTI and initiating antibiotics [^117VPowJ] [^113XBv2i].

---

## Frequency of altered mental status in elderly patients with UTIs

- **Prevalence**: Altered mental status (AMS) is common in elderly UTI patients, especially in long-term care and those with cognitive impairment [^111rzdke] [^113sSJ7m].

- **Nursing homes**: AMS is the most common reason for suspecting UTI in nursing home residents, but only 16% meet minimum criteria for symptomatic UTI [^113sSJ7m].

- **Emergency department**: AMS is present in 7% of older adults and 13% of the oldest adults diagnosed with UTI, and is more frequent with nursing home residence [^111rzdke].

---

## Clinical evidence linking UTIs to altered mental status

- **Association**: Multiple studies and reviews report an association between UTI and delirium/AMS in older adults, but causality is uncertain [^114gzDFg] [^115hAbL5].

- **Meta-analysis**: Delirium is significantly associated with UTI (OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.12–3.36), but many studies are observational and heterogeneous [^114gzDFg] [^115DNzgx].

- **Systematic review**: Evidence is insufficient to establish a clear causal link between UTI and confusion due to poor case definitions and confounding [^115hAbL5] [^111T3aVF].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms may explain how UTIs could lead to altered mental status in older adults:

- **Systemic inflammation**: Cytokine release and neuroinflammation can disrupt cerebral function [^113a379C].

- **Indirect effects**: Fever, dehydration, and metabolic disturbances from infection can precipitate delirium [^1158Sa37].

- **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: Infection-related neurochemical changes may contribute to AMS [^113a379C].

---

## Risk factors for altered mental status in elderly patients with UTIs

Certain factors increase the likelihood of AMS in elderly patients with UTIs:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cognitive impairment | Dementia and baseline cognitive decline are major risk factors [^113a379C] |
| Frailty | Frail patients are more susceptible to delirium with infection [^notfound] |
| Nursing home residence | Higher rates of AMS and atypical presentations [^111rzdke] [^113XBv2i] |
| Comorbidities | Diabetes, renal impairment, and cardiovascular disease increase risk [^notfound] |
| Medications | Polypharmacy, anticholinergics, and sedatives elevate delirium risk [^116d8X3o] |

---

## Diagnostic challenges and confounding factors

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Common in older adults and often misinterpreted as UTI when AMS is present [^114drgDM] [^113XBv2i].

- **Poor case definitions**: Inconsistent criteria for UTI and AMS limit the reliability of associations [^115hAbL5] [^1162GUVS].

- **Confounding**: Frailty, dehydration, and medications can independently cause AMS, complicating attribution to UTI [^116d8X3o] [^111T3aVF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

IDSA guidelines advise against treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults with AMS unless there are localizing urinary symptoms or systemic signs; instead, **evaluate other causes and observe** [^117VPowJ] [^115B8tWu]. Antibiotics for AMS with bacteriuria but without urinary symptoms are not supported and may cause harm, including longer hospitalization and Clostridioides difficile infection [^115QNZYr] [^116AXR2M]. Clinicians should confirm UTI with compatible symptoms or systemic signs before attributing AMS to UTI [^117VPowJ] [^116wbFyD].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Evaluate for non-urinary causes of AMS (e.g. dehydration, medications, electrolyte disturbances, other infections) [^1157E3m4] [^113pN9uD].

- **Diagnostic stewardship**: Avoid unnecessary urine testing and antibiotics in the absence of urinary symptoms or systemic signs [^113XBv2i] [^1141TowA].

- **Targeted treatment**: Treat only when UTI is confirmed with localizing symptoms or systemic signs, and use narrow-spectrum antibiotics when indicated [^117VPowJ] [^113cR6bQ].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess mental status after treating identified precipitants; persistent AMS warrants further evaluation for alternative causes [^113pN9uD].

UTIs can be associated with altered mental status in older adults, but **most cases are not due to UTI alone**. Clinicians should confirm UTI with localizing symptoms or systemic signs before attributing AMS to UTI and initiating antibiotics.

### The diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin for urinary tract infection in hospitalized older adults: a prospective study [^116ogibX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) is challenging among hospitalized older adults, particularly among those with altered mental status.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) for UTI in hospitalized older adults.

Design

We performed a prospective cohort study of older adults (≥ 65 years old) admitted to a single hospital with evidence of pyuria on urinalysis. PCT was tested on initial blood samples. The reference standard was a clinical definition that included the presence of a positive urine culture and any symptom or sign of infection referable to the genitourinary tract. We also surveyed the treating physicians for their clinical judgment and performed expert adjudication of cases for the determination of UTI.

Participants

Two hundred twenty-nine study participants at a major academic medical center.

Main Measures

We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of PCT for the diagnosis of UTI.

Key Results

In this study cohort, 61 (27%) participants met clinical criteria for UTI. The median age of the overall cohort was 82.6 (IQR 74.9–89.7) years. The AUC of PCT for the diagnosis of UTI was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.46–0.65). A series of sensitivity analyses on UTI definition, which included using a decreased threshold for bacteriuria, the treating physicians' clinical judgment, and independent infectious disease specialist adjudication, confirmed the negative result.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that PCT has limited value in the diagnosis of UTI among hospitalized older adults. Clinicians should be cautious using PCT for the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older adults.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112KNEot]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^114PqH22]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Purpose

While urinary tract infections (UTIs) are thought to be common among women, as many as 65% of UTI diagnoses may be inaccurate. To identify strategies to improve antibiotic stewardship, we sought to determine the clinical and laboratory factors associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs.

Methods

Electronic health records identified patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI within a single healthcare system during July 2019. Demographic, clinical, and microbial data were collected by manual chart review. Regression analyses were utilized to determine factors associated with guideline non‐concordant UTI diagnosis and treatment utilizing R statistical software (version 4.3.1).

Results

In patients diagnosed with UTI, 64% were treated with antibiotics despite only 28% having symptoms consistent with UTI diagnostic criteria. Of patients diagnosed with a UTI who were treated in an emergency room (ER) setting, 95% were given antibiotics compared with only 55% of patients in an outpatient setting. Even without any urinary symptoms, 95% of patients in the ER and 27% of patients in outpatient settings were treated with antibiotics. Patients who presented to the ER for non‐localizing symptoms, such as mental status changes (MSC), were more likely to be diagnosed with UTI compared with those in an outpatient setting.

Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrate that patients were frequently diagnosed with and treated for a UTI despite not meeting diagnostic criteria. This pattern of overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, particularly in acute care settings, contributing to worsening antibiotic resistance in conjunction with incomplete evaluation of patients' primary complaints.

### Intestinal microbiology and urinary tract infection associated risk in long-term aged care residents [^1163Jaoz]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most frequently diagnosed infection in residents of long-term care and are a major risk factor for urosepsis, hospitalisation, and death. Translocation of gut pathobionts into the urinary tract is the presumed cause of most UTIs. While specific gut microbiota characteristics have been linked to UTI risk in younger adults, their relevance in aged care residents remains uncertain.

Methods

The faecal microbiome was assessed in 54 long-term aged care residents with a history of UTIs and 69 residents without a UTI history. Further comparisons were made to microbiome characteristics in 20 younger adults without UTIs. Microbiome characteristics were examined in relation to prior and subsequent UTIs, as well as antibiotic therapy.

Results

In long-term aged care residents, prior UTI history and exposure to UTI-exclusive antibiotics do not significantly affect microbiome composition or functional capacity. However, exposure to antibiotics unrelated to UTI treatment is associated with distinct microbiota compositional traits. Adjustment for dementia, incontinence, diabetes, and prior antibiotic use finds no microbiota characteristic linked to UTI development. However, prior UTI is identified as a predictor of future UTIs. Comparison with younger adults identifies greater within-participant dispersion in aged care residents, as well as lower microbiota diversity and altered microbiome functional potential.

Conclusions

No association between the gut microbiome and UTI incidence, as has been reported in younger individuals, is evident in long-term aged care residents. Considerable variability in gut microbiome characteristics, relating to high antibiotic exposure and age-related physiological and immunological factors, could mask such a relationship. However, it cannot be discounted that increased UTI risk in the elderly is independent of microbiome-mediated mechanisms.

3.3 Impact of Depression and Urinary Conditions on Mental and Physical Health Components

After adjusting for age, marital status, education, income, employment, alcohol use, and smoking status, a significantly greater decrease in mental health component scores was observed in individuals with moderate to severe LUTS (IPSS ≥ 8), particularly in the presence of depression (p = 0.01) (Table 4). Similar significant associations were observed with incontinence, overactive bladder, and urinary tract infection. Urinary incontinence was additionally associated with a more pronounced decrease in physical health component scores in individuals with depression (p = 0.02). Greater reductions in SF12 PCS scores were also observed in moderate to severe LUTS, overactive bladder, or urinary tract infection in the presence of depression. Overall, any urinary condition present significantly modified the impact of depression on mental health component scores (p = 0.05) (Figure 1).

### Nursing assistants: "he seems to be ill"-a reason for nurses to take action: validation of the early detection scale of infection (EDIS) [^112wRDvy]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nursing home residents (NHR) are more likely than elderly in general to suffer from acute infections due to general frailty and physical incapability. Infectious diseases are associated with poorer prognosis, delirium, hospital care and increased mortality, and also with long rehabilitation and decreased physical function, which may also reduce general wellbeing. The prevalence of infections in NHRs is estimated to be 11 to 13%. The most frequent are urinary tract infection (UTI) (5.2%), pneumonia (2.2%) and cellulitis (1.6%), while other infections constitute 2.8% of the total. Cham et al. estimated pneumonia to account for 41% of all infections. In an earlier study we found that pneumonia was as common as stroke and heart failure as a cause of death in NHRs. Signs and symptoms of infection in the frail elderly are often atypical, while specific ones, including fever, are often absent, causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Examples of atypical signs and symptoms are weakness, falling, weight loss, physical dysfunction and cognitive decline. In pneumonia, the presence of cognitive decline is as common as symptoms more specific to respiratory tract infection, such as cough and sputum production. However, quite frequently clinical identification of infections among elderly is based on atypical symptoms and end up not being infections. For example, D'Agata et al. reported that mental status changes, such as lethargy or alterations of cognitive status, were the sole symptoms or signs documented in 36% of episodes of suspected UTI in NHRs, and only 21 (16%) of the 131 episodes met the minimum criteria to initiate antimicrobial therapy based on documented signs or symptoms. Consequently, there is a risk of over treating elderly persons with antibiotics, and e.g. Sundvall et. al reported that residence in a care home setting is associated with high antibiotic consumption, especially for UTI where the odds of prescription is doubled.

### Predictors of outcome in geriatric patients with urinary tract infections [^112Q4Adx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A study was conducted to determine the prognosis of geriatric patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and identify clinical factors associated with adverse outcomes. This retrospective, cohort study identified elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) presenting to an academic, urban Emergency Department (ED) during a 16-week period with UTI, suggested by urinalysis and pertinent symptoms. There were 37 demographic and clinical variables analyzed as potential predictors of outcome. Morbidity was defined as in-hospital death, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay (LOS) > 2 days, or hospital intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics > 2 days. Factors identified by univariate analysis were combined using multiple logistic regression to identify independent predictors of morbidity. There were 284 patients who met selection criteria. Thirteen patients (4.6%) died during hospitalization and 27 (9.5%) had ICU admission, 139 (48.9%) had LOS > 2 days, and 75 (26.4%) had i.v. antibiotics > 2 days. Multivariate analysis identified the following variables as independent predictors of adverse outcomes: mental status change, frequent UTIs, other nonurinary infections, abnormal temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated BUN, hyperglycemia, elevated WBC, and relative neutrophilia. Regression models for adverse outcomes had sensitivities from 74.8% to 96.2% and specificities from 31.1% to 69.0%. In conclusion, this study defines high rates of morbidity for geriatric patients with UTIs and describes predictive variables that may help identify low-risk patients. These data may lay the foundation for determining specific guidelines for disposition of this high-risk patient population.

### Nonspecific symptoms lack diagnostic accuracy for infection in older patients in the emergency department [^112vHE6F]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine if nonspecific symptoms and fever affect the posttest probability of acute bacterial infection in older patients in the emergency department (ED).

Design

Preplanned, secondary analysis of a prospective observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care, academic ED.

Participants

A total of 424 patients in the ED, 65 years or older, including all chief complaints.

Measurements

We identified presence of altered mental status, malaise/lethargy, and fever, as reported by the patient, as documented in the chart, or both. Bacterial infection was adjudicated by agreement among two or more of three expert reviewers. Odds ratios were calculated using univariable logistic regression. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) were used to determine each symptom's effect on posttest probability of infection.

Results

Of 424 subjects, 77 (18%) had bacterial infection. Accounting for different reporting methods, presence of altered mental status (PLR range, 1.40–2.53) or malaise/lethargy (PLR range, 1.25–1.34) only slightly increased posttest probability of infection. Their absence did not assist with ruling out infection (NLR, greater than 0.50 for both). Fever of 38°C or higher either before or during the ED visit had moderate to large increases in probability of infection (PLR, 5.15–18.10), with initial fever in the ED perfectly predictive, but absence of fever did not rule out infection (NLR, 0.79–0.92). Results were similar when analyzing lower respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) individually. Of older adults diagnosed as having UTIs, 47% did not complain of UTI symptoms.

Conclusions

The presence of either altered mental status or malaise/lethargy does not substantially increase the probability of bacterial infection in older adults in the ED and should not be used alone to indicate infection in this population. Fever of 38°C or higher is associated with increased probability of infection. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:484–492, 2019.

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^116YSudf]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Data analyses

The incidence of UTI from age 86 years onwards was calculated during four years of follow-up (until age 90 years), using the life-table method. The number of first time UTI was assigned to the numerator and the observed person-years at risk were assigned to the denominator. The observed person-years at risk were counted from age 86 to the censor date (age 90 years), to date of death, or to date of first UTI.

The association between predictive factors and the occurrence of UTI in participants from age 86 years onwards was investigated with Cox proportional hazards models. Those factors predicting UTI in the univariate Cox regression analysis with a P- value < 0.10 were included in a multivariate Cox regression analysis. Since the GDS-15 could only be administered to participants without cognitive impairment (MMSE ≥ 19 points, n = 393), the variable 'depressive symptoms' was not included in the multivariate analysis. The relative contribution of the different predictive factors to the occurrence of UTI was determined by calculating the Population Attributable Risk (PAR), which combines the relative risk and the prevalence of the different predictive factors. Data analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA).

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^116x2HUQ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Mental status changes are poorly understood to be a symptom of UTI. Despite AGS and IDSA guidelines recommending against testing and treatment for patients with only mental status changes, all of the patients (100%, n = 14) who presented with mental status changes to the ER were treated with antibiotics despite only one (7%) having urinary symptoms. Mental status changes are often misunderstood to be a definitive feature of UTIs, but in the absence of localizing urinary symptoms or systemic signs of infection, such as fever or hemodynamic instability, mental status changes correlate poorly to infectious processes. In addition to the lack of clinical benefit from antibiotic treatment, patients with mental status changes may suffer harms from treatment with adverse drug reactions and reinfection with drug‐resistant organisms. These harms are so great that the AGS and IDSA recommend against even testing for UTI in patients with only mental status changes due to the risk for inappropriate treatment. When evaluating a patient presenting with delirium‐like symptoms or mental status changes, providers should explore non‐urinary etiologies of MSC and observe the patient while encouraging or facilitating fluid intake without prescribing antibiotics. Our study showed a lack of adherence to these guidelines in both the ER and office settings with 100% of ER patients and 71% of office visit patients with MSC receiving antibiotic treatment despite only 7% of ER patients and 12% of office patients experiencing urinary symptoms. This discordance between the symptomatology of these patients and their diagnosis and treatment highlights the need for further provider education and understanding of guidelines for the treatment of MSC in the absence of urinary symptoms.

### Common infections in older adults [^113mGtJj]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases account for one third of all deaths in people 65 years and older. Early detection is more difficult in the elderly because the typical signs and symptoms, such as fever and leukocytosis, are frequently absent. A change in mental status or decline in function may be the only presenting problem in an older patient with an infection. An estimated 90 percent of deaths resulting from pneumonia occur in people 65 years and older. Mortality resulting from influenza also occurs primarily in the elderly. Urinary tract infections are the most common cause of bacteremia in older adults. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs frequently in the elderly; however, antibiotic treatment does not appear to be efficacious. The recent rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) is a particular problem in the elderly because they are exposed to infections at higher rates in hospital and institutional settings. Treatment of colonization and active infection is problematic; strict adherence to hygiene practices is necessary to prevent the spread of resistant organisms.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178Jm2f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first meta‐analysis of the associations of delirium with UTI and AB. Only delirium and UTI were found to be significantly associated.

Through subgroup meta‐analysis, the association between delirium and UTI persisted regardless of whether individuals with delirium were compared with non‐delirium individuals, or individuals with UTI were compared with non‐UTI individuals. This association remains significant when considering (1) only those studies in which delirium was diagnosed according to formal diagnostic criteria and (2) only those studies in which the diagnosis of UTI was based on positive results of microbiological urine tests combined with the presence of UTI symptoms, making it unlikely that our results were biased by non‐optimal approaches to detecting delirium and UTI.

According to both subgroup meta‐analysis and meta‐regression analysis, the association between delirium and UTI in older adults was similar in clinical, nursing home, and population‐based samples; thus, clinical referral bias cannot account for this association.

Meta‐regression analysis showed that gender, age, and differences defining delirium and UTI also had no statistically significant effect on the association between delirium and UTI, which is consistent with the results of our subgroup meta‐analysis. There was also no statistically significant effect of study design (cohort, case–control, cross‐sectional) and temporality (prospective and retrospective) on the association we studied. The effect of the study country did not reach statistical significance. This observation should be interpreted with caution as only one or two studies were available for most countries.

It is noteworthy that preexisting dementia did not show a statistically significant impact on the association between delirium and UTI in older adults in the meta‐regression analysis. It is conceivable that recognition of both delirium and UTI is more difficult in individuals with dementia, making such an association less detectable. This issue requires further study.

### Inappropriate testing for urinary tract infection in hospitalized patients: an opportunity for improvement [^1179a1HN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urine cultures are frequently obtained for hospitalized patients. We reviewed documented indications for culture and compared these with professional society guidelines. Lack of documentation and important clinical scenarios (before orthopedic procedures and when the patient has altered mental status without a urinary catheter) are highlighted as areas of use outside of current guidelines.

### Antibiotics for delirium in older adults with pyuria or bacteriuria: a systematic review [^116AXR2M]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether antibiotics impact delirium outcomes in older adults with pyuria or bacteriuria in the absence of systemic signs of infection or genitourinary symptoms.

Methods

We registered our systematic review protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42023418091). We searched the Medline and Embase databases from inception until April 2023 for studies investigating the impact of antimicrobial treatment on the duration and severity of delirium in older adults (≥ 60years) with pyuria (white blood cells detected on urinalysis or dipstick) or bacteriuria (bacteria growing on urine culture) and without systemic signs of infection (temperature > 37.9C [> 100.2F] or 1.5C [2.4F] increase above baseline temperature, and/or hemodynamic instability) or genitourinary symptoms (acute dysuria or new/worsening urinary symptoms). Two reviewers independently screened search results, abstracted data, and appraised the risk of bias. Full-text randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational study designs were included without restriction on study language, duration, or year of publication.

Results

We screened 984 citations and included 4 studies comprising 652 older adults (mean age was 84.6years and 63.5% were women). The four studies were published between 1996 and 2022, and included one RCT, two prospective observational cohort studies, and one retrospective chart review. None of the four studies demonstrated a significant effect of antibiotics on delirium outcomes, with two studies reported a worsening of outcomes among adults who received antibiotics. The three observational studies included had a moderate or serious overall risk of bias, while the one RCT had a high overall risk of bias.

Conclusions

Our systematic review found no evidence that treatment with antibiotics is associated with improved delirium outcomes in older adults with pyuria or bacteriuria and without systemic signs of infection or genitourinary symptoms. Overall, the evidence was limited, largely observational, and had substantial risk of bias.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^112WkYvB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most overdiagnosed infections, especially in hospitalized patients, older adults, and catheterized patients. Recent data show almost 50% of antibiotic prescriptions for outpatient UTIs are either inappropriate or unnecessary. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is even more common in hospitalized older adults and those presenting with dementia and/or altered mental status (AMS). AMS remains one of the primary indications for ASB treatment despite guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommending withholding antibiotic treatment in patients with ASB.

One reason for ASB overtreatment is clinicians' concern that poor outcomes (eg, bacteremia from UTI) may occur if antibiotics are not started early. Evidence to guide treatment in these situations are sparse. On the one hand, studies suggest antibiotic delays in patients with bacteremia or severe sepsis may increase mortality. In contrast, antibiotic treatment of ASB has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes and is instead associated with increased health care utilization, adverse drug events, and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Prior studies have suggested that estimating a patient's risk of an outcome (eg, bacteremia) and then treating with antibiotic therapy if their risk exceeds 2% could balance potential under and overtreatment. However, there is no validated way to estimate the risk of bacteremia in a hospitalized patient with ASB.

We sought to (1) determine the prevalence of bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in a large, multihospital cohort of hospitalized patients with ASB and a subgroup of patients with AMS; (2) examine factors associated with bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in patients with ASB; and (3) estimate antibiotics avoided if a 2% risk of bacteremia were used as a threshold for empiric antibiotic treatment of ASB.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HaXjM]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Highlights

- Older adults may present atypically with UTI and making a diagnosis can be difficult.
- There is limited authoritative guidance on how older adult outpatients present with UTI.
- Symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI (e.g. nocturia, urgency and abnormal vital signs) may have limited utility in diagnosing these infections in older adult outpatients.
- Disability in performing a number of acts of daily living may be better predictors of UTI; high quality studies should be conducted in this area to confirm this.

Acute delirium evaluation — The following criteria can be helpful to diagnose an acute delirium: onset acute versus insidious, course fluctuating versus constant, attention disordered versus generally preserved*, consciousness disordered versus generally preserved*, and hallucinations often present versus generally absent*, with '✱ = Variable in Advanced Dementia'. As mental status changes may wax and wane, delirium screening will be reevaluated on a regular basis, and upon diagnosis of an acute delirium, attention will be paid to underlying causes including, but not limited to, infections (UTI, pneumonia most commonly) and medications such as anti-cholinergic medications, sedative/hypnotics, narcotics, and any new medication, especially if multiple medications have been recently added.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^1124wanp]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections in older persons living in nursing homes (NHs). It is estimated that the error rate of a UTI diagnosis based solely on clinical criteria is 33% in a general population. A much higher error rate is to be expected in older persons as they often present infections in an atypical way. Signs/symptoms can be more subtle (e.g. absence or reduced intensity of fever) or less specific (e.g. acute change in mental or functional status) in this age group compared to younger adults. Older adults also less frequently present typical symptoms of a UTI such as dysuria and frequency. A meta-analysis by Gbinigie et al. tried to evaluate the diagnostic value of different signs/symptoms in older outpatients. The results of this meta-analysis are however difficult to interpret due to heterogeneity in the applied definitions of a UTI in the included studies. Hence, this topic needs further study.

As the diagnosis cannot be solely based on signs/symptoms, additional diagnostic testing is required to improve antimicrobial prescribing in NH residents suspected of having a UTI. Bacteriological urine culture has become a standard test in the diagnosis of UTI and is also recommended for older persons as their microbiology differs from the young. To minimize contamination the urine specimen should be appropriately collected. This is not straightforward in older persons who suffer from incontinence and/or are physically or cognitively impaired. In addition, many older adults have bacteria in their urine (bacteriuria). The prevalence varies from 25 to 50% in institutionalized women and from 15 to 40% in men. A Belgian study confirmed this finding and even reported a 80–90% prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in a subpopulation of female NH residents with urinary incontinence or with a high degree of dependence and disorientation. Despite trials reporting no benefits and even potential harms (increased risk of adverse events, costs and antimicrobial resistance) with antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, this practice continues to be prevalent in NHs. Up to 50% of all antimicrobial treatments in NHs are still prescribed to asymptomatic residents. The interpretation of bacteriuria as symptomatic in the presence of nonspecific symptoms, the uncertainty of physicians about the significance of a positive urine culture result and concerns over liability of nurses and physicians play herewith an important role.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kr3sq]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the associations of delirium with urinary tract infection (UTI) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in individuals aged 65 and older.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review and meta‐analysis was published on PROSPERO (CRD42020164341). Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies, professional associations and experts in the field were additionally contacted. Studies with control groups reporting associations between delirium and UTI as well as delirium and AB in older adults were included. The random effects model meta‐analysis was conducted using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as effect size measures. The Newcastle‐Ottawa scale was used to rate the studies' quality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I² tests. The effects of potential moderators were investigated by both subgroup and meta‐regression analyses. The risk of publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot and Egger's test.

Results

Twenty nine relevant studies (16,618 participants) examining the association between delirium and UTI in older adults were identified. The association between delirium and UTI was found to be significant (OR 2.67; 95% CI 2.12–3.36; p < 0.001) and persisted regardless of potential confounders. The association between delirium and AB in older adults in the only eligible study found (192 participants) was insignificant (OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.57–4.65; p = 0.37). All included studies were of moderate quality.

Conclusion

The results of this study support the association between delirium and UTI in older adults. Insufficient evidence was found to conclude on an association between delirium and AB in this age group. These findings are limited due to the moderate quality of the included studies and a lack of available research on the association between delirium and AB. Future studies should use the highest quality approaches for defining both delirium and UTI and consider AB in their investigations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117VPowJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Urinary tract infection in geriatric and institutionalized patients [^111KvmyV]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of urinary tract infection in elderly populations and some of the unique features in its evaluation and therapy are becoming better recognized. In elderly populations in the community there are concerns about increasing antimicrobial resistance in infecting organisms. In postmenopausal women, the importance of vaginal estrogen deficiency as a factor which promotes urinary tract infection is becoming increasingly recognized, leading to therapeutic strategies other than antimicrobials. For elderly residents of long term care facilities, urinary tract infection is very common, and most frequent in those with the greatest functional impairment. Whilst it is recognized that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in this population often presents a dilemma. In particular, the urine culture is useful only in excluding urinary tract infection, not in making a diagnosis of symptomatic infection. There has been a tendency to manage all clinical deterioration in long term care facility residents who have positive urine cultures as urinary tract infection, contributing to excess antimicrobial use and heightening the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Recently published guidelines and commentaries attempt to address this problem.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to clinical history, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that signs and symptoms compatible with CA-UTI include new onset or worsening of fever, rigors, altered mental status, malaise, or lethargy with no other identified cause; flank pain; costovertebral angle tenderness; acute hematuria; pelvic discomfort; and in cases where catheters have been removed, dysuria, urgent or frequent urination, or suprapubic pain or tenderness.

### Geriatric trauma management [^115urvzK]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Dehydration — risk factors, associations, outcomes, and management are described: dehydration is multifactorial in etiology and can be attributed to age-related changes in total body water, thirst perception, altered renal function, recent vomiting or diarrhea, illness, altered mental status, or environmental changes (e.g., lack of electricity or air conditioning on a hot day). Dehydration is common among nursing home residents, and elder abuse or neglect can also be a contributor; it is commonly associated with diagnoses such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and can be a red flag of failure to thrive. About 20% of elderly Medicare patients hospitalized with a principle diagnosis of dehydration die within 30 days of admission, and 30% more die in the subsequent 11 months. For trauma patients in whom dehydration is a contributor for admission, treat the traumatic injury as well as the underlying cause of dehydration, and perform a frailty assessment, consider a home safety evaluation, and discuss advanced directives, as appropriate.

### Current controversies in urinary tract infections: ICI-RS 2017 [^111R3npi]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The current definition of urinary tract infection (UTI) relies on laboratory and clinical findings, which may or may not be relevant, depending upon the patient group under consideration. This report considers the utility of current definitions for UTI in adults with and without underlying neurological conditions in order to identify gaps in current understanding and to recommend directions for research.

Methods

This is a consensus report of the proceedings of Think Tank TT3: "How do we define and when do we treat UTI in neurological and non-neurological adult patients?" from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), June 8–10, 2017 (Bristol, UK).

Results

Evidence considering the definitions of UTI in patients with and without neurological diseases was reviewed and synthesized. We examined research on laboratory methods and clinical definitions, focusing on specific cut-off values for the quantification of significant bacteriuria, and leucocyturia. Several areas were identified, mostly related to the lack of evidence-based definitions of significant bacteriuria for different patient groups, as well as uncertainties about the role of inflammatory biomarkers, and non-specific symptoms and signs.

Conclusions

One of the biggest challenges in clinical practice is to discriminate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI. Future research should concentrate on risk factors for developing symptomatic UTI in different patient groups. Targeted investigations for specific populations, such as the frail elderly, and patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, are still needed.

### Common bacterial infections and risk of dementia or cognitive decline: a systematic review [^112KQTeh]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our systematic review suggests that sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and cellulitis may be associated with an increased risk of dementia, after adjustment for multiple confounders. However, due to the paucity of longitudinal studies, further evidence from high quality studies is needed to confirm this association. Given that evidence on cognitive decline was limited by a lack of studies and small sample sizes, further large scale, well-powered studies are needed to investigate the effect of infections on cognitive decline. Infections are well-recognized to trigger delirium, as such, it is important for future work to distinguish whether the potential association between infections and cognitive decline is independent of delirium. Common bacterial infections frequently occur in the elderly, who are at an increased risk of dementia, and thus a better understanding of their role in dementia development could inform dementia risk reduction strategies.

American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely — initial "things that it recommends against" for older adults include percutaneous feeding tubes in individuals with advanced dementia; instead, it advised offering oral assisted feeding, antipsychotics as a first choice to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, medications to achieve a glycosylated hemoglobin level of less than 7.5% in most adults aged 65 and older because moderate control is generally better for this age group, benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics for older adults as a first choice for insomnia, agitation, or delirium, and antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present.

### Effect of inpatient antibiotic treatment among older adults with delirium found with a positive urinalysis: a health record review [^111UW7Au]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite these recommendations, treatment of suspected UTI based on positive urinalysis in confused older patients is a common practice even when localizing UTI symptoms or systemic signs such as fever are absent. Ideally, UTI and ASB should be diagnosed in the context of positive urine culture. However, given the multi-day delay to obtain urine culture results, urinalysis is often used in practice as a surrogate marker to make decisions for antibiotic treatment, despite its inherent limitations in specificity and sensitivity. Despite this common practice, whether such practice has any benefit in improving the rate of delirium resolution is unknown.

For this reason, we wished to gather data to enable design of future clinical trials as called for by the previous studies. We conducted a health record review of inpatient older adults with delirium and positive urinalysis. We sought to examine how many patients were treated with antibiotics among two subgroups: the group with infectious symptoms or signs beyond delirium and positive urinalysis (potential UTI, pneumonia, etc.), and the group with none (potential ASB). We then attempted to examine the association between antibiotic treatment and delirium resolution, and adverse outcomes, including mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Age, nursing home residence, and presentation of urinary tract infection in U.S. emergency departments, 2001–2008 [^111rzdke]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Current outpatient diagnostic algorithms for urinary tract infection (UTI) in older adults require the presence of classic signs and symptoms of UTI, such as fever and genitourinary symptoms. However, older adults with UTI may present with atypical signs and symptoms. The objective was to identify the associations of age and nursing home status with the clinical presentation of emergency department (ED) patients diagnosed with UTI.

Methods

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of the 2001–2008 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), ED component. Participants were adult ED patients diagnosed with UTI. Outcome variables were presence of fever, altered mental status, and urinary tract symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed for each outcome. Age and nursing home status were the independent variables of interest. Age was divided into adults 18 to 64years, older adults 65 to 84years, and oldest adults 85years of age and older.

Results

There were 25.4 million ED visits in which UTI was diagnosed from 2001 through 2008, including 5.0 million in older adults and 2.2 million in the oldest adults. Fever was present in 13% of adults, 21% of older adults, and 19% of the oldest adults. Altered mental status was present in 1% of adults, 7% of older adults, and 13% of the oldest adults. Urinary tract symptoms were identified in 32% of adults, 24% of older adults, and 17% of the oldest adults. In multivariable analysis, altered mental status was more common in older adults (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94) and in the oldest adults (OR = 2.49). Urinary tract symptoms were less common in older adults (OR = 0.60) and the oldest adults (OR = 0.48). Nursing home residence was associated with increased fever (OR = 1.63) and altered mental status (OR = 4.79) and with decreased urinary tract symptoms (OR = 0.35).

Conclusions

Fever and urinary tract symptoms are absent in a large proportion of adults over 65years of age diagnosed with UTI in the ED. Age over 65years and nursing home residence are associated with increased presence of altered mental status and with lack of urinary tract symptoms. Nursing home residence is also associated with increased presence of fever. Emergency physicians (EPs) continue to diagnose UTI in patients without classic symptoms. Diagnostic criteria for UTI among adults 65years and over specifically designed for use in the acute care setting should be developed and validated to prevent both inappropriate overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of UTI.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113taX1W]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

The effects of treatment of UTI and AB on their associations with delirium are of particular interest for further research, as clinicians are ultimately interested in whether treatment of UTI and AB can improve delirium. In this context, the impact of treatment of usually benign AB in those subgroups of older adults who due to varying factors are at higher risk of developing UTI and urosepsis also merits further closer study. The influence of individual types of organisms (including those associated with a higher incidence of drug resistance) remains open to further research as well.

### Delirium [^113a379C]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Delirium, a syndrome characterized by an acute change in attention, awareness and cognition, is caused by a medical condition that cannot be better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder. Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues. The effective implementation of delirium detection, treatment and prevention strategies remains a major challenge for health-care organizations globally.

Table 3
Factors predictive for increased risk of developing UTI after age of 86 years onwards by multivariate Cox regression analysis and Population Attributable Risk (PAR) of the occurrence of UTI (n = 479)

Variables in multivariate Cox regression model: gender, institutionalisation, education, severe cognitive impairment (MMSE < 19), disability in daily living, UTI between the ages of 85 and 86 years, stroke, unintentional loss of faeces, self-reported urine incontinence and medical diagnosis urine incontinence.

CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination; UTI = urinary tract infection

† Disability in daily living = unable to do any one of the nine basic activities of daily living independently, according to the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale.

In both women and men, a UTI between the ages of 85 and 86 years was predictive for developing UTI from age 86 onwards (in women HR 3.8 (95% CI 2.5, 5.6); P < 0.001 and in men HR 4.4 (95% CI 1.8, 10.8); P = 0.001). Further stratified analysis showed that severe cognitive impairment (MMSE < 19) was associated with a three times higher risk in developing UTI in women (HR 3.0 (95% CI 2.0, 4.5); P < 0.001), but not in men (HR 1.5 (95% CI 0.6, 3.9); P = 0.41). Moreover, stroke showed significantly higher risk for developing UTI in women (HR 2.0 (95% CI 1.2, 3.4); P = 0.005), but not in men (HR 1.6 (95% CI 0.6, 4.2); P = 0.346). Also higher risk was found for CRP > 5 mg/l in women (HR 1.5 (95% CI 1.0, 2.2); P = 0.049), but not in men (HR 0.8 (95% CI 0.4, 1.8); P = 0.633). Stratification for living situation (independently or long-term care facility) shows no differences in predictive factors for UTI (Table 4).

RESULTS

Figure 1 illustrates the study selection process, with 29 studies, being retained for a meta‐analysis of the associations between delirium and UTI, comprising 16,618 participants, with 26 studies, comparing participants with delirium (4842 individuals) to those without delirium (10,849 individuals), and 3 studies, comparing participants with UTI (266 individuals) to those without UTI (661 individuals) (for details on each study, see Table 1 and Table S1). A study by Gau and colleaguespresented data on the association between delirium and UTI as well as on the association between delirium and AB (192 participants in total: 50 individuals with AB and 142 non‐bacteriuric subjects) and this was the only study we could find that addressed this association: the OR with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for this association was calculated separately (for details see Table 1 and Table S2). Studies not included in the meta‐analysis after evaluation of the full text are listed in Table S3, with reasons for exclusion.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults with delirium or after falls — observational data and panel rationale emphasize limited benefit and potential harm from antimicrobials. In hospitalized cohorts with ASB and no focal urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms, 44 (66%) of 67 had confusion or delirium and 43 (64%) were treated with antimicrobials, and those with confusion had higher treatment rates (75% vs 43%; OR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.19–4.12]). In a prospective study, hospitalized patients aged ≥ 70 years were screened for delirium every 2 days; delirious patients treated for ASB had poorer functional outcome (adjusted OR, 3.45 [95% CI, 1.27–9.38]) and were more likely to develop CDI (OR, 2.45 [95% CI, .86–6.96]). Regarding falls, a nursing home review found 39 (48%) of 80 fallers had pyuria and bacteriuria and were diagnosed as UTI, whereas in a cohort of suspected UTI only 9 of 45 (20%) fall episodes had bacteriuria and pyuria, with the remaining 80% had no bacteriuria and pyuria; these studies suggest that most older residents who fall do not have ASB and falls should not immediately trigger suspicion for UTI. Current evidence does not suggest a causal relationship between bacteriuria and delirium or falls, and treatment of ASB in delirious patients has not been shown to have any beneficial impact on clinical outcomes (all low or very low certainty). There is high certainty that antimicrobials cause harm, including probable increases in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including CDI) and antimicrobial resistance. In patients who fall and have fever or hemodynamic instability, careful evaluation to identify a site of infection is warranted.

### Infectious disease risk in the elderly [^117AevwZ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Older persons suffer excessively from infectious diseases such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. This article discusses some of the reasons for this additional morbidity and mortality, including the anatomical and physiological changes with aging, impairment of immune function, presence of co-morbid diseases, and delays in diagnosis and initiation of therapy.

### Effect of inpatient antibiotic treatment among older adults with delirium found with a positive urinalysis: a health record review [^116bJZ1g]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Among older adults with delirium and positive urinalysis, antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection is common practice, but unsupported by literature or guidelines. We sought to: i) determine the rate of antibiotic treatment and the proportion of asymptomatic patients (other than delirium) in this patient population, and ii) examine the effect of antibiotic treatment on delirium resolution and adverse outcomes.

Methods

A health record review was conducted at a tertiary academic centre from January to December 2020. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 65, positive delirium screening assessment, positive urinalysis, and admission to general medical units. Outcomes included rates of antibiotic treatment, delirium on day 7 of admission, and 30-day adverse outcomes. We compared delirium and adverse outcome rates in antibiotic-treated vs. non-treated groups. We conducted subgroup analyses among asymptomatic patients.

Results

We included 150 patients (57% female, mean age 85.4years). Antibiotics were given to 86%. The asymptomatic subgroup (delirium without urinary symptoms or fever) comprised 38% and antibiotic treatment rate in this subgroup was 68%. There was no significant difference in delirium rate on day 7 between antibiotic-treated vs. non-treated groups, (entire cohort RR 0.94 [0.41–2.16] and asymptomatic subgroup RR 0.69 [0.22–2.15]) or in 30-day adverse outcomes.

Conclusions

Older adults with delirium and positive urinalysis in general medical inpatient units were frequently treated with antibiotics - often despite the absence of urinary or other infectious symptoms. We failed to find evidence that antibiotic treatment in this population is associated with delirium resolution on day 7 of admission.

### Management of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections in the older adult [^112HusbM]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Are long-lasting nonspecific symptoms related to vitamin D deficiency among older adults living in nursing homes? [^117Khp92]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As the population ages, the healthcare needs of older adults have become an increasingly important focus. Older individuals often present with atypical or nonspecific symptoms when experiencing common health issues, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. This is particularly true in older adults living in nursing homes, where frailty, comorbidities, and cognitive decline are prevalent. Nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion or fatigue, may obscure the underlying cause of illness, leading to potential misdiagnosis.

Furthermore, the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance has prompted a critical review of how antibiotics are used, particularly in the care of older adults in nursing homes. As such, there is a growing need to understand and explore other potential explanations for these nonspecific symptoms in this vulnerable population.

Confusion, restlessness, and fatigue are common nonspecific symptoms among older adults living in nursing homes and, in the absence of new symptoms from the urinary tract, often misinterpreted as urinary tract infections (UTIs), leading to unnecessary antibiotic treatment. This practice increases the risk of selecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. UTIs are more prevalent among women in nursing homes. According to international consensus, even in older residents in nursing homes, symptoms from the lower urinary tract should be present to diagnose acute cystitis. Despite this, few patients treated for suspected UTIs in nursing homes actually exhibit lower urinary tract symptoms. The diagnosis is instead based on nonspecific symptoms, which are not specific to the urinary tract, such as confusion, restlessness, fatigue, agitation, reduced appetite, tendency to fall, or a sense of not being oneself. Given the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria it is important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Therefore, it is important to investigate alternative explanations for these nonspecific symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency is common among older adults living in nursing homes and is associated with risk of falls. It has also been linked to impaired cognitive functions and dementia. Impaired cognitive function can manifest as nonspecific symptoms, highlighting the importance of investigating whether there is an association between these symptoms, often misinterpreted as UTIs, and vitamin D deficiency.

The aim of this study was to determine if nonspecific symptoms among older adults living in nursing homes are associated with vitamin D deficiency.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^111T3aVF]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of the evidence

Following this review, it is evident that all of the studies which have explored the association between suspected UTI and confusion are methodologically flawed, due to poor case definition for UTI or confusion, or inadequate control of confounding factors introducing significant bias. Subsequently, no accurate conclusions about the association between UTI and confusion can be drawn. One study of acceptable quality shows an association between confusion and bacteriuria. However, this sample of patients in whom they tested bacteriuria and pyuria were patients already suspected of having a UTI, introducing a bias into their calculation. In summary, none of the 22 publications had sufficient methodological quality to enable valid conclusions.

Frailty

Frail residents are more likely to have bacteriuria. Frailty also predisposes for cognitive decline. Hence, there might be an indirect link between confusion and bacteriuria, easily misinterpreted as UTI causing confusion. This might explain some of the trends found in the existing literature.

Confusion linked to acute cystitis or pyelonephritis

Studies including hospitalised patients are likely to also include patients with pyelonephritis, a condition likely to result in confusion in a fragile elderly person. However, the typical nursing home situation usually involves the suspicion of confusion caused by a lower UTI (acute cystitis) in an afebrile patient.

The primary aim of this review was not to evaluate the association between pyelonephritis and confusion. The primary question was if lower UTI with no fever in residents without a urinary catheter, with or without localised symptoms such as acute dysuria, urgency or frequency, is associated with confusion. This review concludes that current evidence does not provide a clear answer to this question.

Strengths and limitations of the review

The strengths of this review are mainly due to its methodological quality; that it utilised a broad search strategy, with no limits to age or date applied. This allowed for studies that were representative of an elderly population and without the explicit aim of reporting the relationship between confusion and UTI to be identified. Another strength of this review was the registration of a protocol with pre-specified objectives and methods. The use of a second reviewer independently assessing the quality of selected studies also increases the quality of the review. Limitations included limiting articles to English and being unable to assess the eligibility of the unobtainable full-texts. This review also did not attempt to include studies from the unpublished literature, introducing possible publication bias.

### "Urinary tract infection"-requiem for a heavyweight [^111XDEJp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

"Urinary tract infection" ("UTI") is an ambiguous, expansive, overused diagnosis that can lead to marked, harmful antibiotic overtreatment. "Significant bacteriuria", central to most definitions of "UTI", has little significance in identifying individuals who will benefit from treatment. "Urinary symptoms" are similarly uninformative. Neither criterion is well defined. Bacteriuria and symptoms remit and recur spontaneously. Treatment is standard for acute uncomplicated cystitis and common for asymptomatic bacteriuria, but definite benefits are few. Treatment for "UTI" in older adults with delirium and bacteriuria is widespread but no evidence supports the practice, and expert opinion opposes it. Sensitive diagnostic tests now demonstrate that healthy urinary tracts host a ubiquitous, complex microbial community. Recognition of this microbiome, largely undetectable using standard agar-based cultures, offers a new perspective on "UTI". Everyone is bacteriuric. From this perspective, most people who are treated for a "UTI" would probably be better off without treatment. Elderly adults, little studied in this regard, face particular risk. Invasive bacterial diseases such as pyelonephritis and bacteremic bacteriuria are also "UTIs". Mindful decisions about antibiotic use will require a far better understanding of how pathogenicity arises within microbial communities. It is likely that public education and meaningful informed-consent discussions about antibiotic treatment of bacteriuria, emphasizing potential harms and uncertain benefits, would reduce overtreatment. Emphasizing the microbiome's significance and using the term "urinary tract dysbiosis" instead of "UTI" might also help and might encourage mindful study of the relationships among host, aging, microbiome, disease, and antibiotic treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115Siep9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Older adults with bacteriuria — rationale and evidence on delirium, mental status change, and treatment: The guideline states there is no benefit and high-quality evidence of harm from treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, noting in the elderly that antibiotic treatment likely does not reduce death (relative difference, 13 per 1000 [95% CI, –25 to 85]) or sepsis (RD, 100 fewer per 1000 [95% CI, –260 to 60]). Observational data report higher postoperative bacteriuria in those delirious (8 of 36 [22%]) versus nondelirious (7 of 106 [6.5%]), while a larger cohort found change in mental status associated with bacteriuria plus pyuria in patients treated for UTI (odds ratio [OR], 1.38 [95% CI, 1.03–1.74]). Another cohort found no difference in bacteriuria prevalence with nonspecific symptoms including confusion (31% of 85) versus without such symptoms (32% of 336; p = 0.74). In a randomized trial of older residents with asymptomatic bacteriuria, participants were randomized to norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily or placebo for 7 days (29 per group), and behavioral scores were higher in the treatment group but not statistically different at any time, worsening in both groups (1.18 to 1.91 with norfloxacin and 1.57 to 1.66 with placebo).

### Are antibiotics helpful for older adults with delirium and pyuria or bacteriuria? [^112eAry9]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics for Delirium and Pyuria or BacteriuriaDelirium is common among hospitalized older adults, frequently leading to initiation of antibiotics when pyuria or bacteriuria is detected. However, it is difficult to determine if pyuria or bacteriuria is the cause of delirium or incidentally identified. This article proposes a trial to assess if treatment with antibiotics hastens delirium resolution.

### Development and validation of a screening tool for early identification of bloodstream infection in older patients-a retrospective case-control study [^111EHWT7]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

While older patients are at increased risk of infection, typical manifestations of infection in the elderly are more subtle, or nonexistent. Although fever is a principal sign of infection in other patients populations, it may be absent or diminished in 20–30% of older patients with severe infections. Diagnosing infection in the elderly may be complicated by a non-specific clinical presentation (e.g. falls, altered mental status, delirium, anorexia, loss of urinary or fecal continence, and weakness) which may mimic non-infectious syndromes. Consequently, a delay in diagnosis of bacteremia in geriatric patients occurs in more than 20% of cases, with misdiagnosis in 35%. Therefore, improvement in the early identification and treatment of bacteremia in aging patients is needed.

Bloodstream infections (BSI) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly population; with case-fatality rates ranging from 40 to 60%. Therefore, healthcare practitioners must improve their clinical suspicion for BSI in their elderly patients so that they can appropriately draw blood cultures and begin early empiric antibiotic treatment.

Our objective was to develop and validate a clinically useful screening tool to identify older patients with a high probability of having a BSI to improve early diagnosis and management of these patients.

### Challenges in assessing nursing home residents with advanced dementia for suspected urinary tract infections [^113sSJ7m]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the presentation of suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) in nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia and how they align with minimum criteria to justify antimicrobial initiation.

Design

Twelve-month prospective study.

Setting

Twenty-five NHs.

Participants

Two hundred sixty-six NH residents with advanced dementia.

Measurements

Charts were abstracted monthly for documentation of suspected UTI episodes to determine whether episodes met minimum criteria to initiate antimicrobial therapy according to consensus guidelines.

Results

Seventy-two residents experienced 131 suspected UTI episodes. Presenting symptoms and signs for these episodes are mental status change (44.3%), fever (20.6%), hematuria (6.9%), dysuria (3.8%), costovertebral tenderness (2.3%), urinary frequency (1.5%), rigor (1.5%), urgency (0%), and suprapubic pain (0%). Only 21 (16.0%) episodes met minimal criteria to initiate antimicrobial therapy based on signs and symptoms. Of the 110 episodes that lacked minimum criteria to justify antimicrobial initiation, 82 (74.5%) were treated with antimicrobial therapy. Urinalyses and urine culture results were available for 101 episodes, of which 80 (79.2%) had positive results on both tests. The proportion of episodes with a positive urinalysis and culture was similar for those that met (83.3%) and did not meet (78.3%) minimum criteria (P = 0.06).

Conclusion

The symptoms and signs necessary to meet minimum criteria to support antimicrobial initiation for UTIs are frequently absent in NH residents with advanced dementia. Antimicrobial therapy is prescribed for the majority of suspected UTIs that do not meet these minimum criteria. Urine specimens are frequently positive regardless of symptoms. These observations underscore the need to reconsider the diagnosis and the initiation of treatment for suspected UTIs in advanced dementia.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^116AYAwx]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is common in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and was shown to account for 22% of all infections and more than 50% of the antibiotic prescriptions in this setting. However, in institutionalized older adults, UTI is difficult to differentiate from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). ABU prevalence rates in LTCFs are high, ranging from 25 to 50% in women and from 15 to 40% in men. Such high ABU prevalence rates obviously compromise the value of a positive urine culture as a diagnostic criterion for UTI. In addition, assessing symptoms of a UTI is challenging in this population. Institutionalized older adults, especially those with mental impairment or chronic symptoms, are often incapable of recognizing or communicating the presence of symptoms. Moreover, this geriatric population frequently exhibits atypical manifestations of acute disease and presents with nonspecific symptoms. As UTI can cause severe infections, practitioners are prone to diagnose a UTI relying solely on vague symptoms such as changes in behavior or changes in the appearance of urine rather than typical symptoms of a UTI such as dysuria, frequency or urgency. Residents of LTCFs thus frequently receive antibiotics due to a suspected infection, resulting in a significant overuse of antimicrobials. Treatment of ABU in this population is however not recommended because of potential adverse effects and a lack of efficacy in preventing subsequent UTIs. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that ABU protects against infection.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^111MeC7x]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

As in previous studies, older patients required hospital admission more frequently with longer length of hospitalization. Also, older patients had an in-hospital mortality rate of 4.3%, which was higher compared to non-older patients but significantly lower than the rates reported in previous studies in geriatric patients with UTI with rates that ranged from 8.9 to 33%. Severe sepsis and septic shock are the risk factors that most robustly have been associated with increased mortality in patients with FUTI. Despite several studies have found age to increase mortality in patients with sepsis, others point out that preexisting medical conditions, including chronic kidney failure, could play a more prominent role.

The present study has some potential limitations that have to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the study had a retrospective component and was performed in a single hospital. Secondly, we did not evaluate certain clinical data that would have been worth analysing in older male patients with FUTI including the functional status, the presence of urinary incontinence, altered mental status or delirium. Thirdly, we excluded from the analysis FUTI episodes with negative or polymicrobial urine culture which might have induced a selection bias. Finally, the data collection was limited to the hospitalization period which might have underestimated the outcomes.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^115QNZYr]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use, but risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

Exposures

One or more antibiotic dose for treatment of ASB.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

Results

Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%); median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18), dementia (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15–2.13), acutely altered mental status (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.23–3.04), urinary incontinence (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.36–2.41), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10 000/μL) (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21–2.00), positive urinalysis (presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrite, or > 5 white blood cells per high-power field) (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.05–3.93), and urine culture with a bacterial colony count greater than 100 000 colony-forming units per high-power field (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.83–2.91). Treatment of ASB was associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing (4 vs 3 days; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.28–1.47). No other differences in secondary outcomes were identified after propensity weighting.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hospitalized patients with ASB commonly receive inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic treatment did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes; rather, treatment may be associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing. To possibly reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, stewardship efforts should focus on improving urine testing practices and management strategies for elderly patients with altered mental status.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^1141TowA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — pretest probability and UTI ordering context — Pretest estimates of disease are based on the incidence of disease in specific populations and how risk factors or symptoms modify probability, and this estimation is challenging in patients with nonspecific symptoms. In elderly patients, urine cultures are often ordered for nonspecific symptoms such as failure to thrive or fatigue, and the incidence of urinary tract infections in elderly women is higher than the general population as is the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PzTQ5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite extensive searching, we were unable to assess meta‐analytically the association between delirium and AB in older adults: our results were limited to only one suitable study, which showed no statistically significant association between the two conditions.

Our results should be seen within the context of some limitations. First, we tried to include unpublished research data by contacting experts in the field, but were ultimately unable to obtain any unpublished data. Second, there were a group of studies whose results could potentially be used in our meta‐analysis if the necessary quantitative data were reported in publications, but we were only able to obtain these data from a few authors. Third, we were unable to find any study in which both conditions (UTI or AB and delirium) were defined according to the highest diagnostic standards: in all publications one of the conditions was identified based on a record in the medical files. Fourth, the limited data available on the association between delirium and AB in the older adults should also be taken into account. All of the above suggests that our evidence is of moderate quality and further research is needed to investigate both the associations and the factors affecting them.

Some limitations are also related to the results of the meta‐regression analysis. First, these results are mostly based on subsets of studies. Second, the influence of a number of somatic conditions on the association between delirium and UTI could not be properly assessed, as the individual studies did not report subtypes of the respective conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, type I or II) that were important for understanding such an effect. Third, we were only able to assess the effect of a small group of medications on the association we examined because many of the included studies did not report data on the medications taken by participants.

Our findings have important clinical and medical implications. Clinicians should be aware, of the importance of assessing UTI symptoms in older adults with delirium, and of the possible presence of delirium in older adults referred for treatment of UTI. Due to the lack of relevant data, no reliable conclusions can be drawn about the association between delirium and AB in older adults from our study, which points to the need for high‐quality prospective research addressing this association.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^114zvLqY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lessons and Limitations

The strategies implemented were simple, straightforward, cost effective, easily achievable, and can be implemented in any setting, be it a district or teaching hospital. This study has demonstrated an overall improvement of the various aspects of UTI management. This was likely due to a combination of increased medical and nursing staff awareness and increased availability of specialised equipment detailed above. However, despite a small improvement, the number of patients fulfilling SIGN criteria for a diagnosis of UTI remained low. Small sample sizes and consequent reduction in power meant we were unable to demonstrate statistical significance for any of these improvements.

The low number of patients fulfilling SIGN criteria for a diagnosis of UTI presents problems in interpreting the effects of our measures on other outcomes, such as the increased number of urine cultures sent. Since the SIGN guidance requires that urine cultures be sent only after a certain number of symptoms and signs have been demonstrated, it could be argued that increases in urine culture rates without similar increases in the number of diagnoses concurring with SIGN guidelines do not represent an improvement in management.

Due to the complex presentation of some of the elderly patients with altered mental state, it was challenging for clinicians to obtain a comprehensive history to diagnose a UTI. This posed a similar challenge for our nursing colleagues when attempting to obtain urine samples from this group of patients. For future purposes, the proforma could be improved by including patients' mental or behavioural state on admission. Data could then be analysed for any effect of patient's mental state on the management of their illness.

There will be difficulties in sustaining improvements in practice. The high turnover of medical trainees means many of the educational actions will have to be repeated. There is ongoing work to include a summarised version of the guidelines into the induction pack of both doctors and nurses.

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^117Mroqz]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in the very elderly and account for nearly 25% of all infections. The incidence of UTI increases with age in both men and women, and increases from 12 to 29 per 100 person-years at risk in community-dwelling elderly populations to 44 to 58 per 100 residents per year at risk in long term care facilities. These UTI are often complicated, involving the presence of structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Especially in vulnerable older persons living in long term care facilities, UTIs more often have serious consequences such as delirium, dehydration, urosepsis, hospitalisation, or even death.

Several strategies to prevent UTI have been developed, such as treatment of those at high risk with low-dose, long-term antibiotics, oestrogens and cranberry products. These strategies have been shown to be effective in preventing UTI in younger women with recurrent UTI, but not yet in vulnerable older people. Preventive strategies are best applied to those at risk; however, factors associated with UTI in ambulatory older patients in the community setting have not been described.

Previous studies have shown that increasing age, diabetes mellitus, stroke, urine incontinence, prior history of UTI, urogenital surgery, and impaired functional and cognitive status predict the development of UTI among older individuals. However, these studies investigated predictors of UTI in specific patient groups, such as hospitalised patients and patients residing in long-term care facilities and did not include older individuals in the general population. In addition, these studies used different methods to identify UTI. It is generally accepted that diagnosing symptomatic UTI in older persons is complicated due to factors like difficult doctor-patient communication, chronical genito-urinary symptoms, and a high frequency of positive urine cultures due to bacteriuria without complaints.

To target preventive strategies against UTIs in older individuals, those with highest risk to develop UTI have to be identified. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and predictive factors of UTI among the oldest old in the general population.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^1162GUVS]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

The quality of the studies included in this review varied considerably (Fig. 2). This is partially due to inclusion of all studies that reported data on the rate of confusion in patients with suspected UTI or bacteriuria, or vice versa, even if it was not the main objective of the study. Reporting of main outcomes, description of patient characteristics and number of non-responders/patients lost to follow up were done well in most studies, with only one small study not clearly describing their main outcomes and four studies not reporting the number of non-responders or patients lost to follow up. In terms of internal validity, all applicable studies were deemed to have used appropriate statistical tests; however, half of the studies did not clearly describe other principle confounders in their comparison groups. The external validity, however, of all studies, was generally very high.

Fig. 2
Quality Assessment

The quality of the criteria used to define UTI, bacteriuria and confusion varied considerably and was generally quite poor. No studies used criteria for UTI completely consistent with the revised Mcgeer or Loeb Criteria. Two studies employed a reproducible definition of UTI although neither employed published explicit criteria developed through expert consensus. Many studies utilised discharge coding from patient databases which resulted in the reliability of their criteria being unable to be determined. Two studies were identified that used criteria that were clearly inappropriate. Three studies did not provide a definition for UTI, as they reported confusion in association with validated criteria for bacteriuria only. Only one of these studies utilised an appropriate definition of bacteriuria and validated criteria for delirium. Three of the studies which provided a definition for UTI also defined criteria for bacteriuria.

Almost all studies provided a definition of confusion criteria, but only eight studies used criteria that were valid and reliable (Table 3). Five studies used criteria for confusion which were clearly not valid or reliable, and nine were unclear in their criteria used (Table 4).

### Effect of inpatient antibiotic treatment among older adults with delirium found with a positive urinalysis: a health record review [^111KKK6d]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a common finding in older adults, representing 10% of emergency department (ED) visits and occurs in 29–64% among those hospitalized. In such older adults with new or worsening confusion, urinary tract infection (UTI) is often sought and treated with antibiotics, even in the absence of localizing genitourinary symptoms or signs. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is also common in older adults, with a prevalence as high as 25–50%. Delirium and ASB are both more common among older adults with baseline cognitive impairment. Studies have shown little benefit with antibiotic treatment of ASB in patients without delirium, while reiterating its harms. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of literature to guide clinicians managing older adults with delirium and positive urinalysis but without other findings pointing to UTI, especially in inpatient settings. Systematic reviews have found that studies investigating the relationship between UTI/ASB and delirium were methodologically flawed, and the causal relationship between these condition remains elusive. Many studies included in these systematic reviews had no specific definition of UTI other than as noted in the medical records, or included delirium as part of the definition. On the other hand, non-specific symptoms such as altered mental status, lethargy or malaise did not appear to increase the probability of bacterial infection in one study. Recent guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America and the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease of Canada recommend assessment for causes other than UTI in cognitively or functionally impaired older patients with bacteriuria and delirium.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DVWyk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the associations of delirium with urinary tract infection (UTI) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in individuals aged 65 and older.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was published on PROSPERO (CRD42020164341). Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies, professional associations and experts in the field were additionally contacted. Studies with control groups reporting associations between delirium and UTI as well as delirium and AB in older adults were included. The random effects model meta-analysis was conducted using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as effect size measures. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to rate the studies' quality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I 2 tests. The effects of potential moderators were investigated by both subgroup and meta-regression analyses. The risk of publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot and Egger's test.

Results

Twenty nine relevant studies (16,618 participants) examining the association between delirium and UTI in older adults were identified. The association between delirium and UTI was found to be significant (OR 2.67; 95% CI 2.12–3.36; p < 0.001) and persisted regardless of potential confounders. The association between delirium and AB in older adults in the only eligible study found (192 participants) was insignificant (OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.57–4.65; p = 0.37). All included studies were of moderate quality.

Conclusion

The results of this study support the association between delirium and UTI in older adults. Insufficient evidence was found to conclude on an association between delirium and AB in this age group. These findings are limited due to the moderate quality of the included studies and a lack of available research on the association between delirium and AB. Future studies should use the highest quality approaches for defining both delirium and UTI and consider AB in their investigations.

### In-hospital mortality associated with the misdiagnosis or unidentified site of infection at admission [^111fH3yM]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study found that, among the four major sites of infection, patients with urinary tract and soft-tissue infections were at high risk of misdiagnosis or unidentified site of infection. Patients with infection at rare sites (i.e. not at any of the four major sites of infection) also had a higher risk of misdiagnosis or unidentified site of infection. From a clinical perspective, it is somewhat reasonable that mortality is correlated with the site of infection. However, both the GEE and PSM models, adjusting for the site of infection and severity, demonstrated that initial misdiagnosis or unidentified site of infection was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Misdiagnosis or unidentified site of infection play critical roles.

A previous study of intra-abdominal infections reported that misdiagnosis resulted in inadequate or delayed source control. Other studies have shown that an inappropriate choice of antibiotic therapy, due to inappropriate diagnosis, has been related to poor outcomes. In addition, a retrospective cohort study at an academic hospital reported that vague symptoms, which were not specific to infection, were associated with delayed antibiotic administration and a higher risk of mortality. As there were more patients with an altered mental status (lower GCS) in the misdiagnosis group than in the correct diagnosis group in this study, we hypothesized that an altered mental status might play a role in reportedly vague symptoms that consequent delayed the provision of appropriate care. Nonetheless, the appropriate administration of optimal antibiotic regimens is likely to play an important role in the observed favorable outcomes. Moreover, when we compared matched and unmatched for the PS model, GCS and the site of infection at the final diagnosis seemed to play a role for adjustment. Although these were confounders, they could also be indicators considered as the propensity of misdiagnosis or unidentification of the infection site.

### Intestinal microbiology and urinary tract infection associated risk in long-term aged care residents [^116fSkF2]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are amongst the most common bacterial infections treated in hospital and community settingsand a major contributor to antibiotic prescribing. UTIs occur when bacteria, most commonly uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), proliferate in the urinary tract. If left untreated, UTIs can lead to pyelonephritis and urosepsis, which can be life-threatening. Up to 30% of sepsis cases originate from the urinary tract, with an estimated mortality ranging from 20% to 40% –.

UTIs are a considerable concern among elderly individuals. The incidence of UTIs increases with age and represents the third leading cause of infection-related hospitalisations. Moreover, older hospitalized patients (> 85 years) have a higher risk of developing uroseptic shock than younger patients (< 65 years), which is associated with longer hospital stays and higher mortality. UTIs represent a significant proportion of acquired infections in aged care residents, comprising over one-third of total cases. High rates of cognitive decline, frailty, and medical comorbidities among this population not only increases the risk of UTI complications but also poses challenges for clinical assessment. Consequently, empirical antibiotic therapy is often used even in the absence of confirmatory pathology or clear clinical symptoms.

The lower intestinal tract serves as a reservoir for UPEC and other UTI-causing bacteria, including other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and some Enterococcus species. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in controlling the colonization and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the gut, particularly through the suppression of their growth by commensal anaerobic taxa –. Recent studies have explored this role of gut microbiome in the development of UTIs. Magruder and colleagues identified gut uropathogen abundance as an independent risk factor for the development of bacteriuria and UTI in kidney transplant recipients. Additionally, Worby and colleagues found that lower microbial richness and a reduced prevalence of butyrate-producing bacteria were significantly associated with recurrent UTI in younger women. However, how the microbiome influences the risk of UTI in elderly individuals, a population at high risk of both UTI and its severe complications, remains unexplored.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fP9as]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Identification and selection of studies, data extraction, assessment of study quality

These steps were performed blindly by D.K. and R.K. and are described in detail in Text S1. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale(see Text S2 with the scale content and Table S4 with the detailed results of each study assessment).

Statistical analysis

ORs were extracted when they were available or calculated from the available data. We used random‐effects model in our meta‐analysis. First, we performed a meta‐analysis of ORs across all studies addressing the association between delirium and UTI in older adults. Next, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by (1) removing the study with the highest relative weight and (2) removing the one clear outlier with the highest effect size. Then we conducted a subgroup meta‐analyses of the studies (1) in which participants with delirium were compared with non‐delirium controls, (2) in which participants with UTI were compared with non‐UTI controls, (3) with a diagnosis of delirium based on DSM or ICD criteria, (4) with a diagnosis of UTI based on microbiological urine tests, (5) conducted in the clinical setting, (6) conducted in nursing homes, (7) of population‐based samples.

Additionally, we performed meta‐regression analyses including year of study publication, study country, type, temporality and setting, delirium and UTI assessment method, rating on the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale, age of study participants, their gender distribution and residence status, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and received medications as regressors (for a complete list of all regressors, see Table S5).

We used Cochran's Q test and I² values to assess the heterogeneity of effect sizes. We used funnel plot as well as Egger's regression asymmetry testto assess the presence of the publication bias. We used Duval and Tweedie's "trim and fill" method to examine the effect of the missing results caused by publication bias, if it was detected. With this method, a pooled effect size is recalculated by including the hypothetical missing studies as if they actually existed to augment the observed data so that the funnel plot is more symmetrical.

In the only study found addressing the association between delirium and AB in older adults, the OR was calculated separately.

Analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta‐Analysis Version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ 2013).

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111b9CJm]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Life expectancy is increasing and the population of older people is growing: people over 65 years constitute one sixth of the population, but account for one in three outpatient attendances. Moreover, the older population is at increased risk of bacterial infections, which can cause significant morbidity, mortality and further exacerbate hospital attendance. Of the bacterial infections, urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest in older adults. If not treated promptly, sepsis may ensue. Each year in the UK there are 150,000 cases of sepsis in the population, causing 44,000 deaths.UTI is the commonest cause of sepsis in older adults, with urinary sepsis causing an in-hospital mortality of 33% in this age group. In the United States (US), sepsis is the tenth leading cause of death in patients over 65.

UTI is the leading cause of emergency hospital admissions for acute conditions that could effectively be managed in the community. Over 65 s account for three times as many admissions to hospital for UTI compared to younger adults.6 The cost of hospitalizations is significant; in the UK, hospitalisations for UTI cost £316 million per annum respectively. Adults in the US aged 65–84 years account for over a quarter of hospital stays, and compared to other age groups have the highest average cost per stay at $12,300. Preventing hospital admission for UTI requires early recognition and treatment. However, UTI in older adults often presents atypically, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. A study of older adults in primary care found that UTI was the second most common infection initially missed by clinicians, with many of the reasons for not making the diagnosis at the earliest possible opportunity related to problems with history taking. Symptoms and signs typically associated with infection in younger patients, such as fever, might be absent in older people. Of note, however, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in older adults and should not be treated with antimicrobials.

### Prostatic abscess: an unusual cause of delirium associated with lower urinary tract symptoms [^116GPAdz]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Our case describes an 80-year-old gentleman who presented with delirium and lower urinary tract symptoms. Initially treated for a urinary tract infection, he became more unwell with features of physiological decompensation secondary to sepsis. A computerized tomography scan was performed in light of the findings of suprapubic tenderness, which on examination revealed a prostatic abscess. On discussion with urology and microbiology colleagues a plan for antibiotics was constructed and the gentleman recovered without the need for invasive interventions. Our case goes on to discuss the merits of imaging for the elderly care physician when the diagnosis is not clear or when the clinical picture is of deterioration despite optimal medical care.

### Overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: identifying targets for improvement [^112BDTaY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to antimicrobial overuse in hospitalized patients. Indications for urine culture, treatment, and targets for improvement were evaluated in 153 patients. Drivers of antimicrobial overuse included fever with an alternative source, altered mental status, and leukocytosis, which led 435 excess days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^113B3mZi]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

UTI is often overdiagnosed and overtreated in the elderly population. Studies have suggested that UTI is misdiagnosed in 40% of hospitalised elderly patients. Clinicians often misdiagnose UTI in the elderly who present with non-specific symptoms such as anorexia, fatigue, malaise, or generalised weakness. Antibiotic therapies are commenced in this group of patients without sufficient evidence supporting a diagnosis of UTI. Therefore, it is unsurprising that UTI rates as the second most common reason for empirical antibiotic therapy in secondary care. While the SIGN guidance for the management of suspected bacterial UTI in adults recommends that urine cultures are appropriate in certain cases (where symptoms are resistant to trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, UTI in men and pregnant women), their algorithm for the treatment of UTI in the elderly recommends the collection and analysis of urine samples in all cases, once a diagnosis of UTI has been made based on symptoms and signs. Antimicrobials should then be tailored in light of sensitivities, switching to narrow spectrum if possible. In view of increasing Clostridium difficile infection and antibiotic resistance, it is imperative that changes are made to the management of UTIs in the elderly population.

### CT of acute abdomen in the elderly [^1157E3m4]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The drawbacks of anamnesis, clinical examination and biological tests

The clinical identification of the cause of acute abdominal pain is particularly challenging in the elderly. The findings of a survey conducted among practicing ED physicians revealed that 78% of the respondents found managing abdominal pain in the elderly more difficult than in younger patients. The preliminary diagnosis at the emergency department was less reliable and hospital mortality was higher in the elderly than in younger patients. Several reasons account for these difficulties including the limited predictive values of simple biological tests in the elderly and clinical pitfalls related to patient's history and clinical examination.

Factors linked to patient's history include altered mentation due to fever or electrolyte abnormalities, cognitive impairment, decreased mentation from drugs (e.g. opiates, benzodiazepines), dementia, hearing difficulties, intoxication, language barriers, and psychiatric disorders. Clinical assessment may be impaired by such factors as the absence of fever despite a serious bacterial infection or surgical condition, altered pain perception due to chronic pain medications, coexistent chronic disease(s), lack of hyperthermic response despite a significant intra-abdominal process, a lower likelihood of localized tenderness despite a focal surgical condition, reduced rebound and guarding from decreased abdominal wall musculature, suppressed tachycardia caused by medications or intrinsic cardiac disease. In the end, the physical examination cannot reliably predict or exclude significant disease.

Concerning biological exams, white blood cells may not be elevated in sepsis or in severe surgical conditions. Liver function tests may be misleading. They are often normal in older adults with cholecystitis, and their elevation does not necessarily indicate acute hepatobiliary disease. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is very common in the elderly and affects women more than men; the incidence is nearly 100% in older institutionalized adults with chronic indwelling Foley catheters. Therefore, although it constitutes the most common cause of abdominal infection in the elderly, acute abdominal pain associated with bacteriuria should not be systematically attributed to urinary tract infection.

These limitations explain why the knowledge of the clinico-biological context does not necessarily improve the radiologist's performance in interpreting a CT scan for acute abdomen in elderly patients. In addition, cognitive impairment, blunted inflammatory response, transportation or financial issues, anxiety, depression, or the fear of losing independence account for the important delays in seeking care among elderly people presenting to the ED.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158Sa37]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

There was also statistically significant publication bias in both the main meta‐analysis and most subgroup meta‐analyses. However, the publication bias was insignificant in the sensitivity analysis with the removal of the study with the highest relative weight as well as in two small subgroup meta‐analyses involving three studies in which participants with UTI were compared with non‐UTI controls and three studies conducted in nursing homes. Where publication bias was observed, we attempted to correct the results obtained using Duval and Tweedie's "trim and fill" method, which identified potentially missing studies to add predominantly to the left side of the funnel plots to ensure symmetry. Adjusted ORs were slightly attenuated but remained significant (for details see Figures S1–S17).

Cross‐sectional data are insufficient to identify causality in the association between delirium and UTI. The vast majority of the included longitudinal studies lack data on urine examination findings at baseline. However, in two studies, where such data are available, the number of individuals with and without delirium is pooled for the entire follow‐up period. Thus, we cannot show whether one condition temporarily precedes another, thus contributing to its emergence.

In the absence of a clear signal from longitudinal studies, several possibilities arise: (1) UTI or related factors may increase the risk of developing delirium; (2) delirium may increase the risk of developing UTI; (3) delirium and UTI share some biological risk factors. Regarding the first possibility, there is convincing evidence that inflammation, which is part of the infectious process, itself increases the risk of delirium. As for the second hypothesis, we were unable to assess comprehensively the effect of delirium subtypes, its symptoms severity, or frequency on the association between delirium and UTI, because of the paucity of data. However, the administration of drugs with anticholinergic side effects, as well as benzodiazepines, which are known to increase the risk of delirium, had a statistically significant effect on the association between delirium and UTI. It also seems reasonable that the inability of patients with delirium to maintain proper personal hygiene may increase the risk of UTI and complicate its treatment. This point represents an area for future research. The third hypothesis of shared biological dysfunction in delirium and UTI reflects the idea that many conditions traditionally thought to be nervous system disorders also involve changes in other physiological systems, including the immune system.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115B8tWu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment — when delirium or a fall occurs without local genitourinary or systemic signs of infection, evaluate other causes and observe rather than treat bacteriuria. In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In similar patients who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). This recommendation places a high value on avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as Clostridioides difficile infection, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects. For the bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^115o6xox]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In older populations, UTIs account for nearly 25% of all infections. As UTIs are associated with serious negative outcomes, it is important to consider preventive strategies for UTI in older individuals. Our study showed four important predictors for UTI: severe cognitive impairment, disability in ADL, history of UTI between the ages of 85 and 86 years, and self-reported urine incontinence. Remarkably, none of these predictors appear to be modifiable. However, these predictors could still be used in the development of a clinical prediction rule to select for whom apply preventive strategies. Prophylaxis with low-dose, long-term antibiotics, estrogens and cranberry products are potential strategies to prevent UTI, but so far none of these strategies have been proven to prevent UTI in the very old. Selection of high risk oldest old is a crucial first step in successful prevention of UTI. Before these preventive strategies may be introduced in the oldest old, their effects and side effects have to be studied in randomised intervention studies.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^114drgDM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults — "Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present". ASB prevalence increases with age: in community women age 65 to 90 it ranges from 6% to 16%, is highest in women age 90 and older at 22% to 43%, and in community men age 65 and older it ranges from 5% to 21%, with the highest prevalence in those age 90 and older; in institutionalized elderly, 25% to 50% of women and 15% to 35% of men have ASB. Antimicrobial therapy for ASB has no short- or long-term benefits for mortality, genitourinary symptoms, or subsequent symptomatic episodes and in acute-care settings causes adverse drug reactions and re-infection with more-resistant organisms; although in long-term-care facilities individuals with bacteriuria are at greater risk of symptomatic infection, this is not attributable to bacteriuria. Identifying symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in frail or cognitively impaired elderly is often challenging, and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America has published proposed criteria for initiation of antibiotics and surveillance definitions for nursing homes. For older adults with ASB undergoing traumatic genitourinary procedures with mucosal bleeding, antimicrobial treatment is supported in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^112S3pn9]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of included studies

There were four large retrospective cross-sectional studies, and among the remaining studies the number of patients in each study varied considerably from small community samples of 9 to larger hospital samples of 710 (Tables 3 and 4). The majority of the studies identified were cross-sectional in design. Approximately half of the studies had an entirely elderly population ≥ 65 years (n = 10), with the other half of studies having populations deemed to be representative of an elderly population by median or mean age ≥ 65 years (n = 10). In the two remaining studies, one conducted in a nursing home and the other in a psychogeriatric unit, the demographics of the patient sample were not provided. They were believed to be representative of an elderly population by their care setting. The proportion of participants with urinary catheters was unclear in the majority of included studies (n = 14). In the remaining studies, urinary catheter rates were high, 37–51% (n = 3), low 1.8–5.5% (n = 2) and none (n = 3). The majority of the studies were conducted in a hospital setting (n = 14), followed by nursing homes (n = 6) and community settings (n = 2). Interestingly, only two of the included studies had the explicit aim of exploring the association between confusion and UTI; however, ten studies did partially explore this association.

Results of individual studies

Among the included studies, the rate of confusion in patients with suspected UTI was most commonly reported (n = 13) followed by the rate of suspected UTI in patients with confusion (n = 10). Some studies reported the rate of confusion in patients with bacteriuria (n = 4) and one study reported the rate of bacteriuria in patients with confusion. The majority of studies reported confusion as delirium (n = 15), followed by a few reporting confusion (n = 3), altered mental state (n = 2), and mental status changes (n = 1), with one study reporting both delirium and altered mental status. Twelve studies analysed the correlation between suspected UTI or bacteriuria and confusion (Tables 3 and 4).

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^113XBv2i]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Barriers to change

Requesting urine cultures in the absence of minimum symptoms of UTI leads to detection of ASB, prompting unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Large retrospective and prospective cohort studies conducted in long term care homes across several countries show that only a small fraction of urine specimens collected in long term care meet minimum symptom criteria for culturing, and that up to 80% of residents with ASB had unnecessary urine testing.

The urine dipstick, which is known for its sensitivity in ruling out presence of UTI in younger populations and foregoing a urine culture, may contribute to over diagnosis of UTI in older patients. Unlike in younger populations, where pyuria is generally absent when non-infected, the prevalence of pyuria among long term care residents is nearly universal, and these positive dipsticks trigger urine cultures and occasionally empiric antibiotics in the absence of localising symptoms of UTI.

Residents in long term care homes may have cognitive impairment, which can limit available history, and may present atypically with infection. Staff may fear missing a UTI, or even believe that upfront treatment of ASB can prevent a UTI in the future, despite evidence suggesting the contrary. A urine culture may be perceived to be a more objective assessment that provides a possible diagnostic explanation for non-urinary complaints. Therefore, the clinical presentations used to evoke the presence of UTI are excessively broad; common presentations such as falls, poor oral intake, lethargy, and delirium frequently trigger a urine dipstick or culture as a means of excluding a UTI, even in the absence of clear localising urinary symptoms — with positive results used to support that diagnosis.

Urine cultures may also be integrated into existing order sets and routine panels, which drives overuse and detection of ASB. A recent US survey presented a case of ASB to 551 primary care physicians, and found that more than 70% would prescribe antibiotics. Ninety per cent of those who opted to treat believed the patient had a UTI, even though they lacked any of the cardinal symptoms.

Family members and care givers may specifically request urine testing when a care home resident's condition is altered. Prior experiences of both prescribers and care givers can generate causal inferences based on prior episodes where urine cultures were positive, and these can become particularly challenging to dissociate if improvement in the person's condition coincided with receipt of antibiotics previously.

After removing the study with the highest weightas well as after removing one clear outlier with the highest effect size, results remained significant. Subgroup meta‐analyses of studies (1) in which participants with delirium were compared with non‐delirium controls,(2) in which participants with UTI were compared with non‐UTI controls,(3) with a diagnosis of delirium based on DSM or ICD criteria,(4) with a diagnosis of UTI based on microbiological urine tests,(5) conducted in the clinical setting,(6) conducted in nursing homes, and (7) of population‐based samples, each found a statistically significant pooled OR (see Figures S2–S17). Thus, the results of all sensitivity and subgroup meta‐analyses (see Table 2 and Figures S2–S17) were also statistically significant.

Meta‐regression analysis showed that year of study publication, study country, type, temporality and setting, delirium and UTI assessment method, rating on the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale, age of study participants, their gender distribution, and residence status did not significantly influence the pooled ORs. Among the comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions we examined as regressors only the presence of dehydration, urinary catheter, and urinary retention had a statistically significant effect on the pooled OR. In a meta‐regression analysis, we also found a statistically significant effect of receiving benzodiazepines and drugs with anticholinergic properties on the pooled ORs. For details on meta‐regression analysis, see Tables S5–S13.

The association between delirium and AB in older adults in the only study reporting this association that we could findwas statistically insignificant: OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.57–4.65; p ‐value 0.37.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

### Clinically diagnosed infections predict disability in activities of daily living among the oldest-old in the general population: the Leiden 85-plus study [^115VFnpt]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The oldest-old are predisposed to infectious diseases as a result of deterioration of the immune system and an increased prevalence of co-morbidity. The incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) increase with age, with an exponential increase in the oldest-old.

In vulnerable older persons, the most common bacterial infection is a UTI, with serious adverse health consequences such as delirium, dehydration, urosepsis and hospitalisation. Also, UTI has a high mortality rate, especially by hospitalisation. Community acquired pneumonia, also highly prevalent in older persons, is also a frequent cause of hospitalisation and death.

Literature on the consequences of infections on the functional decline, also highly prevalent in older persons and increasing with age, is limited and mainly describes the impact of infections on the functional status of nursing home residents. To our knowledge, there is no information about how infections and activities of daily living (ADL) disability co-occur in the oldest-old in the general population. Therefore, this study examines whether incident clinical infections between age 85 and 86 years contribute to an increase in ADL disability from age 86 onwards, stratified for ADL disability at baseline.

### Antibiotic use in the care home setting: a retrospective cohort study analysing routine data [^112zXQ94]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing rate of antibiotic resistance is a huge problem as modern health care depends on effective antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Use of antibiotics increases the risk of antibiotic resistance, thus it is important to promote a rational use of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistant bacteria selected by antibiotic treatment, can also be spread among residents at nursing homes.

Patients in care home settings are frequently prescribed antibiotics on an empirical basis for presumed urinary tract infection when suffering from symptoms not specific to the urinary tract. The evidence base for such treatment is poor and the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria adds to the diagnostic difficulty. UTI diagnosis is often made in the absence of newly onset focal urinary tract symptoms. When suspecting UTI in nursing home residents with advanced dementia, the presenting symptom was dysuria in only 3.8%, urinary frequency in 1.5% and urinary urgency in 0% of the episodes. Therefore it is likely that a substantial proportion of these UTI antibiotics are of dubious value. A correct diagnosis is important to avoid a potentially harmful antibiotic treatment and possible delay of other diagnoses.

The nurse plays a central role in the prescription of UTI antibiotics through an awareness of changes in residents' mental status and their consequential communication of this to physicians. Due to this awareness among nurses, residents of care homes might be prescribed more antibiotics for suspected UTI than elderly individuals at the same age and with the same number of co-morbidities but not living in care homes.

The majority of previous studies of antibiotic use in care homes have not compared prescription rates to elderly not living in care homes. Furthermore, most studies of antibiotic use have been point prevalence studies which cannot evaluate annual prescription rates due to substantial seasonal variation in antibiotic prescriptions. There is a lack of studies evaluating annual antibiotic prescription rates among elderly residents of care homes compared to elderly not living in care homes.

The aim of this study was using routine data to describe the pattern of antibiotic prescribing in those 75 years and over resident in care home settings compared to community dwelling older people, with a focus on urinary tract infections taking account of urinary catheter status.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^117QimLf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Patients With AMS

Among patients with ASB, 5059 (43.6%) had AMS (Figure). Of these, 89 (1.8%) were found to have bacteremia from a presumed urinary source (vs 72 [1.1%] in patients without AMS). Risk of bacteremia in patients with AMS differed 4-fold based on whether they had systemic signs of infection (ie, evidence of SIRS or leukocytosis): 0.7% (17 of 2610) for patients without systemic signs of infection (number needed to treat, 154) vs 2.9% (72 of 2449) for patients with systemic signs of infection (number needed to treat, 34). Differences based on whether patients had dementia are shown in the Figure.

Bacteremia From a Presumed Urinary Source Among Hospitalized Patients With Bacteriuria and Altered Mental Status With or Without Dementia

SBP indicates systolic blood pressure; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome; UTI, urinary tract infection.

Variables and Outcomes Associated With Bacteremia From a Presumed Urinary Source

In unadjusted comparisons, patients with ASB who developed bacteremia from a presumed urinary source were older (median [IQR] age, 79.5 [72.2–88.2] years) than patients who did not develop bacteremia (median [IQR] age, 78.2 [67.7–86.6] years; z score, 2.32; p = 0.02). Symptoms or comorbidities associated with developing bacteremia from a presumed urinary source included presentation with AMS with or without dementia, complicated urologic history, indwelling catheter, change in urine characteristics, fatigue, functional decline, and urinary retention (see Table 1 for details). Diagnostic findings associated with development of bacteremia from a presumed urinary source included: serum leukocytosis, elevated urinalysis parameters (ie, pyuria or leukocyte esterase), and growth of Escherichia coli (compared with other pathogens) (Table 1).

Patients with ASB who developed bacteremia from a presumed urinary source had higher unadjusted mortality (9.3% vs 4.5%; χ²₁ = 8.24; p = 0.004) and median (IQR) duration of hospitalization after urine culture (6 [4–7] vs 4 [3–6] days; z score, 7.08; P < .001) than those without bacteremia. Other outcomes including 30-day readmission, 30-day ED visit, and CDI event at 30 days were similar between the 2 groups (Table 1).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113cR6bQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in functionally impaired older adults and long-term care residents — screening and treatment: In older, community-dwelling persons who are functionally impaired, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and in older persons resident in long-term care facilities, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence notes that only 16% of bacteriuric residents with advanced dementia met minimum criteria for symptomatic UTI, but 75% of these received treatment; antimicrobial therapy conferred no survival benefit (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 1.09 [95% CI, .43–2.75] for oral therapy vs no therapy, and 1.83 [95% CI, .44–7.60] for intramuscular therapy vs no therapy); increased frequency of bacteriuric episodes was significantly associated with an increased frequency of receiving an antimicrobial or subsequent isolation of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in urine, but not changes in mental status or admission to hospital for UTI; and the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) within 3 months of therapy was > 8.5-fold higher for patients who received antimicrobial treatment than those who did not.

Methods

Protocol and registration

The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Inclusion criteria and methods were specified in advance and documented in the review protocol. The initial protocol was published with PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews, registration number CRD42015025804.

Eligibility criteria

This review included quantitative studies which met the following inclusion criteria:
Elderly participants. The majority of the participants in the study must be representative of an elderly population, defined as the median or mean age ≥ 65 years.
Primary studies in which participants with lower UTI or bacteriuria were assessed for concurrent confusion, or participants with confusion were assessed for concurrent UTI or bacteriuria.
Any care setting (Hospital, Community, Long Term Care Facility).

The following exclusion criteria were applied:
Studies that refer to specific sub-populations of patients with UTI. Examples include: stroke patients, Alzheimers or dementia patients or post-surgical patients
Studies that exclusively report catheter associated UTI;
Non-English publications
Case studies

The primary outcomes of interest were confusion, UTI and bacteriuria. Due to the large variety of terminology that surrounds the symptom of confusion, definitions used for confusion in this review encompassed: confusion, acute confusional state, delirium, altered mental status, altered mental state. This broad definition was used so as to capture all studies which may have assessed confusion but used alternative terminology. No absolute lower age limit was set, as it was anticipated that these would have an overall negligible effect on the data. This was so as to not exclude studies which may present data representative of an elderly population but which included a small minority of non-elderly participants. Studies that referred to specific subpopulations, or exclusively reported catheter associated UTI were also excluded so as to explore the association between confusion and UTI or bacteriuria in a general elderly population.

Identification of studies

Three databases were accessed to identify studies eligible for this review: PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO (via ProQuest). The search terms were related to three key topics: confusion, UTI and bacteriuria (Table 1) with adaptations for Scopus and PsycINFO. No restrictions on date or language were applied and studies published up to August 2015 were included. Once the final list of full text articles was determined, the references and citation history of the included studies were screened for other potential studies eligible for the review. The full texts of any new studies deemed possibly eligible for inclusion, were then retrieved and assessed.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^114Erpxa]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well documented that lower urinary tract infection (UTI) should only be diagnosed when there are new onset localising genitourinary signs and symptoms and a positive urine culture result. However, despite new onset or worsening of confusion being a non-specific symptom, it continues to be the most common reason for suspecting a lower UTI in elderly patients, often leading to antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of UTI is further complicated by the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in nursing home residents, varying between 25 and 50% for women and 15–40% for men, without an indwelling urinary catheter. While urine cultures can guide the choice of antibiotic, their poor positive predictive value means a positive culture alone should not warrant initiation of antibiotics. Additionally, evidence suggests patients with confusion and dementia are more likely to be continuously bacteriuric. Due to all of these confounding factors, new onset or worsening of non-specific symptoms in residents is one of the major diagnostic challenges in caring for the elderly.

Subsequently, many different consensus based criteria to enable appropriate diagnosis of UTI have been devised, most notably the revised Mcgeer and updated Loeb criteria. Despite the difficulty of diagnosing UTI, there is sound evidence that elderly residents with symptomatic lower UTI should receive antibiotic treatment and elderly residents with asymptomatic bacteriuria should not. Although inappropriate antibiotic use results in those few residents suffering from a lower UTI to be treated promptly, it leads to significant overdiagnosis of UTI and potentially harmful outcomes through misdiagnosis. With many residents receiving unnecessary antibiotics with possible adverse reactions, and the ever-increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, it is evident that inappropriate antibiotic use in this population must be reduced.

A previous literature review conducted by Balogun et al. exclusively reviewed the association between symptomatic UTI and delirium in the elderly in five publications. It concluded that there may be an association between symptomatic UTI and delirium; however, some methodological flaws may have led to biased results. It was limited by only using the term delirium and excluding terms like confusion, resulting in many publications potentially being excluded. In addition, Balogun et al. only searched the Medline database potentially missing important publications.

UTI is a broad diagnosis encompassing infections arising from all levels of the urinary tract, ranging in severity from acute cystitis to acute pyelonephritis. This systematic review aims to review the evidence for the association between acute cystitis or bacteriuria and confusion in the elderly in all care settings.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142huNc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

The available evidence suggests that there is no clinical benefit (both in terms of preventing further urological problems, in terms of mental disturbances, and in terms of mortality) from the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), which usually has a benign natural course and may resolve on its own or persist despite treatment. Moreover, such treatment may lead to serious side effects and the possibility of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. There is also evidence that the administration of antibiotics itself is associated with an increased risk of delirium.

However, the studies addressing the association between delirium and UTI in older adults are contradictory. Furthermore, there are limited data on the association between delirium and AB in older adults.

There have been three systematic reviews published to date, that have addressed the relationship between delirium and UTI. Balogun and Philbrickin their systematic review concluded that there may be an association between UTI and delirium in older adults, but the studies reviewed had methodological flaws that may have led to biased results. Chae and Millerdid not limit their study to older adults and suggested a potential relationship between UTI and delirium. Mayne and colleaguesused the less specific diagnostic category of confusion rather than delirium in their study. The authors concluded that there were insufficient data to determine the relationship between confusion and UTI in older adults, explaining this by poor confusion or UTI definitions as well as inadequate control of confounding factors in individual studies. Previous reviews used less comprehensive search approaches and did not provide a meta‐analytical synthesis. The association between delirium and AB has not been separately systematically studied in any age group.

By answering the main study question, what are the associations of delirium with UTI and AB in older adults, this review should improve the available evidence on these associations.

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^113dSRKk]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common among the oldest old and may lead to a few days of illness, delirium or even to death. We studied the incidence and predictive factors of UTI among the oldest old in the general population.

Methods

The Leiden 85-plus Study is a population-based prospective follow-up study of 86-year-old subjects in Leiden, The Netherlands. Information on the diagnosis of UTI was obtained annually during four years of follow-up from the medical records and interviews of treating physicians. A total of 157 men and 322 women aged 86 years participated in the study. Possible predictive factors were collected at baseline, including history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years, aspects of functioning (cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) < 19), presence of depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) > 4), disability in activities of daily living (ADL)), and co-morbidities.

Results

The incidence of UTI from age 86 through 90 years was 11.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4, 13.1) per 100 person-years at risk. Multivariate analysis showed that history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years (hazard ratio (HR) 3.4 (95% CI 2.4, 5.0)), impaired cognitive function (HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.3, 2.9)), disability in daily living (HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1, 2.5)) and urine incontinence (HR 1.5 (95% CI 1.0, 2.1)) were independent predictors of an increased incidence of UTI from age 86 onwards.

Conclusions

Within the oldest old, a history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years, cognitive impairment, ADL disability and urine incontinence are independent predictors of developing UTI. These predictive factors could be used to target preventive measures to the oldest old at high risk of UTI.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^115a156K]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

While urinary tract infections (UTIs) are thought to be common among women, as many as 65% of UTI diagnoses may be inaccurate. To identify strategies to improve antibiotic stewardship, we sought to determine the clinical and laboratory factors associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs.

Methods

Electronic health records identified patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI within a single healthcare system during July 2019. Demographic, clinical, and microbial data were collected by manual chart review. Regression analyses were utilized to determine factors associated with guideline non-concordant UTI diagnosis and treatment utilizing R statistical software (version 4.3.1).

Results

In patients diagnosed with UTI, 64% were treated with antibiotics despite only 28% having symptoms consistent with UTI diagnostic criteria. Of patients diagnosed with a UTI who were treated in an emergency room (ER) setting, 95% were given antibiotics compared with only 55% of patients in an outpatient setting. Even without any urinary symptoms, 95% of patients in the ER and 27% of patients in outpatient settings were treated with antibiotics. Patients who presented to the ER for non-localizing symptoms, such as mental status changes (MSC), were more likely to be diagnosed with UTI compared with those in an outpatient setting.

Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrate that patients were frequently diagnosed with and treated for a UTI despite not meeting diagnostic criteria. This pattern of overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, particularly in acute care settings, contributing to worsening antibiotic resistance in conjunction with incomplete evaluation of patients' primary complaints.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pHby6]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection criteria

Study type

Original studies with a control group regardless of their publication type and design (with the exception of case series and case studies) were considered. We included studies reporting the degree of associations, expressed as odds ratios (ORs), between delirium and UTI as well as between delirium and AB, or data to calculate these ORs. We considered studies of individuals (a) with delirium compared with non‐delirium controls, (b) with UTI compared with non‐UTI controls, and (c) with AB compared with non‐bacteriuric controls.

Population

Older adults (aged 65 and older) with a diagnosis of delirium, UTI or AB. Comparison subjects were participants without delirium, UTI, or AB respectively. The diagnosis of delirium could have been made either (1) according to DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria (any version); or (2) using a symptom threshold on validated delirium rating scales; or (3) based on records in medical files/registries. The diagnosis of UTI could have been made either (1) on the basis of presence of 1 or more species of bacteria growing in the urine specimen at specified quantitative counts (≥ 10⁵ colony‐forming units [CFU]/ml or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L) in the presence of classic signs or symptoms of (a) cystitis (dysuria, urinary frequency and/or urgency, suprapubic pain or tenderness, hematuria) or (b) pyelonephritis (flank pain, costovertebral angle pain or tenderness) or (c) systemic illness (fever, chills, rigors, marked fatigue, malaise beyond baseline) or (2) based on a listing of the diagnosis of UTI in medical records without additional data on tests performed and presence of UTI symptoms. The diagnosis of AB could have been made either (1) on the basis of presence of 1 or more species of bacteria growing in the urine specimen at specified quantitative counts (≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L) in the absence of signs or symptoms attributable to UTI or (2) on the basis of study‐defined criteria or (3) based on a listing of the diagnosis of AB in medical records.

Outcomes

The outcome measures were ORs expressing the association between delirium and UTI, and between delirium and AB in older adults.

### Interleukin-6 concentrations in the urine and dipstick analyses were related to bacteriuria but not symptoms in the elderly: a cross sectional study of 421 nursing home residents [^1178igct]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) among residents of nursing homes for the elderly varies between 25% and 50% for women and 15% and 40% for men. There is overwhelming evidence that ABU should not be treated with antibiotics in an adult population except for pregnant women and patients prior to traumatic urologic interventions with mucosal bleeding. The high prevalence of ABU makes it difficult to know if a new symptom in a resident with bacteriuria is caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), or if the bacteria in the urine is only representative of an ABU. This is especially difficult in the presence of symptoms not specific to the urinary tract such as fatigue, restlessness, confusion, aggressiveness, loss of appetite or frequent falls.

Nonspecific symptoms such as changes in mental status are the most common reasons for suspecting a UTI among residents of nursing homes. These symptoms can have many causes besides UTI. There are different opinions on the possible connection between different nonspecific symptoms and UTI. Nonspecific symptoms and diagnostic uncertainty often lead to antibiotic treatments of dubious value. Urine culture alone seems inappropriate for evaluating symptoms among residents of nursing homes. There are two major possible explanations, either common bacteria in the urine are of little relevance, or a urine culture is insufficient to identify UTI.

With the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the antimicrobial drug discovery pipeline currently running dry, it is important not to misinterpret bacteriuria as UTI and prescribe antibiotics when it actually represents ABU. Thus, a complementary test to discriminate between symptomatic UTI and ABU is needed. The cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a mediator of inflammation playing an important role in the acute phase response and immune system regulation. The biosynthesis of IL-6 is stimulated by e.g. bacteria. After intravesical inoculation of patients with E. coli, all patients secreted IL-6 into the urine, however, serum concentrations of IL-6 did not increase suggesting a dominance of local IL-6 production. A symptomatic lower UTI is assumed associated with more severe inflammation in the bladder compared to an ABU. Previous studies suggested that concentrations of IL-6 in the urine may be valuable in discriminating between ABU and UTI in the elderly, however, this needs evaluation in a larger study among the elderly.

Regarding specific circumstances for asymptomatic bacteriuria, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to assess for non-urinary pathology as part of the initial evaluation of falls or delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) in older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment, bacteriuria, and no local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection (such as fever or hemodynamic instability).

### A case of confusion: paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis in an elderly patient suspected of having urinary tract infection-associated delirium [^114qp1Dc]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute confusion is a common symptom of physical illness in the older patient. In the majority, it is transient and resolves on treatment of precipitants. In a subset of patients, however, neurological decline is progressive, raising concern about a serious underlying cause. We describe the case of a 71-year-old woman who developed progressive cognitive impairment following insertion of a permanent pacemaker for sinoatrial arrests. An initial diagnosis of delirium secondary to a urinary tract infection was suspected; however, the patient became increasingly confused despite treatment. Laboratory tests revealed serum anti-Hu paraneoplastic antibodies, and CT chest identified an occult lung tumour. Cervical lymph node histopathology confirmed a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. Although a rare cause of confusion, paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis should be recognised early to allow timely identification and treatment of the associated cancer.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^115hAbL5]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-specific symptoms, such as confusion, are often suspected to be caused by urinary tract infection (UTI) and continues to be the most common reason for suspecting a UTI despite many other potential causes. This leads to significant overdiagnosis of UTI, inappropriate antibiotic use and potential harmful outcomes. This problem is particularly prevalent in nursing home settings.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was conducted assessing the association between confusion and UTI in the elderly. PubMed, Scopus and PsychInfo were searched with the following terms: confusion, delirium, altered mental status, acute confusional state, urinary tract infection, urine infection, urinary infection and bacteriuria. Inclusion criteria and methods were specified in advance and documented in the protocol, which was published with PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42015025804). Quality assessment was conducted independently by two authors. Data were extracted using a standardised extraction tool and a qualitative synthesis of evidence was made.

Results

One thousand seven hunderd two original records were identified, of which 22 were included in the final analysis. The quality of these included studies varied, with frequent poor case definitions for UTI or confusion contributing to large variation in results and limiting their validity. Eight studies defined confusion using valid criteria; however, no studies defined UTI in accordance with established criteria. As no study used an acceptable definition of confusion and UTI, an association could not be reliably established. Only one study had acceptable definitions of confusion and bacteriuria, reporting an association with the relative risk being 1.4 (95% CI 1.0–1.7, p = 0.034).

Conclusions

Current evidence appears insufficient to accurately determine if UTI and confusion are associated, with estimates varying widely. This was often attributable to poor case definitions for UTI or confusion, or inadequate control of confounding factors. Future well-designed studies, using validated criteria for UTI and confusion are required to examine the relationship between UTI and acute confusion in the elderly. The optimal solution to clarify this clinical issue would be a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of antibiotics versus placebo in patients with new onset or worsening confusion and presence of bacteriuria while lacking specific urinary tract symptoms.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^116DjuoS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials & Methods

All consecutive patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis within a single healthcare system during July 2019 were identified by the ICD‐10 diagnostic code (Appendix SA). The healthcare system utilized was a large tertiary medical center in a major metropolitan city with high patient volumes. July 2019 was selected to avoid any alterations in treatment delivery resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Patients demonstrating clinical signs or hemodynamic features of bacteremia, positive blood cultures, medical comorbidities associated with complicated UTI (e.g. indwelling catheter, recent urologic surgery, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, or transplant), or those admitted for inpatient care were excluded, resulting in a cohort of 909 patients.

2.1 Data Collection

Manual chart review was utilized to extract demographic (e.g. age, gender), clinical (e.g. symptoms), and microbial (e.g. features of microscopic urinalysis, urine microbiological testing) data from patients who met inclusion criteria. We also catalogued antibiotic treatments used, alternative diagnoses explored, and urine culture and susceptibility results. Symptoms were designated as "acute" if arising < 7 days before the encounter and "chronic" when present for > 28 days before presentation. The presence of "UTI symptoms", specified by the American Urological Association and expert consensus, was defined as either dysuria or hematuria with at least one additional urinary symptom, including urinary urgency, urinary frequency, worsening incontinence, or suprapubic pressure in the absence of any vaginal symptoms. "Mental Status Changes" (MSC) captured symptomatology such as altered mental status, confusion, and lethargy. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, or Enterococcus faecalis were defined as the most common "uropathogenic" bacteria, while all other species were designated as atypical bacteria. Risk factors for complicated UTIs such as anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, systemic disease, immunodeficiency, pregnancy, or history of multidrug resistance bacteria were not collected. Clinical definitions are defined in Appendix SB.

### Education research: evaluating acute altered mental status: are incoming interns prepared? [^112upkZY]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical evaluation of hospitalized patients with acute altered mental status (AMS) is a common task of interns, regardless of medical specialty. The effectiveness of medical education to ensure competence in this area is unknown.

Objective

To measure competency of new interns in the evaluation and management of AMS using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).

Methods

A cohort study was conducted with 61 medical school graduates entering internship at a single teaching hospital in 2006. Interns from all major specialty fields were included. The OSCE consisted of a 12-minute simulated encounter with a human patient simulator and nurse actor. Each intern's performance was graded by the same neurologist, using criteria agreed upon by consensus of the neurology faculty. Competency in obtaining a history, performing a neurologic examination, generating a differential diagnosis, and ordering diagnostic studies was graded. Overall performance was scored on a percentage scale from 0 to 100.

Results

Overall performance scores ranged from 19 to 43 with a mean of 31.4 (SD ± 5.6). Hypoglycemia was identified as a potential cause of AMS by 72.1% of interns, while fewer identified urinary tract infection (45.9%) and seizure (13.1%). While many interns ordered a CXR (86.9%) and head CT (80.3%), few requested a toxicology screen (21.3%) or lumbar puncture (3.3%). Only 41% of interns performed a neurologic examination.

Conclusion

New interns are not well-prepared to evaluate patients with altered mental status in the inpatient setting as measured by an Objective Structured Clinical Examination.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116d8X3o]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Among the moderators related to somatic conditions we found only dehydration, urinary retention, and the presence of a urinary catheter were found to have significant effects on the association between delirium and UTI in older adults. However, the use of a urinary catheter has previously been associated with both delirium and UTI. The associations of delirium with dehydration and urinary retention have also been reported, and there are some suggestions of a possible association between UTI and urinary retention. Although data on the association between UTI and dehydration are contradictory, an adequate hydration is thought to improve the results of antimicrobial therapy for UTI. In the meta‐regression analysis focusing on medication status we found a statistically significant effect of benzodiazepines and drugs with anticholinergic properties on the association between delirium and UTI. However, the association between delirium and drugs from both of these groups has already been described previously.

Study quality was not a significant predictor in the meta‐regression analysis, which is consistent with our meta‐analysis of subgroups demonstrating that significant results persisted when only the most rigorous studies were included, that is, studies in which the diagnosis of delirium was based on formal diagnostic criteria, and studies in which UTI was diagnosed based on results of microbiological urine tests.

There was statistically significant heterogeneity in both the main meta‐analysis and most subgroup meta‐analyses. However, in the sensitivity analysis with the removal of the study with the highest relative weight, the heterogeneity expressed by the I² value decreased from 60.49 (substantial) to 42.83 (moderate). The degree of heterogeneity was not significant in the subgroup meta‐analysis that included studies with a diagnosis of delirium based on formal criteria, as well as in two smaller subgroup meta‐analyses that included three studies conducted in nursing homes and two studies of population‐based samples.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nebsq]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of delirium in persons aged 65 and older (older adults) varies, depending on the method of assessment and the population studied, from 18%–35% in the general medical ward, to 20%–22% in nursing homes, 25% in geriatric units, and 7%–50% in intensive care units. Delirium in older adults is associated with prolonged hospital stays, complexity of care, institutionalization and high mortality rates as well as considerable difficulties for caregivers and increased healthcare costs.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) among older adults is also associated with a high number of cases annually and high healthcare costs. The diagnosis of UTI requires not only confirmed bacteriuria but also the presence of genitourinary symptoms, which often cannot be reliably confirmed in the many delirious individuals who are unable to adequately express themselves, thus posing a challenge to the clinical assessment of such patients. When bacteriuria is detected in older adult patients, many clinicians consider behavioral or mental changes, including delirium, as non‐urinary (also called "non‐specific") manifestations of UTI, especially in patients with cognitive impairment, from whom local urinary tract symptoms are often difficult to obtain.Сlinicians often prescribe antibiotics for delirium in patients with confirmed bacteriuria, based on the assumption that anti‐bacterial treatment will manage non‐specific psychiatric symptoms and improve patient outcomes.
