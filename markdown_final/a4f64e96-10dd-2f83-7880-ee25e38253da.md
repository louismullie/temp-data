## Question

can graves disease have a normal free t4?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Graves' disease can present with a normal free T4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of subclinical hyperthyroidism and whether Graves' disease is a recognized cause. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that explains how TSH can be suppressed while free T4 remains normal. Next, I will review guideline and review-level sources that explicitly include Graves' disease among etiologies of subclinical hyperthyroidism. After that, I should consider clinical contexts where this pattern is particularly relevant, such as early disease, T3-predominant phenotypes, and during or after treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and outline practical implications for diagnosis and follow-up, making sure I double-check any exceptions or confounders along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and normal T3, and importantly, endogenous causes include Graves' disease alongside toxic nodular disease and solitary autonomous nodules, which establishes that Graves' disease can indeed present with normal free T4 when TSH is suppressed [^75cb90d1] [^3babb464] [^ea0f81d6].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I proceed. Graves' disease is driven by TSH receptor antibodies that stimulate the thyroid; in milder disease, the axis can be sufficiently perturbed to suppress TSH while free T4 has not yet risen above the reference range, and in some cases only T3 is elevated (T3 toxicosis), which still fits a suppressed TSH with normal free T4 pattern, so the biochemistry is coherent with the clinical entity of subclinical hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease [^8f7b1e36] [^2d92ae99].

> I should confirm this with higher-credibility sources. The Lancet review explicitly distinguishes overt hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and/or T3) from subclinical hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3), and it notes that Graves' disease is a common cause of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, which directly answers the question affirmatively [^d08bafee]. The ATA guideline similarly defines subclinical hyperthyroidism and lists Graves' disease among the principal endogenous causes, reinforcing that normal free T4 does not exclude Graves' disease when TSH is suppressed [^75cb90d1] [^3babb464].

> Hold on, I should review clinical contexts where this pattern is especially relevant. Early or mild Graves' disease may show only TSH suppression with normal free T4, and T3-predominant Graves' disease can present with disproportionately elevated T3 and normal free T4, both scenarios yielding a suppressed TSH with normal free T4 on initial testing, so I need to ensure I don't anchor on free T4 alone when TSH is low [^8f7b1e36] [^2d92ae99]. During treatment, free T4 often normalizes before TSH recovers, so a normal free T4 with suppressed TSH can reflect improving but still active disease or early biochemical remission, which is why guidelines advise monitoring both free T4 and TSH rather than relying on TSH alone in the early post-treatment period [^c3bd825f] [^e2db076f].

> But wait, what if the suppressed TSH is not due to Graves' disease at all? I should double-check the differential. Toxic nodular disease, thyroiditis, exogenous thyroid hormone, assay interference, and central causes can all produce low TSH with normal free T4, so confirming Graves' disease rests on documenting TSH receptor antibodies and, when needed, imaging patterns, rather than assuming the etiology from TSH and free T4 alone [^d08bafee] [^89392299] [^8f7b1e36].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. Yes, Graves' disease can present with a normal free T4 when TSH is suppressed, a pattern that meets criteria for subclinical hyperthyroidism and reflects early or mild autoimmune stimulation of the thyroid axis; this is well established in contemporary guidelines and reviews, and it underscores the need to measure TSH receptor antibodies and, when appropriate, total T3 to capture T3 toxicosis or evolving disease [^d08bafee] [^75cb90d1] [^3300f6fe].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical steps. If TSH is suppressed with normal free T4, I need to check total T3 to detect T3 toxicosis, measure TSH receptor antibodies to confirm Graves' disease when suspected, and repeat thyroid function tests in 3–6 months to document persistence before deciding on therapy, while individualizing treatment based on age, cardiovascular risk, osteoporosis risk, and symptoms, since subclinical hyperthyroidism carries measurable risks and management should be tailored to patient risk profile and preferences [^8f7b1e36] [^3babb464] [^22fb1b8f].

Graves' disease can present with **normal free T4** when TSH is suppressed but free T4 and T3 are within reference limits, a pattern called subclinical hyperthyroidism [^75cb90d1] [^d08bafee]. This occurs in **early or mild Graves' disease**, or when T3 is preferentially elevated (T3 toxicosis) [^2d92ae99]. Diagnosis relies on **suppressed TSH with normal free T4/T3**, plus positive TRAb and diffuse uptake on scintigraphy or ultrasound [^d08bafee] [^89392299]. Management is individualized: observe if low risk, or treat if high risk (elderly, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or TSH < 0.1 mU/L) [^3052ab57] [^1d438a8c].

---

## Biochemical patterns in Graves' disease

Graves' disease typically shows **suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and/or T3** (overt hyperthyroidism) [^d08bafee]. However, in early or mild disease, free T4 may be normal while TSH is suppressed, defining subclinical hyperthyroidism [^75cb90d1].

---

## Subclinical hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by **low or undetectable TSH with normal free T4 and T3** [^75cb90d1]. Graves' disease is a common cause, especially in younger patients or after antithyroid therapy [^3babb464]. Prevalence is about 0.7–1.8% in the general population, higher in older adults and iodine-deficient regions [^8d239c20].

---

## Mechanisms underlying normal free T4 in Graves' disease

Several mechanisms can explain **normal free T4** with suppressed TSH in Graves' disease:

- **Early or mild disease**: Minimal antibody activity may suppress TSH without raising free T4 above normal [^notfound].
- **T3 toxicosis**: Preferential T3 elevation with normal free T4 can occur [^2d92ae99].
- **Pituitary-thyroid axis lag**: TSH may remain suppressed after free T4 normalizes with therapy [^e2db076f].

---

## Clinical significance and risks

Subclinical hyperthyroidism from Graves' disease is **not benign** and carries risks:

- **Cardiovascular**: Increased atrial fibrillation, especially in older adults [^2f6bc912].
- **Bone health**: Accelerated bone loss and fracture risk in postmenopausal women [^2f6bc912].
- **Progression**: Risk of overt hyperthyroidism, particularly with TSH < 0.1 mU/L [^2f6bc912].

---

## Diagnostic approach

When Graves' disease is suspected with normal free T4, **confirm with**:

- **TRAb testing**: High sensitivity/specificity for Graves' disease [^4208df8b].
- **Imaging**: Diffuse uptake on scintigraphy or increased vascularity on ultrasound supports Graves' disease [^4208df8b].
- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistence of suppressed TSH over 3–6 months [^3babb464].

---

## Management considerations

Management is **individualized** based on risk:

- **Observation**: For low-risk patients (young, asymptomatic, TSH 0.1–0.4 mU/L) [^bb86e4a6].
- **Treatment**: For high-risk patients (≥ 65, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, TSH < 0.1 mU/L) [^3052ab57] [^1d438a8c].
- **Therapies**: Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery, chosen case-by-case [^d08bafee].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular monitoring is essential to detect progression or complications. Reassess **TSH and free T4 every 3–6 months** initially, then annually if stable [^notfound]. Continue to monitor for **atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and symptoms** of overt hyperthyroidism [^2f6bc912].

---

Graves' disease can present with **normal free T4** when TSH is suppressed but free T4 and T3 are normal, consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. This pattern is common in early or mild disease, or with T3 toxicosis. Diagnosis requires suppressed TSH with normal free T4/T3, positive TRAb, and supportive imaging. Management is individualized, with observation for low-risk patients and treatment for high-risk patients.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^5c15f5fa]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to treatment monitoring, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain free T4, total T3, and TSH within the first 1–2 months after radioactive iodine therapy. Continue biochemical monitoring at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^ea0f81d6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^8a233701]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

Regarding specific circumstances for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, antithyroid drugs, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer the lowest possible dose of antithyroid drug needed to keep the mother's thyroid hormone levels at or slightly above the reference range for total T4 and T3 values in pregnancy (1.5 times above nonpregnant reference ranges in the second and third trimesters), and the TSH below the reference range for pregnancy. Keep free T4 levels at or slightly above the upper limit of the pregnancy trimester reference range for the assay. Assess thyroid function at least monthly, and adjust the antithyroid drug dose, as required.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^95377a28]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease persistent hyperthyroidism after radioactive iodine (RAI) — When hyperthyroidism due to GD persists after 6 months following RAI therapy, retreatment with RAI is suggested, and in selected patients with minimal response 3 months after therapy additional RAI may be considered (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms; the goal of retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid, patients with persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely, and in the small percentage refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment [^2f6bc912]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodinedeficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L if they are older than 65 years or have comorbidities such as heart disease or osteoporosis.

### Uncommon causes of thyrotoxicosis [^f48ad662]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Apart from the common causes of thyrotoxicosis, such as Graves' disease and functioning nodular goiters, there are more than 20 less common causes of elevated free thyroid hormones that produce the symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis. This review describes these rarer conditions and includes 14 illustrative patients. Thyrotropin and free thyroxine should be measured and, when the latter is normal, the free triiodothyronine level should be obtained. Measurement of the uptake of (123)I is recommended for most patients.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^c9bcda87]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Remission in GD is usually defined as normal serum levels of T3, fT4, and TSH after 1 year of treatment discontinuation. Remission rates in GD vary significantly from 30–70% in various studies. Lower remission rates are seen among children, men, smokers, patients with large goitres, and patients with more active disease. The optimal duration of maintenance therapy with ATDs is 12–18 months. Remission is not influenced by the duration of therapy, and prolonged therapy with ATD is more often associated with adverse effects. At the end of 18 months of ATD therapy, TRAb assessment will help define further course of action. Patients with low or undetectable TRAbs levels have a high probability of permanent remission: GD may relapse in around 20–30% of such patients after stopping ATD therapy. On the other hand, patients with persistently elevated TRAbs levels are unlikely to be in remission and require further therapy, and GD may relapse in around 80–100% of such patients after stopping ATD therapy. Patients with elevated TRAbs levels after 18 months of ATD can be counselled to continue ATD therapy and repeat TRAbs measurement after another 12–18 months. Alternatively, definitive treatments such as RAI or thyroidectomy may be offered to these patients.

ATD treatment monitoring may be done by clinical examination and measuring serum levels of T3, fT4 and TSH at regular intervals, which can range from once every 2–6 months. Lack of normalization of TRAbs level during therapy was associated with ineffective treatment in a study; however, in this study TRAbs levels were estimated at baseline and after 12 or 18 months of therapy. Evidence is insufficient to recommend measurement of serum TRAbs levels in shorter intervals for monitoring of ATD treatment efficacy.

### Screening and management of thyroid disease… [^11cd69b1]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

If the TSH level is less than 0. 3 to
0. 4 μU per mL or greater than 10 μU per mL, determination of the free thyroxine level is recommended. Screening is not recommended in women less than age 50 or in men because the prevalence of unsuspected symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is low in these populations. Persons found to have subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and progression to overt disease. The optimal management of patients without goiter or ocular findings of Graves' disease is uncertain, but the author recommends repeat measurements of TSH, T 4 and T 3 every six to 12 months. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hypercholesterolemia and progression to overt hypothyroidism.

The effectiveness of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; three small unrandomized trials yielded conflicting results. Observation is appropriate for persons with TSH levels between 5 and 10 μU per mL. A TSH of greater than 10 μU per mL or a high antithyroid antibody titer is associated with an increased risk of complications, and levothyroxine therapy may be appropriate. The author notes that previous studies suggested that the addition of thyroid hormone to long-term methimazole or propylthiouracil therapy in patients with Graves' disease increased the likelihood of remission when antithyroid drug therapy was discontinued. More recently, several large randomized studies have failed to confirm that levothyroxine promotes remission in patients receiving antithyroid therapy.

The author believes the concomitant use of thyroid hormone in these patients is unjustified, especially in light of the higher likelihood of serious adverse effects with higher doses of antithyroid drugs. Evidence supports the use of methimazole over propylthiouracil. Methimazole has been associated with higher cure rates, and this agent requires less frequent doses and may carry a lower risk for agranulocytosis.

### Therapy insight: management of Graves' disease during pregnancy [^a3588dbd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of Graves' disease in pregnancy can be complex because of normal gravid physiologic changes in thyroid hormone metabolism. Mothers with active Graves' disease should be treated with antithyroid drugs, which impact both maternal and fetal thyroid function. Optimally, the lowest possible dose should be used to maintain maternal free thyroxine levels at or just above the upper limit of the normal nonpregnant reference range. Fetal thyroid function depends on the balance between the transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating maternal antibodies and thyroid-inhibiting antithyroid drugs. Elevated levels of serum maternal anti-TSH-receptor antibodies early in the third trimester are a risk factor for fetal hyperthyroidism and should prompt evaluation of the fetal thyroid by ultrasound, even in women with previously ablated Graves' disease. Maternal antithyroid medication can be modulated to treat fetal hyperthyroidism. Serum TSH and either total or free thyroxine levels should be measured in fetal cord blood at delivery in women with active Graves' disease, and those with a history of (131)I-mediated thyroid ablation or thyroidectomy who have anti-TSH-receptor antibodies. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis can occur in the first few days of life after clearance of maternal antithyroid drug, and can last for several months, until maternal antibodies are also cleared.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^2d92ae99]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^5bca9d05]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

Methimazole (MMI) dosing for Graves' disease — At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of 10–30 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated down to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). The task force suggests the following as a rough guide to initial MMI daily dosing: 5–10 mg if free T4 is 1–1.5 times the upper limit of normal; 10–20 mg for free T4 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal; and 30–40 mg for free T4 2–3 times the upper limit of normal; serum T3 levels are important to monitor initially because some patients normalize their free T4 levels with MMI but have persistently elevated serum T3, and adverse drug reactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Serum thyrotropin in Graves' disease: a more reliable index of circulating thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level than thyroid function? [^cd343d25]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between serum thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) on one hand and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), free thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) levels on the other in Graves' disease, inasmuch as TSH may be suppressed in the presence of TSI because TSI may bind to the TSH receptor on the thyroid gland membrane and thus eliminate the need for circulating TSH for stimulating the thyroid gland.

Methods

We determined serum TSI levels in 37 women and 13 men with Graves' disease, stratified into 4 groups on the basis of serum TSH levels irrespective of serum free T4 and T3 levels. Our reference ranges were 0.72 to 1.74 ng/dL for free T4, 80 to 200 ng/dL for T3, and 0.4 to 4.0 micro/mL for TSH.

Results

Mean serum TSI concentrations were highest (215% ± 28%) in patients with undetectable TSH levels (< 0.03 micro/mL) and lowest (103% ± 9%) in those with supernormal TSH concentrations (> 4.0 micro/mL). TSI levels were intermediate in the other study groups: 157% ± 16% in patients with subnormal though detectable TSH levels (0.03 to 0.39 micro/mL) and 125% ± 12% in those with normal TSH levels (0.4 to 4.0 micro/mL). Moreover, a progressive decline in TSI levels with increasing serum TSH concentrations was noted, along with a significant negative correlation (r = -0.45; P < 0.01) between serum TSI and TSH concentrations. Finally, relationships between free T4 and T3 levels on one hand and TSI or TSH levels on the other were not significant, with a considerable variability in free T4 and T3 levels being noted in individual study groups.

Conclusion

Serum TSH is frequently suppressed after treatment with antithyroid drugs or radioiodine (131I), irrespective of clinical thyroid function as expressed by increased, normal, or decreased free T4 and T3 concentrations. In an individual patient with Graves' disease, the serum TSH level may be more reflective of the circulating TSI concentration than is thyroid gland function as expressed by free T4 and T3 concentrations and therefore may be as reliable a predictor of remission as TSI.

### Management aspects of medical therapy in Grave's disease [^f064dda1]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial test for diagnosing hyperthyroidism is TSH. If TSH is suppressed, free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3) should be measured. Suppressed TSH with high FT4 or FT3 or both confirms the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. In subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH is suppressed, with normal FT4 and FT3. Total T4 and total T3 can be ordered if free hormone assays are unavailable. A FT3/FT4 ratio > 0.3 or total T3/T4 ratio of > 20 ng/μg may suggest GD.

Further testing with TSH/thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) can be helpful in differentiating GD from other causes of hyperthyroidism. TRAb is more cost effective than images, and if positive, can confirm the diagnosis of GD. Measurement of TRAb level is a standard method for diagnosing, monitoring therapy, and prediction of remission or relapse in patients with GD. There are 2 available methods for detecting antibodies against TSH receptors: thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBI/thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin) assay and the functional TSI bioassay. Although TSI is a subtype of TRAb, TBI assays are more commonly referred to as TRAb. TBI assays have evolved over time and the current third-generation binding assays are automated and have improved sensitivity and specificity of up to 97% and 99% for diagnosing GD. However, these are competitive assays and do not differentiate between stimulating, inhibiting, or neutral Abs. TSI, on the other hand, is a cell-based bioassay that specifically detects stimulating immunoglobulins and, when compared with TBI, is more sensitive.TRAb measurement can particularly be useful in certain clinical scenarios (Box). Although there is no consensus on the preferred type of immunoglobulin, following TSI has not shown a significant advantage over TRAb in predicting and managing Graves ophthalmopathy specifically. In clinical practice, competitive immunoassays are faster, automated, and more readily available, and therefore are used more commonly.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone in a patient with coexisting Graves' disease [^4daa70ca]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder in which an abnormality in the binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor results in end-organ insensitivity to the actions of thyroid hormones. This disorder is sometimes misdiagnosed as Graves' disease due to the presence of a goiter with high Iodine-123 thyroid uptake and high levels of total and free thyroid hormones. Additionally, some patients with RTH may experience palpitations or tachycardia. There is a previous report of a patient with pituitary RTH and concurrent Graves' disease.

Summary

We describe a patient who was found to have a goiter with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism by his primary care physician. Work-up revealed a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), high thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, high Iodine-123 thyroid uptake, as well as increased homogenous activity in both thyroid glands on nuclear scan and a suppressed TSH. Diagnosis of Graves' disease was made, and the patient underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland. The patient subsequently developed hypothyroidism and required a much higher dose of levothyroxine than his weight-based estimate of a full replacement dose to maintain euthyroidism. On 325 micog of daily levothyroxine the patient was clinically euthyroid and had a normal TSH although his levels of T3 and T4 were high. Work-up revealed a mutation in the thyroid hormone beta-receptor gene, consistent with diagnosis of RTH.

Conclusions

RTH is often misdiagnosed as Graves' disease. However, these disorders can coexist, and the concurrent presence of both disorders in a patient can present diagnostic challenges. A previous report of a patient with Graves' disease associated with RTH was published before gene sequencing could be used to confirm diagnosis of RTH. We present a patient with Graves' disease and concurrent RTH that was confirmed by gene sequencing, showing a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene.

Natural history of GD

Studies in adults have shown that the pathogenic TRAb antibodies can come and go with no apparent associated thyroid dysfunction or clinical phenotype. Spontaneous remission of GD is reported in adults but is probably even more uncommon in children. Children with established GD should be treated so that serious complications such as thyroid storm or life-threatening arrhythmias can be prevented. Hypothyroidism will develop in some patients with GD in the longer term, potentially due to the presence of destructive TPO antibodies from coexisting Hashimoto's disease. Data in younger people are lacking but a quarter of adult patients who remit after ATD (see below) go on to require thyroxine replacement.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^8f7b1e36]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: current concepts and scintigraphic imaging [^7237f4b0]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine and a free triiodothyronine level, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and is usually undetectable. Although patients with this diagnosis have no or few signs and symptoms of overt thyrotoxicosis, there is sufficient evidence that it is associated with a relatively higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias as well as the acceleration or the development of osteoporosis. Consequently, the approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism is controversial, that is, therapeutic intervention versus watchful waiting. Regardless, it is imperative for the referring physician to identify the causative thyroid disorder. This is optimally accomplished by a functional study, namely scintigraphy. Recognition of the scan findings of the various causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism enables the imaging specialist to help in diagnosing the underlying condition causing thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression thereby facilitating the workup and management of this thyroid disorder.

The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^75cb90d1]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

For monitoring, in patients at high risk of complications from SH, TSH and free T4 should be repeated within 2–6 weeks, and for all other patients the serum TSH should be repeated at 3–6 months prior to initiating therapy.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^e93ad3f6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

### A remarkable case of thyrotoxicosis initially caused by Graves' disease followed by a probable TSHoma-a case report [^9e45f776]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

This is an unusual case of a patient with dual pathology: primary thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease (GD) and secondary hyperthyroidism due to a probable TSHoma. Careful interpretation of laboratory and radiological findings allowed both conditions to be identified in a timely manner, and guided choice of therapy.

In cases of primary thyrotoxicosis (high free T4 and suppressed TSH) current guidelines suggest measuring anti-TSH receptor antibody (TRab) levels at an early stage. TRab levels are positive in 90–99% of cases of GD depending on the generation of assay used. In contrast, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are only positive in 75–80% of cases of GD. Thyroid scintigraphy and/or ultrasound may provide additional diagnostic information as the most common causes of primary hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goitre, have characteristic features on imaging.

For cases of suspected central (secondary) hyperthyroidism it is essential to exclude laboratory assay interference before proceeding with further investigations. Circulating heterophilic antibodies or human anti-animal immunoglobulins may cause spurious TSH results. Several approaches can be employed to detect such interference. At the simplest level, the demonstration of discordant results when TSH is measured using two different assay platforms is reasonable evidence of assay interference. However, other techniques [e.g. TSH measurement following serial dilution or polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation] provide more robust assessments of TSH integrity.

Similarly, free thyroid hormone levels may be artifactually raised and consideration should also be given to excluding causes of FT4 (± FT3) assay interference.

Once genuine hyperthyroxinaemia with non-suppressed TSH has been confirmed, investigations are targeted towards differentiating between a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and thyroid hormone resistance due to a loss-of-function mutation in the human THRB gene. Classically, TSHomas exhibit a blunted response to TRH stimulation, elevated sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), raised alpha subunit (ASU), and reduction in thyroid hormone levels in response to depot SSA therapy. However, these findings are not universal. Our patient demonstrated no change in TSH following TRH injection, but ASU was within normal limits. She was unable to tolerate SSA.

### Postradioiodine Graves' management: the PRAGMA study [^9daad3df]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thyroid status in the months following radioiodine (RI) treatment for Graves' disease can be unstable. Our objective was to quantify frequency of abnormal thyroid function post-RI and compare effectiveness of common management strategies.

Design

Retrospective, multicentre and observational study.

Patients

Adult patients with Graves' disease treated with RI with 12 months' follow-up.

Measurements

Euthyroidism was defined as both serum thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) and free thyroxine (FT4) within their reference ranges or, when only one was available, it was within its reference range; hypothyroidism as TSH ≥ 10mU/L, or subnormal FT4 regardless of TSH; hyperthyroidism as TSH below and FT4 above their reference ranges; dysthyroidism as the sum of hypo- and hyperthyroidism; subclinical hypothyroidism as normal FT4 and TSH between the upper limit of normal and < 10mU/L; and subclinical hyperthyroidism as low TSH and normal FT4.

Results

Of 812 patients studied post-RI, hypothyroidism occurred in 80.7% and hyperthyroidism in 48.6% of patients. Three principal post-RI management strategies were employed: (a) antithyroid drugs alone, (b) levothyroxine alone, and (c) combination of the two. Differences among these were small. Adherence to national guidelines regarding monitoring thyroid function in the first 6 months was low (21.4%-28.7%). No negative outcomes (new-onset/exacerbation of Graves' orbitopathy, weight gain, and cardiovascular events) were associated with dysthyroidism. There were significant differences in demographics, clinical practice, and thyroid status postradioiodine between centres.

Conclusions

Dysthyroidism in the 12 months post-RI was common. Differences between post-RI strategies were small, suggesting these interventions alone are unlikely to address the high frequency of dysthyroidism.

Hyperthyroidism

Hyperthyroidism is defined as a TSH concentration below the lower limit of the trimester-specific reference range. If the free T4 levels remains within the normal range this is referred to as subclinical and if above reference range this is termed overt hyperthyroidism.

Overt hyperthyroidism affects 0.1–0.4% of all pregnancies. It can either be secondary to an underlying pre-existing condition such as Graves' disease or nonautoimmune conditions (e.g. toxic nodular disease) or related to pregnancy itself. As previously described; in the first trimester there can often be a suppression of TSH and in the presence of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) there may be biochemical similarities to overt hyperthyroidism.

Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is often seen to present by the middle of the first trimester and usually resolves before the end of second trimester. It is differentiated from Graves' disease by the absence of anti-TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb). However, it can present with symptoms similar to thyrotoxicosis. Despite the abnormal thyroid status there is generally no indication for anti-thyroid medication administration in this condition, which is self-limiting.

### Hyperthyroidism [^d08bafee]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12-18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

Graves' disease (GD) in children — 131I pretreatment, safety, and follow-up — When children receiving methimazole (MMI) are to be treated with 131I, the medication is stopped 3–5 days before treatment, and patients are placed on beta-blockers until total T4 and/or free T4 estimate levels normalize. Although some physicians restart antithyroid drugs after 131I, this is seldom required in children, and thyroid hormone levels begin to fall within the first week after therapy. Radioactive iodine is excreted by saliva, urine, and stool, and families should adhere to local radiation safety recommendations. After 131I therapy, T3, T4, and/or estimated free T4 levels should be obtained every month; TSH determinations may not be useful early because they may remain suppressed for several months. Hypothyroidism typically develops by 2–3 months post-treatment, at which time levothyroxine should be prescribed. Although uncommon, there are rare reports of pediatric patients with severe hyperthyroidism who developed thyroid storm after receiving 131I.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^bf5485fb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists — gestational Graves' disease dosing and monitoring (Recommendation 72) specifies that GD during pregnancy should be treated with the lowest possible dose of antithyroid drugs needed to keep the mother's thyroid hormone levels slightly above the normal range for total T4 and T3 values in pregnancy and the TSH suppressed, with Free T4 estimates kept at or slightly above the upper limit of the nonpregnant reference range and thyroid function assessed monthly with dose adjustment as required. 1/+00. Technical remarks note that Free T4 is the parameter that has been most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and that serum TSH may still be suppressed and should not be used as the guide in treatment, although normalization of maternal TSH during ATD therapy may indicate a need to reduce the dose of ATD. ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy; if a woman receiving such therapy becomes pregnant, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^53050384]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### Observations concerning the natural history of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^e1325f47]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the natural history of a subnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration with normal concentrations of both serum free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) (subclinical hyperthyroidism). PATIENTS, DESIGN, AND MEASUREMENTS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken and yielded 16 ambulatory patients who had presented with subclinical hyperthyroidism and were longitudinally followed with measurements of serum TSH and both FT4 and FT3 for a cumulative follow-up of 11 to 36 months. Seven of the patients had subclinical Graves' hyperthyroidism as judged from the presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) in serum, and 9 had multinodular goiter confirmed with ultrasound and no TSI.

Results

In the 7 patients with TSI, serum TSH reverted to normal in 5 patients, with disappearance or decrease of TSI in 4, within 3 to 19 months. In 1 patient, subnormal serum TSH accompanied by both normal FT4 and FT3 has persisted for 15 months, and in a second patient serum TSH reverted to normal within 9 months, but at follow-up 27 months later overt hyperthyroidism had emerged. In the 9 patients with multinodular goiter, subnormal serum TSH accompanied by both normal FT4 and FT3 persisted during cumulative follow-up that ranged from 11 to 36 months.

Conclusions

This study suggests that the natural history of subclinical hyperthyroidism is variable, resolving or occasionally evolving in subclinical Graves' disease and persisting unchanged in multinodular goiter.

Thyrotoxicosis

Thyrotoxicosis (high free T4 or total T3 with low or normal TSH) may occur secondary to thyroiditis or Graves' disease. Thyroiditis is the most frequent cause of thyrotoxicosis and is seen more commonly with anti-PD1/PD-L1 drugs than with anti-CTLA-4 agents; Graves' disease is very rare and occurs more commonly with anti-CTLA-4 drugs. Thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditis may present with weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, tremors, anxiety, diarrhea and other symptoms of hypermetabolic activity, although these symptoms may be masked if the patient is taking beta-blockers. Most commonly, patients are asymptomatic (painless thyroiditis) and routine laboratory monitoring shows high free T4 or triiodothyronine (T3) levels, with low/normal TSH. A thyrotoxic phase occurs an average of one month after starting the drug. Additional tests can be undertaken when thyroiditis is suspected, primarily to rule out other causes of thyrotoxicosis such as Graves' disease. These include thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody [TRAb] or thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and TPO as well as images when feasible: radioactive iodine uptake scan (RAIUS) or Technetium (Tc)-99 m [pertechnetate] thyroid scan if recent iodinated contrast was used. Thyroiditis is a self-limiting process and leads to permanent hypothyroidism after an average of 1 month after the thyrotoxic phase and 2 months from initiation of immunotherapy. Conservative management during the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis is sufficient. Non-selective beta blockers, preferably with alpha receptor-blocking capacity, may be needed in symptomatic patients. Repeat thyroid hormone levels should be performed every 2–3 weeks and thyroid hormone replacement initiated at the time of hypothyroidism diagnosis.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus

Development of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, nausea and/or vomiting should prompt investigation for possible development or worsening of T1DM. Diagnosis and management of T1DM is based on recognized guidelines. Tests for antibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD65], anti-insulin, anti-islet cell A, zinc transporter 8 [Zn-T8]), C-peptide and insulin could distinguish between type 1 and type 2 disease.

When to refer

An endocrinology consultation is recommended in all cases of suspected or confirmed hypophysitis, primary hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, type 1 DM and all rare endocrinopathies.

### Thyroid abnormalities [^9010212b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities and nonthyroidal illness complicate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Among the effects that result from HIV and other opportunistic infections, distinctive features of HIV infection include early lowering of reverse tri-iodothyromine (T3) levels, with normal free T3 levels. Later, some patients develop an isolated low free thyroxine level. After highly active antiretroviral therapy, the immune system reconstitutes in a way that leads to dysregulation of the autoimmune response and the appearance of Graves disease in 1% to 2% of patients. Opportunistic thyroid infections with unusual organisms are most commonly asymptomatic, but can lead to acute or subacute thyroiditis.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^e3f614c6]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are two thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is the biologically active thyroid hormone. In normal subjects, 100% of T4 is secreted by the thyroid, ∼20% of T3 is secreted from the thyroid gland, and ∼80% of T3 is derived from the conversion of T4 to T3 in extra-thyroidal peripheral tissues. A relative T3 deficiency may, thus, be present in athyreotic patients during levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy. We and other investigators compared postoperative T3 levels in patients on LT4 therapy with their own preoperative levels or with those in controls. These studies indicate that in the athyreotic condition after total thyroidectomy during LT4 therapy, patients with normal serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels had mildly low serum free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels, and patients with suppressed serum TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels.

Radioiodine (131 I) is used as the definitive treatment in many patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Of the patients who receive radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease, most eventually develop hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment and require thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Biological effects of 131 I include necrosis and impaired replication of follicular cells, fibrosis, and a chronic inflammatory response, which, ultimately, result in permanent atrophic changes of the thyroid gland. Although reduction of the thyroid volume (TV) after radioiodine treatment by using ultrasonography has been reported, a few studies have evaluated thyroidal function including serum T3 levels of hypothyroid patients on LT4 after radioiodine treatment, because patients who had normal serum TSH and fT4 levels were generally considered to have euthyroidism.

In this study, we compared serum fT4 and fT3 levels in hypothyroid patients on LT4 who presented atrophic thyroid changes after radioiodine treatment with those in a healthy control group to evaluate the effect of the reduction of the TV after radioiodine treatment for serum thyroid hormone balance. We also evaluated serum thyroid hormone levels in groups of patients who were stratified according to their TVs.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Quitting smoking as a probable trigger for new-onset hypothyroidism after successful medical treatment of Graves' disease: case report [^64991a1f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A retired male patient – 64 years of age and a heavy smoker – presented in May 2015 with a complaint of weight loss despite good appetite. He was ordered thyroid function tests revealing mild overt hyperthyroidism: TSH = 0.01 µIU/L (Normal 0.27–4.2 µIU/L), free T4 = 3.7 ng/dL (Normal 0.93–1.7 ng/dL), and free T3 = 10.9 (Normal 2.0–4.4 pg/mL). He had no goiter and no evidence of thyroid eye disease. Serological investigations were consistent with a diagnosis of GD: TRAbs = 16.3 IU/L (Normal < 1.75 IU/L), TPO antibodies = 268 (Normal < 34 IU/mL), and thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies = 1731 (Normal < 115 IU/mL). The patient was counseled about the nature of GD, about the benefits of quitting smoking, and he was offered medical treatment in the form of carbimazole (CBZ) 20 mg/day, given that methimazole is not available in Egypt. The dose of CBZ was then titrated against his laboratory results, to achieve low normal free T4 and free T3, and he maintained euthyroid on a dose of 5 mg/day for a period of 15 months (February 2016–May 2017). In July 2017, CBZ was discontinued after having a TSH result of 22 µIU/L while being on a dose of 2.5 mg/day for 2 months. Celebrating the discontinuation of treatment after more than 2 years of treatment, the patient decided to quit smoking and comply with the repeated advice of quitting smoking that was offered to the patient in almost every follow-up visit. The first follow-up off CBZ in August 2017, the patient was euthyroid with TSH = 3.3 µIU/L, free T4 = 1.17 ng/dL, and TRAbs was 3.3 IU/L. In November 2017, 4 months after stopping CBZ, the patient presented with 4 kg weight gain (67–71 kg) and severe biochemical hypothyroidism, TSH = 73.5 µIU/L and free T4 = 0.35 ng/dL, which was repeatedly confirmed, TSH = 48.9 µIU/L and free T4 = 0.66 ng/dL (Figure 1). Considering the patient age (66 years) and body weight (71 kg), the patient was started on replacement therapy in the form of levothyroxine 75 µg/day (calculated as 1.1 µg/kg/day), and the dose was later titrated to achieve a target TSH of 0.3–3 µIU/L, which was finally achieved using 100 µg/day, and this target was maintained for 45 months (July 2019–April 2023). TRAbs were measured in November 2021, and it was negative at < 0.8 IU/L. The coincidence of quitting smoking in July 2017 and the spontaneous development of overt hypothyroidism in November 2017, only 4 months later, urged us to search for a possible link between quitting smoking and new onset hypothyroidism in patients with treated GD.

Out of 227 patients diagnosed with GD during the study period, 189 patients met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the study sample (72%) was female, and the patients' ages ranged from 18 to 80 years old. Around 71.3% of the study sample had mild Graves' ophthalmopathy. The TRAb titer ranged from 0.9 to 36 Iu/l. The median thyroid uptake on the 99mTc-pertechnetate scan was 10.0 (4.20, 16.69), consistent with GD diagnosis. The median follow-up period for the patients was 22.0 months (9, 36). All the patients except one were treated with methimazole with a median initial dose of 15 mg (10, 20) with gradual titration as per the treating endocrinologist.

### Effective methimazole dose for childhood Graves' disease and use of free triiodothyronine combined with concurrent thyroid-stimulating hormone level to identify mild hyperthyroidism and delayed pituitary recovery [^bc14b311]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Appropriate methimazole dosing for initial treatment of childhood Graves' disease is uncertain. A retrospective chart review was performed on 5 to 17 year-old children treated for Graves' disease. Patients were divided into two groups depending on initial methimazole dosing: low-dose and high-dose regimens using < 0.5 mg/kg/day and > 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively. The low-dose regimen was effective in 5/12 (42%) of patients and the high-dose regimen was effective in 27/33 (82%) of patients (p = 0.016). There was also a statistically significant dose/time interaction for levels of free thyroxine (T4) (p = 0.025). During treatment, 63.3% of diagnosable samples showed unambiguous hyperthyroidism or triiodothyronine (T3) toxicosis, 16.7% elevated free T3 with normal free T4 and T3 levels, indicating borderline hyperthyroidism, and 20% showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression with normal or low levels of free T4 and free T3, indicating delayed recovery of pituitary TSH secretion. Free T3 levels combined with concurrent TSH levels permit differentiation of mild hyperthyroidism from delayed pituitary recovery.

### Fetal goiter identified in a pregnant woman with triiodothyronine-predominant Graves' disease: a case report [^041b7cb1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 10% of all Graves' disease cases are triiodothyronine (T3)-predominant. T3-predominance is characterized by higher T3 levels than thyroxine (T4) levels. Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor autoantibody (TRAb) levels are higher in T3-predominant Graves' disease cases than in non-T3-predominant Graves' disease cases. Treatment with oral drugs is difficult. Here, we report a case of fetal goiter in a pregnant woman with T3-predominant Graves' disease.

Case Presentation

A 31-year-old woman had unstable thyroid function during the third trimester of pregnancy, making it impossible to reduce her dosage of antithyroid medication. She was admitted to our hospital at 34weeks of gestation owing to hydramnios and signs of threatened premature labor, and fetal goiter (thyromegaly) was detected. The dose of her antithyroid medication was reduced, based on the assumption that it had migrated to the fetus. Subsequently, the fetal goiter decreased in size, and the hydramnios improved. The patient underwent elective cesarean delivery at 36weeks and 5days of gestation. The infant presented with temporary symptoms of hyperthyroidism that improved over time.

Conclusions

The recommended perinatal management of Graves' disease is to adjust free T4 within a range from the upper limit of normal to a slightly elevated level in order to maintain the thyroid function of the fetus. However, in T3-predominant cases, free T4 levels may drop during the long-term course of the pregnancy owing to attempts to control the mother's symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Little is known about the perinatal management and appropriate therapeutic strategy for T3-predominant cases and fetal goiter. Therefore, further investigation is necessary.

### A remarkable case of thyrotoxicosis initially caused by Graves' disease followed by a probable TSHoma-a case report [^a761412e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Graves' disease is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis. It occurs when autoantibodies (TRAb) bind to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors driving unregulated production of thyroid hormones [triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)] that is independent of pituitary TSH. The diagnosis is based on the presence of typical features of thyrotoxicosis (± pathognomonic signs, e.g. dysthyroid eye disease), raised free thyroid hormones (fT3 and fT4) with suppressed TSH (traditionally < 0.1 mU/L), high TRAb titres and/or characteristic increased diffuse uptake on thyroid scintigraphy (using iodine or technetium).

In contrast, TSH producing pituitary adenomas (TSHomas, thyrotropinomas) are a much rarer cause of thyrotoxicosis. They are associated with a biochemical pattern of central/secondary hyperthyroidism (elevated T3/T4 with a non-suppressed TSH), which is distinct from that of Graves' disease and other causes of primary hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is often challenging, reflecting significant variation in clinical manifestations, difficulty in confirming genuine hyperthyroxinaemia with non-suppressed TSH, and the increasing recognition that a significant proportion of TSHomas are microadenomas which are not always readily visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A 2014 retrospective study of all histopathologically proven TSHomas over a 10 year period from a single centre confirmed this wide spectrum of clinical presentations with 34% presenting with visual field disturbance, 25% with thyrotoxicosis, 13% with secondary amenorrhoea and 9% with headaches.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Efficacy of anti-thyroid medications in patients with Graves' disease [^61deb723]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Method

This retrospective chart review study was conducted in the endocrinology clinics at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All GD patients, adults, and adolescents aged 14 years and older treated with ATD as first-line therapy at the discretion of the treating endocrinologist were included. The study period was from July 2015 to December 2022. All the patient had at least 18 months of follow-up. GD diagnosis was based on clinical presentation with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis with suppressed TSH, high levels of either free T4 or free T3, or both. The confirmation of GD diagnosis was achieved through either a high TRAb level, a high thyroid uptake on 99mTc-pertechnetate scan, or both. Patients with insufficient follow-up and those who had undergone RAI therapy or thyroidectomy as a first-line therapy for GD were excluded from the study.

The collected data included demographic variables, such as age, and gender. Clinical variables included TRAb levels, TSH, free T4 and T3 levels, 99mTc-pertechnetate scan uptake results, duration of ATD therapy, and Graves' ophthalmopathy severity. TSH, free T4, and free T3 were measured with a Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (the Abbot Alinity i system). The reference range was 0.35 − 4.94 mIU/L for TSH, 9–19 pmol/L for free T4, and 2.9–4.9 pmol/L for free T3. TRAb levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Cobas e411), and the normal reference value was < 1.8 Iu/l. The severity of ophthalmopathy was assessed and documented by the treating endocrinologist based on the grading system established by the European Group on Graves Orbitopathy (EUGOGO).

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment… [^8d239c20]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. 1 Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be divided into two categories: low but detectable TSH and less than 0. 1 mIU per L. 8 Iodine-deficient areas have a higher prevalence of thyroid autonomy. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey evaluated TSH, free T 4, and thyroid antibody levels in a sample population older than 12 years that represented the geographic and ethnic distribution of the U. S. population. 9 The prevalence of TSH levels less than 0. 1 mIU per L was
0. 7%, whereas 1. 8% had levels less than
0. 4 mIU per L. 4 and T 3 levels tend to be lower in persons with these conditions, whereas persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have free T 4 and T 3 levels in the mid to high reference range.

Reassessment of TSH, free T 3, and free T 4 levels is appropriate after two to four months to evaluate whether low TSH is persistent and whether subclinical thyroid disease has progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. A suggested diagnostic approach is outlined in Figure 1.
2. 12 In comparison, 27% of women with TSH levels less than
0. 1 mIU per L progressed to overt hyperthyroidism over two years, 13 indicating that the chance of progression is higher in persons with lower TSH levels. The disease course is less predictable in subclinical hyperthyroidism caused by Graves disease, with possible remission, progression, or no change in up to 36 months of follow-up. 4 The highest risk was observed in patients with TSH levels less than 0. 1 mIU per L, in men, and in adults older than 65 years.

Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism due to excessive levothyroxine replacement was also associated with increased cardiovascular and overall mortality in patients with fully suppressed TSH levels compared with those with normal TSH levels. 5.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.4 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3- to 6-month period.

### Thyroid disorders in subfertility and early pregnancy [^dfaecb35]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

HG often presents in the first trimester of pregnancy with severe nausea and vomiting. It may result in dehydration and ketonuria. Thyroid biochemistry will begin to normalise to trimester specific reference range; initially with FT4 resolving with the cessation of vomiting however the TSH can often remain suppressed for several weeks. Differentiating this from the autoimmune condition of Graves' disease is important and there can often be a goitre, thyroid eye disease (Graves' orbitopathy) or TRAbs in the latter. Yoshihara et al. suggested that using a free T3/free T4 ratio could be discriminatory, as patients with gestational thyrotoxicosis have significantly lower T3 values, frequently in the normal range.

Graves' disease has a prevalence in pregnancy of 0.4% and can either be detected prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy or postpartum (e.g. detected due to the infant having thyroid disturbance). If diagnosed prior to conception it is treated with anti-thyroid medications, thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment. The symptoms of thyrotoxicosis can often be taken for expected pregnancy-related effects (shortness of breath on exertion, mild tachycardia, and heat intolerance). Patients should be examined for thyroid eye signs as these can often worsen in the first trimester. Unlike hypothyroidism, where there is often an increased requirement of treatment as pregnancy progresses, with Graves' disease there is often a reduction in the amount of medication required with each trimester, which may be related to the immunological changes in pregnancy. It is important to remain vigilant of symptoms in the postpartum period as thyroiditis can often exacerbate disease activity.

T4 measurement — free versus total: T4 is the main hormone exclusively produced and secreted by the thyroid gland (T4 to T3 ratio in thyroglobulin is ∼10:1), while the majority of T3 (∼80%) is generated in extrathyroidal tissues. Circulating TH concentrations are affected by serum TH binding proteins, and serum fT4 should be measured in preference to T4 despite its very low fraction of T4 (0.03%).

### Grave's hyperthyroidism and pregnancy: a clinical update [^df506fae]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on Graves' hyperthyroidism and pregnancy with a focus on treatment with antithyroid drugs.

Methods

We searched the English-language literature for studies published between 1929 and 2009 related to management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. In this review, we discuss differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, management, importance of early diagnosis, and importance of achieving proper control to avoid maternal and fetal complications.

Results

Diagnosing hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can be challenging because many of the signs and symptoms are similar to normal physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy. Patients with Graves disease require prompt treatment with antithyroid drugs and should undergo frequent monitoring for signs of fetal and maternal hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Rates of maternal and perinatal complications are directly related to control of hyperthyroidism in the mother. Thyroid receptor antibodies should be assessed in all women with hyperthyroidism to help predict and reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. The maternal thyroxine level should be kept in the upper third of the reference range or just above normal, using the lowest possible antithyroid drug dosage. Hyperthyroidism may recur in the postpartum period as Graves disease or postpartum thyroiditis; thus, it is prudent to evaluate thyroid function 6 weeks after delivery. Preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary approach to care, and patient education regarding potential maternal and fetal complications that can occur with different types of treatment are important.

Conclusion

Preconception counseling and a multifaceted approach to care by the endocrinologist and the obstetric team are imperative for a successful pregnancy in women with Graves hyperthyroidism.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^6026655b]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis background and etiologies — In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is inappropriately stimulated by trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with values within the normal reference range for both triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) estimates and is most often caused by release of excess thyroid hormone by the gland. GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production. The natural history of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time, and in TAs autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating mutations of genes regulating thyroid hormone synthesis; germline mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid nodules — laboratory evaluation (thyroid hormones and antibodies): Always measure serum thyrotropin (TSH) [BEL 1, GRADE A]. If TSH level is decreased, measure free thyroxine (FT4) plus total or free triiodothyronine (FT3); if TSH level is increased, measure FT4 and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) [BEL 2, GRADE A]. Test for Tg antibody in patients with US or clinical findings suggestive of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, when serum levels of TPOAbs are normal [BEL 3, GRADE B]. Assessment of serum Tg is not recommended in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules [BEL 2, GRADE A]. In patients undergoing surgery for cancer, a preoperative serum Tg measurement may be considered [BEL 4, GRADE D]. Perform TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) measurement for patients with TSH levels below the reference range when Graves disease is suspected [BEL 3, GRADE B].

Diagnosis

Serology

The measurement of serum baseline TSH is the acknowledged screening parameter in the initial evaluation of suspected thyroid dysfunction. Additional assessment of the free thyroid hormones differentiates between overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism.

TSH-R-Ab measurement offers accurate and fast diagnosis of GD (Fig. 1). The conventional TSH-R-Ab binding immunoassays are sensitive and specific (98 and 99%, respectively); however, these assays do not differentiate between Ab functionality. In comparison, the cell-based bioassays measure TSH-R-Ab concentrations at very low Ab concentration and at very high serum dilution, and exclusively report on TSH-R-Ab functionality. Indeed, the bioassays show the functionality of the TSH-R-Abs that interact with the human TSH-R, and can specifically detect TSAbs, differentiating between the TSH-R-Ab types (blocking/stimulating). Functional TSH-R-Abs are also predictive for extrathyroidal manifestations and for neonatal thyroid dysfunction. Further to their clinical utility and diagnostic relevance, measurement of stimulatory TSH-R-Abs markedly reduces both costs and time to diagnosis of GD by 50%.

Imaging

Thyroid ultrasound comprises conventional gray-scale analysis (using a high-frequency linear probe) and color flow Doppler examination (characterizing vascular patterns and quantifying thyroid vascularity). Ultrasound supports the diagnosis of GD as a noninvasive, rapid, and accurate imaging procedure. If a goiter with large nodules is present and/or if radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is indicated, radionuclide scintigraphy with radioiodine uptake is suggested. In the vast majority of cases, a timely and positive TSH-R-Ab serology with a typical ultrasound finding offers a reliable, rapid, and more than sufficient definitive diagnosis of GD.

She was started on carbimazole and remained clinically and biochemically euthyroid for the following 18 months (Table 1).

Carbimazole was stopped in January 2013 and the patient was followed in our clinic with serial thyroid function tests. She remained asymptomatic but her blood tests over the next 2 years demonstrated a discordant pattern – a persistently elevated free T4 with a TSH level inappropriately in the normal range (Table 1). She was clinically euthyroid without a goitre.

The same pattern was confirmed on several different laboratory platforms and assay interference was formally excluded. TFTs on the 2 step Delfia platform showed a free T4 of 26.8 pmol/L (9.0–20), a free T3 of 8.5 nmol/L (3.0–7.5) and a TSH of 0.74 mU/L (0.4–4.0) while TFTs on the 1 step Centaur platform showed a free T4 of 23.9 pmol/L (10.0–19.8), a free T3 of 6.7 pmol/L (3.5–6.5) and a TSH of 0.76 mU/L (0.35–5.50). The alpha subunit was in the normal range [0.9 IU/L (RR < 1.0)], but a thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test demonstrated a flat TSH response (TSH 0.73 / 0.72 / 0.70 mU/L at 0, 20 and 60 min respectively). A pituitary blood profile was unremarkable aside from a mildly elevated serum insulin-like growth factor 1 level (1.2 × upper limit of normal) (Table 2). An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed as a growth hormone suppression test. This showed borderline growth hormone suppression with a nadir of 0.43 ng/mL (Table 3). The patient had no clinical features of acromegaly. A T3 suppression test was considered but following discussion with the patient she decided against this.

### Evaluation and follow-up of clinically euthyroid children with normal free T4 and suppressed TSH [^a021beab]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

Although subnormal TSH between 0.1–0.4 mIU/L is fairly common and benign, suppression of TSH to < 0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4 is less common and more worrisome. We have conducted a retrospective chart review of a collection of such cases and have summarized the features and outcome on follow up.

Methods

We studied 23 consecutive patients referred from 2005–07 to our pediatric endocrine clinic with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L and free T4 in the range of 0.8–2 ng/dl. We collected historical, clinical and laboratory data, and analyzed their outcome.

Results

The natural evolutions of these subjects were separated into 4 groups. Group 1, 14 subjects, (61%) became euthyroid within a mean of 3.7 months. Group 2, 4 subjects, (17%) became hypothyroid within a mean of 2.8 months. Group 3, 2 subjects (9%) progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. Group 4, 3 subjects (13%) had persistently suppressed TSH, 8–14 months after initial testing, of which one had a multinodular goiter and had a thyroidectomy. Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) was seen in 54.5% of those tested.

Conclusion

Only 2/23 in our series became overtly hyperthyroid. Substantial number of subjects had a short period of transient TSH suppression that resolved spontaneously. Markers suggestive of autoimmune thyroid disease were consistently seen in group 2 and less so in others. It is prudent to observe such cases in the short term with serial follow up TSH, free T4 and T3, and to reserve further testing and treatment for those who become symptomatic or do not resolve.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac70a065]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

Investigations

Blood tests in the A&E department showed no abnormality apart from thyrotoxicosis with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) < 0.01 mU/L (reference range 0.3–4.2 mU/L); free thyroxine (T4) 97.5 pmol/L (reference range 12–22 pmol/L) and the free triiodothyronine (T3) level was 32.3 pmol/L (reference range 3.1–6.8 pmol/L). Full blood count, C reactive protein, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were normal.

Three days after discharge, a thyroid Technetium-99m uptake scan demonstrated scintigraphic findings consistent with Graves' disease, with uptake of 18.1% (reference range 1.6%–2.2%). There was uniform increased tracer uptake in the thyroid gland. TSH receptor antibody results came back 2 weeks after the A&E attendance and were positive at 5.6 IU/L (normal value < 0.9 IU/L), confirming the diagnosis of Graves' disease.
