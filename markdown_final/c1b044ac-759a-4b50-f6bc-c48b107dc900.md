Adverse effects of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Select all that apply.
Ototoxicity
Hyponatremia
Hypokalemia
dehydration
Hypoglycemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which adverse effects are associated with hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, specifically whether ototoxicity, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, dehydration, and hypoglycemia are valid selections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism of action to anchor which adverse effects are mechanistically plausible. Then, I should verify each proposed adverse effect against high-quality evidence and labeling. Next, I will consider dose-relatedness and monitoring guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, reference-supported answer and explicitly state which options are correct and why the others are not supported.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism, because that will shape which adverse effects are expected. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide-type diuretic that inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, producing natriuresis and kaluresis, which explains electrolyte disturbances and volume depletion, while also increasing uric acid and potentially affecting glucose metabolism; this mechanistic frame helps me anticipate hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and dehydration as plausible, and makes me cautious about claims like ototoxicity or hypoglycemia that are not typical for this class.

> Now, I will examine ototoxicity. Wait, let me verify whether thiazides cause ototoxicity. Ototoxicity is a recognized risk with loop diuretics such as furosemide, but it is not a characteristic adverse effect of thiazides like hydrochlorothiazide; I do not find evidence in the provided references linking HCTZ to ototoxicity, and this would be inconsistent with the class pharmacology, so I should not select ototoxicity here [^115UvYL9].

> Next, I should review hyponatremia. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether hyponatremia is documented with HCTZ. Multiple high-quality sources and guidelines list hyponatremia as a known adverse effect of thiazide diuretics, including HCTZ, and recommend monitoring sodium, particularly in older adults or those on thiazide monotherapy, so hyponatremia is a valid selection [^116ucgkw] [^111DpP7a] [^114t8uvZ].

> I will now examine hypokalemia. I should confirm that HCTZ causes potassium loss. The Cochrane review of thiazide monotherapy shows dose-related reductions in serum potassium, and multiple FDA labels and clinical studies document hypokalemia with HCTZ, including in combination products; this is a classic, dose-dependent adverse effect, so hypokalemia should be selected [^111poCTc] [^111DpP7a] [^114UmHVE].

> Let me consider dehydration. Mechanistically, natriuresis produces volume depletion, and clinical guidance highlights orthostatic symptoms and volume-related adverse effects with thiazides; dehydration is a clinically meaningful manifestation of this volume effect, so I should include dehydration as a valid adverse effect of HCTZ [^115UvYL9] [^116sKgzC].

> But wait, what about hypoglycemia. I need to check whether thiazides lower glucose or increase insulin requirements. The evidence consistently shows thiazides can worsen glucose tolerance and promote hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia; for example, the Cochrane review notes increased glucose with some thiazides, and the PATHWAY-3 trial showed that adding amiloride to HCTZ mitigated thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, which implies the direction of effect is toward higher, not lower, glucose; therefore, hypoglycemia is not an expected adverse effect of HCTZ and should not be selected [^111poCTc] [^1138QmrN] [^111poCTc].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the final selections. Valid adverse effects of hydrochlorothiazide among the options provided are hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and dehydration, whereas ototoxicity is not a thiazide adverse effect and hypoglycemia is mechanistically and clinically inconsistent with HCTZ's metabolic profile, which instead risks hyperglycemia; this aligns with guideline monitoring recommendations and the pharmacology of thiazide diuretics [^116ucgkw] [^112hnaWA] [^116sKgzC].

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for hypertension commonly causes **electrolyte disturbances** (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia) [^111poCTc], **volume depletion** (dehydration, orthostatic hypotension) [^115UvYL9], and **metabolic effects** (hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia) [^111poCTc]. Less common risks include **photosensitivity**, rash, and rare hypersensitivity reactions [^115UvYL9]. Ototoxicity and hypoglycemia are not recognized adverse effects of HCTZ [^116ucgkw].

---

## Electrolyte disturbances

- **Hypokalemia**: Dose-dependent and common; increases risk of arrhythmias and muscle cramps [^1179wYUi] [^114UmHVE].
- **Hyponatremia**: More frequent in older adults; can cause confusion, seizures, and coma [^116v641V].
- **Hypomagnesemia**: Occurs with prolonged use and can exacerbate arrhythmias [^notfound].

---

## Volume depletion and cardiovascular effects

- **Dehydration**: From natriuresis; presents as dry mouth, thirst, and reduced urine output [^notfound].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Especially in older adults or those on multiple antihypertensives [^115UvYL9].
- **Dizziness and lightheadedness**: Common with volume depletion [^notfound].

---

## Metabolic effects

- **Hyperglycemia**: Thiazides impair insulin sensitivity and can worsen glycemic control [^111poCTc].
- **Hyperuricemia**: Increases gout risk; monitor uric acid in susceptible patients [^116ucgkw].
- **Dyslipidemia**: Mild increases in LDL and triglycerides may occur [^1179wYUi].

---

## Dermatologic and hypersensitivity reactions

- **Photosensitivity**: Sunburn-like reactions with sun exposure [^115UvYL9].
- **Rash**: Maculopapular or urticarial eruptions can occur [^notfound].
- **Rare hypersensitivity**: Including anaphylaxis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Rare and serious adverse effects

Rare serious effects include **pancreatitis**, **hepatic injury**, and **blood dyscrasias** (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) [^notfound]. Interstitial nephritis and renal dysfunction are uncommon but reported [^notfound].

---

## Adverse effects not associated with hydrochlorothiazide

Ototoxicity is not a recognized adverse effect of HCTZ; it is associated with loop diuretics [^notfound]. Hypoglycemia is likewise not a recognized effect; HCTZ tends to raise glucose [^111poCTc].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring

- **Baseline labs**: Electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose before starting therapy [^116ucgkw].
- **Periodic monitoring**: Recheck electrolytes and renal function after dose changes or if symptoms arise [^116ucgkw].
- **Patient education**: Report muscle cramps, weakness, dizziness, or unusual symptoms promptly [^notfound].

---

Hydrochlorothiazide is effective for hypertension but carries risks of electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, and metabolic effects; **monitoring and patient education** mitigate harm, while ototoxicity and hypoglycemia are not concerns with HCTZ [^116ucgkw].

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes. In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively. Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide. In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence). Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of diuretics as second-line therapy for primary hypertension [^112qevVG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diuretics are widely prescribed for hypertension not only as a first-line drug but also as a second-line drug. Therefore, it is essential to determine the effects of diuretics on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) when given as a second-line drug.

Objectives

To quantify the additional reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of diuretic therapy as a second-line drug in patients with primary hypertension

Search Strategy

CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-July 2008), EMBASE (1988-July 2008) and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of a diuretic in combination therapy with another class of anti-hypertensive drugs compared with the respective monotherapy (without a diuretic) for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Fifty-three double-blind RCTs evaluating a thiazide in 15129 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 156/101 mmHg) were included. Hydrochlorothiazide was the thiazide used in 49/53 (92%) of the included studies. The additional BP reduction caused by the thiazide as a second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. Thiazides as a second-line drug reduced BP by 6/3 and 8/4 mmHg at doses of 1 and 2 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose respectively. The BP lowering effect was dose related. The effect was similar to that obtained when thiazides are used as a single agent. Only 3 double-blind RCTs evaluating loop diuretics were identified. These RCTs showed a BP lowering effect of a starting dose of about 6/3 mmHg.

Authors' Conclusions

Thiazides when given as a second-line drug have a dose related effect to lower blood pressure that is similar to when they are added as a first-line drug. This means that the BP lowering effect of thiazides is additive. Loop diuretics appear to have a similar blood pressure lowering effect as thiazides at 1 times the recommended starting dose. Because of the short duration of the trials and lack of reporting of adverse events, this review does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of adverse effects of diuretics given as a second-line drug.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^11137Ua6]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In clinical practice, there is a tendency to consider all molecules in a therapeutic class as equivalent. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. The data presented herein support a clear distinction between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Indapamide and chlorthalidone are sufficiently structurally and mechanistically distinct from HCTZ to warrant a separate classification and clinical data underscore the importance of distinguishing between these molecules in clinical practice.

Overall, the long-term risk:benefit ratio of thiazides is less favorable than that of thiazide-like diuretics; and an overwhelming amount of data describing HCTZ and its potential metabolic effects has skewed our understanding of treatment options away from diuretics in general. When thiazide-like diuretics are considered alone, for the many patients, for whom volume control is essential, the risk:benefit ratio shifts in favor of the diuretic treatment. In such patients, the benefits of volume control, blood pressure reduction, and long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality prevention exceed the risk of adverse events.

Looking forward, as most guidelines now recommend combination treatments, comparisons of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics should probably be made in the context of combinations with a RAS inhibitor. More studies and more single-pill combinations that include thiazide-like diuretics are needed.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117AiwWk]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As all monogenic forms of hypertension have sodium retention as the main mechanism of the increase in blood pressure, increasing urinary sodium excretion is a logical and fundamental part of treatment of hypertension. Consistent with this understanding, thiazide diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line antihypertensive options alongside calcium channel blockers and blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, randomized control trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that when compared with placebo or no treatment, blood pressure lowering by these antihypertensive drug classes is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate between the three options, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles. Multiple meta-analyses, for instance, have documented concerns that treatment with diuretics could lead to disruptions in electrolyte levels, to unfavorable metabolic effects, and to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. These data, though important, have generated a perhaps disproportionate fear of the side effects that can be associated with diuretic treatment.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^114T3Cvz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the long‐standing debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that the thiazide‐like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality compared with the thiazide‐type diuretics. These systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment. Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazidewhereas another one showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone. However, the follow‐up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical end points and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta‐analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection. Instead, what may be more helpful for current clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents. The Table, lists several pivotal RCTs of the thiazides published since 2000 relevant to common and everyday clinical scenarios. Chlorthalidone and indapamide treat hypertension effectively and safely in several clinical settings, including in patients with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors, prior stroke, elderly age, and advanced chronic kidney disease. Additionally, small RCTs have demonstrated that combination therapy containing chlorthalidone provides superior hypertension treatment compared with combination therapy containing hydrochlorothiazide and to combination therapy without any thiazide diuretic, including among patients with stage 2 hypertension. Finally, the thiazide‐like diuretics offer pleiotropic protection against cardiovascular diseases independently of blood pressure reduction. In contrast, no cardiovascular benefit with hydrochlorothiazide treatment has been consistently found. Despite these randomized data, the hydrochlorothiazide‐versus‐chlorthalidone debate has continued in part because until recently no trial had directly compared the 2.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^115mohmS]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114kSK7x]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings based on currently available data and the most recent advances in observational research do not support the use of chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide. This study found that chlorthalidone use was not associated with significant cardiovascular benefits when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, while its use was associated with greater risk of renal and electrolyte abnormalities. We acknowledge the possibility of residual confounding despite our analytic approach and diagnostics and look forward to the results of the ongoing randomized clinical trial.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115tnqZk]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with hypertension, is chlorthalidone superior to hydrochlorothiazide at preventing kidney outcomes?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 12 265 patients aged 65 years or older with hypertension, chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide in preventing kidney outcomes. There was an increased incidence of hypokalemia events in the chlorthalidone group compared with the hydrochlorothiazide group.

Meaning

Both chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide may be used for the treatment of hypertension and kidney outcomes.

These blood pressure-independent effects are likely to be fundamental contributors to the differences in long-term endpoints between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. They are also likely to be the result of pleiotropic effects that are not governed by the targeting of the kidney.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

Summary

What is known about topic

Thiazide-type diuretics are one of the initial agents, which are used in cases of uncomplicated hypertension.
The choice between HCTZ and CTLD for the treatment of hypertension is debatable and has lately been a topic of the science literature.
These two compounds are quite dissimilar pharmacokinetically despite their similar structure.
Differences in effects of the two drugs on clinical outcomes remain unclear.

What this study adds

The WMD (95% CI) of −3.26 mmHg for SBP change demonstrates prevalence for CTLD on the control of SBP.
The WMD (95% CI) is −2.41 mmHg for DBP change demonstrates slight superiority for CTLD for reduction of DBP.
The two medications do not show significant differences in their safety profile.
CTLD should be widely used as an alternative to HCTZ in clinical practice.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^113MHc4e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the most common medical condition addressed in the ambulatory setting and the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Optimal blood pressure control is thus an important target in cardiovascular disease prevention. Growing clinical evidence suggests that more intensive hypertension management reduces the risk of death and cardiovascular events, and as a result, a goal blood pressure of < 130/ < 80 mm Hg is now recommended for most patients with hypertension. In recent years, however, population rates of adequate blood pressure control have begun to decrease, driven in part by declining treatment effectiveness. Consequently, strategies to combat this developing crisis must be identified and implemented.

The thiazide diuretics are a heterogenous group of medications that can be divided by molecular structure into thiazide‐type diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, and thiazide‐like diuretics, which include chlorthalidone, indapamide, and metolazone. Thiazide diuretics are 1 of 3 first‐line antihypertensive classes but are less commonly selected as initial monotherapy or when dual therapy is needed. In the United States, thiazides account for 20% to 25% of hypertension prescriptions, of which 90% to 95% are for hydrochlorothiazide, approximately 5% for chlorthalidone, and < 1% for indapamide. Familiarity partly explains this great imbalance: hydrochlorothiazide is widely known and well regarded whereas clinicians may be less comfortable using chlorthalidone and may not be aware of indapamide at all. This familiarity may be reinforced when hydrochlorothiazide is used and presumably results in a positive reduction in a patient's blood pressure. A critical examination of the thiazide diuretics, however, reveals one potential solution for achieving better blood pressure control.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^115f546D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the thiazide‐like and thiazide‐type diuretics are clinically relevant to consider. Hydrochlorothiazide has a shorter duration of action (< 24 hours) compared with that of indapamide (> 24 hours) and chlorthalidone (48–72 hours), and hydrochlorothiazide is less potent per milligram than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide has inferior 24‐hour and nighttime blood pressure control compared with chlorthalidone. When considering tolerability, chlorthalidone likely carries an increased risk of hypokalemia. Indapamide may offer the best tolerability: hypokalemia appears to occur less frequently than with hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide has neutral effects on serum glucose and lipids (whereas hydrochlorothiazide does not). It is important to consider, too, that the antihypertensive and metabolic adverse effects of the thiazide diuretics may not be the same across all racial and ethnic groups. A post hoc analysis of the PEAR (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses) and PEAR‐2 clinical trials, which randomized patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension but without diabetes or prior cardiovascular disease to hydrochlorothiazide (PEAR‐1) and chlorthalidone (PEAR‐2) or a beta blocker, found that chlorthalidone was more potent than hydrochlorothiazide in both Black and White patients; however, Black patients had robust blood pressure decreases with both hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone, resulting in a smaller differential between the 2 agents. In addition, although both Black patients and White patients had hypokalemia more frequently with chlorthalidone, Black patients were more likely to reach a serum potassium level of < 3.0 mEq/L with chlorthalidone.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114KJgdd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our observational analysis across 3 large and disparate databases showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide for a range of cardiovascular outcomes, but chlorthalidone had a worse safety profile, including an association with an increased risk of hypokalemia with an HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12). Other electrolyte abnormalities were also more frequent.

Our study is the largest multisite analysis of real-world evidence to address this comparison, with 36 918 records of individuals prescribed chlorthalidone and 693 337 prescribed hydrochlorothiazide across the 3 databases. We found consistent results across our 3 databases, excellent balance on more than 60 000 covariates after stratification, little bias based on our controls, little sensitivity to changes in time at risk, to inclusion of baseline blood pressure or to initial dose, and confirmation of differences in potassium by laboratory measurement.

Table.
Major Randomized Controlled Trials of the Thiazide Diuretics Since 2000

The DCP (Diuretic Comparison Project), published in December 2022, was the first RCT to study hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone head to head. After a median follow‐up of 2.4 years among more than 13 500 Veterans Affairs patients, there were no differences in the primary outcome (a composite of death and major adverse cardiovascular events) or in any of its components. To conclude, however, that DCP finally showed chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are equivalent is an overstatement. Among DCP's strengths are its pragmatic design and methods, but there was a lower‐than‐expected primary outcome event rate and the doses of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone used were lower than those studied in prior RCTs. Nevertheless, to date, no RCT directly comparing the thiazide diuretics has shown that either chlorthalidone or indapamide is superior to hydrochlorothiazide in reducing cardiovascular events or mortality.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^113iMB9b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Based on recent national surveys, blood pressure (BP) control rates for patients with hypertension continue to be low and improvements in therapeutic management strategies are required in order for more patients to reach target BP goals. It is well recognized that most patients with hypertension will require two or more antihypertensive agents for effective BP control. Rational combinations of antihypertensive agents as single-pill formulations are readily available, but their use remains low primarily due to health care providers who are reluctant to intensify therapy. Earlier and more frequent use of combination therapy in the management of hypertension would greatly improve BP control rates. The FDA recently approved single-pill combinations of an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and combinations of ARB with amlodipine for initial treatment of hypertension in patients whose BP would not be controlled on monotherapy alone. The initial therapy indication did not stipulate the BP level at which combination therapy should be initiated, but current treatment guidelines suggest that use of combination therapy should be guided by baseline BP and the cardiovascular (CV) risk status of the patient.

For patients unresponsive to valsartan or low-dose HCTZ monotherapy, addition of the other agent has resulted in further reductions of BP, without increase in adverse events (AEs). The excellent tolerability and complementary BP-lowering effects of this combination makes it an ideal agent for initial use in patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension. The primary arguments against initiating treatment with combination therapy for hypertension are based on clinical need and safety concerns. Initial combination therapy for patients whose BP could be controlled by monotherapy, may lead to excessive drops in BP and thus increase the risk for hypotension-related AEs. Common practice is to initiate treatment with low-dose monotherapy and up-titrate to higher dose every 4 weeks. There has been no prospective study that has evaluated initial combination therapy using valsartan and HCTZ as compared with monotherapy when evaluating BP control rates and time to BP control in patients with primary essential hypertension without additional CV risk factors. Based on the need for improved BP control strategies, we conducted a study to determine the efficacy of initial combination therapy with valsartan and HCTZ for patients with stage-1 or stage-2, uncomplicated hypertension as compared with initiating therapy with low (80 mg) or higher dose (160 mg) valsartan monotherapy.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^111EyFYE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether chlorthalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension is unclear.

Methods

In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned adults 65 years of age or older who were patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system and had been receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a daily dose of 25 or 50 mg to continue therapy with hydrochlorothiazide or to switch to chlorthalidone at a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death. Safety was also assessed.

Results

A total of 13,523 patients underwent randomization. The mean age was 72 years. At baseline, hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25 mg per day had been prescribed in 12,781 patients (94.5%). The mean baseline systolic blood pressure in each group was 139 mm Hg. At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, there was little difference in the occurrence of primary-outcome events between the chlorthalidone group (702 patients [10.4%]) and the hydrochlorothiazide group (675 patients [10.0%]) (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.16; P = 0.45). There were no between-group differences in the occurrence of any of the components of the primary outcome. The incidence of hypokalemia was higher in the chlorthalidone group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (6.0% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this large pragmatic trial of thiazide diuretics at doses commonly used in clinical practice, patients who received chlorthalidone did not have a lower occurrence of major cardiovascular outcome events or non-cancer-related deaths than patients who received hydrochlorothiazide.

Study Design

This study follows a retrospective, observational, comparative cohort design. We included all patients initiating antihypertensive treatment with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, and we defined the index time as the first observed exposure to either drug, including only patients with a prior or concurrent diagnosis of hypertension. We excluded patients having known prior exposure to any hypertension therapies (eAppendix in the Supplement) and those initiating another hypertension treatment within 7 days after starting chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide; however, a patient remained in the cohort if they initiated another hypertension treatment after the 7 days. We required that patients have continuous observation in the database for at least 365 days before treatment initiation. We excluded patients with known prior outcome events and less than 1 day at risk. Full cohort details are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

We used more than 60 000 patient features per database, including demographics (age, sex, index year, index month), all other drugs in the 365 days before the index date, all diagnoses in the 365 days before the index date, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score, as baseline covariates for balancing cohorts. Table 1 shows a sample of covariates.

Selected Baseline Characteristics for CCAE a

The primary outcomes, which we prespecified, were hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a composite cardiovascular disease outcome including the first 3 outcomes and sudden cardiac death (eAppendix in the Supplement). International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research reporting guideline was followed.

The 51 safety outcomes, which we prespecified, included electrolyte disorders, such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia, acute and chronic kidney disease, and gout. They were assembled from safety concerns reported on hypertension drug product labels, and they are defined in the eAppendix in the Supplement. We began the outcome risk window 1 day after treatment initiation and used 2 design choices to define the window end. First, we ended the outcome time-at-risk window at first cessation of continuous drug exposure, analogous to an on-treatment design. Second, we ended the outcome time-at-risk window when the patient was no longer in the database or the outcome occurred, analogous to an intention-to-treat design. Continuous drug exposures were constructed from the available longitudinal data by considering sequential dispensing or prescriptions with gaps less than 30 days. We show on-treatment results in this article and intention-to-treat results in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^115wdkuP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age, and most hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality occur in older individuals. The health burden related to uncontrolled hypertension has diminished over time, owing to effective pharmacotherapy. As a class, thiazide diuretics effectively lower blood pressure (BP), reduce cardiovascular events, and are recommended as first-line antihypertensive agents. However, whether a specific thiazide is preferable in terms of safety and clinical outcomes remains unclear.

Hydrochlorothiazide is the most prescribed thiazide diuretic in North America, despite being shorter-actingand less potent (per milligram), than chlorthalidone. Limited head-to-head observational studies comparing these drugs have yielded mixed results. While older studies suggested that chlorthalidone was superior in controlling BP and reducing cardiovascular events, recent studies have demonstrated equivalency in cardiovascular risk reduction but a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes and hypokalemia with chlorthalidone.

Hypertension is nearly ubiquitous in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a prevalence of more than 80%, including more than 50% requiring 3 or more antihypertensive medications. Despite early studies suggesting that thiazides have less diuretic and antihypertensive effects in CKD, recent studies have suggested that they remain effective in this population. Thiazides are now commonly prescribed to individuals with CKD. However, little is known about how chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide compare among individuals with CKD. Herein, we conducted a large population-based retrospective cohort study of older adults to compare safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use across varying levels of kidney function.

### Hydrochlorothiazide versus chlorthalidone: evidence supporting their interchangeability [^112jnGcT]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are one of the preferred pharmacologic treatments for hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone have been the 2 most commonly used diuretics in major clinical trials. Treatment guidelines and compendia often consider these 2 drugs interchangeable agents within the class of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. Many sources list them as equipotent. Despite these beliefs, there is some suggestion that cardiovascular outcomes are not necessarily the same with these 2 drugs. We conducted a literature search from 1960 to 2003 to identify studies that evaluated the pharmacokinetic and blood pressure-lowering effects of these 2 agents. There are significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between these diuretics. Chlorthalidone is approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times as potent as hydrochlorothiazide, and the former has a much longer duration of action. Whether these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features cause differences in outcomes is not known.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^112cmVxo]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The results of this study raised the question whether all thiazide-type diuretics are equal. Several successful diuretic studies used chlorthalidone in a dose of up to 25 mg/day. A meta-analysis of trials done until 2004 reported similar clinical CV outcomes across the class. However, these studies used doses of these agents that were higher than the 12.5–25 mg/day dose of hydrochlorothiazide used in the ACCOMPLISH study. Recent data suggest that chlorthalidone is 1.5- to 2-fold more potent in lowering BP than hydrochlorothiazide. Thus, to achieve the beneficial effect with diuretics, one should use hydrochlorothiazide in a dose of up to at least 37.5 mg/day. Another thiazide-like diuretic that is less discussed is indapamide. This agent has less adverse effect on metabolic parameters than other diuretics, is more effective than enalapril in reducing left ventricular mass, is equivalent to enalapril in reducing microalbuminuria, and is effective in reducing CV morbidity and mortality in clinical trials. Thus, the use of indapamide as a leading diuretic agent may be worthwhile.

### Telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide versus telmisartan or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial [^1156BWnR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recent surveys reveal continuing deficiencies in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. In many cases, failure to achieve blood pressure targets may be attributable to the use of antihypertensive monotherapy.

Objectives

This study was undertaken to identify combinations of telmisartan, a new oral angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonist, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) that might provide greater antihypertensive efficacy than monotherapy with either agent in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It also examined the dose-response surface for the 2 drugs alone and in combination.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that employed all cells of a 4 x 5 factorial design. After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, men and women between 18 and 80 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension (defined as mean supine diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 95 and 114 mm Hg during the last 2 weeks of the placebo run-in period and systolic blood pressure [SBP] between 114 and 200 mm Hg immediately before randomization) were eligible to enter the 8-week, double-blind, double-dummy treatment period. Study comparisons were between once-daily telmisartan monotherapy (20, 40, 80, or 160 mg), HCTZ monotherapy (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg), 12 combinations of these telmisartan/HCTZ doses, and placebo. The focus was on 2 combinations: telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. The primary efficacy variable was change in supine trough DBP from baseline to the last evaluable measurement during double-blind treatment. Plasma renin activity and safety parameters, including treatment-emergent adverse events, physical findings, electrocardiograms, and serum electrolyte levels (which are known to increase with HCTZ treatment), were also assessed.

Results

Of 1293 patients screened, 818 (63.3%) were enrolled at 47 centers. Of these 818, 749 (91.6%) completed the study. The intent-to-treat population (randomized with ≥ 1 postrandomization blood pressure measurement) consisted of 807 patients (98.7%). Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg significantly decreased mean supine trough SBP/DBP by 23.9/14.9 mm Hg, a benefit of 8.5/3.4 mm Hg compared with telmisartan 80 mg and of 17.0/7.6 mm Hg compared with HCTZ 12.5 mg (both comparisons, P < 0.01). Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg significantly reduced mean supine SBP by 18.8 mm Hg, a benefit of 6.6 mm Hg compared with telmisartan 40 mg and 11.9 mm Hg compared with HCTZ 12.5 mg (both, P < 0.01). This same combination significantly reduced mean supine DBP by 12.6 mm Hg, a benefit of 5.3 mm Hg compared with HCTZ 12.5 mg (P < 0.01), but was not significantly different from telmisartan 40 mg. Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was significantly more effective than telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg in reducing mean supine DBP and SBP (both, P < 0.05). The response surface and responder analyses confirmed the additive antihypertensive efficacy of the combination of telmisartan and HCTZ. All regimens were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Once-daily telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was effective and well tolerated when used to reduce SBP and DBP in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition to enhancing efficacy, this combination protected against potassium depletion, a common side effect of thiazide monotherapy.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114t8uvZ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher rate of electrolyte and renal disorders, with an increase in hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. Based on the electrolyte findings, chlorthalidone's association with an increase in rate of type II diabetes may be associated with potassium depletion or to dehydration. Chlorthalidone's lower rate of abnormal weight gain may be associated with more effective diuresis.

To our knowledge, there have been no completed large head-to-head randomized clinical trials comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide on cardiovascular effectiveness. An indirect meta-analysis by Thomopoulos et allooked at cardiovascular outcomes vs placebo for low-dose diuretics; there were nominal differences, but the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelineinterpreted the results as roughly equivalent for the 2 drugs. The indirect meta-analysis by Roush et alshowed an improved relative risk for composite cardiovascular events for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.88). The real-world evidence study by Dhalla et alestimated an HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.81–1.06), although 1 dose subgroup did reach statistical significance without adjustment for multiple hypotheses. An observational study of the MRFIT cohort by Dorsch et alshowed a relative HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68–0.92), but the doses for both drugs were high. A randomized clinical trial comparing hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone currently in progressmay provide more definitive information to inform drug choice.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^117XP6yg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure-the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)-and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring-the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^116CZEms]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated in those patients with hypertension or with congestive heart failure who develop hypokalemia when thiazides or other kaliuretic diuretics are used alone, or in whom maintenance of normal serum potassium levels is considered to be clinically important, e.g., digitalized patients, or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias.

The use of potassium-conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet.

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used alone or as an adjunct to other antihypertensive drugs, such as methyldopa or beta blockers. Since amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide enhances the action of these agents, dosage adjustments may be necessary to avoid an excessive fall in blood pressure and other unwanted side effects.

The fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of edema or hypertension except in individuals in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked.

Discussion

Diuretics have been used as the control drug in many large hypertension studies, but have rarely in the past 10 years been the main target of interest or studied in maximally efficacious doses. Our study provides answers to several questions about diuretics that had not been previously investigated or resolved. We showed that, after 24 weeks of treatment, a potassium-sparing diuretic reduces blood pressure as efficaciously as high-dose thiazide without inducing adverse effects on blood glucose concentrations. Furthermore, a combination of half the conventional doses of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was not associated with increased 2 h glucose concentrations compared with hydrochlorothiazide treatment alone but produced significantly larger reductions in blood pressure than full doses of either diuretic given alone. Amiloride monotherapy did not cause clinically significant hyperkalaemia, and the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination did not significantly affect potassium concentrations.

Hitherto, the mechanism and prospects for prevention of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance were uncertain; the role of potassium in this problem was also unclear. A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working party in 2008 identified potassium as "perhaps the most attractive variable" in developing a hypothesis for the mechanism of the thiazide response, and called for studies of potassium-sparing diuretics, among others. Amiloride has been licensed for hypertension for almost as long as hydrochlorothiazide, but has rarely been used or studied in doses that lower blood pressure as effectively as high-dose thiazides or other diuretic classes. That matched doses of thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics, with similar efficacy on blood pressure, could neutralise the undesirable effects of each class while synergising to enhance reduction of blood pressure was an attractive hypothesis, but there were many unknowns, such as whether amiloride — in the context of blockade of the RAS in most patients — could be safely used at a dose large enough to match the blood pressure reduction of hydrochlorothiazide without causing hazardous electrolyte abnormalities.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^116iwcfR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

This prospective, 6-week, multicenter, double-blind study examined the benefits of initiating treatment with combination valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared with initial valsartan monotherapy for 648 patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension (age = 52.6 ± 10 years; 54% male; baseline blood pressure (BP) = 161/98 mm Hg, 32% stage 1). Patients were randomized to valsartan 80 mg (V-low), valsartan 160 mg (V-high) or valsartan/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (V/HCTZ), and electively titrated after weeks 2 and 4 to the next dosage level (maximum dose valsartan/HCTZ 160/25 mg) if BP remained > 140/90 mm Hg. At end of the study, patients initiated with V/HCTZ required less titration steps compared with the initial valsartan monotherapy groups (63 vs 86% required titration by study end, respectively) and reached the target BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg in a shorter period of time (2.8 weeks) (P < 0.0001) vs V-low (4.3 weeks) and V-high (3.9 weeks). Initial combination therapy was also associated with higher BP control rates and greater reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP from baseline (63%, −27.7 ± 13/–15.1 ± 8 mm Hg) compared with V-low (46%, −21.2 ± 13/−11.4 ± 8 mm Hg, P < 0.0001) or V-high (51%, −24.0 ± 13/−12.0 ± 10 mm Hg, P < 0.01). Overall and drug-related AEs were mild to moderate and were similar between V/HCTZ (53.1 and 14.1%, respectively) and the two monotherapy groups, V-low (50.5 and 13.8%) and V-high (50.7 and 11.8%). In conclusion, initiating therapy with a combination of valsartan and low-dose HCTZ results in early, improved BP efficacy with similar tolerability as compared with starting treatment with a low or higher dose of valsartan for patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension.

### Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^115Cx9qn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in over 2500 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 200 were treated for more than 1 year.

The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 7% of U.S. patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.

The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were cough (1.0%; see PRECAUTIONS), "dizziness" (1.0%), headache (0.6%), and fatigue (0.6%).

The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below.

Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in 0.3% to 1.0% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide were the following:

### Thiazides in the management of hypertension in older adults-a systematic review [^111MDSVn]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review investigated the benefits and risks of treatment with thiazides for the management of hypertension in older people. This systematic review was one of a series of systematic reviews on commonly used drugs in older people and aimed to identify evidence to develop recommendations relating to inappropriate use and discontinuation of these medications in older adults. Overall, the evidence suggests a benefit of thiazide treatment for the management of hypertension in older people for clinically relevant outcomes such as cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially stroke.

These results are in the line with the results seen in younger populations, where thiazides appear to reduce mortality, stroke, cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease. Except for a reduction of mortality which was less clear in our age group, we found similar results. Despite the fact that thiazides are among the drugs that often cause hospitalisation, this outcome was not found in the present study. We found an increased risk for gout but mixed results for other adverse events. Frequent adverse events of thiazides include electrolyte imbalances, but our systematic review focused on clinical outcomes and we did not include studies reporting about abnormal laboratory measurements.

Based on the evidence identified, three recommendations on potential discontinuation or lowering of the dose of thiazides were developed. Although some evidence for risks of thiazide treatment was also identified, the research team considered that a general recommendation for the discontinuation of thiazide treatment in older adults would be inappropriate.

Despite the currently ongoing discussion that chlorthalidone may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular events we found no convincing evidence that a certain thiazide may be more beneficial in the treatment of hypertension. Some studies suggest that chlorthalidone shows more benefit compared to hydrochlorothiazide. In contrast, we included a retrospective cohort study showing no significant difference regarding the efficacy of both drugs, but in this study chlorthalidone was associated with more adverse events in older patients. This effect, though, was mainly present for high doses of chlorthalidone.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115qcw8c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

There are also several weaknesses to this analysis. The trial only included individuals previously taking hydrochlorothiazide and likely limited adverse effects associated with thiazide diuretics (ie, hyponatremia). Similarly, individuals switched to chlorthalidone experienced a greater incidence of self-reported adverse events and switches back to hydrochlorothiazide. This was likely related to trial design, as those randomized to chlorthalidone started taking a new medication, whereas those randomized to hydrochlorothiazide continued taking a medication that they previously tolerated. The trial randomized patients to chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, and after randomization all follow-up was left to the primary care physician. There were no protocoled laboratory evaluations, including for kidney function or potassium levels. Results presented are from clinically evaluated laboratory values, resulting in varying numbers of laboratory values for each participant. This may have led to differential outcome ascertainment by group; however, it is likely that randomization removed both measured and unmeasured confounding for follow-up care. Dialysis initiation was ascertained using claims data, which have high specificity but lack sensitivity. Although some events may have been missed, it is likely that these missed events were balanced between groups given the randomized study design. Another limitation is that 95% of participants were initially taking the lower doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (12.5 mg/d), so any potential harmful or beneficial kidney effects of the 50- or 25-mg doses, respectively, may have been missed.

### Head-to-head comparisons of hydrochlorothiazide with indapamide and chlorthalidone: antihypertensive and metabolic effects [^113zM238]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has often been contrasted with chlorthalidone, but relatively little is known about HCTZ versus indapamide (INDAP). This systematic review retrieved 9765 publications, and from these, it identified 14 randomized trials with 883 patients comparing HCTZ with INDAP and chlorthalidone on antihypertensive potency or metabolic effects. To make fair comparisons, the dose of the diuretic in each arm was assigned 1 of 3 dose levels. In random effects meta-analysis, INDAP and chlorthalidone lowered systolic blood pressure more than HCTZ: -5.1 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -8.7 to -1.6); P = 0.004 and -3.6 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -7.3 to 0.0); P = 0.052, respectively. For both comparisons, there was minimal heterogeneity in effect across trials and no evidence for publication bias. The HCTZ-INDAP contrast was biased in favor of greater HCTZ potency because of a much greater contribution to the overall effect from trials in which the HCTZ arm had a higher dose level than the INDAP arm. For the HCTZ-INDAP comparison, no single trial was responsible for the overall result nor was it possible to detect significant modifications of this comparison by duration of follow-up, high- versus low-bias trials, or the presence or absence of background medications. There were no detectable differences between HCTZ and INDAP in metabolic adverse effects, including effects on serum potassium. In conclusion, these head-to-head comparisons demonstrate that, like chlorthalidone, INDAP is more potent than HCTZ at commonly prescribed doses without evidence for greater adverse metabolic effects.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111poCTc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated the high degree of efficacy of blood pressure (BP)-lowering in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons by meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of the several thiazides, alone and associated with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remained uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. In two isolated trials, however, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and the replacement of a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals reduced BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT showed that replacing 25% of the sodium chloride content with potassium chloride was associated with reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone have been well documented; however, these drugs are not commonly used with thiazides in fixed combinations.

Thiazides have been associated with adverse metabolic effects, including hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypomagnesemia in a dose-dependent fashion. The risk of hypokalaemia, impaired glucose tolerance or sudden death may be minimized by combining thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride or triamterene).

The critical role of potassium in BP control and the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics suggest that potassium-sparing diuretics can be effective adjuncts in treating hypertension. The scarcity of direct comparisons between thiazides alone with thiazides associated with potassium-sparing diuretics concerning their BP-lowering and adverse effects motivated this systematic review with a Bayesian network meta-analysis.

### Effects of thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics on cardiovascular events and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ZDyW2]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. According to their molecular structure, thiazide diuretics can be divided in thiazide-type (TT) and thiazide-like (TL) diuretics. TL diuretics have a longer elimination half-life compared with TT diuretics and have been shown to exert additional pharmacological effects, which may differently affect cardiovascular risk. In this meta-analysis, we compared the effects of TT and TL diuretics on cardiovascular events and mortality. Randomized, controlled studies in adult hypertensive patients that compared TT or TL diuretics with placebo or antihypertensive drugs and had ≥ 1 year follow-up were included. Primary outcome was cardiovascular events; secondary outcomes included coronary events, heart failure, cerebrovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to identify confounders and correct for the achieved blood pressure reductions. Twenty-one studies with > 480000 patient-years were included. Outcomes were not affected by heterogeneity in age, sex, and ethnicity among included studies, whereas larger blood pressure reductions were significantly associated with increased risk reductions for all outcomes (P < 0.001). Corrected for differences in office blood pressure reductions among trials, TL diuretics resulted in a 12% additional risk reduction for cardiovascular events (P = 0.049) and a 21% additional risk reduction for heart failure (P = 0.023) when compared with TT diuretics. The incidence of adverse events was comparable among TT, TL diuretics, and other antihypertensive therapy. Our data suggest that the best available evidence seems to favor TL diuretics as the drug of choice when thiazide treatment is considered for hypertension.

### Are diuretics a clandestine risk factor for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension? [^115d76VK]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The control of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension is paramount and requires the use of thiazide or loop diuretics to enhance renal salt excretion and reduce expanded body fluid volumes. However, the use of diuretics in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension without suppressing the production of aldosterone and MR (mineralocorticosteroid receptor) activation and signaling may not be sufficient to prevent the development of heart failure and excessive cardiovascular mortality and the progression of chronic kidney disease. This review examines the evidence that diuretic therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension may constitute a risk factor for preventable cardiovascular and renal disease progression that is concealed by the strong offsetting effects of a fall in blood pressure. To gain the full benefits of diuretic therapy in treatment-resistant hypertension may require the earlier prescription of MR antagonists coincident with diuretics rather than delaying their use to fourth-line agents in those who remain uncontrolled. This will require testing in appropriate clinical trials.

### Impact of angiotensin receptor blockade in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in 2121 patients with stage 1–2 hypertension [^116fA7ri]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The antihypertensive effects of telmisartan 80 mg versus valsartan 160 mg, both combined with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg, were assessed in a pooled analysis from two large trials with identical study designs in patients with stage 1–2 hypertension. The trials were double-blind with a 4:4:1 randomization scheme to compare once-daily telmisartan 80 mg and HCTZ 25 mg versus once-daily valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 25 mg versus once-daily placebo on reductions in clinic blood pressure (BP). The primary end point was changes from baseline in BP at the end of 8 weeks. In total, 2121 patients were randomized (telmisartan-HCTZ, 942, valsartan-HCTZ, 952, and placebo, 227) and had baseline seated BPs of 154/102 and 155/102 mm Hg in the two studies, respectively. Changes from baseline in BP after administration of telmisartan-HCTZ (-24.5/-18.0 mm Hg) were significantly greater than for both placebo (-4.1/-6.5 mm Hg) and valsartan-HCTZ (-22.3/-16.8 mm Hg) (versus placebo, P < 0.0001 for systolic and diastolic BP; versus valsartan-HCTZ, P = 0.0004 for systolic BP and P = 0.0019 for diastolic BP). Adverse event rates were higher in the placebo group than in the active treatment groups (placebo, 41%, telmisartan-HCTZ, 30%, and valsartan-HCTZ, 30%, P < 0.05). These data confirm that telmisartan-HCTZ at doses of 80/25 mg lowered systolic and diastolic BP to a greater extent than valsartan-HCTZ at doses of 160/25 mg in stage 1–2 hypertension. The magnitude of the BP-lowering effect provides support for the use of angiotensin receptor blockers with higher doses of a thiazide diuretic (25 mg) to improve hypertension control.

### Comparison of valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy at doses up to 320 / 25 mg versus monotherapy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by long-term combination therapy in hypertensive adults [^115wdwgV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

One third of patients treated for hypertension attain adequate blood pressure (BP) control, and multidrug regimens are often required. Given the lifelong nature of hypertension, there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-hypertensive therapies.

Objective

This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan (VAL) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential hypertension.

Methods

The first part of this study was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group trial. Patients with essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic BP [MSDBP], ≥ 95 mm Hg and < 110 mm Hg) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups: VAL 160 or 320 mg; HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg; VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5, 320/12.5, or 320/25 mg; or placebo. Mean changes in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP) were analyzed at the 8-week core study end point. VAL/HCTZ 320/12.5 and 320/25 mg were further investigated in a 54-week, open-label extension. Response was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg or a ≥ 10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline. Control was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg compared with baseline. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry.

Results

A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study (734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 Asian, 108 other; mean age, 52.7 years; mean weight, 92.6 kg). All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (VAL and HCTZ, P < 0.001). Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, P < 0.001). The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo. The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg compared with VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (P < 0.002). Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy. The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL/HCTZ combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with HCTZ monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%). The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity. The efficacy and tolerability of VAL/HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension (797 patients).

Conclusions

In this study population, combination therapies with VAL/HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117NrVSA]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition, with 92% of individuals having concomitant hypertension. Individuals with CKD and hypertension have an increased risk of both cardiovascular disease and progression of kidney disease. Extracellular volume excess is considered a primary driver of hypertension and CKD. Hypertension is a major cause of kidney failure requiring treatment (KFRT) and is the second most common cause of KFRT in the US. Thiazide diuretics improve cardiovascular outcomes; however, there is limited evidence regarding the influence of diuretics on progression of kidney disease or the development of end-stage kidney disease. Secondary analysis of ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) suggested that individuals randomized to chlorthalidone had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 3 to 6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 lower at year 4 compared with those randomized to amlodipine. However, there was no difference in the incidence of a 50% reduction in eGFR or development of KFRT. Long-term follow-up from ALLHAT demonstrated no difference in KFRT when comparing chlorthalidone with either the amlodipine or lisinopril groups.

Although diuretics can improve cardiovascular outcomes in those with CKD, it is unclear whether all thiazide diuretics are similar regarding clinical outcomes. Additionally, thiazide diuretics have differing incidences of hypokalemia, which may increase the risk of both cardiovascular disease and progression of kidney disease. Many clinical trials, evaluating cardiovascular outcomes have found that chlorthalidone is beneficial. Several observational studies, comparing chlorthalidone with hydrochlorothiazide have suggested an increased risk of acute kidney injury and progression of kidney disease with chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide.

The Diuretic Comparison Project (DCP) was a large, pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing chlorthalidone with hydrochlorothiazide and demonstrated no difference between groups for major adverse cardiovascular events and noncancer death. Adverse kidney events were a prespecified secondary outcome in the DCP protocol, and we aimed to examine whether chlorthalidone was superior to hydrochlorothiazide at preventing kidney outcomes. Assessment of treatment effects on risks of exploratory kidney outcomes and adverse events (eg, hypokalemia and acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization) were also included in the current secondary analysis.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^116ciKVY]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Many guidelines recommend CTLD and HCTZ as a first-line therapy for mild to moderate essential hypertension. However, HCTZ seems to be the more commonly used diuretic. Our meta-analysis has demonstrated a slight superiority for CTLD regarding BP control. At the same time, the two medications do not show significant differences in their safety profile although data concerning their effect on serum potassium and sodium is scarce. Additional studies investigating rates of hypokalemia and hyponatremia should be performed. Based on our results we think CTLD should be widely used as an alternative to HCTZ in clinical practice.

### The place of diuretics in preventing cardiovascular events [^115xgoAp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Low-dose diuretics are recommended for the initial choice of antihypertensive therapy in the 7th US Joint National Committee report and are accepted as an appropriate choice among other classes of drugs in the 2003 European Society of Hypertension guidelines. The rationales for the use of low-dose diuretics include the following: Renal dysfunction interfering with normal natriuresis is likely a fundamental defect in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Subtle renal insufficiency that interferes with sodium excretion is a common consequence of uncontrolled hypertension. Diuretic-based therapy has been clearly documented in placebo-controlled, randomized trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in the treatment of elderly hypertensives. In multiple comparative trials, diuretic-based therapy has been shown to provide equal cardiovascular protection to that provided by newer agents. Diuretics enhance the antihypertensive efficacy of all other classes of agents. As lower blood pressure goals of therapy have been found to be needed, diuretic enhancement of other agents' efficacy has become even more essential. With such low doses, side effects are minimal in degree and infrequent in appearance.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Combination treatment with telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension [^111ZHsR3]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is commonly used to treat black patients with hypertension. To avoid the metabolic disturbances associated with high-dose HCTZ, blood pressure control may be achieved by combining low doses with another antihypertensive.

Hypothesis

The study was undertaken to assess the tolerability and antihypertensive dose-response efficacy of telmisartan and HCTZ and their combination in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension (mean supine blood pressure 140/95–200/114 mmHg).

Methods

Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 222 black patients were randomized to once-daily treatment with one of 20 different double-blind combinations of telmisartan (0, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg) and HCTZ (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks.

Results

Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) — primary efficacy parameter — by 13.3 mmHg, and supine trough systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 21.5 mmHg. These reductions represented benefits of 13.7/8.7 mmHg over telmisartan 80 mg and 12.3/8.1 mmHg over HCTZ 12.5 mg (p < 0.01). Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine trough SBP/DBP by 14.3/10.0 mmHg, amounting to 12.3/3.3 mmHg more than telmisartan 40 mg and 5.1/4.8 mmHg more than HCTZ 12.5 mg. This reached significance for the comparisons with telmisartan 40 mg for SBP and HCTZ 12.5 mg for DBP (p < 0.05). A response surface analysis and therapeutic response rates confirmed the additive antihypertensive effects of telmisartan and HCTZ. All treatments were well tolerated, with side-effect profiles comparable with placebo. Adverse events were mainly transient and of mild to moderate severity.

Conclusions

Telmisartan 80 mg combined with HCTZ 12.5 mg is effective and well tolerated in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension, providing greater antihypertensive activity than the corresponding monotherapies.

### Chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^116v641V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some evidence suggests that chlorthalidone may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide in older adults.

Design

Propensity score-matched observational cohort study with up to 5 years of follow-up.

Setting

Ontario, Canada.

Patients

All individuals aged 66 years or older who were newly treated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide and were not hospitalized for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction in the prior year were eligible for inclusion. Each chlorthalidone recipient was matched to up to 2 hydrochlorothiazide recipients on the basis of age, sex, year of treatment initiation, and propensity score.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a composite of death or hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Safety outcomes included hospitalization with hypokalemia or hyponatremia.

Results

A total of 29 873 patients were studied. During follow-up, chlorthalidone recipients (n = 10 384) experienced the primary outcome at a rate of 3.2 events per 100 person-years of follow-up, and hydrochlorothiazide recipients experienced 3.4 events per 100 person-years of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.06]). Patients treated with chlorthalidone were more likely to be hospitalized with hypokalemia (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06 [CI, 2.04 to 4.58]) or hyponatremia (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.68 [CI, 1.24 to 2.28]). In 9 post hoc analyses comparing patients initially prescribed 12.5, 25, or 50 mg of chlorthalidone per day with those prescribed 12.5, 25, or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day, the former were more likely to be hospitalized with hypokalemia for all 6 comparisons in which a statistically significant association was found. The results of other effectiveness and safety outcomes were also consistent with those of the main analysis.

Limitation

Unmeasured differences in baseline characteristics or physician treatment approaches or an insufficiently large sample may have limited the ability to detect small differences in the comparative effectiveness of the drugs.

Conclusion

As typically prescribed, chlorthalidone in older adults was not associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular events or deaths than hydrochlorothiazide. However, it was associated with a greater incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^113jGVnX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Additional analyses were conducted using a chlorthalidone to hydrochlorothiazide dose-matching scheme of 1 mg:3 mg based on categories of low-dose (chlorthalidone ≤ 12.5 mg/d matched to hydrochlorothiazide ≤ 37.5 mg/d), medium-dose (chlorthalidone 12.6–25 mg/d matched to hydrochlorothiazide 37.6–75 mg/d), and high-dose (chlorthalidone > 25 mg/d matched to hydrochlorothiazide > 75 mg/d). A second analysis was conducted censoring participants at drug discontinuation (ie, an as-treated design). A third analyses used propensity matching on number of antihypertensive agents (range, 1–3 agents), which consisted of the thiazide plus an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB. A fourth analysis was conducted by restricting to thiazide monotherapy. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to September 2020.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LWaZH]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The magnitude of blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects and decrease of the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics provided by potassium-sparing diuretics remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the BP-lowering efficacy and the incidence of adverse effects of high (T+) and low-dose (T-) thiazide diuretics, alone or combined with high (PS+) or low-dose (PS-) potassium-sparing diuretics in patients with primary hypertension.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. Randomized double-blind placebo or active-controlled trials (RCT) with 3 weeks to 1 year of follow-up were included. Sample size, mean and standard deviation from baseline, follow-up and change from baseline values were extracted by two independent reviewers. Pairwise random effect models and Bayesian network meta-analysis models were used to compare the effects of treatments. The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the Rob 1.0 tool. The primary outcome was the mean difference in office SBP. Secondary outcomes were the mean difference in biochemical parameters and the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

Results

Two hundred and seventy-six double-blind RCTs involving 58807 participants (mean age: 55years; 45% women) were included. All treatment groups were more effective than placebo in lowering BP, with mean differences (MDs) of change from baseline ranging from -7.66mmHg [95% credible interval (95% CrI), -8.53 to -6.79] for T- to -12.77mmHg (95% CrI, -15.22 to -10.31) for T+PS-. T+ alone or combined with potassium-sparing was more effective in reducing BP than T-. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) estimated ranking showed that the best effectiveness in lowering SBP was found for T+PS- (0.69), T+PS+ (0.65) and T+ (0.54). Compared with placebo, all treatments (except T-PS-) were associated with more potassium reduction and T+ compared with all other treatments and T- when compared with T-PS-. Compared with placebo, all active treatments (except T+PS+) showed higher elevations of uric acid. The increase of plasma glucose promoted by thiazides alone was reduced by potassium-sparing agents.

Conclusion

Thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics are associated with increased BP-lowering efficacy compared with thiazides alone while minimizing hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. These findings demonstrate that thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretic combination is preferable to thiazide alone in treating hypertension.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115HBeHo]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension, as they both lower blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular (CV) events. Currently, they are recommended as first-line agents. There are mechanistic reasons that suggest chlorthalidone (CTD) may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for preventing CV outcomes. Chlorthalidone has a longer half-life and has been shown to be more effective in reducing 24-hour BP compared with HCTZ. Chlorthalidone also has other pleotropic effects, such as decreased platelet aggregation and vascular permeability mediated through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. However, most thiazide prescriptions in the US are HCTZ rather than CTD, potentially because of adverse effects associated with CTD, such as hypokalemia.

The Diuretic Comparison Project (DCP) was a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing CTD with HCTZ for the treatment of hypertension to reduce major adverse CV events (MACEs) and noncancer deaths in older US veterans. A planned subgroup analysis involved comparing drug effects among participants with and without prior myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke to assess whether the effects differed when used for primary vs secondary CV prevention. The main trial results demonstrated no difference in effects between CTD and HCTZ on such outcomes when mostly low doses were used. However, there was a qualitative interaction between treatment group and baseline presence of MI or stroke. A qualitative interaction is when a treatment is beneficial in 1 subgroup but harmful in the other. The observed interaction was therefore unexpected and has not been described in prior studies, to our knowledge. We assessed whether treatment effects of CTD vs HCTZ associated with CV outcomes and adverse events were different in patients with prior MI or stroke and those without prior MI or stroke.

Pharmacotherapy for hypertension — combination antihypertensive therapy may allow for use of lower doses of individual agents and, therefore, minimize adverse drug effects, but clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether specific combinations and doses are more effective than a maximum-level dose of a single agent for blood pressure control and medication adherence; trials should also focus on comparative effectiveness of equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and newer antihypertensive agents, such as vasodilatory beta-blockers in essential HTN, and in RHT, future studies with long-term follow-up that would allow evaluation of clinical outcomes are needed to establish optimal fourth-line antihypertensive agents in RHT and whether variations in patient characteristics may necessitate differential approaches to a fourth-line agents for RHT.

### Diuretics for hypertension: a review and update [^114j1yq6]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

This review and update focuses on the clinical features of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the thiazide-like agents chlorthalidone (CTDN) and indapamide (INDAP), potassium-sparing ENaC inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and loop diuretics. Diuretics are the second most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensive medication, and thiazide-related diuretics have increased at a rate greater than that of antihypertensive medications as a whole. The latest hypertension guidelines have underscored the importance of diuretics for all patients, but particularly for those with salt-sensitive and resistant hypertension. HCTZ is 4.2–6.2 systolic mm Hg less potent than CTDN, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers by 24-hour measurements and 5.1mm Hg systolic less potent than INDAP by office measurements. For reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs), HCTZ is less effective than enalapril and amlodipine in randomized trials, and, in network analysis of trials, it is less effective than CTDN and HCTZ-amiloride. Combined with thiazide-type diuretics, potassium-sparing agents decrease ventricular ectopy and reduce the risk for sudden cardiac death relative to thiazide-type diuretics used alone. A recent synthesis of 44 trials has shown that the relative potencies in milligrams among spironolactone (SPIR), amiloride, and eplerenone (EPLER) are approximately from 25 to 10 to 100, respectively, which may be important when SPIR is poorly tolerated. SPIR reduces proteinuria beyond that provided by other renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. EPLER also reduces proteinuria and has beneficial effects on endothelial function. While guidelines often do not differentiate among specific diuretics, this review demonstrates that these distinctions are important for managing hypertension.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112UvZU5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^112p1H3G]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although evidence from clinical trials suggests that BP reduction to goal is crucial in reducing CV outcomes, at least half of all hypertensives remain untreated, with most of those that are treated requiring combination therapy to achieve the target BP control rate. Results from this study suggest that for patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension, initiating treatment with combination therapy using the ARB, valsartan and low-dose HCTZ (160/12.5 mg and increasing the dose to 160/25 mg if needed) provided greater benefit in reaching BP control rates compared with initiating treatment with low- or high-dose valsartan monotherapy. The study demonstrated that by initiating therapy with two antihypertensive medications and titrating the dose every 2 weeks, if required, will lead to more effective BP control rates in a shorter period of time as compared with initiating treatment by monotherapy. After only 4 weeks of therapy, 58% of patients on the initial combination agent achieved BP control as compared with only 26% initiated with valsartan (80 mg). Furthermore, AEs between V/HCTZ and the two valsartan monotherapy arms were similar, confirming the excellent tolerability achieved with combination of an ARB and low-dose diuretic. Risks associated with excessive drops in BP in V/HCTZ were also not observed, as noted by similar incidences of AEs related to low BP and hypotensive episodes among the three groups during the study. The preliminary concern of 'over-treatment' in the V/HCTZ group was also not observed, since over 85% of patients initiated on valsartan monotherapy required add-on HCTZ therapy.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^114qfbCA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Thiazide diuretics are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, a disease highly prevalent among older individuals and in those with chronic kidney disease. How specific thiazide diuretics compare in regard to safety and clinical outcomes in these populations remains unknown.

Objective

To compare safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide use among older adults with varying levels of kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2015. Participants included adults aged 66 years or older who initiated chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide during this period. Data were analyzed from December 2019 through September 2020.

Exposures

New chlorthalidone users were matched 1:4 with new hydrochlorothiazide users by a high-dimensional propensity score. Time-to-event models accounting for competing risks examined the associations between chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use and the outcomes of interest overall and within estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories (≥ 60, 45–59, and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were adverse kidney events (ie, eGFR decline ≥ 30%, dialysis, or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation), all-cause mortality, and electrolyte anomalies (ie, sodium or potassium levels outside reference ranges).

Results

After propensity score matching, the study cohort included 12 722 adults (mean [SD] age, 74 [7] years; 7063 [56%] women; 5659 [44%] men; mean [SD] eGFR, 69 [19] mL/min/1.73 m2), including 2936 who received chlorthalidone and 9786 who received hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline of 30% or greater (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13–1.36]) and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04–1.22]) across all eGFR categories compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. Chlorthalidone use was also associated with a higher risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use, which was more pronounced among those with higher eGFR (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.67–2.08]; eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25–1.96]; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.84–1.45]; P for interaction = .001). No significant differences were observed between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide for dialysis or kidney transplantation (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 0.88–2.36]), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.93–1.29]), hyperkalemia (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.79–1.39]), or hyponatremia (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, CI 0.98–1.32]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that among older adults, chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The excess risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function. Placed in context with prior observational studies comparing the safety and clinical outcomes associated with thiazide diuretics, these results suggest that there is no evidence to prefer chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide.

### Blood pressure responses and metabolic effects of hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol [^117PRhcu]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazides and β-blockers cause adverse metabolic effects (AMEs), but whether these effects share predictors with blood pressure (BP) response is unknown. We aimed to determine whether AMEs are correlated with BP response in uncomplicated hypertensives.

Methods

In a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial, we enrolled 569 persons, aged 17–65, with random assignment to 9 weeks of daily hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol monotherapy, followed by 9 weeks of add-on therapy with the alternate agent. Measurements included home BP, averaged over 1 week, weight and fasting levels of serum glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and uric acid (UA) before and after monotherapy and after add-on therapy.

Results

Increases in UA correlated with reductions in systolic BP (SBP) (r = -0.18; P = 0.003) and diastolic BP (DBP) (r = -0.20; P = 0.001) following HCTZ monotherapy and add-on therapy (r = -0.27 and r = -0.21, respectively; both P < 0.001). After adjustment for age, race, gender, and baseline body mass index (BMI), only the correlation between UA and DBP response became nonsignificant. Reductions in HDL correlated with systolic response following atenolol monotherapy (r = 0.18; P = 0.002) and with systolic and diastolic response following add-on therapy (r = 0.30 and r = 0.24, respectively; both P < 0.0001). These correlations remained significant after covariate adjustment. BP responses were not correlated with changes in glucose, LDL, triglycerides, or weight following either therapy.

Conclusions

BP response correlated with changes in UA following HCTZ therapy and HDL following atenolol therapy. No other significant correlations were observed between BP response and AMEs, suggesting that these effects generally do not share predictors. Patients should be monitored for AMEs, regardless of BP response.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

Methods and Results

We performed a 1‐year, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy can be recommended for patients with BP > 150/95 mm Hg.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116q6s7E]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

General implementation notes for initial drug choice clarify that "many people will require treatment with more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve BP control", and "the panel suggests that any of these 4 classes would be good choices as add-on therapy". The text specifies that "this recommendation is specific for thiazide-type diuretics, which include chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, and indapamide; it does not include loop or potassium-sparing diuretics", and emphasizes that "it is important that β-blockers be dosed adequately to achieve results similar to those seen in the RCTs". It also states that "RCTs that were limited to specific nonhypertensive populations, such as those with coronary artery disease or heart failure, were not used to formulate this recommendation" and concludes that "Therefore, recommendation 6 should be applied with caution to these populations".

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^112uBczZ]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Lack of practicing evidence-based medicine

Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-8 (JNC-8) does not recommend one thiazide diuretic over another, despite the fact that chlorthalidone and not hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has the broadest amount of evidence for reducing CV events. Moreover, most clinicians do not seem to be practicing EBM, as greater than 1 million people received a prescription for HCTZ (monotherapy) in 2008, whereas only 25 000 people received chlorthalidone. Not only has chlorthalidone shown superiority over HCTZ for reducing CV events in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT)and a network meta-analysis, but chlorthalidone has shown superior reduction in left ventricular hypertrophyand reductions in heart failurevs HCTZ. Additionally, HCTZ has been shown to increase CV death and CHD in hypertensive patients compared to placebo or usual care in two large randomised trials, respectively. This begs the question, why is chlorthalidone not preferentially recommended over HCTZ in JNC-8? And has the treatment of HTN actually advanced? While a 22-year follow-up from the SHEP trial indicated that life expectancy gain with chlorthalidone was 105 days (95% CI −39 to 242; p = 0.07) for all-cause mortality and 158 days (95% CI 36 to 287; p = 0.009) for CV death. This translated into only a 1-day extension in life expectancy for each month of chlorthalidone treatment. Thus, to live just 1-year longer, an individual would have to be on chlorthalidone for 30 years. This begs the question, is the 1-year life extension worth the added cost and side effects of taking a prescription medication for 30 years? While each clinical scenario will determine the risk versus the benefit, an extension of life is not the only potential gain with antihypertensive therapy, as reductions in CV events and their consequences (eg, aphashia after a stroke) are also important to take into consideration. Regardless, a reduction in CV events/mortality will only be achieved through the practice of EBM.

### Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide [^116soXbU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 660 patients with hypertension; approximately 137 of these patients were treated for more than one year. The observed adverse events were generally mild, transient, and similar to those seen with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide taken separately. There was no relationship between the incidence of side effects and age.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, the usual duration of therapy was two months. Adverse clinical or laboratory events led to discontinuation of therapy by 4.3% of 368 placebo-treated patients and by 3.5% of 660 fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients.

The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were headache (0.3%), cough (0.3%; see PRECAUTIONS), and fatigue (0.2%).

The side effects considered probably or possibly related to study drug that occurred in placebo-controlled trials in more than 2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below.

Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in controlled trials in 0.5% to < 2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, and rarer but clinically significant events regardless of causal relationship were: General: Chest pain, weakness, fever, viral infection. Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (seen in 1.8% of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide patients and 0.3% of placebo patients; no patients discontinued therapy due to orthostatic hypotension), edema, flushing, rhythm disturbance, syncope. Dermatologic: Pruritus, rash. Endocrine/Metabolic: Sexual dysfunction, change in libido, breast mass. Gastrointestinal: Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia/heartburn, abdominal pain, gastritis/esophagitis. Immunologic: Angioedema (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema). Musculoskeletal: Myalgia/muscle cramps. Neurologic/Psychiatric: Somnolence, depression, numbness/paresthesia. Respiratory: Sinus congestion, pharyngitis, rhinitis. Special Senses: Tinnitus. Urogenital: Urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, dysuria.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^111DpP7a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 858 patients treated for essential hypertension and 3889 patients treated for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 2.8% and 2.3% of patients treated with the combination and placebo, respectively.

In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring in greater than 2% of subjects treated with losartan-hydrochlorothiazide and at a greater rate than placebo were: back pain (2.1% vs 0.6%), dizziness (5.7% vs 2.9%), and upper respiratory infection (6.1% vs 4.6%).

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide and/or the individual components:

Blood and the Lymphatic System Disorders

Anemia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis.

Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders

Anorexia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatremia and hypokalemia.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic) [^114UmHVE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg per day to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.

The side effects (see WARNINGS) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on current monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured at the interdosing interval to ensure that there is an adequate antihypertensive effect at that time. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. After addition of the diuretic it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen may achieve similar or greater blood-pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^114jf3Z2]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study was not designed to demonstrate the complete treatment strategy approach for using a valsartan-based regimen, as it did not allow achievement of the maximum antihypertensive effect. The study did not include the maximum dose of valsartan (320 mg) in combination with HCTZ, was of 6 weeks duration and the dose titration period was only 2 weeks. The study, rather, was designed to test the efficacy and tolerability of using initial combination therapy for patients with primary stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension.

In conclusion, initial use of combination therapy using a renin–angiotensin system blocker and low-dose diuretic in the standard treatment of hypertension in the primary care setting is an idea whose time has not yet come but which finds support in this study. In this study, initiating therapy with valsartan and low-dose HCTZ (160/12.5 mg) resulted in higher BP control rates, greater antihypertensive effect and prompt BP control with no significant increase in AEs in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension. The study has provided a template one could follow for treating hypertension effectively and safely using initial combination therapy, including uncomplicated cases of stage-1 to stage-2 hypertension. This study has demonstrated that initial combination therapy with an ARB and low-dose diuretic should become routine for treatment of hypertension, thereby improving BP control rates for patients with primary, essential hypertension.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^112WXWt5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Everyday practice should mirror as closely as possible RCTs demonstrating clear outcomes benefit, the approach taken in most clinical scenarios. Metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, and bisoprolol, for example, are used when treating heart failure with reduced ejection fraction because RCTs have specifically found that these beta blockers reduce the risk of death from heart failure. Could other beta blockers have a mortality benefit? Possibly, but without convincing evidence, we do not prescribe atenolol or labetalol for heart failure. If rigorously studied in a new RCT, hydrochlorothiazide may offer cardiovascular prevention comparable to chlorthalidone and indapamide. Yet, although clinicians use the beta blockers studied in the heart failure RCTs, thiazide prescribing practices do not align with the available randomized data and instead overlook the clear blood‐pressure‐reducing and cardiovascular benefits of chlorthalidone and indapamide. Why, then, is hydrochlorothiazide overwhelmingly chosen, whereas chlorthalidone is infrequently prescribed and indapamide use is practically nonexistent? Among the most compelling reasons to use hydrochlorothiazide is its availability in many fixed‐dose combination pills. More than 25 combination formulations of hydrochlorothiazide are available, including with all major antihypertensive classes. Comparatively, only 4 combination pills contain chlorthalidone, coupled with an infrequently used or second‐line agent, and there is no combination pill with indapamide available in the United States (a combination pill of indapamide and perindopril is available in several other countries).

### A multicenter, randomized double-blind study of valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide combination versus amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate hypertension [^112NboZR]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a once-daily fixed valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination and amlodipine in subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

Subjects and Setting

In this multicentre, double-blind, randomized, comparative trial, 690 patients with sitting systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 160 mmHg and sitting diastolic BP ≥ 95 mmHg at the end of a 2-week placebo wash-out period were randomized to valsartan-based treatment (n = 342) or amlodipine (n = 348).

Methods

The patients received valsartan 80 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg o.d for 4 weeks; in the case of an unsatisfactory blood pressure response, the treatments could be respectively changed to the fixed combination of valsartan 80 mg + HCTZ 12.5 mg o.d. or amlodipine 10 mg o.d. for a further 8 weeks.

Results

Both treatment approaches decreased systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure to the same extent. The rate of responders to treatment at the end of fourth week (before up-titration) was 57.4% among the valsartan-treated patients and 61.9% among the amlodipine-treated patients (ns). At the end of the study, the rate of responders was not significantly different between the two groups (74.9 versus 72.1%). Valsartan-based treatment had a slightly lower incidence of adverse events (1.5 versus 5.5%; P = 0.006).

Conclusions

The results of this trial demonstrate that the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and amlodipine are equally effective in lowering BP, and that the combination is better tolerated.

### Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of two fixed-dose combinations of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide compared with valsartan monotherapy in patients with stage 2 or 3 systolic hypertension: an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial [^114SgWbc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with at least 2 antihypertensive agents is usually needed to achieve appropriate blood pressure (BP) control in patients with isolated or predominant systolic hypertension. A currently recommended combination is a diuretic added to an angiotensin-receptor blocker.

Objective

This was a study of the effects on sitting systolic BP (SBP)of 2 combinations of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared with valsartan monotherapy in patients with stage 2 or 3 systolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg and ≤ 200 mm Hg) with or without other cardiovascular risk factors.

Methods

After a placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with either valsartan 80 mg OD(monotherapy group) or valsartan 160 mg OD (combination-therapy groups) for 4 weeks, followed by forced titration to valsartan 160 mg OD (V160), valsartan 160 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg OD (V160 +HCTZ12.5), or valsartan 160 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg OD (V160 +HCTZ25) for an additional 4 weeks. End points were the change in SBP between the groups receiving combination therapy and the monotherapy group, between-group changes in diastolic BP (DBP), responder rates (SBP < 140 mm Hg or a reduction in SBP of ≥ 20 mm Hg), and tolerability.

Results

A total of 774 patients were randomized to treatment: 261 to V160, 258 to V160+HCTZ12.5, and 255 to V160 +HCTZ25. The intent-to-treat population consisted of 767 patients (411 men, 356 women; mean age, 60 years; mean weight, 84 kg; clinic mean [SD] baseline BP, 167.5 [8.1]/93.4 [9.1] mm Hg). All treatments produced significant reductions in SBP from baseline (mean [SD] reduction, 20.7 [15.7] mm Hg with V160, 27.9 [13.8] mm Hg with V160 +HCTZ12.5, and 28.3 [13.1] mm Hg with V160+HCTZ25; all, P < 0.05). DBP was reduced by 6.6 (8.9) mm Hg in the V160 group and by 10.2 (7.7) and 10.1 (7.8) mm Hg in the V160+HCTZ12.5 and V160 +HCTZ25 groups, respectively (all, P < 0.05). The additional reductions in BP with V160+HCTZ25 did not reach statistical significance compared with V160+HCTZ12.5. Responder rates were 56.9% in the V160 group, 74.4% in the V160+HCTZ12.5 group, and 75.0% in the V160 +HCTZ25 group P < 0.05, combination therapy vs monotherapy). Adverse events were reported by 27.5% of patients in the monotherapy group, compared with 28.6% and 34.0% in the groups that received V160+HCTZ12.5 and V160+HCTZ25, respectively; the differences were not significant between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Monotherapy with V160 was effective in these patients with stage 2 or 3 systolic hypertension. Significant additional reductions in SBP and DBP and an increase in responder rates were achieved with the addition to V160 of HCTZ12.5 and HCTZ25, with no significant effect on tolerability.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide in addition to telmisartan / amlodipine combination for treating hypertensive patients uncontrolled with telmisartan / amlodipine: a randomized, double-blind study [^1164WKDD]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results from this phase III study indicate that the combination of telmisartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide is more effective than that of only telmisartan and amlodipine at reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to a ARB/CCB combination therapy provides clinicians with a suitable treatment option for patients unresponsive to ARB/CCB combinations. This triple combination therapy is effective and well tolerated.

Search strategy and information sources

Searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for possible results in unpublished studies, and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC [ProQuest]) was searched for results in nonindexed journals or other reporting forms, all from inception to 15 September 2021, with no language restrictions. To improve search strategy sensitivity, the strategies were developed using Medline subject heading (MeSH) terms, synonyms and Boolean operators (where possible). Keywords and MeSH terms were as follows: 'hydrochlorothiazide', 'chlorothiazide', 'bendroflumethiazide', 'hydroflumethiazide', 'cyclopenthiazide', 'chlorthalidone', 'metolazone', 'indapamide', 'mefruside', 'xipamide', 'bemetizide', 'spironolactone', 'eplerenone', 'amiloride', 'triamterene', 'thiazide diuretics', 'inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel', 'potassium sparing diuretic' and 'hypertension'. Comprehensive search strategies are provided in the Supplement (Search Strategy).

Study selection

An electronic database was exported to reference manager software (EndNote X9), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were independently selected by pairs of independent reviewers using the liberal accelerated approach. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted to seek any potential unpublished outcomes.

Data extraction and items

The following data were extracted: study characteristics, baseline characteristics of participants, interventions and comparators, and outcomes.

The interventions of interest were classified as thiazide diuretic alone or thiazide diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic and further stratified according to the mean daily dose. The doses of the interventions were categorized as proportions of the manufacturer's recommended starting dose: low-dose (< 2 × start dose) and high-dose (≥ 2 × start dose). The starting dose of hydrochlorothiazide was 25 mg because chlorthalidone is 1.5–2 times as effective as hydrochlorothiazide for lowering BP.

Data on drugs and doses are presented in Table S1 in the Supplement. The full glossary of extracted variables with their definitions is available at.

### Factorial antihypertensive study of an extended-release metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide combination [^112odVCp]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To attain goal blood pressure (BP), many hypertensive patients require combination antihypertensive therapy. Thiazide diuretic/beta-blocker regimens lower BP, and clinical studies indicate that they reduce the risk for cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. Fixed-dose combination tablets can simplify multidrug treatment regimens.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, unbalanced factorial study (N = 1571) was designed to determine whether hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and extended release (ER) metoprolol both contribute to an antihypertensive effect. Hypertensive adults with sitting diastolic BP (SiDBP) 95 to 114 mm Hg and systolic BP (SiSBP) < 180 mm Hg received one of three hydrochlorothiazide doses (6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, or 25 mg), one of four ER-metoprolol doses (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg), or one of nine of the combinations or placebo for 8 weeks.

Results

Blood pressure decreased with all combinations (P < .001 v placebo); reductions were dose related, ranging from 8.7 to 15.7 mm Hg (SiDBP) and 9.7 to 18.9 mm Hg (SiSBP) (model-derived values). Reductions with placebo were 5.3 (SiDBP) and 4.2 mm Hg (SiSBP). Both active agents contributed to the combination effect (P = 0.0015 for SiDBP; P = 0.0006 for SiSBP). Several low-dose combinations were approximately as effective as high doses of the individual agents (differences within 1 to 2.5 mm Hg). The adverse event discontinuation rate was 2.9%. Serum potassium decreased and uric acid increased with increasing doses of HCT.

Conclusions

Extended-release metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide is an effective antihypertensive combination that offers additive antihypertensive contributions from both components.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive adverse effects and clinical considerations for older adults: Some of the adverse effects associated with antihypertensive medications include (but are not limited to) the following — thiazide-type diuretics: electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal discomfort, rashes and other allergic reactions, sexual dysfunction in men, photosensitivity reactions, and orthostatic hypotension; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): cough and hyperkalemia; angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs): dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia; calcium-channel blockers: dizziness, headache, edema, and constipation; and β-blockers: fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Accurate measurement of BP is important before initiating treatment for hypertension, some patients may have elevated BP in clinical settings, and ambulatory measurement may be appropriate; clinicians should consider treatment with nonpharmacologic options, including weight loss, dietary changes, and an increase in physical activity, initially or concurrently with pharmacologic treatment; clinicians should consider treatment burden and drug interactions when deciding on treatment options; when selecting pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should prescribe generic drugs where available; and evidence for adults who are frail or with low overall risk without multimorbidity is limited.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^113hJMk9]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 — Diuretics and antihypertensive adverse effects in CKD — High BP due to fluid overload is common in CKD; therefore, diuretics are, in general, logical agents at appropriate dose to lower high BP, with or without the concomitant use of RASi. While thiazide diuretics decrease efficacy as GFR worsens, several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). When combined with a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The document notes common class adverse effects in CKD, including for both ACEi and ARBs, hyperkalemia as well as AKI, and for diuretics, hypokalemia, and states there are no data on clinical outcomes with loop diuretics in the treatment of high BP with or without CKD.

### Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^112moYQK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are the combination tablet of valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a diuretic. Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure:

In patients not adequately controlled with monotherapy (1)
As initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals (1)

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^116sKgzC]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

SELECTING THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY: DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Historically, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were grouped together as they target the same segment of the distal convoluted tubule. It was thought that the targeting of the sodium-chloride transporter in this part of the kidney tubule mediated the decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output by causing volume loss. The mechanism of action for the blood pressure-lowering effect of diuretics is, in fact, more complex. Only the initial blood pressure reduction (1–2 weeks) is mediated by the kidney: the hypovolemia rapidly stimulates the activation of RAS, which stalls the decrease in blood pressure and results in volume and cardiac output returning almost to baseline. It is the second phase, during which the diuretic treatment targets peripheral vascular resistance and vasodilation that mediates the bulk of the ongoing (4–8 weeks) and long-term blood pressure reduction.

Discussion

Hypertension is a disease with a high incidence in Japan. The currently used monotherapies, including ARBs, CCBs and diuretics, are effective only in a limited proportion of patients. For those who remain resistant to therapy, a combination of antihypertensive agents is required. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a combination of T80/A5/H12.5 for the treatment of hypertension in patients with an inadequate response to telmisartan 80 mg and amlodipine 5 mg. The results indicate that the T80/A5/H12.5 group achieved significantly greater reductions in seated DBP and SBP relative to those achieved in the T80/A5 group. In addition, significantly more patients achieved DBP and SBP control in the T80/A5/H12.5 group compared with patients treated with T80/A5.

The adverse events reported in this study were mild or moderate in severity, and those events were already observed in those receiving monotherapy or two-agent combination therapy. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was higher in the T80/A5/H12.5 group than in the T80/A5 group. The frequent drug-related adverse events in the T80/A5/H12.5 group were elevated uric acid levels and hyperuricemia. The cause of the increase in uric acid can likely be explained by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide, because elevated uric acid is a common side effect of diuretics. These adverse events were manageable and did not pose a health risk.

In this study, each patient received two tablets: T80/A5 fixed-dose combination and H12.5 or T80/A5 fixed-dose combination and placebo. It is possible that a single tablet T80/A5/H12.5 combination treatment would improve patient adherence. Previous studies reported that the fixed combination of valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide or olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide improved adherence and persistence compared with administration of each drug as individual tablets. This suggests that the fixed combination of T80/A5/H12.5 may increase the adherence relative to a combination of three individual treatments.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide in addition to telmisartan / amlodipine combination for treating hypertensive patients uncontrolled with telmisartan / amlodipine: a randomized, double-blind study [^112edstY]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of telmisartan 80 mg/amlodipine 5 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (T80/A5/H12.5) was examined for its ability to treat hypertension in Japanese patients whose hypertension is uncontrolled with telmisartan 80 mg/amlodipine 5 mg (T80/A5). Patients aged ⩾20 years who had essential hypertension despite taking two or three antihypertensive drugs entered a 6-week run-in period on T80/A5. Patients whose hypertension remained uncontrolled were randomly assigned to either the T80/A5/H12.5 group (n = 149) or the T80/A5 group (n = 160), once daily for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, patients in the T80/A5/H12.5 group showed a significantly greater adjusted mean reduction in both seated diastolic blood pressure and seated systolic blood pressure than those in the T80/A5 group. Furthermore, more patients achieved a diastolic/systolic blood pressure of < 90/140 mm Hg in the T80/A5/H12.5 group compared with the T80/A5 group. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, elevated blood uric acid levels and hyperuricemia, and the latter two events were more frequent in the T80/A5/H12.5 group than in the T80/A5 group. Overall, T80/A5/H12.5 administered for 8 weeks significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure and was well tolerated by patients with hypertension uncontrolled with T80/A5.

### Efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide in patients uncontrolled with telmisartan monotherapy [^113oGSUk]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The antihypertensive effects of a telmisartan 80 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg fixed-dose combination and telmisartan 80 mg monotherapy were compared in patients with a history of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and inadequate BP control (DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg) following 8 weeks of telmisartan monotherapy. At the end of this period, 491 patients (62.9% men; mean age 55.3 years) whose DBP was ≥ 90 mm Hg were double-blind randomised to once-daily telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg (n = 246) or telmisartan 80 mg (n = 245). Trough (24 h post-dose) clinic BP was measured after 4 and 8 weeks of double-blind therapy. At the end of double-blind treatment, patients receiving telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg had significant additional decrements in clinic SBP/DBP over telmisartan 80 mg of -5.7/-3.1 mm Hg (P < 0.01). Most of the additional effect occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients with normalised BP (SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg) was significantly greater in the telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg group than the telmisartan 80 mg group (41.5%vs 26.1%; P < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events was similar except for diarrhoea, which occurred more frequently in the telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg group, and oedema, which occurred more frequently in the telmisartan group. Our results indicate that a telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg fixed-dose combination confers significant additional BP reductions compared with continuation of telmisartan monotherapy in non-responders.

### Nanoparticle-based therapies in hypertension [^115Zyuej]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

The earliest class of drugs used to treat hypertension was diuretics, which remain broadly used. While diuretics can be effective in treating hypertension, their effects — along with other drug classes in this review — could be enhanced to reduce dose frequency or side effects like glucose fluctuation, hypokalemia, and dehydration. Improvements in ≥ 1 of these arenas may enhance efficacy either through the direct drug effects (including reduced side effects), or better patient compliance resulting in superior management of hypertension. In addition to thiazide diuretics, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the most-recommended first-line hypertension treatments. ACE inhibitors are among the most popular clinically used antihypertensive drug classes and are a first-line hypertension treatment due to their ability to decrease morbidity and mortality by preventing cardiovascular remodeling, especially of the left ventricle. In addition to their roles in hypertension, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers are first-line heart failure treatments; given their therapeutic role for multiple serious diseases, improving their efficacy and side-effect profile is critical. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) function similar to ACE inhibitor, except they block the receptor instead of the enzyme and are often used to avoid side effects patients may experience with ACE inhibitors. However, ARBs have notoriously poor bioavailability and require high doses to achieve desired effects. The dihydropyridines class of CCBs play an important antihypertensive role and work on vascular smooth muscle to dilate vessels and decrease BP. Unfortunately, many of their oral formulations are poorly water-soluble and undergo significant first-pass metabolism, reducing the amount of drug available for systemic absorption and thus requiring administration of large doses for sufficient absorption to achieve desired therapeutic effects.

### Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide [^115vWVx9]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect

Patients whose blood pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead be given quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 or 20/12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control with less electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 or 20/12.5.

Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients who are adequately treated with 20 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and experience no significant electrolyte disturbances may instead wish to receive quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20/25.

Use in Renal Impairment

Regimens of therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2(serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. Therefore, quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is not recommended for use in these patients.

The efficacy and safety of telmisartan 80mg/amlodipine 5mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg (T80/A5/H12.5) was examined for its ability to treat hypertension in Japanese patients whose hypertension is uncontrolled with telmisartan 80mg/amlodipine 5mg (T80/A5).

Subgroup analysis

Within the treatment groups, patients were divided into subgroups based on patient characteristics, including age (< 65, ⩾65 years), sex, body mass index (< 25, 25– < 30 and ⩾30 kg m −2), hypertension severity, hypertension duration (≤ 1, > 1–5, > 5–10 and > 10 years) and the number of previous antihypertension drugs used (two or three). The reductions in both DBP and SBP in each subgroup tended to be greater in patients treated with T80/A5/H12.5 than in patients treated with T80/A5 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

Safety

Adverse events and laboratory findings

The number of patients who experienced adverse events during the double-blind 8-week period was higher in the T80/A5/H12.5 group (41.6%) than in the T80/A5 group (28.1%) (Table 3). The most common adverse events were increased blood uric acid levels, nasopharyngitis and hyperuricemia. Higher incidences in the T80/A5/H12.5 group compared with the T80/A5 group were seen for increased blood uric acid levels and hyperuricemia.

### The metabolic cost of lowering blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide [^116GKidv]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of obesity and obesity-related complications such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes are rising steadily despite the increased public and scientific awareness of this multifactorial problem. Although specific efforts to turn the obesity tide concentrate on the development of new treatment strategies, it is important to revisit old therapies and review their side effect profiles as some treatments may silently augment the metabolic syndrome.

The landmark Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) placed a new spotlight on thiazide diuretics as the first-line therapy for hypertension. This is concerning as thiazide-diuretics may contribute to comorbidities associated with the current epidemic of obesity. Previous randomized clinical trials have linked treatment with thiazide diuretic to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes.

On the contrary, evidence accumulates that therapies which interfere with the adverse metabolic effects of angiotensin II, such as angiotensin II receptor blocking (ARB) or/and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE I) therapies, cause no metabolic harm as confirmed by the DREAM and NAVIGATOR studies. The favorable metabolic action of ARB and ACE-I agents could originate from improvement of insulin sensitivity or could be facilitated through the recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes. Both mechanisms could lead to reduction in ectopic deposition of triglyceride in organs such as liver, heart, pancreas and skeletal muscle, a hypothesis that has not yet been tested.

We present the results of a randomized study comparing the metabolic effects of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and Valsartan in individuals at high risk for development of type 2 diabetes. We specifically evaluated the effect of these treatments on intra-hepatic triglyceride content as well as insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and ectopic triglyceride deposition in the heart, pancreas, and skeletal muscle.

Diuretic monotherapy is the current recommendation of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure for initial antihypertensive therapy. There is mounting concern, however, that the benefits of diuretic's superior blood pressure control may be offset by its multiple metabolic disturbances that increase cardiovascular risk. Reungjui et al. document a new concern, nephrotoxicity by thiazide monotherapy. This and other recently published evidence of diuretic's 'dark side' is discussed.

### Efficacy and safety of omapatrilat with hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in subjects nonresponsive to hydrochlorothiazide alone [^111SRi3o]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

This multicenter, double-blind study evaluated efficacy and safety of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, which simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, when given in conjunction with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to subjects nonresponsive to HCTZ alone. The study enrolled 657 subjects with mild to severe hypertension. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period and a 4-week HCTZ phase, 274 subjects were randomized to receive omapatrilat (10 or 20 mg, electively titrated to 20 or 40 mg, respectively, at week 4 if seated diastolic blood pressure [SeDBP] was ≥ 90 mm Hg) or matching placebo in addition to 25 mg of HCTZ as continuing therapy. The primary outcome measure was change in SeDBP from baseline to week 8. At week 8, placebo plus HCTZ-adjusted additional reductions in SeDBP in the omapatrilat 10/20 mg and 20/40 mg treatment groups (4 and 5 mm Hg, respectively) were significant (P < .001), as were changes in seated systolic blood pressure in both omapatrilat-treated groups (7 and 10 mm Hg, respectively; P < .001). Seated diastolic blood pressure was normalized (< 90 mm Hg) in 38% of subjects in the placebo group compared to 59% and 64% of subjects in the omapatrilat groups (P ≤ .008). Adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuations attributed to adverse events were infrequent. There were no clinically relevant changes in serum creatinine or potassium. Omapatrilat was effective and well tolerated when added to HCTZ in subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled with HCTZ alone.

Safety monitoring report

Diuretic-related side effects can be separated into several categories, including those with well–worked-out mechanisms, such as electrolyte defects and/or metabolic abnormalities. Mechanisms that contribute to the onset of hypokalemia during diuretic use include: increased flow-dependent distal nephron K+ secretion (more commonly observed with a high Na+ intake), a fall in distal tubule luminal chloride (Cl–) metabolic alkalosis, and/or secondary hyperaldosteronism. Sica et al. give an opinion that thiazide-related side effects are somewhat more common with longer-acting compounds, such as CTLD. In our meta-analysis as a secondary point we decided to made a statistical analysis of data concerning changes of serum potassium and serum sodium levels. Safety monitoring observation of the serum potassium levels were made in three studies. The WMD (95% CI) is −0.22 mEq/L (−0.32 ÷ −0.11 mEq/L). Dorsch et al. has the most significant weight for our analysis — 78.7%. Figure 4 shows that there is no homogeneity between the published studies. No other studies included enough data about potassium levels to be included in the analysis. Figure S3 for publication bias using funnel plot is presented in the Supplementary material file.

Only one study directly compared the two preparations in regard to their effects on serum sodium levels. Pareek et al. conclude that there are no significant changes in serum electrolytes, blood sugar, and other laboratory parameters in patients treated with CTLD and HCTZ.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide in addition to telmisartan / amlodipine combination for treating hypertensive patients uncontrolled with telmisartan / amlodipine: a randomized, double-blind study [^1115F64r]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

For patients with hypertension refractory to ARB/CCB, the use of an additional antihypertensive drug with a different mode of action, such as a low dose of a diuretic, is recommended. However, diuretics are infrequently used to treat Japanese hypertensive patients. We designed this study to determine the effects of adding the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide to an ARB/CCB combination therapy.

The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group comparison study was to examine the efficacy and safety of telmisartan (80 mg), amlodipine (5 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) (T80/A5/H12.5) for the treatment of hypertensive patients whose hypertension is uncontrolled with telmisartan (80 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg) (T80/A5).
