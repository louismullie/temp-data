## Question

Ketones in urinalysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ketones in urinalysis, including what they are, how urine testing works, its limitations, when it is useful, and how to interpret results alongside alternatives like blood β-hydroxybutyrate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemistry of ketone bodies and which ones urine actually detects. Then, I should verify the assay principle and its inherent limitations. Next, I will review clinical contexts where urine ketones are still reasonable and where they are misleading. After that, I should compare urine testing with blood β-hydroxybutyrate and outline practical thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and note special populations and interferences, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the biochemistry. Ketone bodies include acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone; in DKA, β-hydroxybutyrate predominates in blood, whereas urine dipsticks detect acetoacetate and, with some brands, acetone, but not β-hydroxybutyrate, which is a critical limitation I need to keep in mind as I interpret results [^e93882ea] [^676d968f].

> Wait, let me verify the assay principle. Urine ketone dipsticks use the nitroprusside reaction, which forms a purple complex with acetoacetate; some formulations also react with acetone, but they do not measure β-hydroxybutyrate, so a negative urine ketone does not exclude DKA and a positive can lag behind clinical improvement as β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized back to acetoacetate during treatment [^676d968f] [^daf3c8ad].

> I should confirm the main limitations. Urine ketones reflect past, not current, ketone production because they average excretion since the last void; they can be falsely negative with poor renal perfusion or oliguria, and falsely positive with highly pigmented urine or sulfhydryl-containing drugs; they are semiquantitative and subjective to read, and they may increase paradoxically as DKA resolves due to β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation to acetoacetate, masking clinical improvement [^daf3c8ad] [^676d968f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check when urine ketones are still reasonable. In resource-limited settings, for home sick-day screening, or when blood testing is unavailable, urine ketones can be a pragmatic adjunct to identify impending DKA, especially if interpreted serially and in clinical context; they are also useful in pregnancy to support the diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum when ketonuria is prominent, and in pediatrics for initial evaluation of suspected new-onset diabetes or DKA when blood testing is pending [^8e65e84b] [^a4be9405] [^9c408ef0].

> Next, I should review the evidence favoring blood β-hydroxybutyrate. Point-of-care capillary β-hydroxybutyrate has sensitivity around 98% for DKA and substantially better specificity than urine dipsticks, reducing unnecessary workups; it provides real-time assessment of the predominant ketone and tracks treatment response more reliably than urine, which can lag or mislead during recovery [^fa198997] [^3c77741a] [^0e3e6928].

> I need to ensure I cite practical thresholds correctly. Levels below about 1.0–1.5 mmol/L generally exclude DKA, 1.5–3.0 mmol/L represents a transition zone where action may prevent progression, and levels above 3.0 mmol/L are consistent with DKA and warrant urgent evaluation; these ranges align with contemporary guidance and observational data, though I should note that exact cutoffs vary slightly by assay and context [^8509ba2c] [^f6d28013].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor or has euglycemic DKA. I should double-check that guidance emphasizes checking ketones even when glucose is normal in symptomatic patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, because euglycemic DKA is a recognized risk; in this scenario, urine ketones may be positive, but blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred for diagnosis and monitoring, and SGLT2 therapy should be held if ketoacidosis is suspected [^fc2affbb] [^7ecc9739] [^d59b5827].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In children with DKA, pyuria is common and should not distract from the metabolic diagnosis; in athletes with type 1 diabetes, exercise should be postponed when glucose is markedly elevated with moderate to large urine ketones or β-hydroxybutyrate above about 1.5 mmol/L; in wilderness or remote settings, urine strips remain lightweight and practical, but users should verify expiration dates and storage conditions because accuracy degrades with age and heat [^877bfcbe] [^f0776903] [^fc85bcd8].

> I should confirm interferences and quality issues. Drugs with free sulfhydryl groups such as mesna can cause false-positive urine ketones, and cefiderocol may interfere with dipstick ketone results; highly acidic urine or ascorbic acid can blunt the nitroprusside reaction, and strips exposed to air or past expiration can yield false negatives, so results must be interpreted in light of medications, storage, and clinical suspicion [^e95dd3e1] [^9b02a84d] [^676d968f].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If DKA is suspected, prioritize direct β-hydroxybutyrate measurement when available; if only urine ketones are accessible, interpret any positive result as a red flag and correlate with glucose, bicarbonate, anion gap, and clinical status, recognizing that a negative urine ketone does not rule out DKA; during treatment, expect urine ketones to transiently rise as β-hydroxybutyrate declines, and rely on blood ketones and acid–base parameters to gauge response [^0e3e6928] [^daf3c8ad].

> In conclusion, I should emphasize that urine ketone testing is a low-cost, widely available screening tool with important limitations; it can support early recognition of ketosis in the right context, but blood β-hydroxybutyrate is the preferred analyte for diagnosing and monitoring DKA because it reflects the predominant circulating ketone and avoids the lag and interferences inherent to urine testing, so clinicians should match the test to the clinical question and be prepared to escalate to blood testing when stakes are high [^0e3e6928] [^e93882ea].

Ketones in urinalysis detect **acetoacetate and acetone** (not β-hydroxybutyrate) and are a **screening tool** for ketosis, especially in diabetes, fasting, low-carb diets, and pregnancy [^e93882ea] [^947d0421]. Urine ketones are **semiquantitative**, lag behind blood levels, and can be falsely negative with good hydration or falsely positive with some drugs or highly pigmented urine [^daf3c8ad] [^676d968f]. For suspected DKA, **blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred** for diagnosis and monitoring because it is more sensitive and specific and reflects current ketone status [^0e3e6928] [^5aee2556]. Urine ketones are best used as an adjunct, not a substitute, for blood testing [^8e65e84b].

---

## Physiological basis of ketone production

Ketone bodies are produced by the liver from fatty acids during **insulin deficiency or carbohydrate restriction** [^e93882ea]. The three main ketones are **acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone**; β-hydroxybutyrate predominates in DKA, while acetoacetate and acetone are more readily detected in urine [^e93882ea] [^d36d450e].

---

## Clinical significance of ketonuria

Ketonuria signals **increased fatty acid metabolism** and is most clinically urgent in the context of **DKA**, a life-threatening complication of diabetes [^34c57fa9]. It also occurs with fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, prolonged exercise, and in pregnancy (e.g. hyperemesis gravidarum) [^a4be9405] [^c1a12008].

---

## Methods of detecting ketones in urinalysis

Urine ketones are detected by **nitroprusside-based dipsticks** that react with acetoacetate (and variably with acetone) to produce a color change [^676d968f]. Results are reported semiquantitatively as negative, trace, small, moderate, or large [^69d2eb16].

---

## Limitations and challenges of urine ketone testing

- **Lag time**: Urine ketones reflect past, not current, ketone levels, causing delays in detection and monitoring [^daf3c8ad].
- **False negatives**: Dilute urine, good hydration, or recent voiding can mask ketonuria [^daf3c8ad].
- **False positives**: Highly pigmented urine, levodopa, ACE inhibitors, and other sulfhydryl-containing drugs can cause false positives [^676d968f] [^e95dd3e1].
- **Subjectivity**: Visual interpretation of dipsticks can vary between observers [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with blood ketone testing

Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is **more sensitive and specific** than urine ketones for DKA and provides real-time assessment of ketone status [^fa198997] [^8509ba2c]. It is the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring DKA and is recommended by current guidelines [^0e3e6928] [^5aee2556].

| **Parameter** | **Urine ketone testing** | **Blood ketone testing** |
|-|-|-|
| Analyte detected | Acetoacetate, acetone | β-hydroxybutyrate |
| Accuracy | Semiquantitative, subjective | Quantitative, objective |
| Lag time | Yes | No |
| False results | Common | Less common |
| Clinical utility | Screening, adjunctive | Diagnostic, monitoring |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ADA 2024**: Obtain direct venous or capillary β-hydroxybutyrate for DKA diagnosis and monitoring [^5aee2556].
- **AAFP 2024**: Use serum β-hydroxybutyrate when available; urine ketones are adjunctive only [^0e3e6928].
- **Diabetes Canada 2018**: Do not rule out DKA based on negative urine ketones [^76110b88].

---

## Clinical scenarios and interpretation

- **Positive urine ketones with hyperglycemia**: Suspect DKA and confirm with blood β-hydroxybutyrate, pH, and bicarbonate [^0e3e6928].
- **Positive urine ketones with normal glucose**: Consider fasting, low-carb diet, or euglycemic DKA (especially with SGLT2 inhibitors) [^7ecc9739].
- **Negative urine ketones with high suspicion of DKA**: Do not exclude DKA; test blood ketones and acid-base status [^76110b88].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **ketonuria is common** and may indicate inadequate caloric intake or hyperemesis gravidarum [^a4be9405]. In pediatrics, **urine ketones are part of the initial evaluation** for suspected diabetes or DKA [^9c408ef0]. In athletes, **ketone monitoring** is advised during intense training or competition, especially with insulin deficiency risk [^f0776903].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Urine ketone testing is a **useful screening tool** for ketosis but has important limitations. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is preferred for diagnosing and monitoring DKA. Clinicians should interpret urine ketones in clinical context and confirm with blood testing when DKA is suspected [^0e3e6928].

2.1 Urine testing for ketones

Urine testing for ketones is a method that has been available for a long time; it is relatively inexpensive and painless, does not require the user to carry a meter and involves minimal technical skill to implement. However, many patients prefer to avoid doing urine tests. The colour‐coded, strip‐based test uses a nitroprusside reaction, which provides a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and with some brands acetone. The test represents an average of ketones excreted in the urine since the last void, which may delay recognition of impending DKA or its resolution. Importantly with treatment, the circulating pool of β‐hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which may cause urine ketone readings to rise, while blood β‐hydroxybutyrate concentrations are falling. The paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate gives the false impression that the condition is not improving. In addition, acetoacetate accounts for approximately only 20% of circulating ketone bodies, impacting the sensitivity of urine testing. False positive results can result from highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, including levodopa and drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free‐sulphydryl compounds. Finally, it requires the person to recognize an increased risk of DKA to then initiate testing. This may be difficult because of oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure or in the absence of a private environment where a urine sample may be obtained.

2 CURRENT APPROACHES TO THE PREVENTION, RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and to proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and thirst occur late, and hyperglycaemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Current available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^6b3a8ffd]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^34c57fa9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

URINARY GLUCOSE

RECOMMENDATION: SEMIQUANTITATIVE URINE GLUCOSE TESTING IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ROUTINE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUSB (low).

1. Use

Semiquantitative urine glucose testing, once the hallmark of diabetes care in the home setting, has now been replaced by SMBG (see above). Semiquantitative urine glucose monitoring should be considered only for patients who are unable or refuse to perform SMBG, because the urine glucose concentration does not accurately reflect the plasma glucose concentration. Notwithstanding these limitations, urine glucose monitoring is supported by the IDF in those situations in which blood glucose monitoring is not accessible or affordable, particularly in resource-poor settings.

2. Rationale

Although urine glucose is detectable in patients with grossly increased blood glucose concentrations, it provides no information about blood glucose concentrations below the variable renal glucose threshold [approximately 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)]. This fact alone limits its usefulness for monitoring diabetes under modern care recommendations. Semiquantitative urine glucose tests also cannot distinguish between euglycemia and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, the extent to which the kidney concentrates the urine will affect urine glucose concentrations, and only mean glucose values between voidings are reflected. These facts further minimize the value of urine glucose measurements.

3. Analytical considerations

Semiquantitative test-strip methods that use reactions specific for glucose are recommended. Commercially available strips use the glucose oxidase reaction. Test methods that detect reducing substances are not recommended because they are subject to numerous interferences, including numerous drugs and nonglucose sugars. When used, single voided urine samples are recommended.

4. Interpretation

Because of the limited use of urine glucose measurements, semiquantitative specific reaction–based test-strip methods are adequate.

KETONE TESTING

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: KETONES MEASURED IN URINE OR BLOOD IN THE HOME SETTING BY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND IN THE CLINIC/HOSPITAL SETTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AN ADJUNCT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF DKA GPP.

The ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc), acetone, and β-hydroxybutyric acid (βHBA) are catabolic products of free fatty acids. Measurements of ketones in urine and blood are widely used in the management of patients with diabetes as adjuncts for both diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of DKA. Measurements of ketone bodies are routinely performed, both in an office/hospital setting and by patients at home. The ADA recommends that ketosis-prone patients with diabetes check urine or blood ketones in situations characterized by deterioration in glycemic control in order to detect and preempt the development of DKA.

### Controversies around the measurement of blood ketones to diagnose and manage diabetic ketoacidosis [^1693a9a3]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The measurement of blood ketones in preference to urine ketones has become a well-established tool in the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, there remains considerable disparity between diabetes guidelines regarding if, how, and when this test should be used. While recent guidelines now mainly emphasize blood measurement, several issues nonetheless remain. Many laboratories still measure blood ketones using a semiquantitative test that does not measure the predominant ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), which may hinder patient management. Even when BOHB is measured, the evidence for cutoffs used in DKA diagnosis or exclusion is limited, while its use in gauging severity, treatment progress, and resolution is not fully clear. Lastly, although employing point-of-care meters instead of a laboratory for BOHB measurement brings undoubted benefits, this approach has its own challenges. This article provides a perspective on these topics to complement current recommendations and to suggest how future research may improve its use in the DKA context.

A. Urine ketones

1. Preanalytical.

The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

2. Analytical.

Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones. A combination dipstick is necessary only if the patient monitors urine glucose instead of or in addition to blood glucose. The nitroprusside method measures only AcAc unless the reagent contains glycine, in which case acetone is also measured. The nitroprusside-containing reagent is much more sensitive to AcAc than acetone with respect to color generation. Importantly, this reagent cannot be used to measure βHBA.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^d9a7e836]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by a serum glucose level greater than 250 mg per dL, a pH less than 7.3, a serum bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq per L, an elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration. Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### Update on measuring ketones [^e93882ea]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies-mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which is the predominant ketone in the urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might be increasing even as DKA is resolving. Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid. Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets; assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use, in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA; and to identify DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes treatment and summarizes emerging trends in the measurement of ketones in the blood, urine, breath, and interstitial fluid.

### Medium-chain acyl-COA dehydrogenase deficiency: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^5c5a4fb4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Infants who display abnormally high levels of C 8 or C 10 should be referred to secondary treatment centers for definitive diagnosis or further genetic screening. Early diagnosis is preferable so as to establish long‐term management strategies and prevent symptom onset when feeding intervals lengthen, as well as reduce the likelihood of developmental delays and other complications associated with the disease.

5.2 /blood analysis of acylcarnitine

While NBS using dried blood samples has been successful in its identification of affected children, there is concern over its associated false positivity rate; LC–MS/MS has been suggested as an additional or alternative test to blood spot analysis to reduce the incidence of false‐positive tests.

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry is the standard method for diagnosis of MCADD. Lymphocytes isolated from whole blood samples or newborn dried blood spots taken from the umbilical cord or heel stick are quantified via LC–MS/MS, in which C8:1‐CoA, C8:0‐CoA, and C8:OH‐CoA are isolated first with high pressure liquid chromatography and subsequently analysed for structure using tandem MS/MS. Patients with homozygous c.985A > G mutations consistently present with MCAD activity below 2.5%, while heterozygous or mild MCADD patients may range between 5.7 and 13.9% of normal activity, defined as 2.78 nmol/(min
- mg protein). This method is the most applicable for widespread screening methods and has been implemented in newborn screening programs in developed nations.

5.3 Urinalysis

Asymptomatic individuals may show normal acylcarnitine levels using tandem mass spectrometry, and therefore require urine acylglycine assays to demonstrate elevated n‐hexanoylglycine (HG), 3‐phenylpropionylglycine, octanoylglycine (OG) and suberylglycine (SG). These assays are completed once again using LC–MS/MS, wherein HG has been identified as the most significant diagnostic marker for MCADD. Newer methods utilize ultra‐performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) to compare ratios of acylglycines; HG/acetylglycine (AG), OG/AG, and SG/OG have been demonstrated as excellent markers for MCAD deficiency. Crucially, presence of ketones in preliminary urinalysis should not be taken as evidence against an MCADD diagnosis because acute metabolic decompensation may cause the presence of some ketones.

### Different urinalysis appearances in children with simple and perforated appendicitis [^864a6d69]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine whether routine urinalysis may serve as a tool in discriminating between acute appendicitis and perforated appendicitis in children.

Basic Procedures

We prospectively collected 357 patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis. Urinalysis was performed in patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis before surgical intervention. Routine urinalysis is composed of 2 examinations: chemical tests for abnormal chemical constituents and microscopic tests for abnormal insoluble constituents. Receiver operating characteristic curves for urine white blood cell (WBC) counts and urine red blood cell (RBC) counts in distinguishing between patients with simple appendicitis and patients with perforated appendicitis were also analyzed.

Main Findings

Urine ketone bodies, leukocyte esterase, specific gravity, pH, WBC, and RBC counts were all significant parameters among patients with normal appendices, simple appendicitis, and perforated appendicitis (all P < .05). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, positive urine ketone bodies and nitrate were significant parameters in predicting perforated appendicitis (P = 0.002 and P = 0.008, respectively). According to the results of receiver operating characteristic curves, the appropriate cutoff values were 2.0/high-power field for urine RBC counts and 4.0/high-power field for urine WBC counts in predicting perforated appendicitis in children.

Principal Conclusions

Routine urinalysis may serve to aid in discriminating between simple and perforated appendicitis. Clinically, we believe that these urine parameters may aid primary emergency physicians with decision making in patients with clinically suspected appendicitis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major acute life‐threatening complication of diabetes, mostly seen in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is usually defined as a metabolic state in which the individual has either a glucose concentration of more than 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) at presentation, or has been previously diagnosed with diabetes; they must have a plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones of more than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test‐stick; and a pH less than 7.3 or a serum bicarbonate of less than 15.0 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a state referred to as euglycaemic ketoacidosis.

DKA results from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin associated with elevated glucagon. These, in turn, promote the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids that are converted to ketone bodies, resulting in an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is then converted enzymatically to β‐hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non‐enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled(Figure 1). The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose and increased endogenous glucose production results in marked hyperglycaemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolaemia, electrolyte disturbance and hyperosmolar state stimulate a counter‐regulatory hormone response increasing insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further exacerbating the metabolic disturbance, resulting in a downward spiral. If left unaddressed this culminates in altered consciousness, cardiovascular collapse, coma and death.

### Inborn errors of metabolism with acidosis: organic acidemias and defects of pyruvate and ketone body metabolism [^cecdafb9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

When a child presents with high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, the pediatrician can proceed with confidence by recalling some basic principles. Defects of organic acid, pyruvate, and ketone body metabolism that present with acute acidosis are reviewed. Flowcharts for identifying the underlying cause and initiating life-saving therapy are provided. By evaluating electrolytes, blood sugar, lactate, ammonia, and urine ketones, the provider can determine the likelihood of an inborn error of metabolism. Freezing serum, plasma, and urine samples during the acute presentation for definitive diagnostic testing at the provider's convenience aids in the differential diagnosis.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^d36d450e]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

2. Rationale

Ketone bodies are usually present in urine and blood, but in very low concentrations (e.g. total serum ketones, < 0.5 mmol/L). Increased ketone concentrations detected in patients with known diabetes or in previously undiagnosed patients presenting with hyperglycemia suggest impending or established DKA, a medical emergency. The two major mechanisms for high ketone concentrations in patients with diabetes are increased production from triglycerides and decreased utilization in the liver — both of which are due to an absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased counter-regulatory hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, glucagon, and growth hormone.

The principal ketone bodies βHBA and AcAc are typically present in approximately equimolar amounts. Acetone, usually present in only small quantities, is derived from spontaneous decarboxylation of AcAc. The equilibrium between AcAc and βHBA is shifted towards βHBA formation in any condition that alters the redox state of hepatic mitochondria to increase NADH concentrations, such as hypoxia, fasting, metabolic disorders (including DKA), and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Thus, assay methods for ketones that do not include βHBA measurement may provide misleading clinical information by underestimating total ketone body concentration.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^6d692b6d]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available but there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic because of variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis. The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement, but whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis. In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone as compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity and resolution of ketoacidosis.

### Urine specific gravity and other urinary indices: inaccurate tests for dehydration [^0aa3955f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Urine output, specific gravity, and ketones (urinary indices) are commonly used as an objective means to assess for dehydration and gastroenteritis severity; however, their utility has not been established. The study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of urinary indices as diagnostic tests to identify acute dehydration.

Methods

We completed a prospective cohort study in the Emergency Department of an urban pediatric hospital. Seventy-nine subjects ages 3 months to 36 months with gastroenteritis, clinically suspected moderate dehydration, and the need for intravenous rehydration were enrolled in the trial. Urine specific gravity and urine ketone levels were determined with bedside calorimetric (dipstick) testing, and urine output during rehydration and observation was measured by commonly used techniques. An internally validated, weight-based criterion standard for the percent dehydration on enrollment was used to identify the cohort of dehydrated subjects. Correlation statistics were calculated for urine output, specific gravity, and ketones. In addition, multilevel tables were created to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio at varying test cutoff values to detect 3% and 5% dehydration.

Results

Urine specific gravity (r = -0.06, P = 0.64), urine ketones (r = 0.08, P = 0.52), and urine output during rehydration (r = 0.01, P = 0.96) did not correlate with the initial degree of dehydration present. Clinically useful cutoff values for urine specific gravity and ketones to increase or decrease the likelihood of dehydration at the time of enrollment could not be identified.

Conclusions

Urinary indices are not useful diagnostic tests to identify the presence of dehydration during the initial assessment of children with gastroenteritis.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^c1a12008]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The connection between low carbohydrate diets and reductions in body water composition has been previously documented. Under physiological conditions, ketones are not present to an appreciable degree in urine in either the post prandial or overnight fasting state. Yet, once a ketogenic diet is begun, the presence of urinary ketones may be detectable within 2 days after initiation of the diet. Furthermore, in some individuals undergoing a very-low carbohydrate diet, the amount of urinary ketones measured during the first 3 days of a fast, was found to be proportional to the amount of natriuresis. Other studies have similarly shown that decreases in total body, intracellular, and extracellular water were correlated with greatest levels of ketosis during ketogenic diets. Therefore, it is likely that initiation of a ketogenic diet results in an osmotic polyuria driven by elevations in serum and urinary ketones. Furthermore, it is likely that the increased natriuresis is sufficient to change body water composition, although the clinical significance and mechanism by which this occurs is not fully known. At the time of this publication, it is also not fully known if, or the extent to which, different ketogenic diets may induce polyuria in pediatric versus adult populations. Increased metabolic demands in pediatric populations and significant variation in the different types of low carbohydrate diets likely confound this factor and further work on this topic is required.

4 THE IDEAL KETONE MONITOR

To address the limitations associated with current approaches to ketone testing we propose the following: (i) an ideal ketone testing device would measure ketones over a relevant dynamic range (we suggest 0‐10 mmol/L) with automated alerts that would not require the user to initiate a measurement; (ii) measurements would need to be precise, particularly at the lower end of the measured range, so as not to result in a significant number of false alerts leading to alarm fatigue; (iii) the display should not be noticeable unless required; and (iv) the technology should be integrated with the user's usual glucose‐management system so that they are not required to carry an additional device. For example, ketone levels and trend information could be displayed on a smartphone or insulin pump screen. Ideally, discomfort, as well as psychological, financial and physical burdens imposed upon the user, should be minimized. At the same time, the device needs to be reliable and durable (Table 1). A further level of refinement, although not essential, could include instructions regarding the most appropriate response to the information provided. Urine, blood and breath ketone testing do not meet these criteria and therefore other approaches need to be explored.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^947d0421]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

4. Interpretation

RECOMMENDATION: KETONES MEASURED IN URINE OR BLOOD IN THE HOME SETTING BY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND IN THE CLINIC/HOSPITAL SETTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AN ADJUNCT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF DKA GPP.

A. Urine ketone measurements.

The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

RECOMMENDATION: BLOOD KETONE DETERMINATIONS THAT RELY ON THE NITROPRUSSIDE REACTION SHOULD BE USED ONLY AS AN ADJUNCT TO DIAGNOSE DKA AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO MONITOR DKA TREATMENT. SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT OF βHBA IN BLOOD CAN BE USED FOR DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF DKA B (moderate).

B. Blood ketone measurements.

Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis, because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy, because AcAc and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy (,–). Blood ketone measurements that measure βHBA specifically are useful for both the diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of DKA. Reference intervals for βHBA differ among assay methods, but concentrations in healthy individuals who have fasted overnight are generally < 0.5 mmol/L. Patients with well-documented DKA [serum CO 2 < 17 mmol/L, arterial pH < 7.3, plasma glucose > 14.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)] generally have βHBA concentrations > 2 mmol/L.

5. Emerging considerations

Further studies are needed to determine whether blood ketone measurements by patients with diabetes are preferable (e.g. better accepted by patients, more prompt diagnosis of DKA) to urine ketone measurements. Studies are necessary to evaluate whether the test offers any clinical advantage over more traditional management approaches (e.g. measurements of serum CO 2, anion gap, or pH).

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^239e7d78]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Our criteria for the diagnosis of DKA included plasma glucose > 250 mg/dl, HCO 3 − < 15 mEq/l, pH < 7.3, and moderate ketones in the urine or blood by the nitroprusside method. A total of 37 patients were prospectively randomly assigned to three groups as follows: 1) the load group consisted of 12 patients who received a loading dose of insulin at 0.07 unit/kg body weight followed by an infusion of 0.07 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1; 2) the no load group consisted of 12 patients who received only an intravenous infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.07 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 without a loading dose; or 3) the twice no load group consisted of 13 patients who received an infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.14 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 without a bolus dose. Responses to therapy were based on the time to achieve a glucose level of ≤ 250 mg/dl, bicarbonate of ≥ 15 mEq/l, and pH ≥ 7.3. All other modes of therapy (hydrating solution, KCl, and HCO 3 −) were similar in the three groups and followed the recommendations of the first ADA position statement. All patients were seen in the emergency department of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis. Upon arrival, history was obtained and a physical examination was performed. Urine ketones (by nitroprusside) plus glucose by fingerstick and blood gas measurements were obtained immediately. Once a suspected diagnosis of DKA was made, the initial laboratory blood samples were obtained for basal metabolic parameters and complete blood count with differential; urinalysis was performed for blood and urine ketones by both the nitroprusside and enzymatic methods. Patients then received 1 liter of 0.9% NaCl per hour until laboratory results were available. After laboratory confirmation, the intravenous fluids were adjusted, depending on the glucose and corrected serum sodium value, to ½ N saline or dextrose with 1 N or ½ N saline. With confirmation of the diagnosis of DKA and an acceptable potassium level (> 3.3 mEq/l), the patients were then transferred to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) of the University of Tennessee Bowld Hospital after the research study was described to the patients or their next of kin and the consent form, which was approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center of Memphis Institutional Review Board, was signed. On arrival at the CRC, the treatment and care of patients was managed by the DKA team, including the medical housestaff on rotation for the service, following an established protocol with consultation of the staff endocrinologist. Hourly blood glucose measurements and blood samples for free insulin were obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min. Blood for measurement of other hormones and ketone bodies, blood gases, and metabolic profile; urinalysis for ketones; and other parameters were obtained. Random assignment of patients to different insulin regimens was done after arrival at the CRC. Random assignment was not based on sex or ethnicity. Because a priming dose of insulin adds an additional risk of hypokalemia, potassium levels were assessed and corrected on an hourly basis for the first few hours of therapy until glucose reached the predetermined goal of < 250 mg/dl (i.e. ∼4 h) and every 2 h thereafter.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^626d7568]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes (protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones).

Objective —

To explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells because of urine strip shortages.

Design —

During shortages, we implemented an automated algorithm that triggered sending urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose and ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed 2 labels so nursing staff would collect 2 specimens. We monitored the turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification, ensured that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding not having usual urinalysis results. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.

Results —

The algorithm was put in place twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period we had only 1 complaint, by a physician wanting to have results of nitrates.

Conclusions —

During urine strip shortages, we successfully implemented a diversion algorithm that provided actionable urinalysis analytes in a timely manner with minimal provider complaints.

### Bedside detection of urine β-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^8a670de7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, current urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empiric treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) catalyst was also assessed.

Methods

Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H(2)O(2) (3%) 1:9 (H(2)O(2):urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO(3) sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

Results

Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H(2)O(2) improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L). Alkalinization and AgNO(3) sticks did not improve BOHB detection beyond this threshold.

Conclusions

Addition of H(2)O(2) (3%), alkalinization, or AgNO(3) sticks did not improve clinically meaningful urine BOHB detection. Clinicians should use direct methods to detect BOHB when suspected.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^c5a242c5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

3 BREATH‐BASED KETONE TESTING

Although not widely available clinically, ketones can also be measured by breath testing. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, which is volatile and exhaled. Advantages include the painless assessment of ketone levels and no necessity for blood exposure or urine collection. Additionally, changes in acetone are dynamic and may provide an early signal of change in a person's metabolic state. Conversely, breath ketone meters are expensive, the test needs to be user‐initiated and the person is required to carry an additional device. A proof‐of‐concept study evaluating a breath ketone analyser (Ketonix, Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with T1D concluded that the device could be used to rule out ketosis in adults, but not in children. However, in general, there is a lack of an evidence base for the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for those with T1D because they have generally been developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets instead of for medical use.

### Can we prevent diabetic ketoacidosis in children? [^a54f7cdc]. Pediatric Diabetes (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes affecting more than 100,000 persons annually in the United States. Although major advances have improved diabetes care, DKA remains the leading cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and death in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As the majority of patients presenting with DKA have established diabetes, it is important to address outpatient educational approaches directed at sick-day management and early identification and treatment of impending DKA. Teaching and reinforcement of sick-day rules involves improved self-care with consistent self-monitoring of blood glucose and ketones, and timely administration of supplemental insulin and fluids. DKA as an initial manifestation of T1D may be less amendable to prevention except with an increased awareness by the lay and medical communities of the symptoms of diabetes and surveillance in high-risk populations potentially identified by family history or genetic susceptibility. New technologies that can detect the blood ketone 3beta-hydroxybutyrate (3beta-OHB) instead of traditional urine ketones appears to provide opportunity for early identification and treatment of impending DKA leading to reduced need for hospitalization and potential cost-savings.

B. Blood ketones

1. Preanalytical.

Serum/plasma ketones can be measured with the tablets or dipsticks routinely used for urine ketone measurements. Although samples can be diluted with saline to "titer" the ketone concentration (results are typically reported as "positive at a 1/ x dilution"), βHBA, the predominant ketone body in DKA, is not detected, as with urine ketone testing.

For specific βHBA measurements, sample requirements differ among methods, as is described below. In general, blood samples can be collected into tubes containing heparin, EDTA, fluoride, citrate, or oxalate. Ascorbic acid interferes with some assay methods. AcAc interferes with some assay methods unless the samples are highly dilute. Sample stability differs among methods, but whole-blood samples are generally stable at 4°C for up to 24 h. Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 1 week at 4°C and for at least several weeks at −20°C (long-term stability data are not available for most assay methods).

2. Analytical.

Although several different assay methods (e.g. colorimetric, gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and enzymatic) have been described for blood ketones, including specific measurement of βHBA, enzymatic methods appear to be the most widely used for the quantification of βHBA for routine clinical management. The principle of the enzymatic methods is that β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD + converts βHBA to AcAc and NADH. Under alkaline conditions (pH 8.5–9.5), the reaction favors the formation of AcAc from βHBA. The NADH produced can be quantified spectrophotometrically (usually kinetically) with the use of a peroxidase reagent. Most methods permit the use of whole-blood, plasma, or serum samples (required volumes are generally ≤ 200 μL). Some methods permit the analysis of multiple analytes; these methods are designed for point-of-care testing. Several methods are available as handheld meters, which have been FDA cleared for both laboratory use and home use by patients. These methods use dry-chemistry test strips to which a drop of whole blood, serum, or plasma is added. Results are displayed on the instruments within approximately 2 min.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with elevated acetone in a patient taking a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor [^476b1908]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor medications are a class of antihyperglycemic agents that increase urinary glucose excretion by interfering with the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubules. In May of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a warning concerning a potential increased risk of ketoacidosis and ketosis in patients taking these medications.

Case Report

We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose > 500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36 h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis. Acetone is one of the three main ketone bodies formed during DKA and it may be present at considerable concentrations, contributing to the serum osmolality.

### Feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring in subcutaneous tissue using a ketone sensor [^29e9dda1]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ketones produced during ketosis or ketoacidosis are water soluble ketones, namely, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, which is acetone. In a setting of acidosis, acetoacetate is converted into BHB. With resolution of the ketoacidosis, BHB levels fall, with an increase in the conversion of BHB to acetoacetate that remains detectable in the urine. Therefore, BHB is the primary ketone body that indicates the onset and resolution of a ketoacidosis and levels are commonly sampled over time in the critical care setting to help guide therapy.

Currently, measurement of ketone levels is most frequently performed using urine or blood ketone test strips. Assays using blood are based on BHB utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) dependent β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (β-HBDH) enzyme. These measurements do not indicate the onset of ketosis or ketoacidosis, but rather confirm if ketosis or ketoacidosis is already in progress and may require medical attention. In real world clinical care, patients seldom check their ketone levels as recommended by the health care professional because of the lack of availability of the in-date strips at the time of needand the fingerstick blood testing requires a conscious action by the patient. Under multiple scenarios, such as failure of insulin delivery, sick days, low carbohydrate intake, use of SGLT2 inhibitors, high risk patients such as people with T1D, or recurring DKA, and so on, patients would benefit from a continuous ketone sensor. Further, continuous monitoring such as how glucose is measured, has been shown to provide real-time behavior feedback to help guide treatment decisions. Measurement of analytes beyond glucose may provide additional information for self-management decisions, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of DKA and perhaps serving as a tool to inform those following a ketogenic diet.

### Addressing pain using a mediterranean ketogenic nutrition program in older adults with mild cognitive impairment [^12ee4f98]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, the pilot control trial had a relatively small sample size overall (N = 58), and both arms had a low number of participants (n = 29). Additionally, fewer participants completed the pain questionnaires at 6-weeks and 3-months post intervention, which reduced the sample size and statistical power. Second, recruitment of participants for the pilot trial did not focus primarily on patients with moderate levels of pain at baseline. At screening, only 24 participants reported pain of 3 or greater (on a scale of 0–10) using the Roland-Morris Pain and Disability Questionnaire. Low baseline levels of pain may have led to a ceiling effect and reduced our ability to detect significant changes. Additionally, ketone levels were measured via home urinalysis testing throughout the intervention and self-reported on a weekly basis, limiting the validity of urine ketone values as they may have been misinterpreted by participants. The active comparator arm may have been too robust of an intervention to show greater differences in pain compared to the MKNE arm.

Next, although the study was designed to reduce potential placebo effects by limiting information about the differences between the two arms at baseline, it is important to acknowledge that placebo could still drive overall changes in self-reported pain. This is particularly the case for aggregate effects evaluated across the two arms. It is possible that simply completing repeated measures of pain and some aspects of the intervention discussions might lead participants to expect improvements in their pain, thereby increasing risk for a placebo response. For example, the association between higher levels of self-reported adherence and pain-related change on the PGIC may be related to expectations that being adherent would improve pain. However, findings that objective measures of ketosis also related to pain bolster the potential validity of our results. Future studies should use waitlist controls or other pain treatments in order to reduce placebo effects.

### Pyuria in children with diabetic ketoacidosis [^877bfcbe]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury occurs frequently during pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We reviewed urinalyses from 561 children with DKA; pyuria was detected in 19% overall and in 40% of children with more comprehensive urine testing (≥ 3 urinalyses) during DKA.

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^3d5192d5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that the maintenance of ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand how ketosis and seizure protection are related, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

Objective

The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

Design

After fasting overnight for 12 h, 12 healthy adults consumed 4 ketogenic meals over 12 h. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

Results

By the end of the 12-h dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R(2) = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R(2) = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

Conclusions

Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as is urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone may be useful for understanding the mechanism of the diet, elucidating the importance of ketosis in seizure protection, and ultimately, enhancing the efficacy of the diet by improving patient monitoring.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^933159c0]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ketonuria (on standard urine testing) is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advent of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

Hypothesis

Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information on severity of illness in children and risk of hospital admission.

Methods

A prospective study using POCT of blood ketone levels in a convenience sample of children < 13 years old, with a typical case mix of medical problems.

Findings

186 children were studied. The range of ketone levels varied widely among this study population depending on the presenting complaint. Higher levels were noted in those presenting with anorexia or vomiting and fever. The median ketone level of the total study population was 0.2 (range 0–6.0, interquartile range 0.1–0.9) mmol/l. Ketone levels correlated poorly with discharge destination and duration of admission. However, receiver-operator characteristics for ketones as a predictor of admission were comparable to Pediatric Risk of Admission scores (area under the curve 0.64 and 0.72, respectively) and may represent an independent risk factor for admission. A ketone level > 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. Ketone levels correlated well with decreased oral intake (R2 = 0.25; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help to predict the requirement for admission to hospital when interpreted in the context of the presenting illness. They may have applications in both the emergency department and primary care settings. Further prospective testing is required to validate these findings.

### Dapagliflozin [^27a1071c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS.

Withhold DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^a3192742]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is critical but is complicated by the fact that DKA only affects a small percentage of the total number of patients with hyperglycemia. Current clinical practice in the emergency department is to screen hyperglycemic patients with a urine dipstick for ketones and conduct a laboratory evaluation for DKA on patients whose results screen positive. Although the urine dipstick is easily accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and has excellent sensitivity for DKA, its poor specificity (estimated at < 50%) results in a large number of false-positive tests and unnecessary work-ups. This has led the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to discourage using the urine dipstick and encourage using serum ketones for DKA screening. The development of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) devices has made following these ADA recommendations feasible in the emergency department. The goal of this prospective study was to compare the test characteristics of a point-of-care β-OHB meter with the urine dipstick for screening for DKA at emergency-department triage.

Hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) — field thresholds and testing emphasize glucose cutoffs and dehydration severity. If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

Health Measures

Adherence (Ketosis)

Ketone levels were used as a measure of adherence to MKN. Ketones were measured using at-home urinalysis test strips daily throughout the 6-week intervention and during in-person assessments at baseline, 6-weeks, and 3-months post intervention. Previous studies assessing urinalysis testing for ketones found high sensitivity in tests when the reading was above negative but low specificity. Reported ketone levels included "negative" (0 mg/dL), "trace" (> 5 mg/dL), "small" (> 15 mg/dL), "moderate" (> 40 mg/dL), and "large" (> 80 mg/dL). Total ketone levels across the 6-week intervention were calculated by summing days above trace levels of ketones.

Change in Weight

Body weight was recorded in pounds using a scale during in-person assessments at baseline, 6-weeks, and 3-months post intervention. Participants were also asked to record their weight in weekly online surveys. Changes in weight were calculated from baseline to 6-weeks and from baseline to 3-months post intervention.

Blood Glucose

Blood glucose levels (BGL) were measured using fasting blood draws (~10 hours) and were analyzed in the Piccolo Xpress chemistry analyzer during in-person assessments at baseline, 6-weeks, and 3-months post intervention. BGLs analyzed using the Piccolo Xpress ranged from 73 to 134 mg/dL at baseline.

### Multicenter pivotal clinical trial of urine malaria test for rapid diagnosis of plasmodium falciparum malaria [^1a41e61a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sample collection and handling.

Upon enrollment, a case report form was completed for each participant. Matched finger-prick blood and urine samples were collected for malaria microscopy, RDT, UMT, and urinalysis. Blood spots were prepared from finger-prick blood samples on Whatman filter paper (GE Healthcare Life Science, United Kingdom). RF testing was done on a cohort of microscopy-negative patients.

UMT technology and procedure.

The UMT technology relies on the fact that in clinical malaria, febrile patients shed elevated levels of proteins, includingproteins, in urine, and the test detects HRP-2 shed in the urine of individuals infected with malaria. The UMT (Fyodor Biotechnologies, Inc. Baltimore, MD, USA) was performed per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a test strip was dipped into a labeled 2-ml test tube containing 200 μl of urine and incubated for 10 min. The strip was removed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, after which the result was read. No clinical decision regarding patient care was made based on UMT results.

BinaxNOW (Pf/Pan) malaria RDT, urinalysis, rheumatoid arthritis test (RF test), and dry blood spot procedure.

The BinaxNOW (Pf/Pan) blood-based malaria RDT (Alere, Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) is a qualitative immunochromatographic assay that detects HRP-2 antigen found in(BinaxNOW Pf), and aldolase, a pan-malaria antigen found in allspecies (BinaxNOW Pan). The test was performed per the manufacturer's instructions and was used as a comparator RDT. Multianalyte urinalysis reagent strips (Rapid Labs, Essex, United Kingdom) were used to measure glucose, bilirubin, specific gravity, ketones, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrites, serum creatinine, and leukocytes. A direct slide test was used to detect RF (Arlington Scientific, Inc. USA). All tests were performed per the manufacturer's instruction.

### Canagliflozin (Invokana) [^8f40b896]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing INVOKANA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKANA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INVOKANA.

Withhold INVOKANA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INVOKANA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue INVOKANA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^3c77741a]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In conclusion, point-of-care capillary β-OHB testing at a cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L was equally sensitive (98.1%) but markedly more specific (78.6 vs. 35.1%) than the urine dipstick for the detection of DKA in our prospective sample of emergency-department patients with hyperglycemia. Utilizing point-of-care β-OHB testing has the potential to substantially reduce comprehensive laboratory evaluations for DKA among hyperglycemic emergency-department patients.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^4d9e55a0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life‐threatening complication usually affecting people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and, less commonly, people with type 2 diabetes. Early identification of ketosis is a cornerstone in DKA prevention and management. Current methods for ketone measurement by people with diabetes include capillary blood or urine testing. These approaches have limitations, including the need to carry testing strips that have a limited shelf life and a requirement for the user to initiate a test. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) via interstitial fluid with a sensor inserted subcutaneously employing an enzymatic electrochemical reaction. Ketone readings can be updated every 5 minutes. In the future, one would expect that commercialized devices will incorporate alarms linked with standardized thresholds and trend arrows. Ideally, to minimize the burden on users, CKM functionality should be integrated with other devices used to implement glucose management, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. We suggest CKM provision to all at risk of DKA and recommend that the devices should be worn continuously. Those who may particularly benefit are individuals who have T1D, are pregnant, on medications such as sodium‐glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors that increase DKA, people with recurrent DKA, those with T1D undertaking high intensity exercise, are socially or geographically isolated, or those on low carbohydrate diets. The provision of ketone profiles will provide important clinical insights that have previously been unavailable to people living with diabetes and their healthcare professionals.

### Evaluation of a nitroprusside dip test for ketone bodies… [^49c9ca48]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The detection of ketone bodies in urine specimens is sufficiently important to warrant the inclusion of a nitroprusside test for ketonuria as a part of the routine urinalysis. In the past, methods available have included a tablet test and the Rothera test, a conventional test tube procedure. Recently the nitroprusside test for urine ketones has been made available as a stick or dip test with a preparation called Ketostix. This test, like the other nitroprusside tests, depends on the reaction between acetoacetic acid and nitroprusside to produce a colored complex. In order to determine the accuracy and simplicity of the new test, it was compared with the two more standard procedures on a series of routine urine specimens in a general hospital laboratory. Tests were also carried out by experienced and inexperienced personnel on urines with and without added acetoacetic acid. The present report describes the results obtained in.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^3202eb60]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL (until April 2012, no language restrictions, studies in humans) were searched for experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings and contact with experts in the field.

Results

Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centres. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing compared with urine testing was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study) and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of heterogeneity in study design and published data.

Conclusions

There is evidence suggesting that blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is more effective than urine acetoacetate testing in reducing emergency department assessment, hospitalization and time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, as well as potentially lowering healthcare expenditure. Further research in both young people and adults is needed.

Pre-exercise glucose and activity level — general guidelines: Starting glycemia below target (< 5.5 mmol/L; < 90 mg/dL) calls to ingest 10–20 g of glucose before starting exercise and to delay exercise until blood glucose is more than 5 mmol/L (> 90 mg/dL) with close hypoglycemia monitoring. Starting glycemia near target (5–6.9 mmol/L; 90–124 mg/dL) advises ingesting 10 g of glucose before starting aerobic exercise, and anaerobic exercise and high-intensity interval training sessions can be started. At target levels (7.0–10.0 mmol/L; 126–180 mg/dL), aerobic exercise can be started and anaerobic/high-intensity interval training sessions can be started, but glucose concentrations could rise. When slightly above target (10.1–15.0 mmol/L; 182–270 mg/dL), aerobic exercise can be started and anaerobic exercise can be started, but glucose concentrations could rise. With starting glycemia above target (> 15 mmol/L; > 270 mg/dL), if hyperglycemia is unexplained check blood ketones; if modestly elevated (up to 1.4 mmol/L), exercise should be restricted to a light intensity for only a brief duration (< 30 min) and a small corrective insulin dose might be needed before starting exercise; if elevated (≥ 1.5 mmol/L), exercise is contraindicated and glucose management should be initiated rapidly as per the advice of the healthcare professional team. Mild-to-moderate aerobic exercise can be started if blood ketones are low (< 0.6 mmol/L) or the urine ketone dipstick is less than 2+ (or < 4.0 mmol/L), glucose should be monitored during exercise, and intense exercise should be initiated only with caution.

### Blood ketone bodies in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (a multicenter study) [^a8bda14b]. Pediatric Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin deficiency with glucagon excess leads to the release of ketone bodies (KBs) by the liver and excretion in the urine. So far, only KB monitoring in urine has been used during assessment of children with diabetes. Currently used nitroprusside strips for urine KB detection react only with acetoacetate (AcAc) and not with the most prevalent KB moiety - 3beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) - that is in equilibrium with AcAc (up to 10:1 ratio).

Aim

To verify the significance of 3HB in the blood compared to that of AcAc in the urine in recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects independent of the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

A total of 118 consecutive newly diagnosed subjects with type 1 diabetes from different centers in Italy underwent intensive insulin therapy and hydration when necessary (38/118 = 32% with DKA). Hourly urine and capillary blood samples were used to monitor KBs until metabolic control was achieved.

Results

Although DKA was present in 32% of patients, blood 3HB was significantly increased (3.56 ± 1.7 mmol/L) in 83% of the patients and correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.39; p < 0.01) according to a bimodal model. The strongest association was found between 3HB and venous pH (r = -0.56; p < 0.0001). Time required for blood 3HB normalization depended strongly on the starting blood KB values (r = 0.44; p < 0.0001) and was significantly lower than that required for disappearance of KB from urine (17.4 ± 13.6 h, range 1–69 h vs. 19.7 ± 17.8 h, range 1–120 h; p = 0.004). However, urine KBs disappeared before blood 3HB normalization in 23% of the patients.

Conclusions

Blood 3HB evaluation is a better indicator of metabolic control compared to urine KB detection and is useful to predict the time required for blood KB clearing. Further studies are needed to assess its use in the early detection and management of DKA.

### Distinguishing between toxic alcohol ingestion vs alcoholic ketoacidosis: how can we tell the difference? [^cfa3ee41]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) is common in patients presenting for emergency care. While some disease processes and ingestions are easily excluded, diagnosing toxic alcohol (TA) ingestion can be challenging. This is especially true if drug concentrations are not readily available, which forces clinicians to rely on surrogate markers. Like TA ingestion, alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) produces an elevated osmol gap and an AGMA. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors suggestive of AKA when TA ingestion was the primary alternative differential diagnosis. We hypothesized that the odds of an AKA diagnosis would increase as ethanol concentration increased.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of data from 2000 through 2019 from a single US Poison Control Center. Records were reviewed to identify cases coded as "methanol" or "ethylene glycol"; or coded as "alcohol" or "ethanol with acidosis". The case definition for AKA required: (1) documented alcohol use disorder; (2) urine or serum ketones or elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration; (3) anion gap ≥ 14mmol/L. The inclusion criterion for TAs was a detectable methanol or ethylene glycol concentration.

Results

Of 699 patients screened, 86 were diagnosed with AKA and 36 were diagnosed with TA ingestion. As ethanol concentration increased, the odds of an AKA diagnosis significantly increased (OR = 1.016, 95% CI 1.002–1.031, p = .03).

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis, the odds of diagnosing AKA instead of TA ingestion increased as ethanol concentration increased. The limited ability of common clinical factors to differentiate these diagnoses highlights the need to obtain quantitative TA concentrations in real time. Until prospective validation, interpretation of ketone concentrations and toxic alcohol concentrations (when available) will continue to guide decision making.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^a4be9405]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common, affecting women in up to 80% of pregnancies. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the severe end of the spectrum and is associated with dehydration, weight loss of > 5% and electrolyte imbalance. Diagnosis is dependent on exclusion of other causes like gastritis and urinary tract infections and inclusion of those with ketones of four or more on urinalysis. It occurs in 0.3%–3.6% of pregnancies with variable recurrence rates between 15.2% and 81%.

Hyperemesis gravidarum has several aetiological theories but is primarily associated with increased beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone levels. It affects women in the first trimester of pregnancy, with symptoms peaking at approximately 9 weeks and mostly resolving by 20 weeks in 90% of women.

Treatment is supportive focusing on fluid, vitamin and electrolyte replacement as well as antiemetic therapy.

One should not dismiss the increasing evidence which highlights the psychological burden of hyperemesis gravidarum, not to mention the financial cost to both the patient and the healthcare system.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^fa198997]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

Research Design and Methods

Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL had urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

Results

Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

Conclusions

Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6 vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Strategy and rationale for urine collection protocols employed in the NEPTUNE study [^513a5923]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

NEPTUNE urine collection protocol

A defined urine collection procedure (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1; and Additional Methods-Manuals of Procedures for Spot Urine and for 24-h Urine Processing) was created based upon best practices and literature review. This approach was employed to provide a standardized collection procedure applied to all participating centers. Samples are collected using two working protocols: (1) from 24-h whole urine collection, and (2) spot urine collections (recorded as "am" or "pm" void). A total of 13 visits are planned for the anticipated 600 participants in the study. In each visit, a total of 11 tubes will be generated: three 5 mL tubes (n = 4 times), seven 2 mL tubes (n = 12), and one 50 mL tube (n = 2). In other words, a total of 121 samples will be generated per participant over 13 visits. To date, about 400 participants have been enrolled in the study. We anticipate there will be up to 72,600 urine samples collected through the study timeframe.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^2a55fd77]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

Those who may particularly benefit are individuals who have T1D, are pregnant, on medications such as sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors that increase DKA, people with recurrent DKA, those with T1D undertaking high intensity exercise, are socially or geographically isolated, or those on low carbohydrate diets. The provision of ketone profiles will provide important clinical insights that have previously been unavailable to people living with diabetes and their healthcare professionals.

7 RESPONDING TOINFORMATION

The rationale behind the use of a CKM in an ambulatory setting would be to pre‐empt DKA rather than to recognize and manage the fully established condition. In support of this approach, Song et al.reported that maximum fasted blood ketone levels of 0.8 mmol/L or higher, as determined by point‐of‐care testing, predicted future DKA. It should also be noted that in the EASE, DEPICT, and TANDEMstudies, levels of up to 0.8‐1.0 mmol/L were not uncommon. Indeed, these minor elevations in ketones may provide part of the protective effect of SGLTinh therapies. Therefore, we suggest that responses to CKM data should be initiated early at ketone levels of either 1.0 or 1.5 mmol/L, as levels below these thresholds effectively exclude DKA., Conversely, ketone levels of more than 3.0 mmol/L are consistent with a diagnosis of DKA., Levels between 1.5 and 3.0 mmol/L represent an intermediate 'transition zone' providing a window of opportunity to avert DKA. It should be noted that until these CKM devices are approved for non‐adjunctive use, confirmation with a finger‐prick ketone measurement would be recommended.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^fae9b8c1]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Missing data

Data were presented as n/N (%) to account for missing data. Absence of organ-specific symptoms was sometimes summarised generically by attending physicians as 'systematically asked, no complaints'. In such cases, it was assumed that the clinician had confirmed the absence of dysuria, frequency and gross haematuria, whereas other symptoms and findings such as cloudy urine, urine retention and abnormal urine colour were categorised as 'not reported'.

To further clarify missing data in the medical records and for validation purposes, all eligible patients during the last week of the study period were also prospectively interviewed the day after admission by the main authors (LHK, RW) for presence or absence of key symptoms and findings associated with diagnosis of UTI. The interviews were carried out without involving the attending physicians and they were not informed about the study.

Index test

Urinary dipsticks were carried out as clinically indicated assessed by the attending staff who remained unaware of the study throughout the observation period. Dipsticks comprised Siemens Multistix 7 that were automatically analysed at point of care using Siemens Clinitek Status+ or Siemens Clinitek Advantus throughout the study period. A positive dipstick was defined as trace or greater reaction to leucocyte esterase (LE), reaction to nitrite or both. Ketoacidosis was primarily diagnosed using point-of-care measurement of ketones in blood, and urine microscopy for diagnosis of UTI was not available nor part of clinical practice in North Denmark Region.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^14a2f5e9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Approximately one-fourth of emergency-department patients have diabetes, and almost half have poor glycemic control. Common clinical emergency-department practice is to consider the diagnosis of DKA in all patients presenting with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL regardless of the reason for the visit. Because emergency-department overcrowding has stretched resources to the breaking point, there is increasing emphasis on developing, testing, and using the most rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use DKA screening tool available. The results of this study show that the specificity of capillary point-of-care β-OHB is superior to the urine dipstick.

Two retrospective emergency-department studies have shown that capillary point-of-care β-OHB is 100% sensitive for DKA. Charles et al. likewise found that β-OHB was 100% sensitive in a prospective study of seven DKA patients. Naunheim et al. reported a β-OHB sensitivity for DKA of 98% in a prospective sample of 160 patients (57 with DKA). Our study is the first to prospectively compare the test characteristics of point-of-care β-OHB against the urine dipstick in a cohort of emergency-department patients. Using β-OHB in lieu of the urine dipstick to screen our sample could have reduced full laboratory work-ups for DKA by 56.9%.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not provide specific training to the nurses who interpreted the urine dipsticks. We felt this was unnecessary because they 1) are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment certified, 2) are familiar and comfortable with this process, and 3) do so regularly in routine clinical practice. Second, the urine dipstick was considered only negative or positive, and consideration of trace/small ketones versus moderate/large ketones may impact the findings. Third, we did not send blood samples to the laboratory for an enzymatic analysis to correlate the values measured by the point-of-care β-OHB meter because, despite early concerns, current-generation β-OHB meters have been shown to be highly accurate compared with laboratory enzymatic analysis. Fourth, although there are many ways to define DKA, we chose to use the ADA definition because this is commonly used in DKA literature, allowing for direct comparison between our results and previous reports.

In the second approach, we built an A-stage predictor using DSP from routine urinalyses. There are two major challenges that we aimed to address. First, the semi-quantitative DSP grade is dependent on the concentration of urine, which is affected by a number of confounding factors, such as fluid intake, volume status, or use of diuretics. Second, different institutions use different semi-quantitative scales to report DSP grade. To address the first problem, we again used a supervised machine-learning approach, but now we incorporated urine specific gravity (SG) measured at the same time as DSP as an additional input feature. For the second problem, we identified two most common urinalysis scales and developed an A-stage classifier using two separate training sets for these scales: Scale 1 (negative, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) and Scale 2 (negative, trace, 10, 30, 100, 300, ≥ 300).

To develop a Scale 1-based classifier, we used 12,185 simultaneous DSP and UACR measurements from the CUIMC EHR system (Supplementary Table 3). The final Scale 1 classifier had the accuracy of 80.9%, 76.0%, and 94.3% for A1, A2, and A3, respectively, by 10-fold cross-validation. For Scale 2-based classifiers we used a similar dataset of 35,891 paired measurements identified within the UMN and additional 7595 paired DSP-UACR measurements from VU (Supplementary Table 4). Each classifier was built using ordinal regression with DSP, SG, age and sex as independent predictors of the A-stage. For each training dataset, we used 10-fold cross-validation approach, derived MSE, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% confidence intervals. Similar to our first approach, neither age nor sex increased our predictive ability and these predictors were subsequently excluded from the model. However, the addition of urine specific gravity to DSP grade significantly improved the model performance regardless of the scale. We also explored more complex machine-learning methods and several other features, including diabetes, race, ethnicity, and other urinalysis variables, such as urine glucose, ketones, pH, blood, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, and bilirubin, however, none of these complex models outperformed a simple ordinal classifier based on combined DSP and SG.

2.2 Blood testing for ketones

Current best practice in Australia advises that ketone levels should be checked on finger‐prick capillary blood using a handheld meter and ketone testing strips. Blood ketone testing measures β‐hydroxybutyrate, which constitutes the major circulating ketone body. There is no clear consensus in the literature as to thresholds of blood ketone levels that should be considered as significantly elevated. In general, levels below 1.0‐1.5 mmol/L are considered to exclude DKA, while those above 2.5‐3.0 mmol/L suggest the diagnosis or the level at which an urgent medical review should be obtained.,

Blood testing for ketones has a greater sensitivity and specificity for DKA than does urine testing. A blood sample is usually readily available, and because it provides a measurement quickly it minimizes delays in diagnosis. Although ketone meters may vary in their accuracy depending on their manufacturer, these devices generally represent a mature technology and many combine blood glucose and ketone testing, which means that a person is not required to carry an additional device. Conversely, ketone meters and their blood strips are expensive, ketone strips have a short shelf‐life of typically 12 months, and testing is painful and involves blood exposure. As with urine ketone measurements, interfering substances may impact specificity.

2.3 Real‐world experience with current ketone testing options

Although there is evidence that continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provision has resulted in a reduction in DKA, this is probably because insulin has been administered to address elevated glucose levels rather than any specific action to determine the presence or absence of ketosis. Indeed, while CGM provision has improved glycaemia, DKA has not yet been abolished. The real‐world experience highlights many of the limitations of blood ketone testing. An audit of 205 adults (38 on insulin pumps) attending our T1D outpatient service revealed that 31% did not have in‐date ketone testing strips at home and only a minority were carrying these with them. A survey of 2995 people with T1D in the United States found that 32% had no urine or blood ketone testing materials at home, with only 21% checking ketones when nauseated or vomiting and only 18% possessing a blood ketone meter. A report in Switzerland of 333 respondents revealed that 64% did not test for ketones at all. These data support the need for alternative approaches to ketone testing that minimize the burden on the person with diabetes and increase their ability to recognize current or impending DKA.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^d59b5827]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue FARXIGA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting FARXIGA.

Withhold FARXIGA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

FARXIGA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Stroke as the presenting feature of new onset diabetes in a young man [^cea2aff5]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 34-year-old man presented to a hospital with a 7-day history of nausea, vertigo, ataxia and frontal headache. Examination revealed ipsilateral cerebellar signs. CT of the brain demonstrated left cerebellar hypodensity suggestive of ischaemic stroke or space occupying lesion. Full blood count showed a markedly raised haemoglobin (219g/L) and haematocrit (0.56). Admission urinalysis was performed but the results not reviewed. Owing to patient deterioration, an arterial blood gas was performed. This showed profound metabolic acidosis. Repeat urinalysis was positive for glucose and ketones. MRI of the brain confirmed ischaemic stroke. The underlying cause of this was hyperviscosity secondary to relative polycythaemia, resulting from undiagnosed diabetic ketoacidosis as a first presentation of diabetes. This case report highlights ischaemic stroke as an unusual presenting feature of diabetic ketoacidosis. Notably, the underlying diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis was initially missed, thereby emphasising the importance of performing an admission urinalysis and acting on the results.

### Development and validation of a nomogram for screening patients with type 2 diabetic ketoacidosis [^54f18cac]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute complication observed in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), which can lead to severe disturbances in electrolyte balance, dehydration, and multiple organ failure, posing a life-threatening risk. The early detection plays a crucial role in enhancing prognosis and reducing medical expenses. The current diagnostic criteria for DKA in adults recommended by the American Diabetes Association are glucose > 250 mg/dL, arterial or venous pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L, urine or serum ketones positive, β-hydroxy butyrate > 3.0 mmol/L, anion gap > 10, and mental status alert. If we were able to acquire all the data encompassed in the diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis of DKA in clinical practice would become more facile. Even without resorting to predictive models, clinicians can accurately diagnose at an early stage. Taking our study's data as an exemplification, if a prediction model were established based on the variables within the diagnostic criteria, both internal validation AUC and external validation achieved remarkable results of 98% and 96%, respectively.

However, despite the validity of the diagnostic criteria, there still exists a delay in diagnosing and treating DKA patients in clinical practice. This can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, even in developed countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, there is a lack of thorough examination for urine or serum ketones, bicarbonate levels, and pH values. A study conducted in Britain revealed that only 36% and 34% of individuals underwent urine ketone and blood ketone examinations respectively. Second, the results of pH and bicarbonate tests are not reliable. Third, in the predisposing factors of DKA, it has been reported that infection and initial diabetes were related. Patients with infections and newly diagnosed diabetes often visit non-endocrine departments such as surgery and infectious diseases. However, non-endocrine departments will ignore some specialized tests, such as blood and urine ketone bodies, pH, and bicarbonate, leading to a delayed diagnosis and treatment. Fourth, the decrease in compliance is undoubtedly also the cause of delayed diagnosis and treatment of DKA. However, patients with low socioeconomic status or unemployed can lead to a decrease in the proportion of outpatient visits. So we need programs that minimize outpatient examinations. Fifth, there are many influencing factors for mental status alerts, and there are large errors in doctors' discrimination.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: a potential complication of treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition [^7ecc9739]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the most recently approved antihyperglycemic medications. We sought to describe their association with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) in hopes that it will enhance recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication.

Research Design and Methods

Cases identified incidentally are described.

Results

We identified 13 episodes of SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euDKA or ketosis in nine individuals, seven with type 1 diabetes and two with type 2 diabetes, from various practices across the U.S. The absence of significant hyperglycemia in these patients delayed recognition of the emergent nature of the problem by patients and providers.

Conclusions

SGLT-2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps as a consequence of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who experience nausea, vomiting, or malaise or develop a metabolic acidosis in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy should be promptly evaluated for the presence of urine and/or serum ketones. SGLT-2 inhibitors should only be used with great caution, extensive counseling, and close monitoring in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Mesna [^612a69b5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences

False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies

A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies).

False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity

Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level.

False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid

Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds

Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a delayed immune-related event after discontinuation of nivolumab [^09b2e9ce]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody with immune checkpoint inhibitory activity, represents a novel treatment for several cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors cause side effects, known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or delayed immune-related events (DIRE), after immunotherapy discontinuation. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported to develop as an irAE during the treatment with nivolumab. Here, we report on a patient who developed T1DM and diabetic ketoacidosis after discontinuation of treatment with nivolumab as a DIRE.

Case Report

A 59-year-old man, who received nivolumab for an alpha fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer, presented with acute fatigue 4 months after discontinuation of nivolumab. Throughout therapy with nivolumab, the patient's hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was ≤ 6%. However, 1 month prior to the patient's emergency department visit, he noticed weight loss, and 3 weeks prior to that, his HbA1c was 7.1%. Urinalysis showed ketone bodies, and arterial blood gas analysis suggested metabolic acidosis with hyperglycemia (690 mg/dL), which established the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis. An endogenous insulin deficiency without verifiable anti-islet autoantibodies was confirmed; the patient had a human leukocyte antigen haplotype that does not increase the risk of acute-onset T1DM. We considered that T1DM in this patient developed possibly due to nivolumab. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case highlights the need for clinicians to be vigilant of the fact that a history of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, whether treatment is ongoing or discontinued.

### Feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring in subcutaneous tissue using a ketone sensor [^2651ee9b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Measuring urine or blood ketone levels using a strip-based technology has its limitations. It provides episodic information that confirms an already ongoing ketosis or DKA event. Early identification of production of ketones may warn of impending ketoacidosis that could reduce the complications of DKA and perhaps even prevent it. Real-time continuous ketone monitoring could also help clinicians manage ketoacidosis. For individuals who are on low carbohydrate diets, the sensor may serve as a tool to monitor the effectiveness of their diet and indicate the effect of diet or exercise on the ketone levels.

Blood ketone test strips typically have a measurement range of 0–8 mM. The appropriate measurement range for a ketone sensor is to be determined based on its use scenario. The in vitro performance of the sensor has been demonstrated up to 8 mM, showing that the sensor responds linearly to the change in the concentration of ketone and with minimal variation between sensors. In an in vitro setting, the sensor responds to changes to the ketone concentration quickly, with a response time of less than 4 minutes across a measurement range.

Unlike glucose, the baseline ketone levels are typically very low and calibrating the sensor at these concentration levels may not be effective. Therefore, operational stability is critical for a ketone sensor. Achieving operational stability for over 14 days for a NAD + dependent chemistry is even more challenging as NAD + is a free molecule, difficult to be retained in the sensing chemistry. Figure 3 shows that the operational stability of the sensor is very good with 2.1% signal change over 14 days.

The first human study of these ketone sensors demonstrated that ISF ketone concentrations in the subcutaneous ketone can be measured with these sensors, which tracks the capillary ketone levels over a 14-day period. Typically, there is a difference between in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of the sensor because of differences in matrices, requiring calibration of the sensor for addressing this difference. A single retrospective calibration was used for the assessment of the accuracy of the sensor with no further adjustments to the calibration over the wear period. From Figures 3 and 4, it can be determined that the sensor is stable over the 14-day period.

### Optimising the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 1 diabetes [^7ed72e8a]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Consider Prescribing Dapagliflozin

People most suitable for dapagliflozin in T1DM are likely to be those with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2, established on stable optimised insulin therapy (i.e. not recently diagnosed) and with high insulin needs (i.e. > 0.5 units/kg of body weight/day).

One of the most important criteria for determining if someone is suitable for dapagliflozin treatment is normal blood ketone levels (< 0.6 mmol/l). Urine ketone monitoring is not advisable as it is not deemed to be as accurate as blood ketone testing, since urine test results are indicative of blood ketone levels in the past, and accuracy is also affected by hydration levels and kidney function. The willingness/ability to follow prescribed regimens for monitoring ketones and responding appropriately to elevated ketone levels must also be considered.

Additional criteria for which people with T1DM should be prescribed dapagliflozin include glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (as dapagliflozin efficacy is dependent on renal function) and age 18–74 years (as the DEPICT clinical trial programme was conducted in this age group).

### Predicting the phenylalanine blood concentration from urine analyses. An approach to noninvasive monitoring of patients with phenylketonuria [^26fbdf59]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

The need for regular blood-drawing in the management of chronic metabolic disorders may negatively influence the compliance of patients and their parents; noninvasive analytical procedures could well alleviate this burden. Using data obtained in six adult probands with phenylketonuria, we evaluate the feasibility of noninvasive prediction of phenylalanine blood concentrations from analysis of phenylalanine and creatinine in urine. Cross-validated regression equations correct for the significant inter-individual variation of phenylalanine fractional excretion rates. With sensitive and specific enzymatic assays for phenylalanine and creatinine, the accuracy of this noninvasive procedure may also become clinically satisfactory for the purpose of self-monitoring.

Investigations and diagnosis

Bedside investigations showed a blood glucose level of 18.1 mmol/L and ketones 0.4 mmol/L. His urinalysis showed large glycosuria (> 1000 mg/dL) but was otherwise unremarkable. Formal laboratory investigation results are included in table 1.

Table 1
Laboratory results on day of admission

His presentation was discussed with his medical oncology team and the rash was considered unlikely to be related to nivolumab due to the timeline. He was admitted for further investigation and commenced on antihistamines and topical steroid cream. Oral steroids were withheld due to concerns of dampening the effects of immunotherapy, as requested by medical oncology.

Due to the abrupt onset of hyperglycaemia, ICI-DM was considered, and this was supported by an haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) that was disproportionate to the level of hyperglycaemia (results in table 2). C-peptide level, islet autoantibodies and an endocrinopathy screen were also performed.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Select inborn errors of metabolism — in infants with compatible clinical features — have recommended initial laboratory testing that includes blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, ammonia, uric acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid (L/P ratio), ketone bodies; and in urine, ketone bodies, 2-keto acids, reducing substances; acylglycines, pH; and sulfites. Newborn screening for galactosemia and tyrosinemia are performed in some countries to identify infants before they are symptomatic, and infants with tyrosinemia can present with cholestasis although more typically present with coagulopathy disproportionate to other biochemical abnormalities; diagnosis via serum fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase enzyme determination or urine succinylacetone is vital in this treatable but life-threatening condition.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^e5946349]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Participants

A total of 859 patients were screened, 616 provided informed consent, and 516 (83.7%) had all data elements necessary for data analysis (excluded patients: 49 with no urine dipstick, 30 with no serum pH via venous blood gas, and 21 with no serum chemistry panel). In our final sample, 54 of 516 subjects (10.5%) met the ADA criteria for DKA. See Table 1 for sample characteristics.

Table 1
Demographic and laboratory characteristics of the study sample

Diagnostic accuracy

At the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, the sensitivity of capillary β-OHB and the urine dipstick for DKA were identical at 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100). However, the specificity of β-OHB was significantly higher than that of the urine dipstick (78.6 [74.5–82.2] vs. 35.1% [30.7–39.6]; P < 0.01). Positive and negative predictive values of capillary β-OHB were 34.9 (27.3–43) and 99.7% (98.5–100), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of the urine dipstick were 15 (11.5–19.2) and 99.4% (96.6–100), respectively. Test characteristics of β-OHB were stable across a wide range of potential cutoffs (Table 1). The receiver-operator curve suggested that the optimal β-OHB cutoff is > 2 mmol/L, where sensitivity remains at 98.1% but specificity improves to 82.3%.

Summary of evidence

All randomized studies used fasting and pre-meal blood glucose levels as the basis for titrating insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Therefore, measuring blood glucose at these times is extremely important, despite the lack of studies comparing the best frequency for testing in patients with hospital hyperglycemia.
Vellanki et al. evaluated the relevance of bedtime glucose monitoring and its role in managing glycemia. The study found no significant improvement in fasting blood glucose levels or overall glycemic control from the use of bedtime insulin supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes, challenging current guidelines recommending routine bedtime supplementation for hyperglycemia correction. Hypoglycemia rates did not differ significantly between groups that received or did not receive bedtime insulin supplementation. Importantly, the majority of hypoglycemic episodes occurred between dinner and early morning, emphasizing the utility of bedtime glucose monitoring in identifying at-risk patients.
Bedtime blood glucose is an important safety parameter to avoid nighttime hypoglycemia in insulin-treated patients. It allows for checking the rise or fall of glucose levels during the night and helps in adjusting basal insulin doses.
Ribeiro et al. evaluated the impact of introducing an institutional glucose screening and monitoring program in a private Brazilian hospital, increasing monitoring from 27.7 to 75.5% of inpatients. This led to an increase in the identification of hyperglycemia from 9.3 to 12.2% and hypoglycemia from 1.5 to 3.3% of inpatients.

Summary of evidence

Capillary ketonemia measurement is an accurate and quick method for detecting serum ketone bodies. The test for detecting ketones in capillary blood has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 79%, compared to the urine ketone test, which has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 35%.
A systematic review of 5 studies, including 2019 patients, identified greater accuracy in measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in capillary blood compared to ketonuria for diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Euglycemic DKA (defined as glucose levels below 200 mg/dL) is a potential complication in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors and is underdiagnosed in the hospital setting.
In Canada and the UK (over 350,000 patients and 500 events of euglycemic DKA), SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a higher risk of DKA compared to DPP-4 inhibitors with incidence 2.03 vs. 0.75 per 1000 patient-years (RR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.99–4.08).

### Unexplained metabolic acidosis: alcoholic ketoacidosis or propylene glycol toxicity [^874c2072]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated anion and osmol gap is suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion. The absence of detectable methanol or ethylene glycol in the serum could mean that metabolism is complete or that other hypotheses have to be considered. Ingestion of less common alcohol or alcoholic ketoacidosis should be investigated as illustrated by the present observation.

Case Report

A 46-year-old woman was admitted with altered consciousness in the Emergency Department. In the presence of a high anion gap (peak value 39 mEq/L) metabolic acidosis with mildly increased osmol gap (peak value 19 mOsm/kg), there was a high suspicion of toxic alcohol ingestion in an individual with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Serum arterial lactate concentration was particularly high at 27 mmol/L. Urinalysis failed to reveal the presence of ketone bodies or oxalate crystals. The results of the serum determination of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol were obtained within 2 h and were negative. Due to the severity of lactic metabolic acidosis and the persisting suspicion of intoxication by a less common toxic alcohol, antidotal therapy with ethanol was initiated together with hemodialysis. Correction of lactic metabolic acidosis was obtained. Results of urinalysis obtained later revealed the presence not only of propylene glycol and D-lactate but also of significant concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate as a marker of alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Discussion

The combination of propylene glycol ingestion and alcoholic ketoacidosis may have contributed to the severity of lactic acidosis.

### Etodolac [^5a7aa197]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone. Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of warfarin andetodolac results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by prothrombin time. Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

The urine of patients who take etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of etodolac. Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with etodolac. Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events. No dose relationship has been observed.

Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving etodolac (600 mg to 1,000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy.

### Canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Invokamet) [^d58daa45]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR.

Withhold INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^2aa09b1f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Detection of surreptitious administration of analog insulin to an 8-week-old infant [^c605c995]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

An 8-week-old infant presented to the emergency department with lethargy, tachycardia, and a blood glucose concentration of 1.8 mmol/L. After admission, hypoglycemia recurred on 3 additional occasions. Initial urinalysis results were negative for ketones, and the results of additional laboratory tests did not support the diagnosis of cortisol or growth hormone deficiency, oral hypoglycemic ingestion, or an inborn error of metabolism. Difficulty restoring and maintaining glucose concentrations along with a transient response to glucagon during 1 hypoglycemic episode suggested hyperinsulinism. In 1 hypoglycemic episode, elevated insulin and low C-peptide concentrations suggested exogenous insulin administration, but 2 subsequent blood samples obtained during hypoglycemia contained appropriately decreased concentrations of insulin. The insulin immunoassay initially used in this case (Roche ElecSys/cobas [Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN]) was insensitive to insulin analogs. Two additional immunoassays, 1 with intermediate (Immulite [Siemens, Deerfield, IL]) and 1 with broad (radioimmunoassay [Millipore, Inc, Billerica, MA]) reactivity to insulin analogs were used to characterize insulin in each of the critical blood samples. Samples obtained during hypoglycemia displayed a graded reactivity similar to that observed in type 1 diabetic patients prescribed insulin analogs, whereas a sample obtained from the patient and a control subject during euglycemia showed equal reactivity among the 3 assays. These data suggested administration of insulin analog to the child, and further characterization of insulin by using tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of Humalog. The child was subsequently placed in foster care with no further recurrence of hypoglycemia.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^d293e450]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue JARDIANCE, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting JARDIANCE.

Withhold JARDIANCE, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume JARDIANCE when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue JARDIANCE and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

JARDIANCE can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating JARDIANCE in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating JARDIANCE. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving JARDIANCE. Treatment with JARDIANCE increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Conclusions

Urine dipsticks are a cheap, readily available, "point of care" test. We found significant interference from factors in urine measured by dipstick and the novel AKI biomarkers investigated here. Future studies should assess the interference of common urine elements on levels of biomarkers of interest and explore the impact of accounting for these elements on their prognostic/diagnostic performance.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^2f98583f]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL," lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup." When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL," insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

### Mesna (Mesnex) [^e95dd3e1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences

False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies

A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with MESNEX when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies).

False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity

MESNEX may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactiviation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level.

False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid

MESNEX may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds

MESNEX is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to MESNEX.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^b010e89d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### A curious cause of appendicitis [^5ec3b662]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Investigations

While blood tests had not been performed the previous day, on this second presentation they revealed a white cell count (WCC) of 14 9 /L and C reactive protein (CRP) of 25 mg/L. Urinalysis showed 1+ketones only.

As acute appendicitis was suspected, the boy was started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics as per Trust guidelines for appendicitis (amoxicillin, metronidazole and gentamycin) and booked for a laparoscopic appendicectomy. At surgery, an acute, gangrenous appendicitis of the body and tip of the appendix was found, with pus in the RIF, right paracolic gutter, pelvis and around the liver. Vicryl endoloops were applied to the base of the appendix and the appendix was excised, placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the umbilical port. A thorough washout with 2.5 L of saline followed until the fluid was clear. Postoperatively, the patient received 48 hours of IV antibiotics, was well and was discharged home. No oral antibiotics were given on discharge as the boy had clinically appeared to be very well, with observations within the normal range and no concerning features on abdominal examination.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^fc85bcd8]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Ketone monitoring and management — modalities and environmental constraints for wilderness use — Monitoring options for ketones include urine ketone strips and serum ketone monitoring using a fingerstick monitor similar to a blood glucometer. Serum ketone measurement may be preferred over urine ketone testing because this method provides real-time levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood, whereas urine ketones measure bladder ketone levels, which may reflect ketone levels that were previously higher. Expiration dates for ketone strips should be checked carefully prior to travel because strips may be inaccurate after their use-by date, and some ketone monitors are approved from −25 to 55°C and up to 7100 m. Ketone monitoring strategies should be discussed with anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes with insulin deficiency, type 2 diabetes requiring insulin injections, or someone who has known or suspected ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes.

### Illnesses associated with ketosis including diabetic ketoacidosis during very low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets [^3b90f723]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Characteristics of flagged events, and of illness associated with ketosis (IAK) including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and no DKA in people with diabetes (PWD).

Among PWD with IAK, there were no clinical characteristics or biomarkers that distinguished between people with adjudicated DKA and non‐DKA events, including risk factors for and markers of insulin deficiency, fingerstick glucose and BHB, SGLT2‐inhibitor and insulin use.

Table 3 shows the laboratory values of PWD with IAK, including adjudicated DKA and non‐DKA events. Laboratory assessments for ketosis were used for DKA adjudication but results are not included in the table due to heterogeneity of specimen sources and of reporting scales. Of the 51 people with DKA, 26 (54%) had blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, and 22 (46%) were normoglycemic. A similar percentage of laboratory glucose above and below 200 mg/dL was seen in non‐DKA IAK. Although alcohol and lactate may contribute to metabolic acidosis, these data were not systematically obtained in clinical practice, so we are unable to examine their roles. Not shown in the Table 3 are the laboratory values of the case of IAK without diabetes. This individual was acidotic (bicarbonate 13 mg/dL), and ketotic (urine ketones 3+), but was missing the glycaemia criterion due to normoglycaemia (93 mg/dL) and lack of history of diabetes.

TABLE 3
Laboratory values for illness associated with ketosis (IAK) including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and no DKA in people with diabetes (PWD).

In a univariate model, PWD ever taking an SGLT2‐inhibitor while in the treatment are 4.3 times more likely than those never on an SGLT2‐inhibitor (p < 0.001) to have an IAK event. Similarly, people who were ever exposed to SGLT2‐inhibitors, whether they were taking SGLT2‐inhibitor in the treatment or where these patients de‐prescribed SGLT2‐inhibitor just prior to dietary change as per our usual care protocol, are 5.9 times more likely than never on SGLT2‐inhibitor (p < 0.001) to have IAK.
