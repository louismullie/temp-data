## Question

On a whole body screening MRI, a dilated ascending thoracic aorta was noted, with the ascending thoracic aorta measuring 4.1 cm AP by 4.1 cm transverse — how should this finding be interpreted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a 4.1 cm by 4.1 cm ascending thoracic aorta seen on a whole-body screening MRI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this non–ECG-gated screening measurement is technically reliable and what anatomic level it represents. Then, I should verify how 4.1 cm maps onto accepted definitions of dilatation versus aneurysm and guideline thresholds for intervention. Next, I will assess short- and mid-term risk and typical growth rates at this size. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers such as sex and body size indexing, valve morphology, and potential heritable aortopathy. Finally, I will outline confirmatory imaging, appropriate surveillance intervals, and triggers for expedited action or referral [^111ZeqXm] [^111qCxYC] [^1134r3aJ].

> Let me first confirm the measurement context, because whole-body screening MRI is often non-gated and motion can overestimate the true lumen, especially in the proximal aorta; I should verify with a dedicated ECG-gated modality and consistent measurement technique perpendicular to the aortic centerline to avoid false labeling of disease severity [^111ZeqXm]. I need to check that an ECG-gated cardiac MRI (SSFP) or a CTA is obtained to confirm maximal diameter at the mid-ascending segment between the sinotubular junction and the innominate artery, since SSFP/MRA or CTA provide reliable, reproducible sizing for follow-up decisions, and cross-modality agreement with TTE can be good when conventions are standardized [^1137HPad] [^111qCxYC] [^116EuxU9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what 4.1 cm means; I should verify the cut-offs used by contemporary guidelines and large cohorts. By recent consensus and supportive population data, ascending aortic dilatation is typically defined at 4.0–4.4 cm and an ascending aneurysm at ≥ 4.5 cm, which means a 4.1 cm mid-ascending measurement is dilated but not aneurysmal, and it remains well below typical elective surgery thresholds of 5.5 cm for average-risk patients and 5.0 cm in selected higher-risk patients or centers of excellence per 2022 ACC/AHA guidance and corroborating literature [^115R4tWE] [^1134r3aJ] [^117Hp6Gz]. Wait, I initially almost labeled this as an aneurysm because 4.0 cm sometimes gets flagged in screening contexts; I should correct that and adhere to the ≥ 4.5 cm definition for an ascending aneurysm in these data and guidelines [^115R4tWE].

> I will now examine risk at this size, and I need to ensure I distinguish relative from absolute risk. Relative risk of dissection rises compared with small reference diameters, but the absolute event rate at 4.0–4.4 cm is low; large datasets estimate a dissection or rupture incidence around 0.1% per patient-year in the moderately enlarged range, and the Nature Communications screening cohort shows marked relative risk increases at 4.0–4.4 cm without implying a high absolute event rate at this threshold [^117QjaFW] [^115R4tWE]. Let me reconsider growth concerns next, because management hinges on both size and growth velocity rather than size alone [^112tfT9f].

> Next, I should review expected growth rates and whether baseline diameter predicts expansion. Wait, let me verify this; recent high-resolution longitudinal mapping studies show slow median growth around 0.2 mm/year and no meaningful correlation between baseline diameter and subsequent growth in nonsyndromic ascending dilatation cohorts, which argues against assuming faster expansion simply because the aorta is already mildly enlarged [^112cNPD4] [^113h2NTr]. I need to ensure follow-up measurements use the same modality and method because inter-modality differences and gating can mimic "growth" when none exists, so reproducible, ECG-gated imaging and double-oblique centerline measurements are critical for accurate trend assessment [^111ZeqXm] [^1137HPad].

> Patient-specific modifiers can shift interpretation, so I should confirm body size indexing and sex effects. For smaller individuals, the aortic size index (ASI = diameter/BSA) or aortic height index (AHI) better reflect risk; for example, with a BSA ≈ 1.7 m², 4.1 cm corresponds to ASI ≈ 2.4 cm/m², which is above normal but below the ~2.75 cm/m² aneurysm cut-point used in proximal aorta indexing frameworks, and newer criteria like ASI ≥ 3.08 cm/m² or AHI ≥ 3.21 cm/m can refine surgical eligibility in select patients, particularly women, in whom these indices are more often met despite similar absolute diameters [^111hFDHT] [^114MWR1m] [^116W2twG]. But wait, I should double-check that indexing is used to contextualize risk and not to redefine this particular 4.1 cm value as aneurysmal in a typical-sized adult, which it does not [^116W2twG] [^114MWR1m].

> I need to check for valve morphology and heritable aortopathy, because those modify thresholds and surveillance. Transthoracic echocardiography at diagnosis is recommended to define aortic valve anatomy and function and to reassess proximal diameters, and genetic or familial features may lower operative thresholds when high-risk markers are present; in patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve surgery, replacing the ascending aorta is considered at ≥ 50 mm, and in nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease with high-risk features, repair can be considered at ≥ 45 mm at experienced centers, which is far above 4.1 cm but relevant if additional risk factors emerge [^116f1NVG] [^115sYAR6] [^116jwZqJ] [^116JCEcY]. Hold on, I should verify that bicuspid valve alone does not make a 4.1 cm aorta a surgical indication; it does not, but it increases the importance of careful follow-up and perioperative planning if cardiac surgery is otherwise indicated [^115sYAR6] [^116f1NVG].

> For surveillance, I should confirm the interval recommended by guidelines. The ACC/AHA advises repeat imaging at 6–12 months to determine the enlargement rate and, if stable, every 6–24 months thereafter, with expedited reassessment if symptoms occur or measurements change unexpectedly; rapid growth, typically defined as ≥ 5 mm in any year or ≥ 3 mm/year in two consecutive years, is a trigger for considering operative management regardless of absolute size, provided the measurements are reproducible with gated techniques [^112tfT9f] [^113synBD]. Let me ensure the follow-up modality is ECG-gated and that the same centerline-perpendicular method and edge convention are documented each time to avoid artifactual "growth" from technique variation [^111ZeqXm] [^1137HPad].

> But wait, what if the enlargement is at the root rather than the tubular mid-ascending segment; I should verify the anatomic level carefully because root dilatation may carry a different natural history and risk curve than mid-ascending enlargement, with some series suggesting earlier hinge points for adverse events in root disease, though these are largely hypothesis-generating and should be integrated cautiously with guideline-based thresholds [^115uguFc] [^114x6MGu]. I need to ensure my labeling distinguishes aortic root, sinotubular junction, and mid-ascending measurements so that risk estimates and follow-up are anatomically appropriate [^111ZeqXm].

> Pulling this together, my plan is as follows: confirm the 4.1 cm mid-ascending diameter with ECG-gated CTA or cardiac MRI and a baseline TTE to assess valve anatomy and function, classify this as ascending aortic dilatation rather than aneurysm, initiate surveillance with repeat imaging in 6–12 months using the same technique, index to body size to contextualize risk in smaller patients, screen for bicuspid valve and heritable features that could lower thresholds in special circumstances, and reserve surgical referral for future scenarios of rapid growth, concomitant valve surgery with larger diameters, or if standardized indices or absolute size thresholds are reached per guideline criteria [^111qCxYC] [^116f1NVG] [^112tfT9f] [^1134r3aJ] [^1135FpfQ].

The ascending aorta measuring 4.1 cm is **mildly dilated** and does not meet aneurysm criteria (≥ 4.5 cm) [^115R4tWE] [^1134r3aJ]. This size carries a **low annual risk** of dissection or rupture (< 0.1% per year) [^117QjaFW] and does not warrant surgery unless there is rapid growth, symptoms, or high-risk features [^1134r3aJ]. Management is **medical**: strict blood pressure control, lifestyle modification, and surveillance imaging at 12 months, then every 1–2 years if stable [^112tfT9f]. Evaluate for a bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disease, and family history [^116f1NVG] [^113MZnpj] refer to cardiology or vascular surgery if high-risk features are present.

---

## Normal and abnormal ascending aortic dimensions

The normal ascending aortic diameter in adults is 2.1–3.5 cm, varying by age, sex, and body size. Mild dilation is **3.6–4.4 cm**, whereas an aneurysm is **≥ 4.5 cm**. Thus, the reported 4.1 cm represents mild dilation and does not meet aneurysm criteria.

---

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

Mild dilation (4.0–4.4 cm) has a **low annual risk** of dissection or rupture (< 0.1% per year) [^117QjaFW] [^1162QeVB]. Risk increases with larger diameters, rapid growth (> 3 mm/year), connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve, or family history of aortic disease [^1135FpfQ] [^112Crra3].

---

## Recommended clinical management

### Initial evaluation

Initial evaluation should **confirm the measurement** with ECG-gated CT or MRI [^111ZeqXm] to reduce motion artifacts, ensure accuracy, and establish a baseline for future comparison [^111qCxYC]. Also assess risk factors, including a bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disorders (e.g. Marfan, Loeys-Dietz), and a family history of aortic disease [^116f1NVG].

---

### Medical management

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; use beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors/ARBs.
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, weight management, regular aerobic exercise, and dietary changes.
- **Avoidance of strenuous activities**: Avoid heavy lifting or intense isometric exercise.

---

### Surveillance imaging

- **Initial follow-up**: Repeat imaging at 6–12 months to assess growth rate [^112tfT9f].
- **Stable dilation**: If stable (< 0.5 mm/year), extend intervals to every 1–2 years [^112tfT9f].
- **Rapid growth**: If ≥ 3 mm/year, consider earlier intervention or closer monitoring [^1134r3aJ] [^113synBD].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is **not indicated at 4.1 cm** unless there is rapid growth, symptoms, or high-risk features [^1134r3aJ]. General thresholds include:

- **Standard threshold**: ≥ 5.5 cm for asymptomatic patients without high-risk features [^1134r3aJ].
- **High-risk patients**: ≥ 5.0 cm for connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve with risk factors, or family history of dissection [^1135FpfQ] [^117Hp6Gz].
- **Rapid growth**: ≥ 3 mm/year regardless of absolute size [^113h2NTr].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Mild dilation generally has a **favorable prognosis** with a low risk of complications when managed appropriately. Regular surveillance and risk-factor control are essential to prevent progression [^114Apfys] [^116jwxmu].

### Ai-based screening for thoracic aortic aneurysms in routine breast MRI [^115R4tWE]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Using the determined aortic diameter, we quantitatively assessed the presence of thoracic aortic dilatation and thoracic aortic aneurysm separately for the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. Definitions of enlarged diameters of the thoracic aorta were selected according to international guidelines and literature as follows.

- **Ascending thoracic aorta (AA)**: Given the sharp increase in the risk of dissection relative to a control aortic diameter of ≤ 3.4 cm, we used specific cut-off values in our study based on the AHA 2022 guidelines for women. An aortic diameter of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm is associated with an 89-fold increased risk, and a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm is associated with a 6000-fold increased risk. Therefore, thoracic ascending aortic dilation (AA dilatation) is defined at 4.0–4.4 cm, and thoracic ascending aortic aneurysm (AA aneurysm) is defined as an aortic diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm.

- **Descending thoracic aorta (DA)**: For the descending thoracic aorta, the presence of dilatation is defined as 3.0–3.4 cm, and thoracic descending aortic (DA) aneurysm is defined as ≥ 3.5 cm. This is in accordance with data from the Framingham Heart Study, which reported an average diameter of 23.1 ± 2.6 mm for women. Dilatation is considered at diameters adding 2 standard deviations to the mean diameter, and an aneurysm is defined at 150% of the vessel in concordance with the American College of Radiology (ACR) Incidental Finding Committee.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Turner syndrome, specifically in the context of cardiac imaging, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend using the ascending aortic size index (the ratio of aortic diameter to body surface area), the aortic height index (the ratio of aortic diameter to height), or the aortic z-score. These measures are used to define the degree of aortic dilatation and to assess the risk of aortic dissection, taking into account the smaller body size of patients (aged 15 years or older) with Turner syndrome.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^115uguFc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The unique nature of root versus mid diameters is significant, as the distribution of the root and mid diameters in size groups questions their homogenized surgical management. The root is characterized by lesser mean and standard deviation, which implies diverging natural histories with embryology likely playing a key role as diverse embryonic cell lines converge to form the ascending aorta. The neural crest populates the ascending segment, while the lateral plate mesoderm supplies the root with smooth muscle of a specific kind. The adjacent structures and the diverse anatomic-physiologic standpoint may be of paramount importance for root and mid remodeling during adulthood, contributing further to their diverse risk profile. The conclusion is that the natural histories of the root and the mid are unique.

Conducting a randomized study on this topic may present ethical issues. As surgical repair of ascending aorta aneurysms is well established, withholding this treatment might be considered inappropriate, and therefore, randomized trials may not be ethical. The best surrogate for studying the natural history of dilatation is retrospective observation. Yale's database is now robust enough to allow the detailed analysis of 1162 patients with aneurysms, where data were accurately recollected, and the aortas were carefully remeasured.

This analysis offers a new perspective on root and mid dilatation with strong clinical implications. These two structures deserve new and individualized criteria and management.

### Impact of nondiameter aortic indices on surgical eligibility: Results from the Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery Versus Surveillance (TITAN: SVS) randomized controlled trial [^116W2twG]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Traditional criteria for intervention on an asymptomatic ascending aortic aneurysm have traditionally required a maximal aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or more. However, the 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association aortic guidelines adopted alternative parameters such as cross-sectional aortic area/height ratio, aortic size index, and aortic height index for surgical intervention. This study's objective was to evaluate the impact of using these newer indices on patient eligibility for surgical intervention in a prospective, multicenter cohort with moderate-sized ascending aortic aneurysms between 5.0 and 5.4 cm.

Patients enrolled from 2018 to 2023 in the randomization or registry arms of the multicenter trial, Treatment In Thoracic Aortic aNeurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance, were included in the study. Clinical data were captured prospectively in an online database, and imaging data were derived from a core computed laboratory.

Among the 329 included patients, 20% were female. The mean age was 65.0 ± 11.6 years, and the mean maximal aortic diameter was 50.8 ± 3.9 mm. In the one-third of all patients (n = 109) who met any one of the three criteria (i.e. aortic size index ≥ 3.08 cm/m², aortic height index ≥ 3.21 cm/m, or cross-sectional aortic area/height ≥ 10 cm²/m), their mean maximal aortic diameter was 52.5 ± 0.52 mm. Alternate criteria were most commonly met in women compared with men: 20% versus 2% for aortic size index (P < .001), 39% versus 5% for aortic height index (P < .001), and 39% versus 21% for cross-sectional aortic area/height (P = 0.002), respectively.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112cNPD4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for three-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size-adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), the mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and the median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was independently associated with growth rate.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^113q3y6R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

As the surgical threshold for the ascending aorta comes to the forefront, the disentanglement of root and mid natural histories acquires new interest. Their separate risk curves are introduced in this study, unveiling cutoff values that blended with each other in the classical ascending-aorta risk curve. This landmark curve was reproduced by large retrospective and prospective studies that fueled the guidelines and established the threshold of 5.5 cm. These studies established the regression analysis of risk against aortic size and its hinge point as the surgical threshold.

In the same context, from the present study, the mid-risk curve presents a hinge point at approximately 5.25 cm, and the root risk curves even earlier at 5.0 cm. These findings advocate for earlier intervention, especially in root aneurysms. Both of these thresholds are accommodated by our recent advocacy for a "left shift" to a simple 5.0 cm criterion for established centers of excellence that can deliver ascending surgery at relatively low risk.

### Descending aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater is not an accurate predictor of acute type B aortic dissection [^114LbgK5]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The risk of acute type B aortic dissection is thought to increase with descending thoracic aortic diameter. Currently, elective repair of the descending thoracic aorta is indicated for an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater. This study investigates the relationship between aortic diameter and acute type B aortic dissection, evaluating the utility of aortic diameter as a predictor of acute type B aortic dissection.

- **Methods**: We examined the descending aortic diameter at presentation of 613 patients with acute type B aortic dissection who were enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection between 1996 and 2009 and analyzed the subset of patients with an aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm.

- **Results**: The median aortic diameter at the level of acute type B aortic dissection was 4.1 cm (range 2.1–13.0 cm). Only 18.4% of patients had an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater. Patients with Marfan syndrome represented 4.3% and had a slightly larger aortic diameter than patients without Marfan syndrome (4.68 vs. 4.32 cm, P = 0.121). Complicated acute type B aortic dissection was more common among patients with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater (52.2% vs. 35.6%, P < .001), and in-hospital mortality for patients with an aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm and 5.5 cm or greater was 6.6% and 23.0% (P < .001), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of patients with acute type B aortic dissection present with a descending aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm.

### Polygenic scoring for detection of ascending thoracic aortic dilation [^111eXZ93]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Ascending thoracic aortic dilation is a complex heritable trait that involves modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. Polygenic scores (PGS) are increasingly used to assess risk for complex diseases. The degree to which a PGS can improve aortic diameter prediction in diverse populations is unknown. Presently, we tested whether adding a PGS to clinical prediction algorithms improves performance in a diverse biobank.

- **Methods**: The analytic cohort comprised 6,235 Penn Medicine Biobank participants with available echocardiography and clinical data linked to genome-wide genotype data. Linear regression models were used to integrate PGS weights derived from a genome-wide association study of thoracic aortic diameter performed in the UK Biobank and were compared with the performance of the previously published aorta optimized regression for thoracic aneurysm (AORTA) score.

- **Results**: Cohort participants had a median age of 61 years (IQR, 53–70) and a mean ascending aortic diameter of 3.36 cm (SD, 0.49). Fifty-five percent were male, and 33% were genetically similar to an African reference population. Compared with the AORTA score, which explained 30.6% (95% CI, 29.9%-31.4%) of the variance in aortic diameter, AORTA score + UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 33.1% (95% CI, 32.3%-33.8%); the reweighted AORTA score explained 32.5% (95% CI, 31.8%-33.2%); and the reweighted AORTA score + UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 34.9% (95% CI, 34.2%-35.6%). When stratified by population, models including the UK Biobank-derived PGS consistently improved upon the clinical AORTA score.

### Debate: Whether evidence supports reducing the threshold diameter to 5 cm for elective interventions in women with abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115RRP32]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines recommend repair of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms once they reach the 5.5-cm-diameter threshold and are based on information from randomized controlled trials. However, because aneurysms are more common in men, women are under-represented in these trials, and questions persist about whether this repair threshold should apply to them. In addition, women have smaller aortas to begin with and, in most aneurysm cohorts, are older, have more atherosclerotic risk factors, are less likely to be anatomic candidates for endovascular repair, and fare poorer after emergency or elective repair of their aneurysm. These are just some of the issues that our discussants address in determining whether the repair threshold should be at a smaller diameter for women.

### Surgical repair of bicuspid aortopathy at small diameters: Clinical and institutional factors [^112Z3ZS6]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve is a common risk factor for thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Guidelines for elective ascending aortic intervention (AAI) in bicuspid aortic valve are derived from limited evidence, and the extent of practice variation due to patient and provider characteristics is unknown. Using data from two large cardiovascular registries, we investigated factors that influence decisions for AAI.

All bicuspid aortic valve cases with known aortic diameters and surgical status were included. We used multivariable logistic regression to profile predictors of isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) or AVR+AAI, stratified by patient characteristics, surgical indications, and institution.

We studied 2,861 subjects at 18 institutions from 1996 to 2015. The median aortic diameter of patients who underwent AVR+AAI varied widely across institutions (39–52 mm). Aortic diameters were < 45 mm in 38% of patients undergoing AVR+AAI. Patients who underwent AAI at < 45 mm, compared with those managed nonoperatively, were younger (54 ± 13 vs 61 ± 15 years; P < .001) with more frequent aortic stenosis (53% vs 28%; P < .001) and regurgitation (52% vs 18%; P < .001).

Clinical and institutional factors influence the timing of AAI and are associated with significant variability in ascending aortic diameter at AAI across institutions. More than one third of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve undergo AAI at aortic diameters < 45 mm. Long-term outcomes of this subgroup of patients, who may manifest earlier and more severe disease, are needed.

### 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: A report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^116f1NVG]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thoracic aortic aneurysm, particularly in relation to echocardiography, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a TTE at the time of diagnosis. This is to assess aortic valve anatomy, aortic valve function, and thoracic aortic diameters in patients with a dilated thoracic aorta.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^111bENgG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In view of the ascending aorta as a single unit, the slope of both curves increases considerably at the diameter of about 5.5 cm, thus reproducing the surgical cutoff value recommended by guidelines. There was no correction for the mid-ascending aorta size as this notion was proposed recently. Taking into consideration the success rates of repair at expert centers and the 15% risk of the first composite endpoint between 5.0 and 5.5 cm, the surgical threshold of 5.5 cm is arguably high. The aortas with low diameters demonstrate pseudo-high risk because of a selection bias with the underrepresentation of healthy individuals. The R² values are very close to 1, suggesting that the trend lines almost perfectly fit the data.

- **Lifetime risk**: The lifetime risk of the first composite endpoint (red line) and the second composite endpoint (black line) is illustrated against the mid-ascending aorta diameter of the 1162 patients.

A mid-ascending aorta diameter > 5.25 cm poses a considerable increase in risk for the first and second composite endpoints. The aortas with low diameters demonstrate different degrees of pseudo-high risk because of a selection bias with the underrepresentation of healthy individuals. At diameters > 4.5 cm, the sample becomes representative. Note that the risk of the first composite endpoint, attributed to a mid 5.0 cm width, is almost 6%. The R² values are very close to 1, suggesting that the trend lines almost perfectly fit the data.

### Ascending aortic aneurysm by cardiac CT angiography [^116xZoft]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is an increasingly frequent and potentially life-threatening medical diagnosis. TAA is defined as a localized dilatation of the aorta to more than 50% of baseline. Patients are most commonly asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis is made incidentally on chest radiography or echocardiography and then confirmed by echocardiography, left ventricular angiography, cardiac computed tomography, or cardiac magnetic resonance. Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an excellent imaging modality for this purpose as it allows simultaneous analysis of the coronary artery tree, which is useful in determining the most suitable procedure for each patient.

### Discrepancies in measurement of the thoracic aorta: JACC review topic of the week [^111ZeqXm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Clinicians often encounter discrepant measurements of the ascending aorta that impede, complicate, and impair appropriate clinical assessment, including key issues such as the presence or absence of aortic growth, rate of growth, and the need for surgical intervention. These discrepancies may arise within a single modality — computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or echocardiography — or between modalities. The authors explore the origins and significance of these discrepancies, revealing that some "truth" usually underlies all the discrepant measurements. Each modality views the ascending aorta from different perspectives and uses various dimensional definitions.

The authors conclude with a practical "question and answer" section that addresses common specific issues in the interpretation and management of patients in real-world settings.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113h2NTr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for three-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size–adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was identified as a factor influencing…

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, especially in patients with other heritable aortic diseases, the ESVS 2017 guidelines recommend considering surgery in patients with a genetic syndrome and an enlarged aortic diameter of less than 50 mm:

- **According to body surface area**: This is particularly relevant for patients of small stature.

- **For rapid progression or more aggressive diseases**: Prompt surgical intervention may be warranted.

- **With a family history of dissection**: A proactive approach is advised.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^111bTnqd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The regression analyses offer valuable insights into the natural history of aortic dilatation. The derived associations, when carefully interpreted, can serve as stepping stones for further studies. Root dilatation and short stature were significant risk factors in all groups. At a second reading, the < 1 hazard ratio of the mid-diameter in the all-patients group is not suggesting a protective effect. Considering the malevolent behavior of root aneurysms, this hazard ratio reflects the milder disease virulence of mid aneurysms, which offer a broader time window for repair that does provide a protective effect. After partially controlling for the confounding factor of surgery by eliminating the surgical patients, it was reconfirmed in the non-surgical group that root dilatation is more dangerous than mid-dilatation.

Body surface area proved less important than height, reiterating that height normalization is more useful for risk estimation. The results for age and hypertension were inconclusive. Younger age and hypertension might predispose individuals to major adverse aortic events (MAAEs). Female sex and diabetes mellitus (DM) were bystanders, heating up the debate about their repercussions. Female sex has been firmly linked to worse outcomes, and DM or antidiabetic medications have been conjectured to be protective.

- **Sampling bias in small size ranges**: The risk curves play a pivotal role in clinical decision-making. The large sample of this study was representative of enlarged aortas, and the risk curve of the ascending aorta as a single unit reproduced the anticip.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for thoracic aortic aneurysm, specifically with respect to the screening of family relatives, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining an aortic TTE if the aortic root and ascending aorta are adequately visualized. Otherwise, CT or MRI should be used in family members found, through genetic screening, to have inherited the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^111Wmva8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Continuous variables are expressed as mean (± SD) or as median (25th–75th percentile values) depending on normality, which was assessed with the Shapiro‐Wilk test. Categorical variables are expressed as percentages for each class. The Student t-test and the Mann‐Whitney U-test were used to compare continuous variables, as appropriate. For categorical variables, the Fisher exact test was used if any individual cell sizes were n < 20; otherwise, the χ² test was used. Pearson correlation coefficients were applied to assess correlations between continuous variables and to test the key hypothesis: the relationship between VDM-derived growth rate and maximal ascending aortic diameters, ascending aortic length, and additional derived size metrics.

Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent contributions of clinical characteristics and CT-derived imaging metrics in predicting the VDM-derived growth rate. Missing clinical data were noted where applicable and excluded from analysis. Patients excluded for poor image quality or failure of the VDM analysis were compared with the included population for differences in baseline clinical characteristics to assess potential bias. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for cohort studies.

### Ascending aortic length and its association with type A aortic dissection [^113bKSz9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Wu et al. evaluated the yearly occurrence of adverse aortic events at varying aortic lengths and diameters, and their findings also support aortic elongation as an important finding in patients at risk for aortic dissection. They further identified hinge points in predicted aortic risk models and suggested that an aortic length cutoff of 11 cm may be used for risk evaluation of patients with TAAs. However, more than half of the patients included in our study would have failed to be identified before presentation with aortic dissection. Our approach, rather than using an absolute cutoff value for length, incorporates easily accessible variables to provide a more nuanced and individualized approach to answer the question of "how long is too long?" The increases in ascending aortic length seen in the predissection group are relative to what would be expected for an individual given a specific age and sex. Larger population studies are required before recommending any relative increases in length as signaling a clinically important increase that would prompt elective surgery.

### Isolated ascending aorta dilatation is associated with increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113cuh8K]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a progressive condition with an increased risk of aortic dissection and mortality. In this study, our results indicate that 2D-TTE imaging is comparable to CT methodology for measuring and estimating ascending aorta diameters during routine echocardiographic examination. Routine 2D-TTE procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and supplemental tests; evaluation of end organ damage (e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus); evaluation of cardiac and aortic structure and function (e.g. left atrial appendage, left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, prosthetic heart valves, paravalvular abscesses, patients on ventilators, or with chest wall injuries); intraoperative TTE; guidance of transcatheter procedures (e.g. septal defect closure, or atrial appendage obliteration, transcatheter valve procedures); and management of critically ill patients.

In addition, we show that patients aged over 75, primarily non-smokers, without known valvular diseases or hemodynamic compromise, but with increased proximal (tubular) ascending aorta (D diameter) during routine echocardiographic measurements, may present with silent AAA. In fact, an increased proximal (tubular) ascending aorta (D diameter) represents an independent predictor of a silent AAA with a threshold of ≥ 33 mm or ≥ 19 mm/m². We hypothesized that in larger prospective studies, the B diameter can also become significantly dilated. Conversely, the fibrous portion of the A and C diameters can mask progression of the dilatation in those areas.

### Sex-specific thoracic aortic dimensions and clinical implications [^113AhXYh]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with a dilated thoracic aorta are at risk for aortic complications such as aortic dissection or rupture. While these aortic complications result in high mortality rates, aortic dilatation often remains asymptomatic for a long period of time. Therefore, identification and treatment of individuals with a dilated aorta is of paramount importance, especially given the availability of diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines define a dilated aorta as having a diameter exceeding 40 mm. Preventive surgery is recommended for aortic diameters above 55 mm for both women and men.

Even though thoracic aortic aneurysms are less prevalent in women compared to men, the consequences are worse for women. Female patients with an aortic dissection experience poorer surgical outcomes and have higher mortality rates than men. Additionally, the growth rate of a thoracic aneurysm is greater in women compared to men.

Currently, as medicine advances, personalized medicine is emerging. The most relevant patient characteristics considered in medicine are age, sex, and comorbidities such as diabetes. However, for aortic complications, information on subgroups is limited because the data in older patients is sparse, and the currently used cut-off values are based on a cohort of relatively young people. Moreover, thoracic aortic diameter values have been determined regardless of sex, resulting in one-size-fits-all cut-off values, while the Framingham Heart Study.

### Surgery insight: The dilated ascending aorta — indications for surgical intervention [^114AzQYp]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Awareness of the clinical significance of thoracic aortic aneurysmal disease has increased in recent years. As diagnostic tools have improved our ability to identify aortic pathology, surgical outcomes have also improved, making intervention a life-saving option in the majority of cases. Here, we aim to examine the indications for surgical intervention on the dilated aorta, particularly the ascending segment.

Studies of the natural history of ascending aortic aneurysms indicate that aneurysms exceeding 6 cm in maximum diameter are associated with a particularly high risk of complications. In the interest of providing some margin of safety, most surgeons would agree that intervention is indicated with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm. Many would intervene even earlier (at 5.0 cm) for patients at low surgical risk or for those with known connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome. In some cases, only the ascending aortic segment needs to be treated, while in others, full root replacement is required.

Reduction aortoplasty has been largely superseded by interposition graft replacement. The standard procedure involves replacement of the valve and root with a composite mechanical conduit or tissue root prosthesis, and results are excellent. Recently developed valve-sparing root reconstructive options, however, are promising and have encouraged an even more aggressive surgical stance.

### The predictive value of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio for ascending aort progression in patients with ascending aortic diameter of 40–50 mm [^113buyXf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Ascending aortic aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition as it may lead to rupture or dissection. Although there are certain risk factors, such as male sex, smoking, hypertension, previous history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), familial disposition, and advanced age, for abdominal aortic dilatation, these among patients with ascending aortic aneurysms are not well described.

The pathology of aortic dilatation varies based on its location. Cystic medial degeneration is the most important cause of ascending aortic dilatations, whereas atherosclerosis is the most prominent factor for descending and abdominal aortic dilatations. The association between abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammation has been previously studied, and some markers, such as white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6, and albumin, are shown to be responsible.

In recent years, it has been proven that inflammation plays an important role in the development of ascending aorta dilatation. T lymphocytes and macrophages are common features in the aorta of patients with medial degeneration. Inflammatory infiltration of T cells expressing Fas may contribute to ascending aortic dilatations in a similar fashion as to abdominal aortic dilatations. It was found that patients with ascending aortic dilatation have elevated plasma d-dimers and hypersensitive CRP. The CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR) was found to be a better indicator of the inflammatory process than either marker alone in cardiovascular disease development and also the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

### Validation of thoracic aortic dimensions on ECG-triggered SSFP as alternative to contrast-enhanced MRA [^1137HPad]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Surgery indications for thoracic aortic aneurysms are mainly based on either absolute aortic diameters or size increases over 1 year. The lower threshold for aneurysms is stated in guidelines and depends on the aortic segment of the dilation — ascending aorta, aortic arch, or descending aorta — and on the medical condition of the patient. An increase in size of more than 3 mm per year should be measured using repetitive measurements obtained with the same imaging technique at exactly the same aortic level. This increase should be verified using an alternative technique to test its consistency when it impacts therapeutic decisions.

To prevent overestimation or underestimation of aortic size increase between repetitive measurements when using both non-ECG-triggered CE-MRA and SSFP-MRA in follow-up, similarity of dimensions is required, as demonstrated in this study. However, variability in and between observers within the same sequence will inevitably add some uncertainty about the actual size increase. This is especially the case when measuring the aortic root in CE-MRA, which is affected by motion artefacts.

When aortic root dilatation is suspected, ideally, SSFP-MRA should be performed to minimize both false negative and positive surgery indications. The use of CE-MRA or SSFP-MRA does not influence the accuracy of the assessed aortic size increase in suspected aortic dilation in other segments, since variation was found to be similar between sequences. To ensure the selection of exactly the same aortic level in follow-up measurements, it may be helpful to measure the distances.

### Aortic size at the time of type A and type B dissections [^117N32rV]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Aortic diameter at the time of dissection remains an indispensable risk-determining characteristic for the prophylactic repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Histograms of aortic size at the time of dissection have the potential to shed more light on this relationship.

- **Methods**: The size of the thoracic aorta at the time of dissection was determined from imaging of 407 naturally occurring, acute, flap-type ascending or descending aortic dissections treated at one institution (1990–2022). Histograms were constructed to depict aortic size at the time of dissection. Data were analyzed by logistic regression.

- **Results**: There were 170 (69.11%) of 246 type A dissections (median, 5.07 cm; interquartile range, 4.60–5.67 cm) and 130 (80.75%) of 161 type B dissections (median, 4.2 cm; interquartile range, 3.60–4.87 cm) that occurred at diameters < 5.5 cm. By unadjusted regression, factors associated with significantly increased odds of type A dissection at diameters < 5.5 cm were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; p = 0.023), hypertension (OR, 1.82; p = 0.036), and smoking (OR, 1.92; p = 0.029). Patients with bicuspid aortic valve had significantly decreased odds of type A dissection at diameters < 5.5 cm (OR, 0.3; p = 0.047). The recent "left shift" to 5.0 cm in the criterion for ascending aortic intervention could prevent an additional 29.3% of type A dissections.

- **Conclusions**: Aortic diameter at the time of type A dissection is consistent with the new guidelines that recommend surgical intervention at 5.0 cm. Type B dissection occurs at smaller sizes and cannot be prevented with a size criterion alone.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, and more specifically in patients with other heritable aortic diseases, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend considering aortic repair by experienced surgeons within a multidisciplinary aortic team. This is advised for patients with an aneurysm of the aortic root or ascending aorta, with nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease and no identified genetic cause, and with a maximal aortic diameter of ≥ 45 mm. These patients should have high-risk features for adverse aortic events or be undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications.

### Risk of aortic dissection in the moderately dilated ascending aorta [^117QjaFW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that many patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AD) have aortic diameters of less than 55 mm at presentation, prompting discussion of lowering the prophylactic surgical guidelines. However, the risk of dissection at these smaller diameters is poorly defined.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study is to understand the risk of AD in moderately dilated ascending aortas using a large echocardiographic data set.

- **Methods**: Using an institutional echocardiography database, we identified 4,654 nonsyndromic adults (age: 68.6 ± 13.1 years; 1,003 women) with maximal ascending aortic diameters of 40 to 55 mm. We performed competing risk analysis to determine the independent risk factors of AD or aortic rupture.

- **Results**: Five hundred eighty-six individuals (12.6%) had bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs). During follow-up (14,431.5 patient-years), AD and rupture occurred in 13 and 1 patients, respectively, which demonstrated a linearized incidence of AD and/or rupture of 0.1% per patient-year. Elective ascending aortic repair was performed in 176 individuals. On multivariable analyses, independent predictors of AD and/or rupture were age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.12; p = 0.024) and baseline aortic diameters (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.36; p = 0.006). The presence of a BAV was not a significant factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.10 to 8.40; p = 0.95). Estimated risks of AD and/or rupture within 5 years were 0.4%, 1.1%, and 2.9% at baseline aortic diameters of 45, 50, and 55 mm, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Risks of AD and/or rupture increase with baseline aortic diameter.

### Inherited thoracic aortic disease: New insights and translational targets [^112bBFpY]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote conditions in which abnormalities lead to thoracic aortic wall weakness or abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles, predisposing patients to aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, and acute aortic complications. Degradation of the components of the thoracic aortic wall can also occur as part of acquired processes, for example, associated with aging or high blood pressure, factors that potentially compound genetically influenced thoracic aortic wall weakness. Patients with inherited aortopathy are at substantially increased risk of acute aortic complications, including aortic dissection or rupture, carrying with it major mortality risk. Because the outcomes from elective surgery are superior to those associated with emergency repair once dissection has occurred, international guidelines advocate a focus on recognizing those at risk early, regular monitoring with imaging, and prophylactically replacing the diseased aortic segment once a threshold diameter is reached. Even with these guidelines and robust monitoring, many patients with inherited thoracic aortopathy still experience aortic dissection or rupture while still below the threshold diameter, whereas others may undergo surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms that are unlikely to dissect or rupture. There is therefore universal agreement that better identification and risk stratification of thoracic aortopathy are urgently required. Indeed, a substantial body of research has been dedicated to addressing these challenges.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, particularly concerning patients with Turner syndrome (diagnostic imaging), the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend using the ascending aortic size index (ratio of aortic diameter to body surface area), aortic height index (ratio of aortic diameter to height), or aortic z-score. These metrics are used to define the degree of aortic dilatation and assess the risk of aortic dissection, taking into account the typically smaller body size of patients (≥ 15 years) with Turner syndrome.

### Dilatation of the ascending aorta - Growth rate, risk factors and clinical outcomes in the long-term follow-up [^114Apfys]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the risk factors, growth rate, and outcomes of ascending aortic (AA) dilatation in patients scheduled for imaging follow-up, this retrospective study included 143 patients who were followed up with thoracic aortic CT-angiography. AA diameters were measured from the aortic root (sinus Valsalva) and mid-AA at the baseline and after long-term follow-up. Risk factors and clinical outcomes were collected from medical records. The standard error of measurement (SEM) method was used to assess the statistical significance of the growth rate of AA dilatation.

The patients' mean age was 64.0 ± 10.0 years, with a predominance of males (n = 115, 80.4%). The mean imaging follow-up time was 3.4 ± 1.6 years, and clinical follow-up was 5.7 ± 1.7 years. According to the SEM method, 37.8% of the patients (n = 54) experienced significant AA growth, 18.9% (n = 27) in the aortic root (0.5 ± 0.7 mm/year), and 24.5% (n = 35) in the mid-AA (0.4 ± 0.5 mm/year). None of the patients experienced aortic rupture, dissection, or died due to aortic reasons during the follow-up. Eighteen patients (12.6%) underwent elective surgical AA reconstruction, and 10 patients (7.0%) died due to some other reason. Male gender was the only factor associated with significant accelerated growth (p = 0.047). However, antihypertensive medication appeared to be a protective factor (p = 0.01).

Less than half of the patients followed due to AA dilatation displayed significant AA growth during the long-term follow-up. Additionally, the growth rate per year was small.

### Follow-up of incidentally detected mild to moderate ascending aortic dilation and risk factors for rapid progression in a Swedish middle-aged population [^1128XtsZ]. Heart (2025). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening disease due to the risk for acute aortic syndromes, causing subjects with dilated ascending aortas to be recommended for surveillance imaging to assess the need for preventive surgery. Our objectives were to investigate the progression of dilated ascending aortas and identify risk factors for rapid progression in a prospectively enrolled, general population-based cohort of subjects aged 50–65 years.

- **Methods**: From the 5058 subjects prospectively enrolled in the general population-based Swedish CardioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) in Linköping, we followed all 74 subjects (22% female, mean age 59 ± 4 years) with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 40mm) identified by CT angiography, thoracic CT, or transthoracic echocardiography. Office and home blood pressure (BP), pulse wave velocity, coronary artery calcification, and carotid plaques were assessed at baseline. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to follow ascending aortic diameters over time.

- **Results**: Three subjects underwent acute or elective aortic repair before the first follow-up examination. Among the remaining subjects, the mean progression rate of ascending aortic diameter was 0.4mm/year (range 0–1.8mm/year) during a mean follow-up of 6.1 ± 1.3 years. In 10 (14%) subjects, all men, no progression was seen. In multivariable analysis, higher 7-day home systolic BP was the only factor associated with a faster progression rate.

- **Conclusions**: Progression of mild to moderate ascending aortic dilation was generally slow. Our findings emphasize the benefit of home BP measurements over office measurements.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^113qkNpd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

A descriptive analysis of patient demographics, risk factors, and CT scan data was conducted and reported as mean ± SD or n (%) when indicated. In order to normalize growth measurements within each patient, total growth per year was defined as the sum of all growth measurements over the total time followed (calculated in days, divided by 365). The first-year growth rate was defined as the sum of all growth measurements within the first 390 days over the sum of all time measurements within the first 390 days, divided by 365. Normalized for a year period appropriately, it should be noted that 390 days was used to capture a greater number of patients' first-year CT aneurysm size measurements.

A Kaplan-Meier curve documented the time from initial MTAA diagnosis to the time of any adverse composite event, plotted for all patients, as well as for patient risk sub-groups. Univariate screening was performed to identify risk factors associated with time to the adverse composite endpoint using Kaplan-Meier (for categorical predictors) or Cox regression (for continuous predictors). Interactions between patient characteristics and aneurysm-related risk variables were also tested. Two methods were used to identify a categorical cut-off value for an index size measurement that might indicate a higher "at-risk" patient sub-population. First, a visual inspection of the frequency distribution of initial index size was used to identify any natural cut-point appearing in the data. Then, a negative likelihood ratio (NLR) analysis was used to validate this cut-point.

### Early thoracic aorta enlargement in asymptomatic individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease: Determinant factors and clinical implication [^112xfn3j]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We analyzed, in above-average risk asymptomatic individuals, the factors determining early thoracic aorta enlargement.

- **Methods**: Ascending aortic diameter (AAD) was measured with noncontrast multidetector computed tomography in 345 participants (mean age 56 years; 78% men) without cardiovascular disease. We analyzed the associations of AAD with risk factors and Framingham risk score (FRS); multidetector computed tomography-assessed coronary artery calcium (CAC); and ultrasound interrogation of plaque presence at five sites (right and left carotid arteries, right and left femoral arteries, and abdominal aorta), with the number of diseased sites being counted from 0 to 5.

- **Results**: AAD was positively associated with age (P < 0.001), male sex (P < 0.01), body surface area (BSA; P < 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in individuals without antihypertensive medication (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Additionally, AAD was positively associated with the CAC score after adjusting for age, sex, and BSA (P < 0.001) or for FRS and BSA (P < 0.001). AAD was higher in the presence of three, four, or five diseased sites with plaque compared to zero, one, or two sites after adjusting for age, sex, and BSA (P < 0.05) or for FRS and BSA (P < 0.001). When participants were divided into subsets by AAD tertiles and number of sites with plaque, FRS and CAC scores were greatest in individuals with AAD in the top tertile and 3–5 sites with plaque, and lowest in those with AAD in the bottom tertile and 0–2 sites with plaque (P < 0.001).

### Risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm after ectatic aorta detection from initial screening [^115FVKkA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The study addressed a gap in the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surveillance guidelines, which currently lack follow-up recommendations for an initial abdominal aortic diameter of less than 3.0 cm. There have been reports of patients experiencing late AAA formation and ruptures following initial ultrasound screenings with aortic diameters between 2.5 to 2.9 cm (ectatic aorta). This research aimed to determine the prevalence of ectatic aortas, the development of AAAs, the risk of ruptures, and the risk factor profile in patients identified with ectatic aortas during AAA screening.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients screened for AAA from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, within a regional healthcare system. The screening focused on men aged 65 to 75 years who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. An ectatic aorta was defined as having a maximum aortic diameter between 2.5 and 2.9 cm, while an AAA was characterized by a diameter of 3 cm or greater. Patients with detected ectatic aortas who underwent follow-up imaging with a minimum of one year were analyzed for clinical and cardiovascular risk factors. Data collection continued through December 3, 2018. Logistic regression analyses of statistically significant variables from univariate and χ² analyses identified risks associated with AAA development from an initially diagnosed ectatic aorta. A Cox proportional hazard model assessed survival data, with a P value of less than .05 being statistically significant.

### Predictive imaging for thoracic aortic dissection and rupture: moving beyond diameters [^117TGVnq]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Best practice — aortic diameters**: The aorta is the largest artery in the body and runs from the aortic valve until the abdominal bifurcation. From proximal to distal, it consists of the aortic root, ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta (Fig. 1). Cross-sectional diameters are influenced by gender, patient habitus, and hypertension, and increase in an indolent manner by approximately 0.1 mm/year. Reference values for the different anatomic segments have been established by multiple imaging modalities, including echocardiography, CT, and MRI. Imaging guidelines provide specific measurement recommendations for each of these techniques and emphasize that there exists no standardized method across modalities. Therefore, diameters can vary slightly depending on trigger time (end-systolic vs. end-diastolic) and edge selection (leading edge-to-leading edge vs. inner edge-inner edge vs. outer edge-outer edge).

In general, it is stressed that measurements should be performed perpendicular to the aortic centerline (i.e. on double oblique images), and that measurement location and methodology should be specified in order to provide for accurate follow-up in individuals with an indication for repetitive imaging.

### Ascending aortic length and its association with type A aortic dissection [^116Vu1u9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of ascending aortic length and diameter in type A aortic dissection.

- **Methods and results**: Computed tomography scans from patients with acute type A dissections (n = 51), patients with proximal thoracic aortic aneurysms (n = 121), and controls with normal aortas (n = 200) were analyzed from the aortic annulus to the innominate artery using multiplanar reconstruction. In the control group, ascending aortic length correlated with diameter (r² = 0.35, P < 0.001), age (r² = 0.17, P < 0.001), and sex (P < 0.001). As a result of immediate changes in aortic morphology at the time of acute dissection, predissection lengths and diameters were estimated based on models from published literature. Ascending aortic length was longer in patients immediately following acute dissection (median, 109.7 mm; interquartile range [IQR], 101.0–115.1 mm), patients in the estimated predissection group (median, 104.2 mm; IQR, 96.0–109.3 mm), and patients in the aneurysm group (median, 107.0 mm; IQR, 99.6–118.7 mm) in comparison to controls (median, 83.2 mm; IQR, 74.5–90.7 mm) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The diameter of the ascending aorta was largest in the aneurysm group (median, 52.0 mm; IQR, 45.9–58.0 mm), followed by the dissection group (median, 50.3 mm; IQR, 46.6–57.5 mm), and not significantly different between controls and the estimated predissection group (median, 33.4 mm [IQR, 30.7–36.7 mm] versus 35.2 mm [IQR, 32.6–40.3 mm], P = 0.09). After adjustment for diameter, age, and sex, the estimated predissection aortic lengths were 16 mm longer than.

### Predictive imaging for thoracic aortic dissection and rupture: moving beyond diameters [^1162QeVB]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is defined as a localized arterial dilatation of ≥ 2 standard deviations (SDs) above the expected vessel diameter. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms differ partially for aneurysms at various locations along the aorta. Whereas thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) results from excessive degeneration of the medial layer of the vessel wall (also known as cystic medial necrosis), the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is mainly associated with atherosclerosis. However, the net result — extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall with loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and elastin content — is similar for all aneurysms.

Progressive aortic dilatation is a well-acknowledged risk factor for the occurrence of both acute dissection and rupture. While these natural complications are rare in ascending aortic aneurysms of moderate size (yearly rupture or dissection risk of 0.08%, 0.22%, and 0.58% at diameters of 45, 50, and 55 mm, respectively), a sharp step-up in their occurrence — to 6.9% yearly — is observed when the diameter exceeds 60 mm. In descending thoracic aneurysms, a similar "hinge point" is identified at 70 mm. To avoid aneurysm expansion beyond these critical points, the general consensus is to refer patients for pre-emptive surgery at 55 mm (ascending aorta) or 55 to 60 mm (descending thoracic aorta), depending on eligibility for an endovascular approach. More frequent surveillance imaging and lower surgical cut-offs apply to patients with connective tissue diseases.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^114x6MGu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection indicate that the guideline criterion of 5.5 cm for ascending aortic intervention misses many dissections occurring at smaller dimensions. Furthermore, studies of natural behavior have generally treated the aortic root and the ascending aorta as one unit despite embryological, anatomical, and functional differences. This study aims to disentangle the natural histories of the aforementioned aortic segments, allowing natural behavior to define specific intervention criteria for root and ascending segments of the aorta.

- **Methods and results**: Diameters of the aortic root and mid-ascending segment were measured separately. Long-term complications (dissection, rupture, and death) were analyzed retrospectively for 1162 patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Cox regression analysis suggested that aortic root dilatation (P = 0.017) is more significant in predicting adverse events than mid-ascending aortic dilatation (P = 0.087). Short stature posed as a serious risk factor. The dedicated risk curves for the aortic root and the mid-ascending aorta revealed hinge points at 5.0 and 5.25 cm, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The natural histories of the aortic root and mid-ascending aorta are uniquely different. Dilation of the aortic root imparts a significantly higher risk of adverse events. A diameter shift for intervention to 5.0 cm for the aortic root and to 5.25 cm for the mid-ascending aorta should be considered at expert centers.

### Agreement of proximal thoracic aorta size by two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography and magnetic resonance angiography [^116EuxU9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There is currently a lack of uniformity in methods of aortic diameter measurements across different imaging modalities. In this study, we sought to evaluate the accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in comparison with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the measurement of proximal thoracic aorta diameters. This is a retrospective analysis of 121 adult patients at our institution who had TTE and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated MRA performed within 90 days of each other between 2013 and 2020.

Measurements were made at the level of sinuses of Valsalva (SoV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AA) using leading edge-to-leading edge (LE) convention for TTE and inner-edge-to-inner-edge (IE) convention for MRA. Agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman methods. Intra- and interobserver variability were assessed by intraclass correlation. The average age of patients in the cohort was 62 years, and 69% of patients were male. The prevalence of hypertension, obstructive coronary artery disease, and diabetes was 66%, 20%, and 11%, respectively.

The mean aortic diameter by TTE was SoV 3.8 ± 0.5 cm, STJ 3.5 ± 0.4 cm, and AA 4.1 ± 0.6 cm. The TTE-derived measurements were larger than the MRA ones by 0.2 ± 2 mm, 0.8 ± 2 mm, and 0.4 ± 3 mm at the level of SoV, STJ, and AA, respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the aorta measurements by TTE compared with MRA when stratified by gender.

In conclusion, transthoracic echocardiogram-derived proximal aorta measurements are comparable to MRA measurements.

### Aortopathies: Etiologies, genetics, differential diagnosis, prognosis and management [^115ZBuYm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aortic root and ascending aortic dilatation are indicators associated with the risk of aortic dissection, which varies according to underlying etiologic associations, indexed aortic root size, and rate of progression. Typical aortic involvement is most commonly seen in syndromic cases, for which there is increasing evidence that aortic aneurysm represents a spectrum of familial inheritance associated with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression. Aortic root and ascending aortic dimensions should be measured routinely with echocardiography. Pharmacologic therapy may reduce the rate of progression. Timing of surgical intervention is guided by indexed aortic size and the rate of change of aortic root and ascending aorta dimensions. Lifelong surveillance is recommended.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^116gpirY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study on patients with CTA imaging of the thorax, obtained between January 2006 and April 2023. This retrospective analysis was performed as part of an Institutional Review Board–approved study (HUM00133798), and informed consent has been waived. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Patients were identified using an electronic medical record search tool.

We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with a medical record diagnosis and imaging confirmation of ascending aortic dilation or aneurysm, defined as a maximal ascending aortic diameter of ≥ 40 mm or an aortic size index of ≥ 2.1 cm/m² body surface area to ensure the capture of patients with smaller body size and aortic dilation. Patients were also only included if they had the availability of ≥ 2 ECG-gated CTAs before an endpoint (i.e. ascending aorta repair, TAAD, or death) and a minimum imaging interval of ≥ 2 years to allow for the detection of slow growth.

Exclusion criteria were as follows:

- **Known HTAD (syndromic or nonsyndromic with identified pathogenic mutation)**: thick CT slices (> 2 mm).
- **Significant motion artifact in the ascending aorta**: preventing clear delineation of the aortic wall.
- **Insufficient aortic luminal enhancement**: (< 200 Hounsfield units).
- **Known infectious or inflammatory conditions of the thoracic aorta**: (e.g. aortitis).
- **Prior surgical intervention on the thoracic aorta**: (open or endovascular).

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^113zJnoS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Aortic dissection is a devastating disease that threatens life without premonitory signs. The surgical guidelines of the American Heart Association, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, and European Society of Cardiology recommend preemptive repair of ascending aorta aneurysms at a diameter of 5.5 cm and 5.0 cm for patients with connective tissue aortopathies, whose malevolent behavior dictates a more aggressive approach and earlier intervention. The cutoff value of 5.5 cm corresponds to a steep rise in the respective risk curve. The threshold for intervention for patients with a bicuspid aortic valve has varied over the years, with the most recent dedicated bicuspid valve guidelines (American Heart Association, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery) returning to 5.5 cm. Beyond intervention criterion values, the major adverse aortic events (MAAEs), defined as dissection, rupture, and death, pose a considerable threat to patients, exceeding operative risk at experienced centers.

Despite improved access to healthcare services, increased awareness of clinicians, implemented screening policies, and improved surgical outcomes, the prevalence of thoracic aortic disease has been reported to be on the increase. The study by Evangelista et al. from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection demonstrated that 60% of acutely dissected ascending aortas present with a diameter < 5.5 cm and 40% < 5.0 cm. Our recent study showed that population dynamics at least partially explain this observation.

### Imaging of the aortic root on high-pitch non-gated and ECG-gated CT: Awareness is the key [^111hFDHT]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

An aortic aneurysm is defined as an abnormal permanent dilatation of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times its expected normal diameter. Among all thoracic aortic aneurysms, 60% include the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both. True aneurysms involve all the layers of the vessel wall, while a false aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm represents a disruption of the layers of the aorta wall, with the extravasated blood being contained by surrounding tissues forming a pseudo-capsule.

Based on the normal variation in the size of the proximal aorta, as described in the "Aortic anatomy — aortic root and ascending aorta" section, the American College of Radiology (ACR) white paper on the management of incidentals on thoracic CT suggests a size of 5 cm as the cutoff for a proximal aortic aneurysm. When using such an approach of a cutoff number, it should be kept in mind that aortic diameter is influenced by factors such as sex, age, patient size, and the segment of the aorta. If the maximum aortic diameter is between the upper limits of normal (SOV, STJ: 4 cm, 3.6 cm for males and 3.6, 3.2 cm for females) and does not meet the criteria for an aneurysm, the abnormal segment should be reported as dilated.

For increased accuracy, the maximum aortic diameter can be indexed to body surface area. For the proximal aorta, a value of 2.1 cm/m² as an upper limit of normal and a value of 2.75 cm/m² as a cutoff for aneurysm have been described to have a specificity of over 95%. The presence of connective tissue disease can be an important determinant in the diagnosis and management of an aortic aneurysm.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, particularly concerning patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the ESVS 2017 guidelines recommend considering surgery for patients with a genetic syndrome and an enlarged aortic diameter of less than 50 mm. Surgery should be considered:

- **According to body surface area**: In patients of small stature.
- **For rapid progression or aggressive diseases**.
- **With a family history**: In cases with a family history of dissection.

### A prospective study of growth and rupture risk of small-to-moderate size ascending aortic aneurysms [^116jwxmu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The natural history of small-to-moderate size ascending aortic aneurysms is poorly understood. To follow these patients better, we have developed a method to objectively and reproducibly measure ascending aortic volume based on gated contrast computed tomography scans.

- **Methods**: From 2009 to 2011, 507 patients were referred for management of ascending aortic aneurysms. A total of 232 patients (46%) with small-to-moderate size aneurysms, who did not have compelling indications for an operation, had measurement(s) of ascending aortic and total aortic volume. Of these, 166 patients had more than one scan, allowing measurement of growth. Additionally, 66 patients admitted to the emergency department without ascending aortic pathology served as a reference group.

- **Results**: None of the patients experienced rupture, dissection, or death; however, 3 patients ultimately underwent operation. Ascending aortic volume and volume/total aortic volume differed significantly between the surveillance and reference groups: 132.8 ± 39.4 mL versus 78.0 ± 24.5 mL, and 38.3% ± 7.4% versus 29.1% ± 3.9%, respectively (both P < .001). Diameters at the sinotubular junction and mid-ascending aortic were 4.1 ± 0.6 cm and 4.4 ± 0.6 cm, respectively, for the surveillance group, compared to 3.0 ± 0.4 cm and 3.2 ± 0.4 cm, respectively, for controls. The increase in ascending aortic volume was 0.95 ± 4.5 mL/year and 0.73% ± 3.7%/year (P = 0.007 and .012, respectively). Analysis of risk factors for ascending aortic growth revealed only the use of antithrombotic medication as possibly significant.

- **Conclusions**: Computed tomography volume measurements provide valuable insights into the natural history and management of small-to-moderate size ascending aortic aneurysms.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^111NMGom]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

When growth rate is stratified by categorical clinical characteristics, the only variable that demonstrated a higher growth rate was a history of type 2 diabetes (0.27 mm/year [IQR, 0.19–0.45 mm/year] versus 0.20 mm/year [IQR, 0.12–0.33 mm/year]; P = 0.026). For all other clinical variables, no significant difference between groups was observed, including for men versus women (P = 0.442) or for patients with tricuspid versus BAV (P = 0.172). However, a larger baseline maximal aortic diameter was observed in patients with BAV compared with tricuspid aortic valve (47.4 ± 3.2 mm versus 45.9 ± 3.7 mm; P = 0.005) as well as those with moderate/severe aortic insufficiency (48.7 ± 3.6 mm versus 45.9 ± 3.5 mm; P < 0.0001). The diameter of the aortic sinuses was also significantly larger among patients with significant aortic insufficiency (45.3 ± 5.5 mm versus 41.7 ± 4.7 mm; P < 0.0001). Men demonstrated minimally larger baseline maximal ascending aorta diameters compared with women (46.8 ± 3.6 mm versus 45.4 ± 3.5 mm; P = 0.003). Conversely, when aortic size indexes were used in place of diameter, women showed significantly greater ASI, AHI, and ascending aortic length values compared to men.

Among the 41 patients with fast or rapid growth (≥ 0.5 mm/year), there was no evidence of aortitis at any time by clinical history, laboratory, or surgical pathology results. Eight patients had abnormal CRP (C-reactive protein) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation.

### Predictive imaging for thoracic aortic dissection and rupture: Moving beyond diameters [^117DbyBB]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Excessive aortic dilatation (diameter ≥ 5.5 cm) poses a significant risk for the occurrence of acute aortic events, and patients with aneurysms beyond this size should be referred for prophylactic surgical intervention. However, the majority of acute aortic events occur in aortas with diameters below surgical thresholds; therefore, these patients would not have qualified for preventative surgery even when screened appropriately prior to event onset. Several modern imaging techniques, such as hybrid PET-CT and 4D flow MRI, have shown promise in detecting vessel wall instability at an early stage. Studies aiming to demonstrate a causal link with the occurrence of acute aortic syndromes are currently ongoing and could lead to the integration of these techniques into clinical practice guidelines.

### Development and validation of a predictive model to identify patients with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm [^115zLAd1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The definition of ATAA was the outcome of interest and was defined as an ascending thoracic aorta with a diameter ≥ 4.0 cm. This measurement was taken using the double oblique technique, where the plane perpendicular to the long-axis of the aorta is defined in three-dimensional space. The cross-sectional aorta was measured via the average of outer-to-outer wall diameters measured 60° apart from each other. The threshold of 4.0 cm was chosen to increase the sensitivity of detecting an enlarged aorta in a screening context, acknowledging that studies have defined aneurysm variably. The largest portion of the aorta between the sinotubular junction and the proximal take-off of the innominate artery was measured.

We did not index the aortic diameter by body size because guideline recommendations for surgical intervention are based on diameter without indexing. Since the scans included both cardiac-gated and nongated scans, we only considered aneurysms occurring in the ascending aorta, as the aortic root measurement is susceptible to motion artifacts along the cardiac cycle. Measurements were performed using Visage imaging software (Visage Imaging, Richmond, Australia) by an author (S.Y.) trained by a senior member of the radiology faculty specializing in cardiac and thoracic imaging. This investigator's measurements were compared with those of the radiologist's measurement of the aneurysm, yielding a 0.3-mm mean difference.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113synBD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the guideline-recommended practice of maximal diameter-driven prophylactic surgical repair, studies have shown that over 80% of thoracic aortic aneurysm dissection (TAAD) occurs below surgical diameter thresholds and is therefore not preventable by these approaches. Attempts have been made to improve diameter-based risk estimates by adjusting for patient height or body surface area. However, a recently published study of over 6,000 patients with sporadic ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA) did not find improved risk discrimination using such adjusted size metrics. The study did find that the occurrence of aTAA growth during surveillance increased the risk of TAAD by a factor of 2 to 3, supporting guidelines recommending prophylactic repair in the presence of rapid growth (≥ 3 mm/year in two consecutive years or ≥ 5 mm in any year) regardless of aneurysm size.

Given that methods for risk stratification in aTAA rely on both aneurysm diameter and growth rate, a clear understanding of the relationship between these metrics is important for more clearly depicting disease severity and determining optimal imaging surveillance. Growth of aTAA has commonly been reported to increase with diameter. This association has been widely justified by the law of Laplace (wall tension is proportional to vessel diameter, assuming negligible change in wall thickness) and referenced in the recent 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease. However, this approach does not take into consideration the aortic wall's ability to remodel over time through well-developed mechanisms.

Regarding surgical interventions for thoracic aortic aneurysm, especially with respect to aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysm repair, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend considering surgery by experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team for asymptomatic patients. This recommendation applies to patients with aneurysms of the aortic root or ascending aorta who have either an aortic size index of ≥ 3.08 cm/m² or an aortic height index of ≥ 3.21 cm/m.
