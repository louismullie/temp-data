## Question

Which is better for Huntington's Chorea: allogeneic or autologous transplant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which is better for Huntington's chorea: allogeneic or autologous transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and define what "allogeneic" and "autologous" mean in neural cell therapy for Huntington's disease. Then, I should review the human evidence for fetal striatal allografts. Next, I will examine the status and barriers for autologous iPSC-derived grafts. After that, I need to compare efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, feasibility, and ethics across the two strategies. Finally, I will synthesize expert consensus and formulate a practical recommendation grounded in current data and clinical realities [^1171s33r].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology because I need to ensure we are not conflating hematopoietic transplantation with neural grafting in the brain. In Huntington's disease, "allogeneic" typically refers to donor-derived neural tissue grafts, historically fetal striatal tissue implanted into the patient's striatum, whereas "autologous" refers to patient-derived cells, most prominently induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated toward medium spiny neuron lineage for replacement or trophic support. The therapeutic aim is striatal neuronal replacement and circuit repair, which is biologically distinct from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation paradigms, so I should keep the discussion focused on neural graft data and translational frameworks specific to HD [^1171s33r].

> Next, I should review the human evidence for allogeneic fetal tissue transplantation. Early open-label series reported feasibility and hints of benefit, including increased striatal metabolism on FDG-PET in some recipients and small motor score improvements at 12 months in post hoc analyses, although results were inconsistent and often not sustained. For example, early cohorts showed increased striatal metabolic activity in three of five patients and reduction of striatal-cortical hypometabolism in responders, but others progressed despite grafting, and clinical trajectories varied substantially across individuals. Surgical complications occurred, including subdural hemorrhages in several patients in one series, emphasizing nontrivial procedural risk [^115UpbFV] [^116NjZG5] [^111Vvt7r].

> Wait, let me verify the randomized data because open-label signals can be misleading. The MIG-HD randomized phase II trial with delayed-start design did not demonstrate a significant difference in UHDRS total motor score at 20 months between early transplant and control groups, and the post-transplant rate of decline was similar to the pre-transplant slope, arguing against disease modification over that interval. There were 27 severe adverse events among randomized patients, 10 related to the surgical procedure, although iterative procedural improvements reduced surgical event frequency during the trial. Importantly, postmortem and immunologic data in the broader literature document alloimmunization and inflammatory responses around grafts, with graft survival appearing good at approximately 18 months but markedly attenuated by a decade in some cohorts, raising concern about long-term durability without ongoing immunomodulation [^113wTc54] [^111XzygP] [^1167VeHk].

> I need to check how immunosuppression is handled because this is central to allogeneic strategies. Most neural transplant protocols have used oral immunosuppression for roughly 6 to 12 months during the period of blood-brain barrier disruption, but postmortem data show evidence both of long-term graft survival after immunotherapy withdrawal and of alloimmune rejection in other cases, suggesting that regimen intensity and duration may need individualization. Hold on, I should verify the current strategic stance: despite risks, expert translational reviews propose that chronic immunosuppression remains the most reliable option at present to protect allogeneic hPSC-derived neural grafts from rejection in clinical development, pending definitive solutions such as hypoimmunogenic engineering or MHC matching, which themselves pose regulatory and safety challenges [^111XzygP] [^111G4hWo] [^11138rKY].

> Now, I will examine autologous iPSC-derived transplantation. Conceptually, autologous grafts might avoid alloimmune rejection and obviate maintenance immunosuppression, which at first glance seems decisively favorable. But wait, let me verify the immunology. Recent reports indicate that iPSC derivatives can be immunogenic even in syngeneic or autologous settings due to aberrant antigen expression, so immunogenicity is reduced but not eliminated by autologous sourcing. Moreover, for Huntington's disease specifically, there are no completed human trials of autologous striatal neuron transplantation; major hurdles include GMP-grade individualized manufacturing, cost and scalability constraints, ensuring authentic medium spiny neuron identity and maturation, safe integration without tumorigenicity or overgrowth, and reliable stereotactic delivery at human scale. In short, autologous HD neural transplantation remains preclinical and not clinically feasible at this time [^11138rKY] [^1171s33r] [^111qs7jH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before comparing the domains systematically. On the evidence base, allogeneic fetal tissue transplantation has multiple human series and at least one randomized phase II trial, whereas autologous iPSC transplantation in HD lacks human efficacy or safety data. Regarding efficacy, allogeneic grafts show at most modest and often transient clinical and metabolic signals without proven disease modification in controlled analysis, while autologous approaches remain theoretical. For safety, allogeneic strategies carry known surgical risks and immune risks managed variably by immunosuppression; autologous products face unknown human safety, including tumor risk and ectopic integration. Immunogenicity is higher with allogeneic grafts and persistent even in some autologous iPSC derivatives. Feasibility and ethics currently favor the practicality of allogeneic protocols within trials despite fetal tissue sourcing constraints, whereas patient-specific autologous manufacture is presently impractical at scale. Let me double-check that this synthesis aligns with consensus reviews emphasizing these translational tradeoffs and current limitations [^113wTc54] [^1167VeHk] [^11138rKY] [^1171s33r].

> I should confirm the direction of expert consensus. Authoritative translational frameworks conclude that fetal allografts have demonstrated feasibility and acceptable short-term safety, but clinical benefits, if present, have been small and not durable, with long-term graft degeneration a concern. Simultaneously, autologous iPSC strategies are considered theoretically ideal yet currently unrealistic due to immunogenicity concerns, manufacturing complexity, and cost, leading groups to prioritize strategies like improving allogeneic graft immunoprotection and building standardized development pathways under international consortia to de-risk first-in-human studies. Let me reconsider the immunology point one more time: given the lack of a definitive solution to allogeneic responses in neural grafts, chronic immunosuppression remains the pragmatic protective strategy in the near term during clinical translation, despite its attendant risks [^1167VeHk] [^11138rKY] [^112tz7LD] [^111G4hWo].

> But wait, what if I overinterpreted the early open-label improvements as clinically meaningful change? I should verify against the randomized data again. The MIG-HD trial did not meet its primary motor endpoint and showed no change in the slope of decline post-transplant compared with pre-transplant, which tempers enthusiasm for disease-modifying benefit at this stage. Conversely, my initial assumption that autologous grafts would negate all immunologic risk needs correction; even autologous iPSC derivatives can be immunogenic, so the benefit is less absolute than it first appears. These self-checks reinforce that neither modality has proven durable clinical efficacy in HD to date, and that the most prudent path forward remains controlled trials with rigorous outcome measures and immunologic planning [^113wTc54] [^11138rKY].

> Bringing this together into a practical recommendation, I need to ensure the guidance reflects current evidence and clinical realities. Neither allogeneic nor autologous neural transplantation can be considered standard of care for Huntington's chorea at present. Allogeneic fetal tissue transplantation is the only approach with human data and can be performed within research settings with acceptable short-term safety, but benefits are modest and transient at best, with immunologic and surgical risks requiring careful management. Autologous iPSC-based transplantation remains preclinical and is not presently a clinical option. Thus, outside of a clinical trial, management should prioritize approved symptomatic therapies and supportive care, while enrollment in rigorously designed studies may be considered at experienced centers as the field advances toward renewable, well-characterized donor sources and optimized delivery and immunomodulation strategies [^113wTc54] [^112UcHam] [^1171s33r].

---

Neither allogeneic nor autologous transplantation is currently superior or recommended [^113wTc54] for Huntington's disease as both remain **experimental with limited and inconsistent clinical benefit** [^111Ki7G7] [^1171s33r]. Allogeneic fetal striatal grafts show variable survival and modest, transient effects [^1112mfM6] [^115UpbFV] and carry significant risks, including immune rejection [^111XzygP] and graft degeneration [^1167VeHk] [^113wTc54]. Autologous iPSC-derived approaches are theoretically less immunogenic [^111G4hWo] but are not yet clinically available and face major technical and cost barriers [^11138rKY]. No transplantation approach is **standard care**; patients should enroll in trials [^112tz7LD], and progress depends on improved graft survival, integration, and immune control [^11138rKY] [^113wTc54].

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

### Allogeneic transplantation

- **Clinical trials and studies**: Allogeneic fetal striatal grafts have been tested in small open-label studies [^115UpbFV] [^116NjZG5] and a phase II trial [^113wTc54], showing variable graft survival and modest, transient clinical effects [^1112mfM6].

- **Phase II trial results**: The MIG-HD trial [^113wTc54] found no significant motor benefit at 20 months, with similar pre- and post-transplant decline rates; severe adverse events, including immune responses, were common [^111XzygP].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Grafts can survive years [^111Ki7G7] but often degenerate over time [^1167VeHk], limiting durable benefit [^115zxZph].

---

### Autologous transplantation

Current status: Autologous iPSC-derived neural grafts remain **preclinical**; no human efficacy data exist [^11138rKY]. Theoretical advantages include lower immunogenicity and avoidance of chronic immunosuppression [^111G4hWo], but **clinical feasibility remains unproven** [^11138rKY].

---

## Risks and complications

### Allogeneic transplantation

- **Immune rejection**: Significant risk of rejection [^1167VeHk] and alloimmunization, requiring immunosuppression with infection and malignancy risks [^113wTc54] [^111XzygP].

- **Graft degeneration**: Grafts often degenerate over time [^111Ki7G7], limiting long-term benefit [^1167VeHk].

- **Surgical risks**: Subdural hemorrhage and other procedural complications have occurred [^111Vvt7r] [^113wTc54].

---

### Autologous transplantation

- **Technical challenges**: Generating patient-specific iPSCs is complex, costly, and time-consuming [^11138rKY] [^113UQeXb].

- **Potential immunogenicity**: iPSC derivatives can be immunogenic even in autologous settings [^11138rKY] [^111G4hWo].

- **Tumorigenesis risk**: Pluripotent-derived grafts carry theoretical tumor risks, requiring rigorous control [^112nHeeL].

---

## Graft survival and integration

Allogeneic grafts show **variable survival and integration** [^113wTc54], with immune rejection and degeneration limiting durability [^1167VeHk] [^115zxZph]. Autologous grafts are expected to have **better survival and integration** due to lower immunogenicity [^111G4hWo], though clinical validation is lacking [^11138rKY].

---

## Ethical and practical considerations

Allogeneic transplantation raises ethical issues, including **fetal tissue use** [^1171s33r], immune rejection, and risks from immunosuppression [^113wTc54], whereas autologous transplantation poses fewer ethical concerns but faces major practical barriers, such as **cost, time, and technical complexity** [^11138rKY] [^113UQeXb].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

No current recommendations endorse allogeneic or autologous transplantation for HD; both remain **experimental** [^113wTc54]. Expert consensus emphasizes **rigorous trials**, improved graft survival and integration, and immune-response management [^113wTc54] [^11138rKY] [^112tz7LD].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

Allogeneic transplantation research focuses on **reducing immunogenicity** [^111G4hWo], improving graft survival, and optimizing delivery [^113wTc54] [^111qs7jH], while autologous transplantation efforts aim to overcome **technical and cost barriers** [^113UQeXb] and validate safety and efficacy in humans [^11138rKY].

---

Allogeneic transplantation has **limited, inconsistent benefit with significant immune risks** [^1167VeHk], whereas autologous approaches are **not yet clinically available** [^11138rKY]. No transplantation strategy is **standard care**; patients should participate in trials [^113wTc54], and progress depends on better graft survival, integration, and immune control [^112tz7LD] [^11138rKY].

### Outcome of cell suspension allografts in a patient with Huntington's disease [^111Ki7G7]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that presents with a combination of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric problems, which progress over a 20-year period to death. It is currently incurable, and although many therapies have been the subject of clinical trials, none have been shown to alter the natural history of this condition. More than 20 years ago, work commenced on a novel strategy that involved allografting fetal tissue into the striatum of patients with mid-stage disease to attempt to repair the damaged circuitry, as had been shown preclinically using excitotoxic lesions of the rat and monkey striatum.

At the time of writing, seven small open-label studies of neural transplants have been conducted worldwide assessing the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of this procedure in patients with HD. This approach has yielded mixed results, including postmortem analysis of transplanted patients. Here, we present long-term histological data on one of the five patients treated with a fetal striatal cell suspension allograft as part of the UK study.

Alternative or complementary approaches have been tested in the preclinical setup to improve graft survival. Autologous cell therapy products derived from host hiPSCs would theoretically be ideal from an immunological standpoint. Recent reports, however, suggest that mouse and human iPSC derivatives can be immunogenic in syngeneic or autologous recipients and in an autologous humanized mouse model, respectively. In addition, the high cost of GMP-grade production of patient-specific hiPSCs renders therapeutic autologous hPSC-grafts unrealistic at this time. Other strategies have been described and partially tested to reduce or suppress human allogeneic immune responses against hPSC-derived cell therapy products. For example, encapsulation techniques that are being tested on diabetic patients (NCT03163511) can isolate implanted cells from the host but also preclude all cellular (including synaptic) interactions with it. Matching donor and host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) could be a way to avoid the immune system. Access to MHC-matched donor lines can be ensured either via selection in the general population of HLA homozygous human induced PSC (iPSC) (e.g. A, B, DR triple homozygous) established by a global iPSC haplobank.

### Neuronal degeneration in striatal transplants and Huntington's disease: potential mechanisms and clinical implications [^1167VeHk]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Cell therapy offers the possibility of replacing degenerated neurons, thereby improving the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease. However, the clinical benefits in patients with Huntington's disease, if any, have been transient and modest. Grafts survived well at 18 months in one patient with Huntington's disease, but graft survival was markedly attenuated by 10 years in three other patients from this transplantation cohort. It is critical to delineate the causes of graft degeneration if such therapies are to be utilized in patients with the goal of achieving meaningful clinical benefit. Similar challenges may also accrue to future stem cell therapies.

- **Potential causes of suboptimal long-term graft survival**: Here we discuss the potential causes of suboptimal long-term graft survival in patients with Huntington's disease, including allograft immunoreactivity, microglial responses targeted at grafted cells, and cell-to-cell neurotoxicity. We also discuss similar challenges and unique differences when comparing neuronal grafts in patients with Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.

### Human fetal cell therapy in Huntington's disease: A randomized, multicenter, phase II trial [^113wTc54]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease is a rare, severe, inherited neurodegenerative disease in which we assessed the safety and efficacy of grafting human fetal ganglionic eminence intrastriatally.

- **Methods**: Patients at the early stage of the disease were enrolled in the Multicentric Intracerebral Grafting in Huntington's Disease trial, a delayed-start phase II randomized study. After a run-in period of 12 months, patients were randomized at month 12 to either the treatment group (transplanted at month 13-month 14) or the control group and secondarily treated 20 months later (month 33-month 34). The primary outcome was total motor score compared between both groups 20 months post-randomization (month 32). Secondary outcomes included clinical, imaging, and electrophysiological findings, and a comparison of pregraft and postgraft total motor score slopes during the entire study period (month 0-month 52) regardless of the time of transplant.

- **Results**: Of 54 randomized patients, 45 were transplanted; 26 immediately (treatment) and 19 delayed (control). The mean total motor score at month 32 did not differ between groups (treated controls difference in means adjusted for month 12: +2.9 [95% confidence interval, -2.8 to 8.6]; P = 0.31). Its rate of decline after transplantation was similar to that before transplantation. A total of 27 severe adverse events were recorded in the randomized patients, 10 of which were related to the transplant procedure. Improvement of procedures during the trial significantly decreased the frequency of surgical events. We found anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody…

### Motor and cognitive improvements in patients with Huntington's disease after neural transplantation [^115UpbFV]. Lancet (2000). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease of genetic origin that mainly affects the striatum. It has severe motor and cognitive consequences, and up to now, no treatment is available. Motor and cognitive functions can be restored in experimental animal models by means of intrastriatal transplantation of fetal striatal neuroblasts. We explored whether grafts of human fetal striatal tissue could survive and have detectable effects in five patients with mild to moderate Huntington's disease.

- **Methods**: After 2 years of preoperative assessment, patients were grafted with human fetal neuroblasts into the right striatum. Then, following a year, the left striatum was grafted. Final results were assessed 1 year later on the basis of neurological, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and psychiatric tests. The results obtained were compared with those of a cohort of 22 untreated patients at similar stages of the disease, who were followed up in parallel. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with fluorine-18-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose were also done to assess metabolic activity.

- **Findings**: The final PET-scan assessment showed increased metabolic activity in various subnuclei of the striatum in three of five patients, contrasting with the progressive decline recorded in the two other patients in the series, as seen in patients with untreated Huntington's disease. Small areas of even higher metabolic activity, co-registering with spherical hyposignals on MRI, were also present in the same three patients, suggesting that grafts were functional.

### Opdualag [^113N9D1Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation**: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDUALAG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDUALAG for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDUALAG [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Europe 2014: More than 40 000 transplants annually [^115eQtZ3]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

A record number of 40,829 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) in 36,469 patients (15,765 allogeneic (43%), 20,704 autologous (57%)) were reported by 656 centers in 47 countries to the 2014 survey. Trends include continued growth in transplant activity, more prominently in Eastern European countries than in the West; a continued increase in the use of haploidentical family donors (by 25%) with slower growth for unrelated donor HSCT. The use of cord blood as a stem cell source has decreased again in 2014.

- **Main indications**: HSCT was indicated for leukemias (11,853; 33% with 96% allogeneic), lymphoid neoplasias (20,802; 57% with 11% allogeneic), solid tumors (1,458; 4% with 3% allogeneic), and non-malignant disorders (2,203; 6% with 88% allogeneic).

- **Changes in transplant activity**: There has been an increase in allogeneic HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1), myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), and aplastic anemia, alongside a decrease in use for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Additionally, there is more autologous HSCT for plasma cell disorders, particularly for amyloidosis.

Data on the numbers of teams performing alternative donor transplants, allogeneic after autologous HSCT, and autologous cord blood transplants are presented.

Achieving efficient clinical trials while conforming to regulatory standards

In rare diseases, implementing less stringent criteria, such as the use of one-sided testing or altering the type I error rate in outcome evaluation, may be worth considering. Consensus work involving the Huntington's disease community (including professionals and patients) and regulatory agencies is crucial to define acceptable levels of evidence that justify progression to definitive evaluation and to determine which objective endpoints can guide decision-making.

In small sample sizes, randomization may not always balance characteristics between treatment groups. Therefore, it is important to consider alternatives to the typical randomized parallel group design by exploring plausible trial designs. These alternatives can minimize total sample size requirements and reduce variability or heterogeneity. For example, using repeated measurement outcomes in within-patient designs or trials within cohorts can be considered. However, when considering historical control data or observational data from disease registries, it is essential to take methods to account for confounders into account.

Given the very early stage of development of these novel therapeutics in rare diseases like Huntington's, it may be beneficial to initially focus on single-arm early phase designs. The emphasis should be on graft survival and growth, along with the safety and acceptability of the intervention as a whole, before transitioning to larger-scale trials.

### Huntington's disease: Current and future therapeutic prospects [^112UcHam]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which therapies are woefully inadequate and do not prevent inevitable progression. Currently, approved therapies are primarily aimed at treating chorea but do not address the more clinically meaningful motor, behavioral, and cognitive features of the disease. However, there are a number of promising new therapies that are currently being studied in the laboratory and in the clinic. This article reviews the wide variety of therapies currently being tested, the advances in clinical trials and endpoints, and the many potentially relevant new targets.

Efficacy testing is an essential component of preclinical studies, but it is challenging to define the most relevant outcome criteria, given the lack of validated therapies that have moved from preclinical studies to disease modification in human patients. Typically, behavioural assays have been used to assess efficacy in Huntington's disease mouse models; however, we need to understand more about the relationship of any given assay or measurement to changes in human disease and the most relevant translational endpoints. Restoration of molecular and cellular phenotypes altered in Huntington's disease models and in human disease, including gene and protein expression, protein homeostasis, trophic factor activity, electrophysiology to reflect circuitry, and neuropathological improvement may be highly informative as potential endpoints and may be more readily standardized and related to human disease.

Developing a better understanding of how individual measures relate to human disease and suggesting core outcome sets may be useful. Rather than adopting a single primary outcome and specifying secondary outcomes, as is typical in human clinical trials, it could be argued that a diverse array of assays is needed, including those that test the proposed mechanism of action, in order to maximally inform clinical progression. Finally, there are a range of other technical considerations such as using immunosuppressive drugs for human xenografts versus using immunocompromised mice to alleviate rejection of a given cell product.

### One and a half million hematopoietic stem cell transplants: Continuous and differential improvement in worldwide access with the use of non-identical family donors [^112nKNZX]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation: The most frequent indication for autologous HCT in 2016 was LPD, accounting for 84.2% of all autologous HCT. The most frequent single indications were PCD and HD/NHL, with rates of 59.4% and 40.4%, respectively. HCT for solid tumors accounted for 6.4% of autologous HCT, while 1.9% were performed for leukemias, predominantly AML (74.8%) and ALL (18.4%).

Autoimmune diseases (AID) comprised 92.2% of autologous HCT indications in non-malignant diseases. The frequency of autologous HCT increased in almost all indications and regions, especially for LPD and non-malignant disorders. Decreases in autologous HCT were noted for leukemia (except SEAR/WPR) and for solid tumors in Europe. The highest increase in autologous HCT was observed in Latin America for non-malignant disorders.

Overall, the frequency of autologous HCT increased by 68.9%, predominantly in non-malignant disorders (258%), primarily AID (246.2%), PCD (122%), and lymphoma (46.7%). Decreased activity of autologous HCT was reported for all leukemias, with a reduction of 51.1%.

### Hematopoietic cell transplantation, version 2.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113mfRqA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) involves the infusion of hematopoietic progenitor cells into patients with hematologic disorders to re-establish normal hematopoietic and immune function. HCT is classified as autologous or allogeneic, based on the origin of hematopoietic cells. Autologous HCT uses the patient's own cells, while allogeneic HCT uses hematopoietic cells from a human leukocyte antigen-compatible donor. Allogeneic HCT is a potentially curative treatment option for patients with certain types of hematologic malignancies, and autologous HCT is primarily used to support patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy.

Advances in HCT methods and supportive care in recent decades have led to improved survival after HCT; however, disease relapse and posttransplant complications commonly occur in both autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients may also develop acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in immune-mediated cellular injury of several organs. The NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation focus on recommendations for pretransplant recipient evaluation and the management of GVHD in adult patients with malignant disease.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^111XzygP]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Management of the immunogenicity of the graft and the host's immune response to it is a major challenge. The relative immune privilege of the brain has led to many neural transplant studies taking an approach where immunosuppressant therapy is administered over the period during which the blood-brain barrier is disrupted (following brain penetration and delivery of cells) and then withdrawn. Arbitrarily, this has resulted in immunosuppressant administration being maintained for a period of 6–12 months, although in some studies none was given. There is post-mortem evidence that grafts survive many years after immunotherapy withdrawal, but there is also some evidence of allogeneic graft rejection due to alloimmunization to fetal donor antigens and some post-mortem evidence of increased inflammatory reaction around grafts, suggesting that careful consideration of the need for immune suppression and duration of treatment is necessary.

- **Strategies to address the challenge**: Tackling graft–host interactions is the only way to ensure the long-term survival of cell therapy grafts and thus ensure their long-term therapeutic activity. Oral immunosuppression of recipients is the standard option to manage graft immunogenicity, despite imposing increased risks of cancer, infections, and cardiovascular diseases when given long-term. Post-transplant immunosuppression regimes vary.

Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

In regard to therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, specifically with respect to stem cell transplantation, the ASTCT 2025 guidelines recommend not offering allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation to patients with CLL who have responsive disease after second-line therapy, regardless of whether the response followed a BCL-2 inhibitor or a covalent Bruton TKI.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^1171s33r]. Brain (2022). High credibility.

The underpinning concept of stem cell therapy is restorative. This restorative goal can be achieved through several approaches. For example, the implantation of cells can provide support for existing vulnerable host cells through mechanisms such as the controlled release of trophic molecules, or through implantation of cells designed to integrate and adopt the function of those lost to the disease process (the latter is referred to here as cell replacement therapy). These are potential non-mutually exclusive approaches.

Neurons degenerate throughout the brain in Huntington's disease, but the earliest and most severe loss occurs in the striatum, where medium spiny striatal neurons (MSNs), the most abundant neurons in the normal striatum, are most affected. Thus, one therapeutic aim is striatal neuronal replacement, with a particular emphasis on transplanting cells capable of differentiating into MSNs. Mature adult neurons will not survive transplantation, so it is necessary to transplant progenitors that can differentiate into MSNs.

Early studies focused on donor cells collected from the developing fetal striatum, where MSNs develop during normal development, and pilot studies in which such cells were transplanted into the striatum of individuals with Huntington's disease have demonstrated feasibility and proven overall safety. However, collecting high-quality fetal tissue and performing adequate quality control in the limited time window between collection and surgical delivery is difficult and limiting. This has stimulated research to derive striatal-like neurons from renewable sources.

### History of hematopoietic cell transplantation: Challenges and progress [^116GXeAF]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Over more than 60 years of research, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has evolved from an idea considered defunct in the 1960s to become a standard treatment for both malignant and non-malignant blood diseases that were previously fatal. By the time of writing, nearly 1.5 million hematopoietic cell transplants have been performed across over 1,500 transplantation centers globally. This review aims to highlight the substantial efforts made by numerous investigators worldwide to transition HCT from an experimental concept to a clinical reality, examine the ongoing challenges facing the field, and provide insights into future directions.

The field of allogeneic transplantation has made vast improvements since its inception in 1968. Improvements in supportive care have greatly enhanced survival. However, delayed immune reconstitution, graft versus host disease, and relapse of disease still pose significant obstacles. This article highlights novel strategies for using cellular therapy in conjunction with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) that potentially may lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients undergoing HCT in the future.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^112nHeeL]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

- **Designing clinical trials in practice**: Subject to appropriate regulatory approvals being in place, including those in relation to the product and the device, the first human studies will typically focus on safety before transitioning to exploratory therapeutic trials of relatively short duration in well-defined, relatively homogeneous patient populations. It is common in these situations to include surrogate end points and, where relevant, to consider single-arm designs in which all participants receive the experimental treatment, with the objective being to establish proof of principle that warrants further investigation in a later definitive trial. Traditional phase I dose escalation studies that measure maximum drug toxicity are likely to be difficult to apply to the evaluation of such targeted therapies, given that cell therapies are not reversible and possible adverse outcomes could include graft overgrowth or tumorigenesis, which could take months to become apparent. However, it will be important to establish the optimal dose, possibly through sequential cohort evaluations.

There are several constraints associated with undertaking novel experimental surgical interventions and cell therapies. The disease targeted for treatment and the route of administration are highly influential in determining the trial design of choice. The fact that cells are being delivered via a surgical approach into the brain places both ethical and practical constraints on the numbers that can or should be included in the first study. The relative rarity of Huntington's disease further impacts the design and implementation of such trials.

### Fetal neural grafts for Huntington's disease: a prospective view [^116gcKna]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Intrastriatal transplantation of striatal neuroblasts from human fetuses is a promising approach for the treatment of Huntington's disease, based on many experimental animal studies and, most recently, pilot clinical trials. Technically, several issues remain to be resolved, such as the precise site of dissection of the fetal tissue, the number and location of the fetal striatal implants, and the use of immunosuppressive therapy. These issues await larger-scale trials and purposely designed protocols.

Further clinical data must also be obtained, and preliminary promising results must be replicated in a patient group large enough to provide conclusive results. It is important to establish the following:

- **Clinical benefit provided**: The amount of clinical benefit provided to the patient by the grafted cells.
- **Duration of benefits**: The anticipated duration of clinical benefits.
- **Rate of decline**: The secondary rate of decline after the benefit of the graft has been overbalanced.

Evaluation of these parameters will require very long-term follow-up of the patients involved, over several years after grafting, before the technique can be proposed widely to patients.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^111qs7jH]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

- **Nature of the challenge**: The impermeable nature of the intact blood-brain barrier means that systemic cell delivery is not effective. While barrier breakdown in certain conditions affords the possibility of small molecule access, the inability to spatially constrict and deliver to distant impermeable areas means this strategy has limited applicability to cell therapy at the moment. In addition, the specific brain area in which cells are transplanted may play a crucial role in graft survival, integration, and functionality, as well as in the immune response generated upon transplantation.

The development of optimized devices has lagged behind that of cell therapies due to reasons of research funding and regulatory confines. Clinical trials frequently use in-house manufactured devices or the off-label use of commercial catheters designed for gene therapy delivery. Despite well-established principles of safe stereotactic neurosurgery for functional stimulation and ablation, efforts to simply scale up delivery devices from the rodent to the human brain have not met with unqualified success. The main issues include the need to deliver significantly greater numbers of cells over a larger brain volume using delivery devices that scale poorly.

Studies have shown significant issues with cell sedimentation within the delivery catheter, back reflux of the cell therapy product along the delivery needle tract leading to ectopic delivery, engraftment failure, and poor survival.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^115gS6XS]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

There are compelling reasons for considering regenerative medicine for the treatment of a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions, ranging from common heterogeneous conditions such as Parkinson's disease to many rarer conditions, including single-gene disorders like Huntington's disease. Together, these conditions represent a very large and growing disease burden, and the majority are currently largely untreatable. Furthermore, for many conditions, targeted pharmacological treatments remain a distant prospect as the detailed pathogenesis is not yet fully delineated, making a rational approach to therapy difficult or impossible. However, even where pathogenesis is obscure, a condition can still be amenable to cell therapy if the anatomy and distribution of neuronal or glial cell loss is characterized, particularly in conditions where major cell loss affects relatively focal areas and/or predominantly involves a specific neural cell type.

As we move towards clinical trials for neural transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases, it is essential that we incorporate and adapt understanding derived from preclinical studies. We must recognize the complex, wide-ranging, and multi-component challenges involved in evaluating delivery of substances and cells to the brain. We therefore propose the development of agreed-upon research frameworks that are sufficiently flexible to accommodate the multiple complexities inherent in the development and evaluation process, which will highlight future directions.

### Mesenchymal stromal cells as treatment or prophylaxis for acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with a haematological condition [^111G3iGw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) can develop acute or chronic forms of graft-versus-host disease (a/cGvHD), whereby immune cells of the donor attack host tissues. Steroids are the primary treatment, but patients with severe, refractory disease have limited options and a poor prognosis. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exhibit immunosuppressive properties and are being tested in clinical trials for their safety and efficacy in treating many immune-mediated disorders. GvHD is one of the first areas in which MSCs were clinically applied, and it is important that the accumulating evidence is systematically reviewed to assess whether their use is favored.

- **Objectives**: To determine the evidence for the safety and efficacy of MSCs for treating immune-mediated inflammation post-transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2018, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (from 1990), and ongoing trial databases up to 6 December 2018. No constraints were placed on language or publication status.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs of participants with a haematological condition who have undergone an HSCT as treatment for their condition and were randomised to MSCs (intervention arm) or no MSCs (comparator arm) to prevent or treat GvHD. We also included RCTs which compared different interventions.

### New perspectives in human stem cell therapeutic research [^113EWGCQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

There are some major changes happening in stem cell therapies that are setting a new paradigm for regenerative medicine. The opportunity to repair and regenerate tissues injured by disease and trauma is opening the way to new optimistic treatments that need to be carefully evaluated in early clinical trials. These developments build on the successes of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants that have more than 30 years of patient applications in blood diseases and cancer.

The bulk of applications of the new stem cell therapies follow the expected route of autologous transplants to avoid severe immune suppression that commonly applies to allogeneic cell transplantation. However, autologous therapies require several steps:

- **Stem cell recovery**: This involves the recovery of the patient's own hematopoietic, endothelial, or mesenchymal stem cells by bone marrow biopsy.
- **Mobilization of stem cell types**: This is done by administering recombinant growth factors.
- **Isolation of multipotent stem cells**: These stem cells are isolated from adipose tissue.

These stem cell recovery and isolation steps are essential to advancing therapeutic applications.

### Systematic reviews in hematopoietic cell transplantation and cellular therapy: Considerations and guidance from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research late effects and quality of life working committee [^11649uzc]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews apply rigorous methodologies to address a pre-specified, clearly formulated clinical research question. The conclusions reached are often cited to robustly inform decision-making by clinicians, third-party payers, and managed care organizations about the clinical question of interest. While systematic reviews provide a rigorous standard, they may be unfeasible when the task is to create general disease-focused guidelines comprised of multiple clinical practice questions versus a single major clinical practice question.

Collaborating transplantation and cellular therapy societal committees also recognize that the quantity and quality of reference sources may be insufficient for a meaningful systematic review. As the conduct of systematic reviews has evolved over time in terms of grading systems, reporting requirements, and use of technology, we provide guidance in methodologies, resources for reviewers, and approaches to overcome challenges in conducting systematic reviews in transplantation and cellular therapy.

### The whys and hows of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell mobilization [^116KMXXM]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Intentional mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into the circulation has improved the efficiency of their collection. Transplantation of mobilized blood stem cells to patients with marrow aplasia results in a faster pace of hematopoietic recovery than transplantation of marrow-derived stem cells. Autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are increasingly performed with blood-derived cells. Donors of both autologous and allogeneic blood stem cells do not always respond well to therapies designed to produce mobilization.

Autologous donors may respond poorly as a result of myelotoxic damage inflicted by prior antitumor therapy, but this explanation is not valid for allogeneic donors. The mechanisms involved in the process of mobilization are incompletely understood. Until these mechanisms are elucidated, methods to improve mobilization vigor on a rational basis will not be obvious. Meanwhile, clinical observations may provide some hints regarding the whys and hows of mobilization and permit incremental improvements in this process.

### Experimental basis for the treatment of autoimmune diseases with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^111wCwoq]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Preclinical research with autologous bone marrow transplantation has been performed in two models of autoimmune disease using Buffalo rats. In this strain, adjuvant arthritis develops as a chronic progressive systemic type of arthritis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis as a chronic remitting relapsing disease. In these models, the influence of various treatment parameters was studied, including the conditioning regimen, the composition of the graft, and the effect of reimmunization of cured animals. Continued research in animal models is recommended to solve problems that have emerged from the experience with several hundreds of severely ill autoimmune patients treated thus far with autologous stem cells.

### Hematopoietic reconstitution dynamics of mobilized- and bone marrow-derived human hematopoietic stem cells after gene therapy [^115u9Fy6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Mobilized peripheral blood is increasingly used instead of bone marrow as a source of autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells for ex vivo gene therapy. Here, we present an unplanned exploratory analysis evaluating the hematopoietic reconstitution kinetics, engraftment, and clonality in 13 pediatric Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients treated with autologous lentiviral-vector transduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from mobilized peripheral blood (n = 7), bone marrow (n = 5), or the combination of the two sources (n = 1). Eight out of thirteen gene therapy patients were enrolled in an open-label, non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical study (NCT01515462), and the remaining five patients were treated under expanded access programs.

Although mobilized peripheral blood- and bone marrow-hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells display similar capabilities of being gene-corrected and maintaining the engineered grafts up to three years after gene therapy, the mobilized peripheral blood-gene therapy group shows faster neutrophil and platelet recovery, a higher number of engrafted clones, and increased gene correction in the myeloid lineage. This correlates with a higher amount of primitive and myeloid progenitors contained in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from mobilized peripheral blood.

In vitro differentiation and transplantation studies in mice confirm that primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from both sources have comparable engraftment and multilineage differentiation potential. Altogether, our analyses reveal that the differential behavior after gene therapy of hematopoietic…

### Mesenchymal stromal cells: A novel and effective strategy for facilitating engraftment and accelerating hematopoietic recovery after transplantation [^115nXLP9]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be isolated from several human tissues and expanded ex vivo for clinical use. They comprise a heterogeneous population of cells that, through the production of growth factors, cell-to-cell interactions, and secretion of matrix proteins, play a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In recent years, several experimental studies have shown that MSCs possess immunomodulatory properties and have the capacity to promote graft survival in animal models. Given these properties, MSCs have been tested in pilot studies aiming to prevent or treat graft rejection and accelerate recovery after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

The available clinical evidence from these studies indicates that MSC infusion is safe and promising in terms of preventing graft failure. However, the effect of MSCs in accelerating hematopoietic reconstitution after HCT is more debated. Whether the favorable effect of MSCs largely depends on the type of transplantation remains an area for future investigation. Furthermore, future research should aim to gain more insights into the biological and functional mechanisms of MSCs that are relevant for their use in the modulation of alloreactivity and in the promotion of hematopoietic reconstitution.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^112tz7LD]. Brain (2022). High credibility.

We propose that it is important to pursue stem cell therapies for Huntington's disease, with the intention of meeting the need for therapeutics in Huntington's disease and to help provide a roadmap for the translation of cell therapies in other neurodegenerative conditions. To achieve this in the safest and most efficient way, we have established an international consortium of experts, called "Stem cells for Huntington's disease" (SC4HD). SC4HD aims to provide a platform for discussion and share experiences to offer guidance and generate a robust clinical development plan across a range of stem cell-based therapies for Huntington's disease.

The consortium works closely with the European Huntington's Disease Network (EHDN) Advanced Therapies Working Group (ATWG), which aims to address similar issues for both cells and molecules, and with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, which seeks to provide stem cell-based therapies for a range of human diseases. Here, we set out a consensus document that identifies key challenges to clinical translation and indicates the next steps needed to move forward safely and effectively to the next phase of this work.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^113UQeXb]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

There has been substantial progress in the development of regenerative medicine strategies for CNS disorders over the last decade, with progression to early clinical studies for some conditions. However, there are multiple challenges along the translational pipeline, many of which are common across diseases and pertinent to multiple donor cell types. These include defining the point at which the preclinical data are sufficiently compelling to permit progression to the first clinical studies; scaling-up, characterization, quality control, and validation of the cell product; and the design, validation, and approval of the surgical device and operative procedures for the safe and effective delivery of cell products to the brain.

Furthermore, clinical trials that incorporate principles of efficient design and disease-specific outcomes are urgently needed, particularly for those undertaken in rare diseases where relatively small cohorts are an additional limiting factor. Additionally, all processes must be adaptable in a dynamic regulatory environment. Here we set out the challenges associated with the clinical translation of cell therapy, using Huntington's disease as a specific example, and suggest potential strategies to address these challenges.

Huntington's disease presents a clear unmet need. Importantly, it is an autosomal dominant condition with a readily available gene test, full genetic penetrance, and a wide range of associated animal models, which together mean that it is a powerful condition in which to develop principles and test experimental therapeutics.

### One and a half million hematopoietic stem cell transplants: Continuous and differential improvement in worldwide access with the use of non-identical family donors [^114LJ2L6]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is considered a routine but complex therapy for patients with otherwise incurable chemo- and immune-sensitive malignant and non-malignant disorders. The treatment is also used for replacing deficient hematopoietic cells or cellular components and, more recently, for repairing hematopoietic stem cells by gene editing. Despite its increasing applications and international expansion of access, allogeneic HCT is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality and remains an example of highly specialized, high-cost medicine. It requires extensive experience, significant infrastructure, and a network of specialists from all fields of medicine.

Over the last two decades, in particular, allogeneic HCT has undergone a constant technological evolution, with decreasing transplant-related morbidity and mortality and expansion of the donor pool. This has been achieved by optimizing indications, manipulating alloreactive immune reactions ex vivo and in vivo, and using novel reduced or minimal intensity conditioning regimens. As a result, HCT is being offered to patients without a matched donor, to older patients, and to those with comorbidities.

The predominant autologous HCT transplant type, in contrast, relies exclusively on the high-dose preparative regimen for tumor eradication or for reshaping the immune system in autoimmune diseases. Patients' own hematopoietic stem cells are required to rebuild a normal hematopoietic system after the intensive preparative regimen.

### Allogeneic, but not autologous, hematopoietic cell transplantation improves survival only among younger adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^112XJnpM]. Blood (2013). High credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and prolonged chemotherapy are standard post-remission strategies for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission, but the optimal strategy remains controversial. There are no randomized trials of allogeneic HCT. In the present study, updated individual patient data were collected and analyzed from studies with information on the availability of a matched sibling donor (used to mimic randomization) and from randomized trials of autograft versus chemotherapy.

Data from 13 studies, including 2962 patients and excluding Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients, showed a survival benefit for having a matched sibling donor for patients under 35 years of age (OR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70–0.90, P = 0.0003) but not for those aged 35 years or older (OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85–1.19, P = 0.9; heterogeneity P = 0.03) due to the higher absolute risk of nonrelapse mortality for older patients. No differences were seen by risk group.

There was a trend toward inferior survival for autograft versus chemotherapy (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 0.99–1.41; p = 0.06). No beneficial effect of autografting was seen compared with chemotherapy in this analysis. We conclude that matched sibling donor myeloablative HCT improves survival only for younger patients, with an absolute benefit of approximately 10% at 5 years. Improved chemotherapy outcomes and reduced nonrelapse mortality associated with allogeneic HCT may change the relative effects of these treatments in the future.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^111G4hWo]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

One promising strategy is the generation of 'universal cells', also known as 'hypoimmunogenic cells', where hESC and hiPSCs can be engineered to reduce their immunogenicity upon transplantation, for example, by use of CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt HLA on their surface while still maintaining their ability to be differentiated towards the neuronal type of interest. To achieve this goal and ensure safety, there is a need to optimize the engineering strategy. Results in partially MHC-matched allogeneic neural grafts in primates are controversial, showing increased survival in the short term but no effect on rejection in the long term. Transgenic expression of soluble immune-modulators by the cell therapy product or gene-editing approaches targeting non-polymorphic MHC-class I genes represent other avenues under investigation in 'humanized' mouse models.

There is currently no consensus as to which of these strategies can resolve the issue of allogeneic responses to hPSC neural grafts. Moreover, gene editing will introduce a raft of additional regulatory complications over and above those already confronting a stem-cell derived ATMP. In this light, despite the associated risks, chronic immunosuppression currently remains the best option to protect allogeneic grafts from rejection. Thus, immunology expertise must be utilized in planning transplant procedures to tailor induction and maintenance treatment to the individual, ensuring long-term safety for the participant and long-term survival of the graft. The challenge of adherence to long-term immunosuppressant treatment is associated.

### Striatal allografts in patients with Huntington's disease: Impact of diminished astrocytes and vascularization on graft viability [^115zxZph]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Neuronal transplantation has been proposed as a potential therapy to replace lost neurons in Huntington's disease. Transplant vascularization and trophic support are important for graft survival. However, very few studies have specifically addressed graft vascularization in patients with neurological disorders. In the present study, we analyzed the vasculature of the host putamen and solid grafts of fetal striatal tissue transplanted into patients with Huntington's disease 9 and 12 years previously. Grafts were characterized by a significantly reduced number of large-caliber blood vessels in comparison with the host brain. There were also significantly fewer astrocytes and gap junctions, suggesting a lack of functional blood-brain barrier components within the grafted tissue.

Additionally, grafts demonstrated a nearly complete absence of pericytes (compared with the striatum) that are considered important for vascular stabilization and angiogenesis. Finally, the host striatum had a marked increase in atrophic astrocytes in comparison with controls and grafts. The extent to which the lower number of large-caliber vessels and astrocytes within the transplants contributed to suboptimal graft survival is unknown. The marked increase in atrophic astrocytes in the host brain surrounding the grafts suggests that reduced host trophic support may also contribute to poor graft survival in Huntington's disease. A better understanding of the way in which these components support allografted tissue is critical to the future development of cell-based therapies for the treatment of Huntington's disease.

### Striatal neural grafting improves cortical metabolism in Huntington's disease patients [^116NjZG5]. Brain (2004). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease is a hereditary condition characterized by the degeneration of neurons in the striatum, resulting in motor and cognitive deficits. Foetal striatal allografts have been shown to reverse these deficits in phenotypic models of Huntington's disease developed in primates. A recent open-label pilot study demonstrated some clinical improvement or stabilization in three out of five Huntington's disease patients who received bilateral striatal grafts of foetal neurons. In these three patients, clinical changes were associated with a reduction in striatal and cortical hypometabolism, indicating that the grafts were able to restore the function of striato-cortical loops.

Conversely, in the two patients who did not improve from the grafts, striatal and cortical hypometabolism progressed over the 2-year follow-up. A detailed anatomical-functional analysis of the grafted striata, enabled by 3D fusion of MRI and metabolic images, revealed considerable heterogeneity in the anatomic and metabolic profiles of grafted tissue, both within and between Huntington's disease patients. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of PET measurements of brain glucose metabolism in understanding the effects of foetal grafts in patients with Huntington's disease.

### The long-term safety and efficacy of bilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue in patients with mild to moderate Huntington's disease [^116RzkRL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements, and psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. It is caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin (htt) gene. Patients with 36 or more CAG repeats in this gene develop HD. The htt protein is now recognized to be involved in a variety of cellular, metabolic, transcription, and maintenance processes throughout development and in adults. Abnormal CAG expansion in HD results in neuronal dysfunction, aberrant intracellular aggregation of mutant protein fragments, and eventually, cell death.

Cellular dysfunction and loss are regionally specific within the brain, with early prominent atrophy occurring within the caudate nucleus and putamen, as well as the neocortex, eventually extending to additional areas of the brain as the disease advances. The condition is currently incurable, with patients usually dying within 15–30 years of disease onset.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^116zrtmv]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Use of placebo-controlled designs is an important component in the rigorous evaluation of new therapies, both to account for the patient's expectation of effectiveness and to establish any neurobiological effects of the intervention. It is, however, important that placebo interventions be minimally invasive and associated with as little risk as possible. The importance of controlling for placebo effects is particularly relevant when outcome assessment relies on patient-reported measures. Thus, when therapeutic outcomes (for example, with the use of digital sensors or computer-based assessments) can be objectively quantified, and valid and reliable surrogate measures of efficacy defined, it may not always be necessary to account for the psychological placebo effect.

Whilst the availability of placebo control data is highly relevant in terms of evaluating safety, particularly in the immediate postoperative period, in complex surgical interventions, the associated surgical risk of placebo must be considered. While some compromises as to the invasiveness of surgical placebos may be entertained, such as scalp incision and partial burr hole rather than dural penetrant cannulation, the larger issue is whether any such surgical placebo interventions remain reasonable in the era of mechanistically based surrogate outcome measures and large-scale natural history studies. More broadly, as a community, we need to consider whether such alternative information can allow the development of trial designs sufficient to establish treatment efficacy.

Documentation of the safety and efficacy of busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell reconstitution is derived from two sources:

- **Prospective clinical trial of Busulfan Injection**: The prospective trial was a single-arm, open-label study involving 61 patients who received Busulfan Injection as part of a conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The study included patients with acute leukemia past first remission (first or subsequent relapse), with high-risk first remission, or with induction failure; chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis; primary refractory or resistant relapsed Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and myelodysplastic syndrome. Forty-eight percent of patients (29/61) were heavily pretreated, defined as having at least one of the following: prior radiation, three or more prior chemotherapeutic regimens, or prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Seventy-five percent of patients (46/61) were transplanted with active disease.

- **Published reports of randomized, controlled trials**: High-dose oral busulfan was used as a component of a conditioning regimen for transplantation in these trials, which were identified in a literature review of five established commercial databases.

### Precision transplant and cell therapies for non-malignant disorders-the path forward [^111ova1f]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

The number of patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) and cell therapies for non-malignant disorders is steadily increasing, with more genetic diseases being identified and newer gene therapy products being introduced for various indications. By combining individualized conditioning, novel graft manipulation techniques, using cutting-edge methods to monitor post-HCT response, and offering exceptional survivorship care, one can achieve excellent survival and improved quality of life for these patients.

### Opdivo [^115hD8w2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Embryo-fetal toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for five months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when OPDIVO is added to a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone:

### High-dose therapy in lymphomas: A review of the current status of allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation in Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^116hMzF5]. The Oncologist (2001). Low credibility.

Autologous stem cell transplantation has proven to be beneficial in selected patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In patients with HD, transplantation appears to increase event-free survival in patients who fail to enter complete remission with initial therapy. When a patient relapses following a complete remission, transplantation is probably the best option, especially if the remission lasted less than one year.

Transplantation as part of primary therapy for very high-risk patients may be beneficial, but it is not standard therapy at this time. For patients with diffuse large-cell NHL, transplantation can be considered standard therapy for relapsed patients if they have chemotherapy-sensitive disease. The use of transplantation for high-risk patients in complete remission is promising, but definite recommendations cannot be made at this time.

For follicular lymphomas, selected patients seem to benefit, and studies are ongoing. Finally, the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be useful in a select group of younger patients.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^115FY3kL]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

We are in an exciting phase of accelerated progress for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), which includes recent progress in stem cell therapies. The optimism around stem cell therapies is built on decades of preclinical research establishing the key principles of cellular therapies, developments in the stem cell field that are leading to a better understanding of how to generate and manufacture donor cells, and the emergence of key research methodologies in the area of genomics, epigenomics, and human imaging.

Huntington's disease is a potential indication for regenerative medicine and represents a neurodegenerative disease paradigm in which to establish principles for its safe and efficient clinical translation. Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder that typically develops in mid-life and is characterized by progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairment, seriously eroding quality of life and with a high societal impact. It is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative condition of the CNS, being caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. The availability of a reliable genetic test and complete penetrance for CAG repeats above 39 mean that Huntington's disease is reliably diagnosed in life, and individuals carrying the mutation can be identified in the presymptomatic phases. These factors provide substantial power for clinical studies that seek to evaluate disease progression and/or potential modification by treatments. This, alongside the fact that Huntington's disease features the major pathophysiological…

### Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in multiple sclerosis: Recommendations of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society [^113ShiQ6]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) for multiple sclerosis has gained increasing interest in recent years. Despite the availability of many U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved disease-modifying therapies, some patients do not respond adequately, and others may have very early aggressive disease that prompts consideration of alternative, highly effective, long-lasting therapy. The National Medical Advisory Committee of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has reviewed recent literature on AHSCT to make recommendations about its use based on knowledge, as well as highlighting areas of controversy and issues requiring further research.

Studies on AHSCT have repeatedly demonstrated high efficacy and durable outcomes in people with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Recent studies have shown considerable improvement in the safety of the procedure, with much lower mortality rates than were reported earlier. Consensus is emerging about the characteristics of the best candidates for the procedure. However, questions remain about the ideal protocol, particularly concerning the best conditioning regimen to be used to eliminate immune cells. Larger randomized clinical trials are needed to address whether AHSCT has advantages over the most efficacious disease-modifying agents currently available. One such trial, Best Available Therapy Versus Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Multiple Sclerosis (BEAT-MS), is currently in progress.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society believes in the potential of AHSCT as an effective treatment option for suitable candidates and advocates for continued research and evaluation in this area.

### Stem cells for cell replacement therapy: A therapeutic strategy for HD [^114dmTse]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Much interest has been expressed over the last couple of decades in the potential application of stem cells to medicine, both for research and diagnostic tools and as a source of donor cells for therapeutic purposes. Potential therapeutic applications include the replacement of cells in many body organs where the capacity for intrinsic repair is limited, including the pancreas, heart, and brain. A key challenge is to generate the relevant donor cell types, and this is particularly challenging in the brain, where the number of different neuronal subtypes is so great. Although dopamine neuron replacement in Parkinson's disease has been the focus of most clinical studies, great interest has also been shown in this approach for other disorders, including Huntington's disease.

Replacing complete neural circuits in the adult brain is clearly challenging, and there are many other complexities regarding both donor cells and the host. This article presents the pros and cons of taking a cell therapy approach in Huntington's disease. It considers the implantation of both cells that are already of the same neural subtype as those lost in the disease process (i.e. primary fetal cells derived from the developing striatum) and those derived from stem cells, which require "directing" toward that phenotype.

### Translating cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's disease as a model disorder [^116HhCQM]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

There has been substantial progress in the development of regenerative medicine strategies for CNS disorders over the last decade, with progression to early clinical studies for some conditions. However, there are multiple challenges along the translational pipeline, many of which are common across diseases and pertinent to multiple donor cell types. These challenges include defining the point at which the preclinical data are sufficiently compelling to permit progression to the first clinical studies; scaling-up, characterization, quality control, and validation of the cell product; design, validation, and approval of the surgical device; and operative procedures for safe and effective delivery of cell product to the brain. Furthermore, clinical trials that incorporate principles of efficient design and disease-specific outcomes are urgently needed, particularly for those undertaken in rare diseases, where relatively small cohorts are an additional limiting factor, and all processes must be adaptable in a dynamic regulatory environment.

Here we set out the challenges associated with the clinical translation of cell therapy, using Huntington's disease as a specific example, and suggest potential strategies to address these challenges. Huntington's disease presents a clear unmet need. Importantly, it is an autosomal dominant condition with a readily available gene test, full genetic penetrance, and a wide range of associated animal models, which together mean that it is a powerful condition in which to develop principles and test experimental therapeutics.

For therapeutic procedures addressing aplastic anemia, particularly concerning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines suggest performing upfront matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation. This is recommended for pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with severe aplastic anemia, as it provides high cure rates with minimal risks of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), rejection, or disease transformation.

### Methods and role of minimal residual disease after stem cell transplantation [^112wBRg7]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Relapse is the major cause of treatment failure after stem cell transplantation. Despite the fact that relapses occur even when transplantation is performed in complete remission, it is evident that minimal residual disease (MRD) is present, though not morphologically apparent. Adaptive immunotherapy, such as donor lymphocyte infusion, novel cell therapies, and less toxic drugs that can be used post-transplantation, have increased the clinical importance of detecting MRD as a variable for treatment outcomes. Advanced technologies now enable the detection of residual malignant cells with a sensitivity of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁶.

Under the patronage of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT), the 3rd workshop was held on November 4–5, 2016, in Hamburg, Germany. The workshop aimed to present the current status of the epidemiology and biology of relapse, and to summarize the available options for preventing and treating post-transplant relapse. The methods and role of minimal residual disease for myeloid and lymphoid malignancies are summarized here.

### The long-term safety and efficacy of bilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue in patients with mild to moderate Huntington's disease [^1161ETZU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Analysis of individual patients revealed some apparent improvements. Patient 1 showed improvement after the first unilateral transplant, with the UHDRS motor score falling from 37 to 18 in the first 6 months after transplantation. After the second transplant (at T = 22.5 on the graph), the UHDRS motor scores became progressively worse. The final UHDRS score recorded 10 years after the first transplant was 37. This patient has never received any drug treatment for her chorea.

Patient 2 also improved his motor score after the first transplant and again after the second operation. For the next 6 years, their motor UHDRS score seemed to stabilize. However, motor scores then deteriorated and have continued to do so to the present time, and olanzapine was started for psychiatric problems 7 years after the initial transplant. Some individual patients in the reference control group showed equally marked improvements at particular points during their 6-monthly or annual assessments (see figure 1).

Thus, we see no evidence when comparing all patients of the two groups of a significant short-term improvement following transplantation and no evidence for a change of slope of disease progression. Importantly, there is also no evidence of a detectable placebo effect in the transplant group when using objective motor ratings in the UHDRS, even though this is an open-label trial design.

### Advances in graft-versus-host disease biology and therapy [^116Bkcnh]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used to treat a variety of disorders, but its efficacy is limited by the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The past decade has brought impressive advances in our understanding of the role of stimulatory and suppressive elements of the adaptive and innate immune systems from both the donor and the host in GVHD pathogenesis. New insights from basic immunology, preclinical models, and clinical studies have led to novel approaches for prevention and treatment. This review highlights the recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of GVHD and its treatment, with a focus on manipulations of the immune system that are amenable to clinical application.

Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to stem cell transplantation, the indications in the ASTCT 2025 guidelines recommend not offering allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation to patients with CLL whose disease has relapsed and/or is refractory to both a covalent Bruton TKI and a BCL-2 inhibitor, regardless of response to a non-covalent Bruton TKI.

### Change in stem cell source for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Europe: A report of the EBMT activity survey 2003 [^112q6TZm]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

This EBMT activity survey presents the status of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Europe in 2003, focusing on changes in stem cell sources over the last decade. There were 21,028 first HSCTs: 7,091 allogeneic (34%) and 13,937 autologous (66%), with an additional 4,179 re- or multiple transplants reported from 597 centers in 42 European countries in 2003. The main indications were leukemias (6,613 or 31%; 78% allogeneic), lymphomas (11,571 or 55%; 93% autologous), solid tumors (1,792 or 9%; 92% autologous), and nonmalignant disorders (898 or 5%; 93% allogeneic).

In 1991, the vast majority of autologous and all allogeneic HSCTs were still bone marrow (BM) transplants. The stem cell source changed rapidly to peripheral blood (PB) for autologous HSCTs between 1992 and 1996. By 2003, 97% of autologous HSCTs were PB-derived. The change to PB for allogeneic HSCTs followed three years later and occurred at a lower rate, with 65% of all allogeneic HSCTs being PB-derived in 2003. The change in stem cell sources was not uniform and was associated with donor type, main diagnosis, disease stage, and varied between European countries. In 2003, bone marrow remained a significant source of stem cells in some European countries for autologous HSCTs and for nonmalignant disorders in allogeneic HSCTs.

### Systematic reviews in hematopoietic cell transplantation and cellular therapy: Considerations and guidance from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research late effects and quality of life working committee [^112qk4mh]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Systematic reviews apply rigorous methodologies to address a prespecified, clearly formulated clinical research question. The conclusion that results is often cited to more robustly inform decision-making by clinicians, third-party payers, and managed care organizations about the clinical question of interest. Although systematic reviews provide a rigorous standard, they may be infeasible when the task is to create general disease-focused guidelines comprising multiple clinical practice questions versus a single major clinical practice question. Collaborating transplantation and cellular therapy society committees also recognize that the quantity and/or quality of reference sources may be insufficient for a meaningful systematic review.

As the conduct of systematic reviews has evolved over time in terms of grading systems, reporting requirements, and use of technology, here we provide guidance on methodologies, resources for reviewers, and approaches to overcome challenges in conducting systematic reviews in transplantation and cellular therapy.

### Current status of reduced-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation using alternative donors [^114zTS9J]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal donor for a patient undergoing reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation remains a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched relative. Alternative donors, such as matched unrelated donors (MUDs), mismatched related donors (haploidentical), or unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) units, have emerged as viable options as well. The most experience thus far has been with MUD donors, which is largely attributed to the development of allele-specific DNA-based HLA-typing methods. The primary drawback is the significant delay required to locate a donor. Haploidentical donors exist for almost all patients and offer the convenience of a living related donor; however, significant rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other toxicities continue to complicate such HLA mismatching. UCB is the most recent option for a source of stem cells. Frozen cord blood units can be acquired almost immediately and are able to safely traverse 1 or 2-HLA antigen mismatch barriers. The experience with UCB has been limited by the low cell dose, although recent innovations are attempting to overcome this limitation. In this review, we summarize the experience and knowledge with alternative donors as stem cell sources for reduced-intensity transplantation.

### Fetal striatal grafting slows motor and cognitive decline of Huntington's disease [^1112mfM6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Human fetal striatal transplantation is being investigated as a possible treatment for Huntington's disease (HD), with the goal of restoring striatal function impaired by primary degeneration. Pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the therapy. Imaging has shown controversial data on the survival and efficacy of the graft, and long-term pathological studies have reported its eventual neuronal degeneration. Different graft growth patterns have been described.

Even though alloimmunization has been reported, and its possible role in graft degeneration has been hypothesized, the host/graft immune response is not well understood. Neoplastic or teratogenic transformation of the graft has never been observed, while the occurrence of overgrowth has seldom been reported. According to a few long-term follow-up studies, fetal striatal transplantation provided a period of clinical improvement in three out of five patients, stability in one out of two, while no significant clinical benefit was found in a group of five patients compared with 12 non-grafted patients.

We report the results of a follow-up study designed to assess disease progression in 10 consecutive HD transplanted patients and 16 HD non-transplanted patients, and discuss how fetal striatal transplantation may affect the disease course.

### Bilateral human fetal striatal transplantation in Huntington's disease [^111Vvt7r]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Transplanted striatal cells have been demonstrated to survive, grow, establish afferent and efferent connections, and improve behavioral signs in animal models of Huntington's disease (HD).

- **Objective**: To evaluate feasibility and safety and to provide preliminary information regarding the efficacy of bilateral human fetal striatal transplantation in HD.

- **Methods**: Seven symptomatic patients with genetically confirmed HD underwent bilateral stereotactic transplantation of two to eight fetal striata per side in two staged procedures. Tissue was dissected from the lateral half of the lateral ventricular eminence of donors 8 to 9 weeks postconception. Subjects received cyclosporine for 6 months.

- **Results**: Three subjects developed subdural hemorrhages (SDHs) and two required surgical drainage. One subject died 18 months after surgery from probable cardiac arrhythmia secondary to severe atherosclerotic cardiac disease. Autopsy demonstrated clearly demarcated grafts of typical developing striatal morphology, with host-derived dopaminergic fibers extending into the grafts and no evidence of immune rejection. Other adverse events were generally mild and transient. Mean Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor scores were 32.9 ± 6.2 at baseline and 29.7 ± 7.5 12 months after surgery (p = 0.24). Post-hoc analysis, excluding one subject who experienced cognitive and motor deterioration after the development of symptomatic bilateral SDHs, found that UHDRS motor scores were 33.8 ± 6.2 at baseline and 27.5 ± 5.2 at 12 months (p = 0.03).
