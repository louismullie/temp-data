## Question

diagnosis of HRS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern nomenclature and why the criteria shifted from fixed creatinine thresholds to dynamic AKI-based definitions. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology that underpins the diagnostic logic. Next, I will review the stepwise diagnostic algorithm, including how to stage AKI, exclude other causes, apply the albumin challenge, and confirm HRS-AKI. After that, I need to check the role of biomarkers and imaging in differentiating HRS from ATN and prerenal azotemia. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, documentation requirements, and the implications for urgency of therapy and transplant evaluation, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't anchor on outdated concepts. Historically, HRS was divided into type 1 and type 2, but contemporary guidance adopts HRS-AKI for the acute form and HRS-CKD for chronic functional kidney injury, aligning with KDIGO-style AKI dynamics rather than fixed creatinine cutoffs, which enables earlier recognition and treatment initiation [^111mEFn4] [^114XePvM] [^11462Zvo].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiologic foundation is clear because it drives the diagnostic exclusions. HRS-AKI reflects marked splanchnic arterial vasodilation causing effective arterial underfilling, activation of vasoconstrictor systems, and intense renal arteriolar vasoconstriction with preserved tubular function, and importantly, systemic inflammation contributes substantially in decompensated cirrhosis, which helps explain variability in response to vasoconstrictors and the need to exclude structural injury [^115iY975] [^116RyTxD] [^11462Zvo].

> Next, I should review how to stage AKI in cirrhosis, since HRS-AKI is a subtype of AKI. AKI is defined by an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a 50% increase from baseline within 7 days, and baseline should be the most recent value within 3 months when available. Staging uses the same KDIGO framework, with stage 1 as 1.5–1.9× baseline or ≥ 0.3 mg/dL rise, stage 2 as 2.0–2.9× baseline, and stage 3 as ≥ 3× baseline or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL with an acute rise, which stratifies severity and prognostic risk in cirrhosis [^111mEFn4] [^115UzXZj] [^116FJ1ad].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Before labeling HRS, I must systematically exclude other causes of AKI. I should confirm there is no shock, no recent nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, or iodinated contrast, and no evidence of structural kidney disease by urinalysis and imaging, specifically proteinuria greater than 500 mg/day, microhematuria more than 50 RBCs per high-power field, or abnormal renal ultrasound, because these findings point away from HRS and toward intrinsic renal injury or obstruction [^111mEFn4] [^112DUEj5].

> Wait, let me verify the albumin challenge protocol, since this is a key diagnostic gate. After withholding diuretics for 48 hours, I should administer intravenous albumin at 1 g/kg per day for 2 days, not exceeding 100 g/day, and then reassess creatinine. Lack of improvement in creatinine after this maneuver supports a functional, vasoconstrictive process consistent with HRS-AKI rather than prerenal azotemia, though I need to monitor closely for volume overload during this test [^111mEFn4] [^112Ynvce].

> I will now examine the confirmation criteria for HRS-AKI. The diagnosis is made when a patient with cirrhosis and ascites has AKI by ICA-AKI criteria, no response after 48 hours of diuretic withdrawal and albumin expansion, absence of shock, no current or recent nephrotoxins, and no signs of structural kidney injury on urinalysis or ultrasound, recognizing that HRS-AKI is a diagnosis of exclusion and that early stages of AKI, even stage 1A, carry significant mortality and warrant prompt action [^111mEFn4] [^116FJ1ad] [^115x4zjo].

> Let me consider biomarkers and imaging to refine the differential, especially HRS versus ATN. Urinary NGAL can suggest ATN when elevated, whereas a fractional excretion of sodium less than 1% may favor HRS, but I should double-check that these are adjuncts rather than standalone diagnostics, and that normal renal ultrasound and bland urine sediment support a functional process. Still, I must remember that tubular injury can coexist, so biomarkers should be interpreted in clinical context and not replace the algorithm [^112DUEj5] [^113129rR] [^111Lo3Kz].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on dialysis or has chronic kidney disease. I should confirm that HRS-CKD is defined as a functional CKD in cirrhosis with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for at least 3 months in the absence of other causes, and that HRS-AKI can be superimposed on CKD, which complicates interpretation and underscores the need to follow the same exclusion framework and consider transplant candidacy early [^116pxwX2] [^111mEFn4].

> I need to ensure I document precipitating factors because they influence both diagnosis and prognosis. Infections, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, large-volume paracentesis without albumin, and systemic inflammatory response are common triggers, and addressing them promptly is essential. Importantly, albumin plus antibiotics reduces HRS-AKI incidence and improves survival in SBP, illustrating how treating precipitants alters outcomes [^112Pb4rt] [^112KeFYx].

> Hold on, I should verify the urgency of therapy and transplant evaluation. Once HRS-AKI is diagnosed, vasoconstrictor therapy plus albumin should be initiated expeditiously, ideally within days, and all patients should be considered for urgent liver transplantation given high short-term mortality even with treatment response. Response is typically defined as creatinine returning to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline or less than 1.5 mg/dL, and nonresponders may require RRT as a bridge while continuing transplant evaluation [^113TnLRo] [^1135Vmim] [^113TnLRo].

> Let me reconsider the role of TIPS so I don't overstate it. TIPS is not recommended for HRS-AKI due to insufficient evidence, but may be considered in selected patients with HRS-non-AKI to reduce morbidity and mortality, so I should avoid suggesting TIPS in the acute AKI setting and reserve it for carefully selected non-AKI cases after multidisciplinary review [^1141NVK8] [^1119JPsz].

> In summary, I should confirm that diagnosing HRS-AKI requires a disciplined, stepwise approach: stage AKI dynamically, exclude shock, nephrotoxins, and structural injury, perform a standardized albumin challenge, and apply the ICA-AKI–based exclusion criteria. Biomarkers and imaging refine the differential but do not replace the algorithm, and early recognition enables timely vasoconstrictor therapy and transplant referral, which materially affect outcomes in this high-mortality condition [^111mEFn4] [^112DUEj5] [^113TnLRo].

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is diagnosed by **excluding other causes** of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis with ascites, using the **revised ICA criteria** [^117EKXtt] [^111mEFn4]. HRS-AKI is defined by an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 50% from baseline, **no response after 48 hours** of diuretic withdrawal and albumin (1 g/kg/day, max 100 g/day), absence of shock, nephrotoxins, and structural kidney injury (normal urinalysis, no proteinuria > 500 mg/day, normal renal ultrasound) [^111mEFn4] [^116FJ1ad]. HRS-CKD is a **chronic functional decline** (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for > 3 months) without other causes. Early recognition and exclusion of prerenal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis, and intrinsic renal disease are essential; urinary biomarkers (e.g. NGAL) may help distinguish ATN from HRS when uncertain [^113129rR] [^112DUEj5].

---

## Clinical context and predisposing factors

HRS occurs almost exclusively in patients with **advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension**, typically with ascites [^111mEFn4]. Common precipitating factors include:

- **Bacterial infections**: Especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) [^116azr5U].
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Acute variceal hemorrhage [^114wZsVJ].
- **Large-volume paracentesis**: Without adequate albumin replacement [^112Pb4rt].
- **Nephrotoxic drugs**: NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, iodinated contrast media [^111mEFn4].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI

The **revised ICA criteria** for HRS-AKI include:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cirrhosis with ascites | Essential prerequisite |
| AKI definition | Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 50% from baseline [^111mEFn4] [^116FJ1ad] |
| No response to volume expansion | No reduction in serum creatinine after 48 hours of diuretic withdrawal and albumin infusion (1 g/kg/day, max 100 g/day) [^111mEFn4] [^112Ynvce] |
| Absence of shock | No hypotension or need for vasopressors |
| No nephrotoxic drugs | No recent use of NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, or iodinated contrast |
| No structural kidney injury | - Normal urinalysis <br/> - Proteinuria ≤ 500 mg/day <br/> - Normal renal ultrasound [^111mEFn4] [^111Lo3Kz] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria for HRS-CKD

HRS-CKD is defined as a **chronic functional decline** in renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for > 3 months) in the absence of other causes of chronic kidney disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, or chronic glomerulonephritis [^116pxwX2].

---

## Differentiation from other causes of AKI in cirrhosis

HRS-AKI is a **diagnosis of exclusion**; the main differentials are:

- **Prerenal azotemia**: Hypovolemia-induced AKI responsive to volume expansion [^113qPqfK].
- **Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**: Often associated with shock, nephrotoxins, or severe sepsis; characterized by muddy brown casts, proteinuria, and abnormal renal ultrasound [^111Lo3Kz].
- **Intrinsic renal disease**: Chronic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, or interstitial nephritis [^notfound].

Urinary biomarkers such as **neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)** can help differentiate ATN from HRS, although they are not yet universally adopted [^113129rR] [^112DUEj5].

---

## Role of biomarkers and imaging

Biomarkers like NGAL, **interleukin-18 (IL-18)**, and **kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1)** are under investigation to distinguish HRS from ATN and prerenal azotemia [^notfound]. Renal ultrasound is essential to exclude **obstructive uropathy** and assess kidney size and echogenicity, which are typically normal in HRS [^111mEFn4].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed recognition and treatment of HRS-AKI are associated with **high mortality** and poor outcomes [^115x4zjo]. Early initiation of vasoconstrictor therapy (terlipressin or norepinephrine) combined with albumin significantly improves renal function and survival [^1135Vmim] [^113jdTar].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

- **Identify AKI**: Use KDIGO criteria (serum creatinine increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 50% from baseline) [^111mEFn4] [^116FJ1ad].
- **Exclude other causes**: Prerenal azotemia, ATN, and intrinsic renal disease [^111xrqwE].
- **Apply ICA criteria**: Confirm HRS-AKI or HRS-CKD based on revised ICA criteria [^117EKXtt].
- **Use adjuncts**: Consider biomarkers and imaging when differentiation is uncertain [^112DUEj5].

### Hepatorenal syndrome: updates on definition, classification, pathophysiology and treatment options [^115PFhxj]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a severe complication of advanced liver disease, characterized by renal dysfunction in the absence of intrinsic kidney disease. It is associated with high mortality, necessitating early recognition and prompt treatment. In this review, we summarize the latest in pathophysiology, diagnosis, classification and treatment of hepatorenal syndrome relevant to a consulting interventional radiologist. The diagnosis and classification of HRS has recently been updated by the International Club of Ascites (ICA) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) to include more subcategories that better reflect disease severity and prognosis. Greater insights have also been obtained into the pathophysiology of HRS, currently understood to be a complex manifestation of hemodynamic disturbances due to portal hypertension, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and biliary injury. We discuss the role of laboratory biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis along with associated pitfalls. Treatment options are reviewed starting with first line medical management, adjunctive renal replacement therapy, and liver transplantation. Finally, we review the evidence to date investigating transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation in this population, focusing on expected efficacy for specific subpopulations and current gaps in knowledge, all driving practical recommendations for when the procedure should be considered.

### Hepatorenal syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^114XePvM]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), the extreme manifestation of renal impairment in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Hepatorenal syndrome is diagnosed when kidney function is reduced but evidence of intrinsic kidney disease, such as hematuria, proteinuria, or abnormal kidney ultrasonography, is absent. Unlike other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatorenal syndrome results from functional changes in the renal circulation and is potentially reversible with liver transplantation or vasoconstrictor drugs. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome are recognized depending on the acuity and progression of kidney injury. The first represents an acute impairment of kidney function, HRS-AKI, whereas the second represents a more chronic kidney dysfunction, HRS-CKD (chronic kidney disease). In this review, we provide critical insight into the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of hepatorenal syndrome.

Introduction

Renal dysfunction is a common complication in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Since the original publication of the definition and diagnostic criteria for the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), there have been major advances in our understanding of its pathogenesis. The prognosis of patients with cirrhosis who develop HRS remains poor, with a median survival without liver transplantation of less than six months. However, a number of pharmacological and other therapeutic strategies have now become available which offer the ability to prevent or treat renal dysfunction more effectively in this setting. Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline, PubMed and Web of Science, data provided by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the bibliographies of key reviews. We determined a list of key questions and convened a two-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions. In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.

Results

Of the 30 questions considered, we found inadequate evidence for the majority of questions and our recommendations were mainly based on expert opinion. There was insufficient evidence to grade three questions, but we were able to develop a consensus definition for acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis and provide consensus recommendations for future investigations to address key areas of uncertainty.

Conclusions

Despite a paucity of sufficiently powered prospectively randomized trials, we were able to establish an evidence-based appraisal of this field and develop a set of consensus recommendations to standardize care and direct further research for patients with cirrhosis and renal dysfunction.

Material and methods

This review was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement.

The population, intervention, comparison and outcome framework was used to structure the research question. Specifically, the population is humans who are diagnosed with HRS. The intervention is different regimens as trials in the diagnosed cases of HRS. The comparison is a trial regimen, placebo and standard/routine treatments for HRS. The outcomes were differences in related variables to the efficacy of the treatment compared with the study groups, including HRS reversal, mortality and model for end-stage liver dise.

Two coauthors searched the electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar) to collect all papers relevant to treating HRS.

The primary outcome was to evaluate the current treatment for HRS and discuss the challenges in deciding the most appropriate medication regimens. The secondary outcome was to determine the effect of different treatments on the follow-up of HRS patients.

The keywords searched were "HRS" and/or "hepatorenal syndrome" combined with the general term "liver diseases" and "kidney diseases", "AKI-HRS", "CKD-HRS", "KDIGO criteria", "HRS type 1 & 2", " terlipressin", "albumin", "hemodialysis" and "liver transplant". At this step, data were collected based on the study titles. All in vivo clinical trial studies on human studies in English, regardless of the age or sex of cases from 1999 to 2023, were included.

Literature selection and data extraction: After collecting the papers, two researchers briefly read each paper to exclude the irrelevant and duplicate studies. Next, the relevant studies were reviewed carefully, and the references were explored to collect more papers (figure 1). We prepared a data gathering form containing the title, author's name, year of study, population, sample size and the study results (table 1). Researchers reread the articles to extract and document the data required to complete the form.

### Hepatorenal syndrome type 1: diagnosis and treatment [^117WUHCd]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a feared complication in patients with advanced cirrhosis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While recognized as a distinct physiologic condition for well over one hundred years, a lack of objective diagnostic tests has made the diagnosis one of exclusion. Since 1979, multiple sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Though varying in detail, the principal intent of these criteria is to identify patients with severe, functional acute kidney injury that is unresponsive to volume resuscitation and exclude those with structural injury. However, accurate differential diagnosis remains challenging. Recently, multiple urinary biomarkers of kidney injury, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, have been studied as a means of objectively phenotyping etiologies of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. Along with markers reflecting tubular functional integrity, including the fractional excretion of sodium, injury markers will likely be incorporated into future diagnostic criteria. Making an accurate diagnosis is critical, as therapeutic options exist for HRS but must be given in a timely manner and only to those patients likely to benefit. Terlipressin, an analog of vasopressin, is the first line of therapy for HRS in much of the world and has recently been approved for use in the United States. Significant questions remain regarding the optimal dosing strategy, metrics for titration, and the potential role of point-of-care ultrasound to help guide concurrent albumin administration.

Purpose Of Review

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is encountered frequently in patients with end-stage liver disease and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. This review will focus and provide updates on pathophysiology, assessment of kidney function, new definitions, and treatment and prevention of HRS.

Recent Findings

Pathophysiology of HRS has been elucidated more recently and in addition to hemodynamic changes, the role of systemic inflammatory response contributes significantly to this process. Assessment of kidney function in patients with liver cirrhosis remains challenging. Novel glomerular filtration rate equations have been developed in patients with liver disease to better estimate kidney function and changes made in the definition of acute kidney injury (AKI), which are more aligned with KDIGO criteria for AKI. Vasoconstrictors, especially terlipressin, along with albumin remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of HRS-AKI. Biomarkers have been useful in differentiating ATN from HRS at an early stage.

Summary

HRS remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with end-stage liver disease. Newer understanding of mechanisms in development and pathophysiology of HRS have helped with elucidation of the disease process.

### Hepatorenal syndrome [^116RyTxD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome is a severe complication of end-stage cirrhosis characterized by increased splanchnic blood flow, hyperdynamic state, a state of decreased central volume, activation of vasoconstrictor systems, and extreme kidney vasoconstriction leading to decreased GFR. The contribution of systemic inflammation, a key feature of cirrhosis, in the development of hepatorenal syndrome has been highlighted in recent years. The mechanisms by which systemic inflammation precipitates kidney circulatory changes during hepatorenal syndrome need to be clarified. Early diagnosis is central in the management and recent changes in the definition of hepatorenal syndrome help identify patients at an earlier stage. Vasoconstrictive agents (terlipressin in particular) and albumin are the first-line treatment option. Several controlled studies proved that terlipressin is effective at reversing hepatorenal syndrome and may improve short-term survival. Not all patients are responders, and even in responders, early mortality rates are very high in the absence of liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. In the long term, patients transplanted with hepatorenal syndrome tend to have lower GFR compared with patients without hepatorenal syndrome. Differentiating hepatorenal syndrome from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is often a challenging yet important step because vasoconstrictors are not justified for the treatment of ATN. Hepatorenal syndrome and ATN may be considered as a continuum rather than distinct entities. Emerging biomarkers may help differentiate these two conditions and provide prognostic information on kidney recovery after liver transplantation, and potentially affect the decision for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

### Hepatorenal syndrome: the 8th international consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative (ADQI) group [^114pGjNL]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a unique form of kidney injury resulting from renal vasoconstriction in the setting of systemic and splanchnic arterial vasodilatation in patients with advanced cirrhosis. HRS is typically subdivided into two types: type-1 in which there is a rapid deterioration in kidney function with the serum creatinine (Scr) increasing by more than 100% from baseline to greater than 2.5 mg/dl within a two-week period, whereas type-2 HRS occurs in patients with refractory ascites with either a steady but moderate degree of functional renal failure (≥ 1.5 mg/dl) or a deterioration in kidney function that does not fulfill the criteria for HRS type-1. In patients with advanced cirrhosis, HRS is reported to occur in 18% within one year of diagnosis and up to 40% at five years. Untreated, median survival is two weeks for patients with type-1 HRS and four to six months in patients with type-2 HRS. However, many patients with lesser degrees of renal impairment in the setting of cirrhosis do not meet the precise definitions of HRS and, yet, have the same pathophysiological basis to their renal impairment and, therefore, could potentially benefit from therapies developed for HRS. A consensus conference under the auspices of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) was held in 2010. The purpose of this consensus conference was to review the literature on renal impairment in cirrhosis and to create the basis for a definition and classification system of all forms of renal impairment including HRS, from there to develop a broader understanding of its epidemiology, review current knowledge in the field of prevention and treatment, and develop the framework for a research agenda in relation to this condition.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatorenal syndrome: insights into HRS-AKI and liver transplantation [^112ZQr9b]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), accurate and early diagnosis is crucial. HRS is a severe condition seen in advanced cirrhosis, requiring prompt recognition and proper management to enhance patient outcomes. Diagnosis of HRS-AKI relies on serum creatinine elevations, similar to other AKI cases in cirrhosis. However, distinguishing HRS-AKI from other renal impairments in these patients can be challenging. Biomarkers and clinical criteria aid in diagnosis and guide treatment. The management of HRS-AKI initially involves improving the haemodynamic profile using albumin and vasoconstrictors like terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue. Despite some reports linking terlipressin to increased adverse events compared with norepinephrine, it remains the preferred choice in HRS-AKI and acute-on-chronic liver failure due to its faster, stronger response and improved survival.

Abstract

In hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), accurate and early diagnosis is crucial. HRS is a severe condition seen in advanced cirrhosis, requiring prompt recognition and proper management to enhance patient outcomes. Diagnosis of HRS-AKI relies on serum creatinine elevations, similar to other AKI cases in cirrhosis. However, distinguishing HRS-AKI from other renal impairments in these patients can be challenging. Biomarkers and clinical criteria aid in diagnosis and guide treatment. The management of HRS-AKI initially involves improving the haemodynamic profile using albumin and vasoconstrictors like terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue. Despite some reports linking terlipressin to increased adverse events compared with norepinephrine, it remains the preferred choice in HRS-AKI and acute-on-chronic liver failure due to its faster, stronger response and improved survival. Additional therapies like midodrine (alpha-1 adrenergic agonist), octreotide (somatostatin analogue) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt are proposed as adjuvant treatments for HRS-AKI, aiming to improve vasoconstriction and renal blood flow. However, these adjunctive therapies cannot replace the definitive treatment for HRS-AKI — liver transplantation (LT). In cases unresponsive to medical management, LT is the only option to restore liver function and improve renal outcomes. Current evidence favours combined liver and kidney transplantation (CLKT) in certain situations. This review aims to evaluate the present evidence and recommendations on AKI in patients with cirrhosis, the pathophysiology of HRS-AKI, different treatments and indications for LT and CLKT. Understanding the complexities of managing HRS-AKI is crucial for optimising patient care and achieving better outcomes in this challenging clinical setting.

Objectives

To review the current definitions and diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI) and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) now termed HRS-AKI and discuss the challenges in deciding the most appropriate medication regimens to treat patients with HRS-AKI.

Data Sources

PubMed (inception to April 2023) with bibliographies of retrieved articles searched for additional articles; organizational websites for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating albumin and vasoconstrictors for HRS-AKI.

Data Synthesis

A major change in the most recent revision of definitions and diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI is the elimination of the set cutoff serum creatinine values for AKI. This change should be considered when comparing studies of HRS-AKI over time. Albumin has been administered to both vasoconstrictor treatment and placebo groups in all recent RCTs; however, there has never been a large RCT evaluating a no-albumin group. Most prospective trials comparing a midodrine/octreotide combination or norepinephrine to placebo or terlipressin have enrolled less than 100 patients limiting any conclusions regarding clinically important outcomes. Terlipressin with albumin has shown mixed results for complete HRS-AKI reversal with no reductions in crude mortality but adverse effect concerns involving ischemic and pulmonary events.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome with acute kidney injury is a potentially life-threatening syndrome with diagnostic and treatment challenges. Albumin plus a vasoconstrictor has become the routine HRS-AKI treatment even though there has not been a large RCT evaluating a no-albumin group. Terlipressin is the vasoconstrictor of choice for HRS-AKI in current CPGs, but it has adverse effect concerns and, until recently, was not available in the United States.

Conclusions

In conjunction with changes in the definitions and diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI, debate continues regarding the optimal therapy for HRS-AKI, particularly considering recent trials demonstrating ischemic and pulmonary adverse events with terlipressin used in combination with albumin.

### Hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhosis [^111iTHzc]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a form of kidney dysfunction that characteristically occurs in liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by a marked impairment of kidney function in response to circulatory and hemodynamic alterations that occur in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis, aggravated by systemic inflammation and bacterial translocation. The classical definitions of the types of HRS have been recently revisited and 2 forms of HRS have been redefined: the acute form, referred to as acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), and the chronic form, referred to as chronic kidney disease. HRS-AKI is one of the most severe forms of AKI in patients with cirrhosis and it consists of an abrupt impairment of kidney function, frequently triggered by an infection, appearing in the setting of advanced decompensated cirrhosis. Differential diagnosis with other causes of AKI is crucial because HRS-AKI requires a specific treatment. Differential diagnosis with AKI-acute tubular necrosis may be challenging and kidney biomarkers may be useful in this setting. Treatment of HRS-AKI is based on the administration of vasoconstrictor drugs in combination with volume expansion with albumin. Prognosis of HRS-AKI is poor, and the ideal definitive treatment consists of liver transplantation or simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. HRS-AKI has a big impact on patients' quality of life. Management of HRS-AKI remains challenging in specific situations such as alcohol-associated hepatitis or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease cirrhosis. Developing preventive measures for HRS-AKI, improving its early identification, discovering new biomarkers for differential diagnosis, and improving the response to therapy are some of the unmet needs in the field of HRS-AKI.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is defined as the occurrence of renal dysfunction in a patient with end-stage liver cirrhosis in the absence of another identifiable cause of renal failure. The prognosis of HRS remains poor, with a median survival without liver transplantation of < 6 months. However, understanding the pathogenesis of HRS has led to the introduction of treatments designed to increase renal perfusion and mean arterial blood pressure using vasopressors and albumin, which has led to improvement in renal function in ∼50% of patients.

### New challenge of hepatorenal syndrome: prevention and treatment [^115ZosJU]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) remains one of the major therapeutic challenges in hepatology today. The pathogenesis is complex, but the final common pathway seems to be that sinusoidal portal hypertension, in the presence of severe hepatic decompensation, leads to splanchnic and systemic vasodilatation and decreased effective arterial blood volume. Renal vasoconstriction increases concomitantly, renal hemodynamics worsens, and renal failure occurs. Renal failure was shown 15 years ago to be potentially reversible after liver transplantation. This potential reversibility together with increased understanding of the pathogenesis has led to successful preliminary attempts to reverse HRS nonsurgically with combinations of splanchnic vasoconstrictors and colloid volume expansion, insertion of transjugular intrahepatic portovenous shunt radiologically, and improved forms of dialysis. Recent classification of HRS into the acute onset or severe type 1 with virtually 100% mortality and the more insidious less severe type II promises to shed more light on the pathogenesis of HRS, especially on the currently unrecognized precipitating factors. It is hoped that this classification will be included in the necessary and carefully performed clinical trials, which should lead to clearer indications for the available therapies. The challenge now is to use all this information to improve our management of cirrhotic patients to prevent occurrence of HRS in the future.

### Hepatorenal syndrome [^116azr5U]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a form of kidney function impairment that characteristically occurs in cirrhosis. Recent changes in terminology have led to acute HRS being referred to as acute kidney injury (AKI)-HRS and chronic HRS as chronic kidney disease (CKD)-HRS. AKI-HRS is characterized by a severe impairment of kidney function owing to vasoconstriction of the renal arteries in the absence of substantial abnormalities in kidney histology. Pathogenetic mechanisms involve disturbances in circulatory function due to a marked splanchnic arterial vasodilation, which triggers the activation of vasoconstrictor factors. An intense systemic inflammatory reaction that is characteristic of advanced cirrhosis may also be involved. The main triggering factors of AKI-HRS are bacterial infections, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The diagnosis of AKI-HRS is a challenge because of a lack of specific diagnostic tools and mainly involves the differential diagnosis from other forms of AKI, particularly acute tubular necrosis. The prognosis of patients with AKI-HRS is poor, with a median survival of ≤ 3 months. The ideal treatment for AKI-HRS is liver transplantation in patients without contraindications. Medical therapy consists of vasoconstrictor drugs to counteract splanchnic arterial vasodilation together with volume expansion with albumin. Effective measures to prevent AKI-HRS include early identification and treatment of bacterial infections and the administration of albumin in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Towards goal-directed therapy of hepatorenal syndrome: we have the tools but we need the trials [^111hsk7i]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis who develop tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome have a very high mortality and present a management challenge. Current debate stems from a lack of studies evaluating changes in effective arterial blood volume following paracentesis or targeting fluid replacement with appropriate vascular physiological measures to ensure no paracentesis-related circulatory dysfunction. The study by Umgelter and colleagues addresses a goal-directed approach to fluid management in hepatorenal syndrome and raises several mechanistic questions, the answers to which are likely to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology in hepatorenal syndrome and to guide future management.

Conclusions

HRS is a common entity associated with high morbidity and mortality. For this reason, making an early diagnosis and initiating appropriate therapies (volume expansion, terlipressin plus albumin) is vital. It is equally essential to identify patients who are candidates for LT as well as a combined liver and kidney transplant, which portends a higher probability of clinical success. High-quality prospective clinical trials are needed to define criteria for selecting patients and establishing individualised treatments, aiming to select better candidates who could benefit from renal replacement therapy, LT or CLKT.

### Hepatorenal syndrome: a dreaded complication of end-stage liver disease [^1169xqgF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome is the dreaded complication of end-stage liver disease characterized by functional renal failure due to renal vasoconstriction in the absence of underlying kidney pathology. The pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome is the result of an extreme underfilling of the arterial circulation secondary to an arterial vasodilation located in the splanchnic circulation. This underfilling triggers a compensatory response with activation of vasoconstrictor systems leading to intense renal vasoconstriction. The diagnosis is based on established diagnostic criteria aimed at excluding nonfunctional causes of renal failure. The prognosis of patients with hepatorenal syndrome is extremely poor especially in those who have a rapidly progressive course. Liver transplantation is the best option in suitable candidates, but it is not always applicable due to the short survival expectancy and donor shortage. Pharmacological therapies based on the use of vasoconstrictor drugs (terlipressin, midodrine, octreotide, or noradrenline) are the most promising in the aim of successfully offering a bridge to liver transplantation. Other treatments such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts and albumin dialysis are effective but experience is very limited. Although there is limited information on the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome, intravenous albumin infusion in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and with oral pentoxifylline in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis seems to effectively prevent hepatorenal syndrome in these two settings.

Abstract

Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1) is a severe form of acute kidney injury (AKI) that affects individuals with advanced cirrhosis and ascites. The main pillar of its pathogenesis is rooted on marked maladaptive renal vasoconstriction. Because of the lack of a gold standard, establishing the diagnosis requires a meticulous process of recognizing its phenotypical features and ascertaining the absence of strong evidence of an alternative etiology of AKI. This is particularly important because a diagnosis of AKI due to HRS-1 prompts initiation of a specific vasoconstrictor pharmacotherapy. Terlipressin and norepinephrine are the most effective therapeutic agents for HRS-1. Treatment eligibility and choice of agent should follow a systematic assessment of clinical presentation, drug safety profile, practical and logistical considerations around intensive care unit bed availability and proximity of liver transplantation. Independently of the vasoconstrictor used, the goal of therapy is to target a sustained rise in mean arterial pressure to enable renal perfusion. Although albumin has been historically viewed as a key coadjuvant of vasoconstrictor therapy, newer data have emerged demonstrating that albumin may increase the risk for fluid overload. Conversely, diuretics may be safely introduced when clinically applicable. In this review, we navigate through the common challenges faced during the assessment, diagnosis and medical treatment of a patient with decompensated cirrhosis and AKI suspected to be due to HRS-1, emphasizing the newest lessons learned about the role of terlipressin, its safety profile, and the paradigm shift around the role of albumin in the management in HRS-1.

Definitions of AKI and HRS-AKI

AKI is diagnosed if patients present with an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) > 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) or > 50% from baseline within 48 hours, or the urine output < 0.5 mL/kg > 6 hours, regardless of the aetiology. A value of sCr obtained in the previous 3 months, when available, can be used as baseline sCr. In patients with more than one value within the previous 3 months, the value closest to the admission time to the hospital should be used. AKI can be categorised into three stages based on the increase of sCr from baseline, ranging from 1 to 3 (table 1). The correct staging of AKI is important to optimise cirrhosis management, as stages 2 and 3 have a lower response rate to standard vasopressor treatment, a worse prognosis, and lower transplant-free survival compared with individuals with stage 1 AKI.

Table 1
AKI is staged for severity according to the KDIGO Classification

On the other side, the HRS-AKI diagnosis is made when a patient with cirrhosis, ACLF or ALF, presents with AKI that does not respond to 48 hours of suspension of diuretic treatment and intravascular volume expansion with albumin at a dose of 1 g/kg/day (maximum 100 g per day), and after excluding shock, nephrotoxicity and renal parenchymal disease(figure 1) The changes in the diagnostic criteria of HRS-AKI were developed to perform an early diagnosis and timely treatment. This is particularly important considering that even the early stages of AKI (stage 1A) have been independently associated with mortality in patients with cirrhosis.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^111baJkK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a serious form of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. It is an important component of the acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) syndrome. Significant recent changes in the understanding of the pathophysiology of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis include the role of inflammation in addition to hemodynamic changes. The term acute kidney injury (AKI) is now adopted to include all functional and structural forms of acute renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, with various stages describing the severity of the condition. Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS1) is renamed HRS-AKI, which is stage 2 AKI [doubling of baseline serum creatinine (sCr)] while fulfilling all other criteria of HRS1. Albumin is used for its volume expanding and anti-inflammatory properties to confirm the diagnosis of HRS-AKI. Vasoconstrictors are added to albumin as pharmacotherapy to improve the hemodynamics. Terlipressin, although not yet available in North America, is the most common vasoconstrictor used worldwide. Patients with high grade of ACLF treated with terlipressin are at risk for respiratory failure if there is pretreatment respiratory compromise. Norepinephrine is equally effective as terlipressin in reversing HRS1. Recent data show that norepinephrine may be administered outside the intensive care setting, but close monitoring is still required. There has been no improvement in overall or transplant-free survival shown with vasoconstrictor use, but response to vasoconstrictors with reduction in sCr is associated with improvement in survival. Non-responders to vasoconstrictor plus albumin will need liver transplantation as definite treatment with renal replacement therapy as a bridge therapy. Combined liver and kidney transplantation is recommended for patients with prolonged history of AKI, underlying chronic kidney disease or with hereditary renal conditions. Future developments, such as the use of biomarkers and metabolomics, may help to identify at risk patients with earlier diagnosis to allow for earlier treatment with improved outcomes.

Conclusions

Since first defined in 1996 by the IAC, there has been substantial progress towards understanding the pathogenesis and natural history of HRS. However, there remains a significant deficiency in our knowledge regarding its management. The IAC has set out clear diagnostic criteria for both acute and chronic forms of HRS, but has not delineated guidelines for the diagnosis of other forms of renal impairment in cirrhosis, be they acute or chronic. Well-accepted definitions and staging systems for CKD and AKI exist, but have not been consistently applied to patients with advanced liver disease. Indeed, it must be understood that although our recommendations are based, to the best extent possible, on data, there are insufficient data to guide many important decisions. In addition, although our Work Group included a wide range of specialists from around the world, we do recognize that there exists regional heterogeneity in practice. As a result, our findings should be considered a 'first step' in the process of standardization of the definition of AKI in patients with cirrhosis. Once agreed, these new diagnostic criteria of AKI for cirrhosis will need to be validated and the threshold for the diagnosis of type-1 HRS may need to be revised to a lower target value to allow patients with a lesser degree of S Cr rise to receive prompt appropriate treatment. In addition, criteria for SLK may need to be revisited in lieu of the new classification and to determine whether the new classification and definition will improve patient outcomes. One clear conclusion of this ADQI meeting is that multicenter, prospective, long-term outcome studies in patients with advanced cirrhosis and HRS are urgently needed.

Introduction

In the natural history of chronic liver disease, patients with portal hypertension are at higher risk of developing kidney dysfunction. In particular, acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly observed in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), and acute liver failure (ALF), reaching an incidence between 20% and 53% in hospitalised patients. AKI in patients with underlying chronic liver disease is usually progressive and severe, with worsening AKI stage being independently associated with higher mortality. Up to 25% of patients with cirrhosis who survive an AKI episode will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). Several phenotypes are identified in patients with cirrhosis and AKI, including prerenal, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI) and postrenal kidney injury. Prompt recognition of AKI and diagnosis of underlying aetiology are essential to carry out an early, appropriate and effective treatment.

In particular, HRS-AKI is a functional and progressive kidney failure that is potentially reversible but most often rapidly fatal. HRS-AKI accounts for 11%–20% of all AKI episodes in patients with cirrhosis, and its diagnosis is often challenging to differentiate from prerenal or ATN. In addition, around 40% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS-AKI within a 5-year period. Early recognition of HRS allows for the use of standard pharmacological treatment with terlipressin plus albumin, restoring kidney function in only 40%–50% of patients. Within this group of patients, clinical decisions are complex, and evidence of the benefits of different therapies is scarce.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in these 'advanced' therapies for the management of HRS-AKI. On one hand, it is crucial to define the timing, duration and modality of renal replacement therapies. On the other hand, determining the timing and type of transplant needed for each patient's profile presents a major challenge. Despite the existence of some guidelines, there is no absolute consensus on when to consider combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) or sequential liver-kidney transplantation (SLKT). The timing of when to consider palliative care is also an evolving topic. Therefore, this review aims to provide an updated assessment of the diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of HRS-AKI, with a particular focus on the benefits and drawbacks of renal replacement therapy (RRT), liver transplantation (LT), CLKT and SLKT.

Management of acute kidney injury (AKI) — once AKI is diagnosed, it should be treated as soon as possible, and if the patient has concomitant complications such as severe hepatic encephalopathy or multiorgan failure or requires RRT, management in an intensive or intermediate care unit should be considered. Patients should be monitored closely for worsening of kidney function and emergence of further complications, particularly bacterial infections.

### Diagnosis, treatment and survival of patients with hepatorenal syndrome: a survey on daily medical practice [^113f31A9]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a severe complication of cirrhosis with ascites. The International Ascites Club recommended strict diagnostic criteria and treatment with vasoconstrictors and albumin. Aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the prevalence of HRS, diagnostic criteria, treatment and 3-month outcome in the daily-clinical-practice.

Methods

Two-hundred-fifty-three patients with cirrhosis and renal failure consecutively admitted to 21 Italian hospitals were recruited.

Results

The prevalence of HRS was 45.8% (30% type-1 and 15.8% type-2). In 36% of cases HRS was presumed because not all diagnostic criteria could be fulfilled. In 8% of cases HRS was superimposed on an organic nephropathy. Patients with HRS type-1 were younger and showed higher leukocyte count, higher respiratory rates, and worse liver function scores. Sixty-four patients with HRS type-1 received vasoconstrictors (40 terlipressin and 24 midodrine/octreotide). A complete response was obtained in 19 cases (30%) and a partial response in 13 (20%). Age was the only independent predictor of response (p = 0.033). Three-month survival of patients with HRS type-1 was 19.7%. Survival was better in patients who responded to therapy. Age (p = 0.017), bilirubin (p = 0.012), and creatinine increase after diagnostic volume expansion (p = 0.02) independently predicted death. The mortality rate was 97% among patients with at least two negative predictors.

Conclusions

The diagnostic criteria of HRS in our daily-clinical-practice could not be completely fulfilled in one third of cases. The treatment with vasoconstrictors and albumin was widely implemented. Mortality was strongly predicted by simple baseline variables.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) — definition and epidemiology: AKI is common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites, with a prevalence in hospitalized patients that ranges between 27% and 53%, and the development of AKI entails a poor prognosis with 30-day mortality ranging from 29% to 44%; AKI is an independent negative predictor of transplant-free survival and post–LT outcomes. HRS-AKI is described as a type of AKI unique to patients with cirrhosis that occurs in the absence of hypovolemia or significant abnormalities in kidney histology. Chronic impairment in kidney function (CKD) is defined as a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate to < 60 mL/1.73 m2 per minute for at least 3 months.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^113UjyL2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal dysfunction is the most common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites, occurring in 20–49% of patients. – For a long time, renal dysfunction in cirrhosis was synonymous with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS1), a condition associated with a fatal outcome in days to weeks if left untreated. After defining the diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in 1996, there followed treatment guidelines for the condition. Further understanding of the pathophysiology of HRS led to refinement of diagnostic criteria for HRS in 2007. However, it soon became clear that the threshold of serum creatinine (sCr) set for the diagnosis of HRS represented very advanced renal failure; therefore, treatment beginning at such a late stage of renal impairment was compromising the chance for renal recovery. Therefore, there was a need to change the diagnostic criteria for HRS. The term acute kidney injury (AKI) was borrowed from the nephrology and intensive care communities of specialists, who describe renal dysfunction by a dynamic change rather than by a fixed threshold in the sCr (Table 1), as these small dynamic changes in sCr have been associated with negative outcomes in other patient populations. AKI in cirrhosis was finally defined in 2015, and HRS1 became a special sub-category of AKI, and renamed as HRS-AKI. These new diagnostic criteria will allow for prompt diagnosis and early initiation of treatment.

Table 1.
Diagnostic criteria of AKI in cirrhosis.

There are several phenotypes of AKI and may include functional and structural etiologies. Functional AKI is related to functional changes in the kidneys or renal circulation; and in cirrhosis, is usually related to hemodynamic abnormalities affecting the kidneys as a result of advanced cirrhosis. Functional AKI can include volume responsive prerenal azotemia or HRS-AKI. In contrast, structural causes of AKI involve structural injury to the kidneys such as glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis or tubular damage. A common prototype would be acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Overall incidence of ATN (15–60%) and prerenal azotemia (15–45%) in cirrhosis are more common than HRS, which affects 10–40% of patients.HRS is the subset of AKI that does not respond to volume resuscitation alone and is considered one of the dreaded complications of cirrhosis with median survival without treatment in days to weeks. Recent advances in the understanding and management of the HRS, combined with diagnosis of renal dysfunction at an earlier stage of its natural history, have made treatment more effective. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the management of HRS.

The following constitutes key background information on hepatorenal syndrome:

- **Definition**: HRS is a severe complication of advanced liver disease, characterized by progressive renal failure in response to circulatory and hemodynamic alterations.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of HRS involves intense renal vasoconstriction, systemic and splanchnic arterial vasodilation, and reduced cardiac output, leading to renal dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of HRS-AKI in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites is about 11%.
- **Risk factors**: HRS develops in patients with advanced liver disease, with risk factors including advanced liver cirrhosis with ascites, marked circulatory dysfunction, portal hypertension, SBP, severe alcoholic hepatitis, and specific triggers such as bacterial infections, nephrotoxic drugs, fluid loss, and large-volume paracentesis.
- Disease course: HRS is classified into two types: type 1 HRS is characterized by a rapid and progressive impairment in renal function, while type 2 HRS is characterized by a stable or less progressive impairment in renal function. The decline in renal function seen in HRS is consistent with AKI.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of HRS is extremely poor, especially for those with a rapidly progressive course. The median survival of patients with HRS without liver transplantation is < 6 months.

### News in pathophysiology, definition and classification of hepatorenal syndrome: a step beyond the international club of ascites (ICA) consensus document [^11462Zvo]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal dysfunction is a common, life-threatening complication occurring in patients with liver disease. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has been defined as a purely "functional" type of renal failure that often occurs in patients with cirrhosis in the setting of marked abnormalities in arterial circulation, as well as overactivity of the endogenous vasoactive systems. 4,5 In 2007, the International Club of Ascites (ICA) classified HRS into types 1 and 2 (HRS-1 and HRS-2). 5 HRS-1 is characterised by a rapid deterioration of renal function that often occurs because of a precipitating event, while HRS-2 is a moderate and stable or slowly progressive renal dysfunction that often occurs without an obvious precipitant. Clinically, HRS-1 is characterised by acute renal failure while HRS-2 is mainly characterised by refractory ascites. Nevertheless, after these two entities were first described, new concepts, definitions, and diagnostic criteria have been developed by nephrologists for renal dysfunction in the general population and hospitalised patients. In particular, the definitions and characterisation of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease have been introduced/refined. 6 Accordingly, a debate among hepatologists of the ICA led to a complete revision of the nomenclature and diagnosistic criteria for HRS-1, which was renamed HRS-AKI. 7 Additionally, over recent years, greater granularity has been gained regarding the pathogenesis of HRS; it is now increasingly recognised that it is not a purely "functional" entity with haemodynamic derangements, but that systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and bile salt-related tubular damage may contribute significantly to its development. That is, HRS has an additional structural component that would not only make traditional diagnostic criteria less reliable, but would explain the lack of response to pharmacological treatment with vasoconstrictors plus albumin that correlates with a progressive increase in inflammation. Because classification, nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and pathogenic theories have evolved over the years since the traditional classification of HRS-1 and HRS-2 was first described, it was considered that all these novel aspects be reviewed and summarised in a position paper. The aim of this position paper authored by two hepatologists (members of ICA) and two nephrologists involved in the study of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, is to complete the re-classification of HRS initiated by the ICA in 2012 and to provide an update on the definition, classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of HRS.

The Work Group accepted the definition of CKD, as set out by the practice guidelines from the K/DOQI Work Group, of an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 calculated using the MDRD-6 formula for more than three months for patients with cirrhosis (Table 5). Patients with type-2 HRS who meet these criteria should be considered as having CKD.

### Terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome [^113jdTar]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The definition and diagnostic criteria of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) has undergone recent changes. A major vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, has recently been approved as pharmacotherapy for HRS-AKI in the United States. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the readers with these new diagnostic criteria of HRS-AKI, and how best to use terlipressin.

Recent Findings

Terlipressin is effective either as bolus dosing or continuous infusion and can achieve reversal of HRS-AKI in approximately 40% of patients. Continuous infusion allows lower daily dose with equal efficacy and less side effects but not an approved mode of administration in the United States. Response to terlipressin in the randomized controlled trials was defined as repeat reduction of serum creatinine to less than 1.5mg/dl. Newer studies will likely require response to treatment to be defined as a repeat serum creatinine to be less than 0.3mg/dl from baseline. Terlipressin use is associated with ischemic side effects and potential for respiratory failure development.

Summary

Careful patient selection and close monitoring are necessary for its use. Response to terlipressin with HRS-AKI reversal is associated with improved outcomes with better survival and less requirement for renal replacement therapy.

### A new multisystem ERCC1-hepatorenal syndrome: insights from a clinical cohort, molecular pathogenesis, and management guidelines [^113Ujg8e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

This study provides a detailed characterization of the ERCC1 -hepatorenal syndrome phenotype. The progressive, multisystem nature of the condition highlights the importance of early and accurate molecular diagnosis to enable timely monitoring and treatment of organ involvement. UV protection is recommended due to photosensitivity and the underlying DNA repair defect. Regular liver function monitoring and imaging are essential. Only two individuals in our cohort are alive without liver transplantation: CA16LD, aged three, currently being assessed for liver transplant; and XE1AH, aged 17, with progressive cirrhotic liver disease. Based on clinical observations, we propose management guidelines for newly diagnosed individuals (Table 2). Given the rarity of pediatric HCC, surveillance strategies are adapted from adult protocols. We recommend ultrasound and AFP monitoring every three to six months, which are accessible and do not require sedation. Annual MRI is advised from diagnosis, with earlier imaging if ultrasound findings, AFP elevation, or cirrhosis are present. CEUS may also aid lesion characterization without radiation exposure. Further data are needed to refine surveillance intervals and assess HCC risk. If HCC is diagnosed, treatment options include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and systemic therapies such as chemotherapy or targeted agents like sorafenib. Complete resection or transplantation remains the primary determinant of survival. Systemic therapies may be used pre- or post-operatively, but outcomes for unresectable or metastatic HCC remain poor. The role of systemic therapy in children with resectable disease is still evolving. In ERCC1 -hepatorenal syndrome, chemotherapy must be used cautiously due to increased toxicity from DNA repair defects. Platinum-based agents like cisplatin pose particular risks. Given the high risk of decompensation and frequent liver involvement, early consideration of liver transplantation is warranted. In our cohort, all transplanted individuals survived up to nine years post-transplant.

Table 2
Clinical care guidelines for individuals with ERCC1 -hepatorenal syndrome (Unless specified, all surveillance recommendations are suggested from the time of diagnosis).

In conclusion, we describe a cohort with ERCC1 -hepatorenal syndrome, characterized by progressive cholestatic liver disease, early-onset HCC, renal impairment, photosensitivity, and growth restriction. We provide clinical management recommendations and emphasize the need for caution with chemotherapy. Ongoing follow-up is essential to better understand the long-term course and optimize care for affected individuals.

Treatments in HRS-AKI

General management

Early recognition of HRS-AKI is essential for establishing effective treatment plans and achieving better clinical outcomes. Intravascular volume expansion to ensure that hypovolaemia is managed adequately, withdrawing nephrotoxic drugs (ie, diuretics, anti-inflammatory drugs, ACE inhibitors, or β-blockers) together with ruling out obstructive uropathy are essential diagnostic steps. Concurrently, potential precipitating factors that could trigger HRS-AKI must be sought and treated early to not perpetuate SIRS and the various underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of HRS-AKI.

Intravascular volume expansion

The judicious expansion of intravascular volume with albumin is a critical point that requires close, dynamic evaluation to prevent complications of overexpansion in critically ill patients. In patients with HRS-AKI, it is essential to correct the haemodynamic alterations in the splanchnic, peripheral and renal vessels and restore the effective circulating volume. Albumin infusion seeks to rule out prerenal azotemia and achieve early expansion of plasma volume, considering the reduction of EABV in these patients. For this reason, management of HRS-AKI begins with a fluid challenge of 20%–25% intravenous albumin at 1 g/kg/day for 2 days (not to exceed 100 g/day), followed by an infusion of 20–40 g/day (depending on the patient's haemodynamic conditions). Diuretics should also be withheld initially, and non-selective β-blockers temporarily discontinued given their negative inotropic effect that reduces cardiac output.

### Hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in liver transplantation [^1174iq1a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a serious complication of cirrhosis. HRS nomenclature has recently changed to HRS-AKI (acute kidney injury). HRS is a complex response to chronic vasodilatory changes brought about by portal hypertension and exacerbated by inflammatory responses that portends poor prognosis to patients with cirrhosis. This syndrome is commonly seen in the setting of infections, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Because of the frequency of renal injury in the patient with cirrhosis, HRS-AKI has to be considered high in the differential diagnosis of AKI. Discontinuation of potential triggering agents and elimination of pre-renal AKI, intrinsic renal disease, and structural uropathy as causes of injury are imperative on presentation. Volume expansion with albumin and vasoconstrictive drugs to counteract the underlying splanchnic vasodilation constitutes the most effective medical modality to manage this process. Although the most effective therapy is generally considered to be liver transplantation (LT), the logistic barriers of offering this life-saving therapy on time to all needing it is a major limitation. Terlipressin has been shown to reverse HRS-AKI in a significant proportion of those treated and consequently can lead to increased LT patient survival and freedom from renal replacement therapy. We will review the impact of HRS on the management of patients awaiting LT, present strategies to prevent this significant complication, and discuss major implications of recent therapeutic advances in the setting of LT.

### Hepatorenal syndrome: a severe, but treatable, cause of kidney failure in cirrhosis [^115j5ef3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a unique type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced cirrhosis. It is characterized by functional impairment of the kidneys due to vasoconstriction of the renal arteries in the setting of preserved tubular function and absence of significant histologic abnormalities. Renal vasoconstriction in HRS is due to severe vasodilation of the splanchnic arteries associated with portal hypertension, leading to a decrease in effective arterial blood volume and arterial pressure. HRS commonly develops after a trigger, usually a bacterial infection, that disrupts the arterial circulation, but it also may occur spontaneously. There are 2 forms of HRS: type 1 is characterized by an acute progressive decrease in kidney function and very short survival without treatment, whereas type 2 features stable less severe kidney failure and longer survival compared with type 1. A liver transplant is the preferred treatment for HRS. Pharmacologic treatment with vasoconstrictors to reverse splanchnic vasodilation, together with albumin, is effective in 40%-50% of patients with type 1 HRS and improves survival. The drug of choice is the vasopressin analogue terlipressin. Renal replacement therapy should not be used as first-line therapy.

Pathogenesis of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) — key mechanisms: The guidance highlights that "pathogenetic events of importance are renal sodium retention, arterial underfilling, and portal hypertension, which may be mitigated by diuretics, albumin infusion, and portal decompressive procedures, respectively". It notes, "HRS is a functional renal failure resulting from hemodynamic changes occurring in patients with ascites and portal hypertension", with "the primary pathophysiologic mechanism of HRS" described as reduced renal perfusion mediated by "increased activities of the sympathetic, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and vasopressin systems", and potentially aggravated by "decreased cardiac output in patients with cirrhosis-associated cardiomyopathy". Additional contributors include that "systemic inflammation that is common among patients with decompensated cirrhosis may trigger immune-mediated renal injury", and that impaired renal autoregulation predisposes to "additional direct hemodynamic renal injury", with the statement that "structural kidney damage can follow severe and/or repeated episodes of such renal events".

Objectives

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a common and life-threatening entity that is associated with advanced liver disease. There are limited data on predisposing or precipitating factors related to the development of this syndrome. The aims of this study were: 1) to determine the accuracy of the diagnosis of HRS in an urban tertiary care center; 2) to compare features of HRS with those of non-HRS renal failure; and 3) to document the precipitating factors for HRS in this setting.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 46 patients at the Health Sciences Center in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who were diagnosed with HRS within the last 10 yr. In addition to assessing the accuracy of the diagnosis of HRS (as defined by the International Ascites Club), we also developed a database that included clinical and biochemical features of these patients' liver disease, possible predisposing factors, precipitating events, etiology of cirrhosis, and mortality rates. A cohort of 19 patients with advanced liver disease and renal failure not ascribed to HRS (non-HRS) served as controls.

Results

A total of 46 patients were labeled as having HRS during their hospital stay, of whom 27 (59%) fulfilled International Ascites Club criteria. Their mean age was 51.8 ± 12.1 yr, and 67% were male. Demographic and biochemical findings in the HRS patients were similar to those of the non-HRS patients. Hepatic encephalopathy (p < 0.03) and jaundice (p < 0.01) more commonly preceeded renal failure in the HRS group than in the controls. The most common predisposing factor for HRS was alcohol abuse. Precipitating factors for HRS included infection in 48% patients, GI bleeding in 33%, and over paracentesis in 27%. Drug-induced renal disease was significantly more common in patients with non-HRS renal failure. Contrary to previous reports, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not common precipitating factors of HRS. Alcohol-related liver disease was the most common underlying etiology of liver disease in all patients who developed renal failure but was proportionally higher in the HRS group. Mortality was almost universal in both groups, regardless of the cause of renal failure.

Conclusions

The diagnostic accuracy (or lack thereof) of HRS highlights the importance of ensuring that diagnostic criteria are met in studies describing the natural history and/or the results of therapeutic intervention in HRS. Alcohol abuse is a common predisposing factor for the development of HRS. Infection, GI bleed, and aggressive paracentesis were the most common precipitating factors for HRS.

### New developments in hepatorenal syndrome [^116SdCgz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) continues to be one of the major complications of decompensated cirrhosis, leading to death in the absence of liver transplantation. Challenges in precisely evaluating renal function in the patient with cirrhosis remain because of the limitations of serum creatinine (Cr) alone in estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR); current GFR estimating models appear to underestimate renal dysfunction. Newer models incorporating renal biomarkers, such as the Cr-Cystatin C GFR Equation for Cirrhosis appear to estimate measured GFR more accurately. A major change in the diagnostic criteria for HRS based on dynamic serial changes in serum Cr that regard HRS type 1 as a special form of acute kidney injury promises the possibility of earlier identification of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis. The diagnostic criteria of HRS still include the exclusion of other causes of kidney injury. Renal biomarkers have been disappointing in assisting with the differentiation of HRS from prerenal azotemia and other kidney disorders. Serum metabolomic profiling may be a more powerful tool to assess renal dysfunction, although the practical clinical significance of this remains unclear. As a result of the difficulties of assessing renal function in cirrhosis and the varying HRS diagnostic criteria and the rigor with which they are applied, the precise incidence and prevalence of HRS is unknown, but it is likely that HRS occurs more commonly than expected. The pathophysiology of HRS is rooted firmly in the setting of progressive reduction in renal blood flow as a result of portal hypertension and splanchnic vasodilation. Progressive marked renal cortical ischemia in patients with cirrhosis parallels the evolution of diuretic-sensitive ascites to diuretic-refractory ascites and HRS, a recognized continuum of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis. Alterations in nitrous oxide production, both increased and decreased, may play a major role in the pathophysiology of this evolution. The inflammatory cascade, triggered by bacterial translocation and endotoxemia, increasingly recognized as important in the manifestation of acute-on-chronic liver failure, also may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of HRS. The mainstay of treatment remains vasopressor therapy with albumin in an attempt to reverse splanchnic vasodilation and improve renal blood flow. Several meta-analyses have confirmed the value of vasopressors, chiefly terlipressin and noradrenaline, in improving renal function and reversing HRS type 1. Other interventions such as renal replacement therapy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and artificial liver support systems have a very limited role in improving outcomes in HRS. Liver transplantation remains the definitive treatment for HRS. The frequency of simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation has increased dramatically in the Model for End-stage Liver Disease era, with changes in organ allocation policies. This has resulted in a more urgent need to predict native kidney recovery from HRS after liver transplantation alone, to avoid unnecessary simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

Introduction

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of acute kidney dysfunction in patients with advanced liver disease. Recent changes in the definition of HRS have caused it to be known in two ways: acute with acute kidney injury (AKI)-HRSand chronic with chronic kidney disease-HRS. AKI-HRS is characterised by a severe kidney function impairment due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries in the absence of significant abnormalities in kidney tissue. There are two types of HRS with different characteristics and prognoses. HRS type 1 is characterised by the sudden onset of acute kidney failure and the rapid deterioration of the function of other organs. HRS type 2 has slow and progressive deterioration of renal function due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension and is associated with refractory ascites.

Pathogenetic mechanisms include circulatory dysfunction due to dilation of splanchnic arterial vessels, which activates vasoconstrictor factors. A severe systemic inflammatory reaction is one of the main triggers of AKI-HRS.

The only definitive treatment for HRS is a liver transplant. There are controversial results about the administration of different pharmacological therapeutic regimens have been used, including octreotide/midodrine as traditional treatment, norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin and vasopressin analogues (ornipressin, terlipressin, etc). Administration of intravenous albumin is an established coadjuvant therapy.

This systematic review assesses the current treatment for HRS and discusses the challenges in deciding the most appropriate medication regimens. We have also evaluated the effect of different treatments on the follow-up of HRS patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^111Lo3Kz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in cirrhosis — features and classification are summarized as follows: "AKI in patients with cirrhosis may be due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), or acute tubular necrosis (ATN)", and HRS "is characterized by a marked reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to intense renal arteriolar vasoconstriction", with contributors including "Systemic inflammation, adrenal dysfunction, intra-abdominal hypertension, and the hepatorenal reflex". Typical urinalysis and imaging in HRS are described: "Hematuria and proteinuria are absent, urine sediment is usually normal, and the kidney appears normal on ultrasonography in HRS". Clinical course may improve, as "Renal function may return to normal with the administration of pharmacological therapy or following liver transplantation (LT)", although "Even though absence of renal damage is a criterion for diagnosis of HRS, tubular injury may be present on kidney biopsy". Two forms are delineated: "2 forms of HRS are recognized: HRS-AKI, which represents acute impairment in renal function, and HRS–non-AKI, when patients with cirrhosis have functional kidney injury for > 7 days in the absence of other causes of kidney disease".

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — proposed diagnostic and management algorithm begins when there is an "Acute rise in creatinine by ≥ 0.3mg/dL", followed by "Clinical assessment including urinary sediment and biomarkers" and determining if a "Specific diagnosis" is identified; urinary markers guide etiology, as "Urinary sediments and biomarkers (particularly NGAL) may indicate ATN, whereas fractional excretion of sodium < 1% may suggest HRS". If no specific diagnosis is made, the branch evaluates "Creatinine doubled from baseline?"; management emphasizes risk factor correction, and if there is "No resolution in 1–2 days" or a "further rise in serum creatinine", proceed to albumin challenge: "Risk factor management, if applicable Give albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". After albumin, assess "Meets the criteria for HRS"; if yes, determine "Vasoconstrictor therapy candidate?" and administer vasoconstrictor therapy if appropriate, while if no, use "Individualized nephrology care". Risk factor management includes "the withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, reduction or withdrawal of diuretics, detection, and treatment of infections, if present, and volume replacement (if severely volume-depleted) using 5% albumin or crystalloids, preferentially balanced, initially".

1. Classify AKI in the setting of cirrhosis according to RIFLE criteria (Not Graded)

Rationale: In 1996, the International Ascites Club (IAC) proposed a definition and diagnostic criteria for HRS which was later revised in 2007 (Table 3). However, the rigid cut off value of S Cr of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL has limited prompt management of patients with milder renal dysfunction. In 2004, the ADQI Workgroup developed a consensus definition and classification for AKI known as the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage) criteria which stratified acute renal dysfunction into grades of increasing severity based on changes in S Cr and/or urine output. Subsequently it was recognized that even smaller increases in S Cr (absolute increase in S Cr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL) are associated with adverse outcome. As a result, the criteria was modified in 2007 to broaden the definition of AKI (Table 4).

Table 3
International Ascites Club (IAC) definition and diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome

Table 4
The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) criteria for the definition and classification of acute kidney injury (modified RIFLE criteria)

Scr = serum creatinine

In critically ill patients with cirrhosis, AKI defined by RIFLE criteria has been shown to be a predictor of hospital survival. The final consensus of the workgroup was to apply the RIFLE criteria to define AKI in patients with cirrhosis irrespective of whether the cause of the acute deterioration in renal function was related to a functional or structural disorder (Table 5). This will certainly identify many patients with AKI with normal S Cr but low GFR and allow us to extend treatment to patients at a lesser level of severity. In addition, the overall consensus was to also propose that the term hepatorenal disorders (HRD) be used to describe all patients with advanced cirrhosis and concurrent kidney dysfunction (Figure 1). HRD is thus defined as any form of kidney disease occurring in patients with cirrhosis, be it functional or structural in nature. Such a definition will allow cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction to be properly classified, thereby allowing appropriate studies to be conducted to define their prognosis and to devise treatment options.

AKI often occurs as a part of multi-organ failure scenario in the syndrome known as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which is characterized by one or more extrahepatic organ failures and associated with high short-term mortality. Renal failure is considered one of the important extrahepatic organ failures that defines mortality. The presence of other organ failures may also enhance the inflammatory milieu, which can significantly worsen renal function, analogous to inflammation worsening the severity of liver dysfunction.

Pathogenesis of ascites and related complications in cirrhosis is characterized by effective arterial underfilling from splanchnic vasodilation that leads to activation of vasoconstrictor and antidiuretic factors, and portal hypertension that increases sinusoidal hydrostatic pressure and gut permeability allowing bacterial translocation, contributing to complications including hyponatremia, AKI, HRS, and spontaneous bacterial infections.

### Acute kidney injury in acute-on-chronic liver failure: where does hepatorenal syndrome fit? [^113TBpmz]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction occurs in 25% to 50% of patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital with an acute episode of hepatic decompensation and may be due to underlying chronic kidney disease, an acute deterioration, or both. An acute deterioration in renal function in cirrhotic patients is now collectively referred to as acute kidney injury (AKI), which has been subclassified into different grades of severity that identify prognostic groups. Acute-on-chronic liver failure is characterized by acute hepatic and/or extrahepatic organ failure driven by a dysregulated immune response and systemic inflammatory response. AKI is also one of the defining features of ACLF and a major component in grading the severity of acute-on-chronic liver failure. As such, the pattern of AKI now observed in patients admitted to the hospital with acutely decompensated liver disease is likely to be one of inflammatory kidney injury including acute tubular injury (referred in this review as non-hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]-AKI) rather than HRS. As the management and supportive treatment of non-HRS-AKI potentially differ from those of HRS, then from the nephrology perspective, it is important to distinguish between non-HRS-AKI and HRS-AKI when reviewing patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and AKI, so that appropriate and early management can be instituted.

Conclusion

HRS-AKI is a form of AKI in cirrhosis. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. Recent changes in diagnostic criteria means that HRS-AKI can now be diagnosed at a lower level of sCr, thereby allowing earlier institution of treatment. Vasoconstrictors are the mainstay of treatment with terlipressin being the most commonly used worldwide, but terlipressin is not yet available in most parts of North America. Vasoconstrictors are usually given in conjunction with albumin, but care needs to be taken not to overdose patients with albumin. This is because albumin increases the cardiac preload by improving the volume status of the patients, whereas vasoconstrictors by increasing the afterload may cause cardiac failure with pulmonary edema in these patients. Timely assessment for liver transplant is necessary, as these patients still have a high mortality rate despite response to pharmacotherapy because of their advanced liver dysfunction. RRT may be used as a bridging therapy, but patients should not be maintained on long-term RRT while waiting for a liver transplant, as this has a negative impact on post-transplant patient outcomes including non-reversal of HRS. Combined liver kidney transplant should be considered for patients with underlying CKD or with prolonged pre-transplant RRT. The future will see the availability of new techniques and biomarkers to identify the susceptibility for HRS development, progression of HRS, and response to treatment. This will allow for personalized targeted treatment to improve patient outcomes.

### Renohepatic crosstalk: does acute kidney injury cause liver dysfunction? [^115N9VyA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The concept of hepatorenal syndrome is well recognized, although incompletely understood. The converse clinical problem of hepatic dysfunction in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is less well recognized yet may be a contributor to the high patient morbidity and mortality seen in this group. This review draws together the available evidence for AKI's effect on the liver from animal models, pharmacological studies and recent clinical data. It examines liver function beyond clinically used blood tests, to determine the effect of AKI on hepatic synthetic function, acute phase response and drug metabolism. Parallels are drawn with other organ crosstalk in AKI and with liver-kidney interactions in chronic kidney disease. Definition of the pathophysiology of renohepatic crosstalk may lead to improved management strategies for this vulnerable patient group.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — diagnosis, baseline determination, and etiological factors: AKI is diagnosed by an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine that is known or presumed to have occurred within the preceding 7 days; by convention, stable creatinine values within the previous 3 months before hospitalization can be used as the baseline in the diagnosis of AKI, and if a previous creatinine before admission is not available, a formal diagnosis of AKI can only be made if creatinine continues to rise during hospitalization. Main etiologies for AKI in cirrhosis are prerenal AKI and acute tubular necrosis (ATN); the two main causes of prerenal AKI are hypovolemia and HRS-AKI, and ATN is usually due to septic or hypovolemic shock and, less commonly, nephrotoxic drugs/agents.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites can develop a specific form of renal dysfunction, which is termed hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Traditionally HRS was thought to be due to the altered haemodynamic alterations with hyperdynamic circulation as well as overactive endogenous vasoactive system which results in renal hypoperfusion. It is now recognised that systemic inflammation also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of HRS.

The traditional classification of HRS-1 and HRS-2 has recently been revised by the International Club of Ascites.HRS-1, which reflects a rapid reduction in renal function, has been proposed to be changed to HRS-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI). The new definition of HRS-AKI includes an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (27 µmol/L) within 48 hours or ≥ 50% from baseline, without necessitating a final cut-off value of 1.5 mg/dL (133 µmol/L). This allows treatment to be started earlier. HRS-2, which represents renal dysfunction that does not progress rapidly, has been proposed to be changed to HRS-NAKI (non-AKI).

The mainstay of treatment of HRS-AKI involves HAS and vasoconstrictors, particularly terlipressin. Combination of terlipressin and HAS has been shown in RCTs to significantly improve renal function in HRS-AKI and improve short-term mortality (online supplemental table 12). Higher baseline serum creatinine is an independent predictor of failure to respond to vasoconstrictor treatment. A full review of HRS is beyond the scope of this guideline.

Future directions

Early diagnosis of HRS-AKI to initiate vasoconstrictor therapy is crucial in the management of HRS-AKI. Existing tools, such as urinalysis and fractional excretion of sodium, have significant limitation in differentiating the different phenotypes like prerenal, HRS-AKI, and structural kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling may be the new tool to identify biomarkers of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, allowing early diagnosis of HRS, prediction of response to HRS treatment, and native kidney recovery after liver transplantation, all important in the decision-making regarding the need for SLKT. The future should also see further developments in the prediction models of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and HRS-AKI, so to improve our management of these patients.

3. Acute on CKD in cirrhosis is defined as a rise in S Cr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL in less than 48 hours or an increase in S Cr ≥ 50% from baseline, or in a patient with cirrhosis whose baseline GFR has been < 60 ml/min calculated with the MDRD-6 formula for more than three months (Not Graded)

Rationale: It is important to recognize that AKI may also occur in patients with preexisting HRD. The group recognizes that acute on CKD does occur in cirrhosis and has defined it using the RIFLE criteria for AKI and K/DOQI guidelines for CKD (Table 5).

Recommendations for future research:

- **Multicenter, prospective, epidemiologic (observational) studies to**:

- Investigate the incidence, prevalence, basic demographics and outcomes of patients with HRD

- Validate new diagnostic criteria of AKI, CKD and acute on CKD for the cirrhotic population

- Determine whether the development of type-1 HRS in a patient with pre-existing type-2 HRS is the same as patients with pre-existing CKD

- Investigate the use of biomarkers to differentiate between type-1 HRS and other forms of AKI in patients with cirrhosis.

Treatment of HRS-AKI — vasoconstrictors (terlipressin or norepinephrine) plus albumin improve renal function with a response rate of 20%-80% (average ~50%); vasoconstrictors are maintained until creatinine returns to baseline values up to 14 days, sometimes longer than 14 days, and may be discontinued if creatinine remains at or above pretreatment level over 4 days at maximum tolerated doses; some patients may need prolonged infusions to prevent early recurrence after discontinuation.

Preventing progression to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) — the first principle is the treatment or prevention of possible precipitating factors, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and bacterial infections, and avoiding LVP without albumin administration. For example, IV albumin, together with antibiotics, reduces the incidence of HRS-AKI and improves survival in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), whereas albumin in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections other than SBP neither prevents HRS-AKI nor improves survival.

Defining Hepatorenal Syndrome

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)–acute kidney injury (AKI), a dire consequence of end‐stage liver disease, is a functional, progressive kidney failure that is potentially reversible but most often rapidly fatal. HRS‐AKI is observed in hepatic failure of any cause, but most often occurs in the setting of advanced cirrhosis. In advanced cirrhosis, portal hypertension reduces portal blood flow, which results in the release of vasodilators and blood pooling in the splanchnic circulation. This causes activation of both the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system. The intense renal vasoconstriction with predominant peripheral arterial vasodilation (mainly in the splanchnic circulation) that follows is considered the hallmark feature of HRS. In the United States, at least 633,000 adults are afflicted with cirrhosis, which represents 0.3% of the population. The estimated annual incidence for HRS type 1 (HRS‐1; the previously used term for HRS‐AKI) in the United States ranges from 9000 patients to more than 35,000 patients. Although these rates technically classify HRS‐AKI as rare, the literature regards it as a "relatively frequent problem". Approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis experience HRS‐AKI. Previous studies have found that 18% of patients with advanced cirrhosis develop HRS‐AKI after 1 year of follow‐up, and this proportion more than doubles to 39% after 5 years.

The continuum of kidney damage that occurs in HRS‐AKI, initially reversible, can lead to permanent damage, ultimately in the form of irreversible renal failure if left untreated. Although recommendations for early and rapid interventions are widely accepted, favorable outcomes are seldom achieved. Current treatment options, particularly in the United States, are generally ineffective, and better options to manage HRS‐AKI are sought. The purpose of this article is to discuss the substantial unmet medical need associated with HRS‐AKI and delineate ways to improve therapy for this disease.

### Pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome: implications for therapy [^116AW3Pp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis are prone to develop acute kidney injury (AKI) due to a number of causes, including bacterial infections with or without septic shock, hypovolemia, administration of nephrotoxic drugs, and intrinsic kidney diseases, among others. Most importantly, patients with advanced cirrhosis develop a distinctive cause of AKI, characterized by rapidly progressive glomerular filtration rate loss associated with marked disturbances in circulatory function in the absence of obvious pathologic abnormalities in the kidneys, known as hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Decreased kidney function results from intense renal vasoconstriction secondary to the complex circulatory changes of cirrhosis with splanchnic vasodilatation and effective hypovolemia. Beyond activation of vasoactive systems, factors including impaired renal blood flow autoregulation and systemic inflammation may play a role in the development of HRS. Most patients improve with albumin and vasopressors; however, the prognosis of HRS remains very poor. Novel biomarkers may be helpful in distinguishing HRS from other causes of AKI in patients with cirrhosis.

### A new look at renal dysfunction in the cirrhotic patient [^115SLgpi]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a pre-renal azotemia-like acute renal failure occurring in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. HRS results from arteriolar vasodilatation, arteriolar underfilling, and intense renal vasoconstriction. By definition, it is not responsive to volume expansion, and the prognosis is especially poor even with the use of terlipressin or albumin dialysis or both. It may be difficult, on the basis of the current criteria, to clearly differentiate HRS from other causes of acute renal failure in cirrhosis. In addition, patients with HRS frequently have underlying chronic kidney changes that may not be reversible after transplantation. In the previous issue of Critical Care, a group of experts proposed a new classification of acute, acute-on-chronic, or chronic renal impairment in cirrhosis on the basis of the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria. The group proposed the term 'hepatorenal disorder' to define patients with advanced cirrhosis and kidney dysfunction at an earlier stage, regardless of the mechanisms. As stated by the authors, more data are needed to clearly identify, by non-invasive means, those with a potential for improvement with liver transplantation and those who can undergo a combined liver and kidney transplantation.

Liver transplantation

In the last few decades, with the incorporation of the MELD score in the allocation of organs for LT, the number of transplant candidates with kidney failure or RRT requirements has increased by at least 25%. Only 1.5% of patients with severe pre-LT renal dysfunction (eGFR < 30 mL/min) required kidney transplantation within 1 year after LT, suggesting that recovery of kidney function occurred in a large percentage of these patients. It is important to consider that this study included patients suffering from all types of AKI, not solely HRS-AKI. In a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis, 83% of patients with HRS achieved HRS-AKI reversal after LT. In addition, the mortality rate of LT recipients with HRS was higher than LT recipients without HRS. However, the study had a high heterogeneity.

In another retrospective study, 2112 adults deceased-donor LT-alone recipients who received acute RRT for < 90 days before LT, the cumulative incidence of renal non-recovery (defined as a transition to chronic dialysis within 6 months of LT) was 8.9% among those on acute RRT (< 90 days) before LT, and adjusted renal non-recovery risk increased by 3.6% per day of pre-LT RRT. The predictors of renal non-recovery include a longer duration of pre-LT RRT, pre-LT diabetes, previous LT and older age. Therefore, most patients recovered their renal function within 6 months of LT.

Cirrhosis with acute kidney injury (AKI) — vasoconstrictor response, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and transplant evaluation — Patients should be closely monitored for the possible development of side effects of vasoconstrictors and albumin, including ischemic complications and pulmonary edema. Response to terlipressin or norepinephrine is defined by creatinine decreases to < 1.5 mg/dL or return to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline over a maximum of 14 days, and therapy may be discontinued if creatinine remains at or above the pretreatment level over 4 days with the maximum tolerated doses of the vasoconstrictor. Recurrence may occur after treatment discontinuation and should be retreated. All patients with cirrhosis and AKI should be considered for urgent liver transplantation (LT) evaluation given the high short-term mortality even in responders to vasoconstrictors. RRT should be used in candidates for LT with worsening renal function or electrolyte disturbances or increasing volume overload unresponsive to vasoconstrictor therapy, and initiation of RRT in patients who are not candidates for LT must be made with a clear endpoint in mind. Given the complexity of patients with suspected AKI, timely initiation of vasoconstrictor therapy and RRT should be made, if possible, by multidisciplinary teams including specialists in hepatology, nephrology, critical care, and transplant surgery. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation may be necessary for patients who are not expected to recover kidney function posttransplantation.
