A. Aspirin
B. Dabigatran
C. Heparin
D. Warfarin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anticoagulant directly inhibits thrombin among the listed options for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism of each option. Then, I should verify which agents are approved for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Next, I will cross-check the mechanism of action against authoritative sources. Finally, I will confirm the correct answer and briefly note why the other options do not fit the description of direct thrombin inhibition.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the key mechanism we are looking for. The question is about an oral anticoagulant for clot prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation that directly inhibits thrombin, which in coagulation nomenclature is factor IIa, distinguishing it from indirect inhibitors and from factor Xa inhibitors that reduce thrombin generation rather than directly block thrombin activity.

> Now, I will examine each option mechanistically. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and reduces thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation; it does not inhibit thrombin, so I should rule it out. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that suppresses hepatic synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X; it acts indirectly and upstream of thrombin, so it is not a direct thrombin inhibitor. Heparin, whether unfractionated or low molecular weight, exerts its anticoagulant effect by binding antithrombin and accelerating inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa; again, this is indirect, not direct thrombin inhibition. Dabigatran, by contrast, is a direct thrombin inhibitor that binds thrombin and blocks fibrin formation; this matches the requested mechanism.

> Wait, let me verify the approval status and guideline positioning to ensure clinical relevance. Dabigatran is FDA-approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and contemporary guidelines prefer DOACs, including dabigatran, over warfarin for most patients without mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, which supports its appropriateness for AF stroke prevention in this scenario [^1126frCA].

> Hold on, I should double-check the mechanism wording to avoid a subtle mistake. Factor Xa inhibitors like rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban reduce thrombin generation by inhibiting factor Xa; that is not the same as directly inhibiting thrombin itself. Only dabigatran among the listed options directly and reversibly inhibits thrombin, including both free and clot-bound forms, which is precisely why it is the correct choice here [^116G4bYD] [^116pCCs9].

> Putting this together, the only option that both directly inhibits thrombin and is indicated for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation is dabigatran. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Dabigatran.

---

The correct answer is **B. Dabigatran** because it is the only direct thrombin inhibitor among the options provided [^112yy2Ka]. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent, heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor via antithrombin, and warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that reduces thrombin synthesis; none directly inhibit thrombin.

---

## Mechanism of action of dabigatran

Dabigatran is a **direct thrombin inhibitor** that binds reversibly to thrombin (factor IIa), blocking the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and thereby preventing thrombus formation [^112hqU8s]. It inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin, providing rapid, predictable anticoagulation without routine monitoring [^116pCCs9].

---

## Comparison with other anticoagulants

| **Drug** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Aspirin | Antiplatelet agent | Stroke prevention in low-risk AF or when anticoagulation is contraindicated [^114wq8C6] |
| Heparin | Indirect thrombin inhibitor via antithrombin | Short-term anticoagulation, bridging therapy [^116sxgZA] |
| Warfarin | Vitamin K antagonist | Long-term anticoagulation, requires INR monitoring [^113iH4Ub] |
| Dabigatran | Direct thrombin inhibitor | Stroke prevention in non-valvular AF, no routine monitoring [^112yy2Ka] |

---

## Clinical implications of direct thrombin inhibition

Direct thrombin inhibition offers **rapid onset/offset**, predictable pharmacokinetics, and fewer drug–food interactions than warfarin [^112rtM8j]. It is preferred over warfarin in many patients with non-valvular AF to reduce stroke and intracranial hemorrhage risk [^117MT2Gg].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend DOACs, including dabigatran, over warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF, except in patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis [^117MT2Gg]. Dabigatran is **approved for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF** and is a standard option in clinical practice [^112yy2Ka].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

Benefits include **effective stroke prevention**, lower intracranial hemorrhage risk than warfarin, and no routine monitoring [^116wyzuA]. Risks include bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the need for dose adjustment in renal impairment [^116G4bYD].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Renal function should be assessed before prescribing dabigatran, with dose adjustments or alternative agents considered in significant impairment [^114hXpmi]. Drug interactions are fewer than with warfarin, but concomitant P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampin) should be avoided [^111JUK4U]. Patient preference may favor dabigatran for its **convenience and lack of routine monitoring** [^114qFbqZ].

---

## Conclusion

Dabigatran is the correct answer because it is the **only direct thrombin inhibitor** among the options, providing effective, convenient anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^112yy2Ka].

### Should we still be utilizing warfarin in the type 2 diabetic patient? [^115LgHte]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The frequency of non-valvular atrial fibrillation is increased by 40% in type 2 diabetic individuals and the thromboembolic risk associated with atrial fibrillation is increased by 79% compared with the non-diabetic individual with atrial fibrillation. Warfarin, the traditional anticoagulant used to prevent thromboembolism, is non-specific and affects several proteins outside the coagulation system. Decreasing the levels of matrix Gla protein entails an increase in coronary and renal artery calcification, which has the potential to increase cardiovascular events and accelerate decline in renal function. The direct-acting oral anticoagulants are specific, directly inhibiting either thrombin or factor Xa, and have been shown to be safer and more efficacious in studies of the type 2 diabetic patient.

Warfarin has long been the 'gold standard' of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Recently, the oral direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors have emerged as attractive alternatives to warfarin and have already changed the landscape of stroke prevention in AF. The new anticoagulants have important advantages over warfarin. Despite their impressive performance in clinical trials, their long-term efficacy and safety still require evaluation in 'real-world' clinical practice. In this review, the emerging role of the new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with AF is discussed.

Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common dysrhythmia in the United States, with a prevalence that is expected to rise significantly as the population ages. Despite the recognition of several modifiable risk factors for AF, such as obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and alcohol use, its prevalence and incidence continue to grow, making it an attractive target for preventive interventions. The preventive approach for AF is 2‐fold: (1) targeting and treating risk factors and (2) promptly diagnosing and initiating antithrombotic therapy to minimize thromboembolic complications.

Although limiting symptoms may significantly affect one's quality of life, the most feared complication associated with AF is stroke or systemic embolism. To this end, selective ECG screening for clinically asymptomatic disease in otherwise healthy persons may be indicated for stroke prevention. In the recently presented STROKESTOP (Population screening of 75‐ and 76‐year‐old men and women for silent atrial fibrillation) trial, population‐based screening of asymptomatic patients in Sweden identified 5% of the population as candidates for oral anticoagulation. The full study is currently under way.

Once AF has been diagnosed, thromboembolic risk assessment should be performed to determine optimal antithrombotic therapy. The 2014 ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society AF guidelines recommend risk stratification using the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, which performs better than the CHADS 2 score alone. Although not formally recommended in the guidelines yet, biomarkers, including high‐sensitivity troponin, have been shown to improve risk assessment. Although aspirin and warfarin have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in AF, – most patients warrant anticoagulant therapy. Until recently, warfarin was the sole anticoagulant approved for AF patients. Novel oral anticoagulants now offer alternatives that do not require prothrombin time monitoring and are associated with superior efficacy and/or safety in nonvalvular AF. – These agents inhibit the coagulation cascade either as a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) or a factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, which has not yet received US Food and Drug Administration approval).

### Novel oral anticoagulants to prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation [^113ngdqd]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation by around 60%, while antiplatelet therapy is much less effective. Bleeding is, however, a notable adverse effect with warfarin. Another major drawback of warfarin is the need for frequent clotting assessment. Oral agents have been developed that directly inhibit the activity of thrombin (factor IIa), as well as drugs that directly block activated factor X (factor Xa), which is the first enzyme in the final common pathway to the activation of thrombin. These drugs have fast onset and offset of action and anticoagulation does not seem to need monitoring. These new agents for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation are being investigated in ongoing phase III trials. In one of these trials an oral thrombin blocker has so far shown superiority to warfarin in efficacy and safety. In this Review, I address the potential of modern oral anticoagulants to improve stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

### New anticoagulant drugs for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113wm4Gw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and atrial fibrillation are common conditions in Western countries. The mainstay of treatment and prevention for these diseases is fast-acting anticoagulant drugs such as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The use of these drugs is, however, complex and demanding for both patients and physicians. Recently, new antithrombotic drugs that act directly by inhibiting activated coagulation factors such as factor X or thrombin have been developed and investigated in phase III clinical trials. The aim of this article is to review: (i) the need to develop new drugs; (ii) their efficacy/safety as demonstrated in clinical trials; (iii) the need for laboratory monitoring and (iv) the direction towards the use of these new drugs in the real-life clinical situation.

### Oral factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors: a clinical perspective [^11642kR4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation used to be synonymous with warfarin until the recent approval of oral direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors in United States and other countries across the world. Thrombosis prevention and treatment continue to be the main objective and goal for surgical and medical patients. Regulatory agencies continue to revise their guidelines to treat these patients with appropriate medication and for optimal duration. As the choices for oral anticoagulants increase, with many oral anticoagulant drugs currently in the pipeline awaiting completion of clinical trials, the guidelines for venous thromboembolism prevention, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and treatment of acute arterial and venous thrombi will also shift from the current standards to new standards set by these clinical trials for optimal dosing and duration of treatment. However, it must be reinforced that these new oral anticoagulants are distinct pharmacological compounds with specific targets and will also have distinct clinical indications for use.

### Assessment of dabigatran utilization and prescribing patterns for atrial fibrillation in a physician group practice setting [^114Wnkvm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

For years, warfarin and aspirin have been standard therapies for prophylaxis of stroke in atrial fibrillation. In late 2010, dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, became available for use in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We sought to evaluate utilization and prescribing patterns of dabigatran in a physician group practice setting. We retrospectively collected prescription data from October 2010 to December 2011 including indication of use, dose, renal function, drug interactions, history of warfarin therapy, and risk assessment scores (CHADS2 and HAS-BLED). Off-label use (history of valve disease or no diagnosis of atrial fibrillation) occurred in 20% (n = 34) of 174 patients. Renal function assessed by Cockcroft-Gault equation identified 1 case of contraindicated use and the need for initial renal dose adjustment in approximately 1/2 of the patients with reduced renal function (15–30 ml/min). Review of anticoagulant use revealed 68% of patients (n = 119) previously received warfarin and ultimately 20% of all patients on dabigatran resumed warfarin therapy. A significant increase in the use of permeability glycoprotein inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors after initiating dabigatran was observed. Nearly 10% of patients had a CHADS2 score of 0. For patients receiving novel oral anticoagulants, prospective inclusion in anticoagulation services and guidance from specific "place in therapy" statements have potential to play a large role in maximizing safety while aiding in continued research.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: our current failures and required research [^115cs3Ne]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is a common rhythm disorder of middle-aged to older adults that can cause ischemic strokes and systemic embolism. Lifelong use of oral anticoagulants reduces the risk of these ischemic events but increases the risk of major and clinically relevant hemorrhages. These medications also require strict compliance for efficacy, and they have nontrivial failure rates in higher-risk patients. Left atrial appendage closure is a nonpharmacological method to prevent ischemic strokes in atrial fibrillation without the need for lifelong anticoagulant use, but this procedure has the potential for complications and residual embolic events. This workshop of the Roundtable of Academia and Industry for Stroke Prevention discussed future research needed to further decrease the ischemic and hemorrhagic risks among patients with atrial fibrillation. A direct thrombin inhibitor, factor Xa inhibitors, and left atrial appendage closure are FDA-approved approaches whereas factor XIa inhibitors are currently being studied in phase 3 randomized controlled trials for stroke prevention. The benefits, risks, and shortcomings of these treatments and future research required in different high-risk patient populations are reviewed in this consensus statement.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117JsQSK]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitor AZD0837 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a randomized dose-guiding, safety, and tolerability study of four doses of AZD0837 vs. vitamin K antagonists [^1163Fqsp]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality from stroke and thromboembolism. Current guidelines recommend dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (e.g. warfarin) titrated to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0–3.0 for thromboprophylaxis in AF patients with moderate to high risk of stroke. While VKAs can be given orally, they are associated with a number of limitations, – including slow onset and offset of action, a narrow therapeutic index requiring frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment, and interactions with many drugs and with food. The consequence is a variable therapeutic response, leading either to increased risk of bleeding complications or a suboptimal antithrombotic effect, resulting in undertreatment of many patients. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is recommended in low- to moderate-risk patients or as second-line therapy in patients with contraindications for VKA treatment, although stroke prevention with antiplatelet agents is suboptimal in AF patients compared with VKA. Hence, there is a need for a novel oral anticoagulant that is effective and well tolerated, with a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile than VKAs, without the inconvenience of regular INR monitoring, while maintaining, or improving, the therapeutic effect.

### Dabigatran compared with warfarin for stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation: experience in Hong Kong [^111YYPve]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor recently approved for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) as an alternative to warfarin. The primary advantages of dabigatran are freedom from monitoring and less interaction with other drugs and food. It is ideal for patients who are unwilling to adhere to regular coagulation monitoring or whose therapeutic effect using warfarin is not optimal despite adequate monitoring and management. However, the impact of dabigatran on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and drug compliance has been less evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and humanistic outcomes of dabigatran use in Hong Kong.

Hypothesis

Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was non-inferior in stroke prophylaxis in AF patients compared to adjusted-dose warfarin; while dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to adjusted-dose warfarin in the real world data in Hong Kong.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 244 patients with newly diagnosed AF and prescribed dabigatran (n = 122) or warfarin (n = 122) for stroke prophylaxis from the Prince of Wales Hospital between January 2010 to November 2011. Clinical outcomes including death, stroke, bleeding, and HRQoL using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L were compared between patients on dabigatran and warfarin.

Results

The median duration of follow-up was 310 days. Stroke occurred in 2 patients (1.64%) in the dabigatran group and 4 in the warfarin group (3.28%) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53, P = 0.47). Bleeding of any degree occurred in 28 patients on dabigatran and 38 patients on warfarin (adjusted HR: 0.76, P = 0.28), with age over 70 years and renal impairment being significant positive predictors of bleeding (P = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Dyspepsia was the most common adverse event of dabigatran over warfarin (19.7% vs 8.2%, P = 0.01). Rate of discontinuation of dabigatran was 25.4%, with dyspepsia being the most common cause for discontinuation (6 patients, 4.92%). There was no significant difference in drug compliance or HRQoL at 1 year between the 2 groups (utility score 0.77 [dabigatran] vs 0.74 [warfarin], P = 0.28).

Conclusions

In Hong Kong, the clinical efficacy and safety of dabigatran were comparable to that of warfarin, and drug compliance and HRQoL of using dabigatran and warfarin were similar after 1 year of use.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA atrial fibrillation measures — direct thrombin/Xa inhibitors in end-stage kidney disease: An inpatient measure addresses "Inappropriate Prescription of a Direct Thrombin and Factor Xa Inhibitor Rivaroxaban or Edoxaban in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and End-Stage Kidney Disease or on Dialysis". The guideline-based rationale is that patients with AF and end-stage kidney disease or on dialysis should "not be prescribed the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban" due to "the lack of evidence from clinical trials with regard to the balance of risks and benefits", and the committee "expanded it to include edoxaban because it was approved for use in patients with AF after the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guidelines for Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation had been released". Implementation notes state, "In developing this quality measure the writing committee did consider existing studies that relate to anticoagulation in patients with kidney disease.2" It adds that "Based on additional studies that may be published or changes to future ACC/AHA recommendations, the writing committee may re-evaluate the construct of this measure", and "At this time the measure is designated as a quality measure".

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114wq8C6]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — For patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack] score of 0), we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy, and for patients choosing antithrombotic therapy, we suggest aspirin rather than oral anticoagulation or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For intermediate risk (eg, CHADS2 score of 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, and we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For high risk (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest dabigatran 150 mg bid rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### Lessons from the stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation trials [^1111b4jE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation predisposes to left atrial thrombus formation and carries a sixfold increased risk for stroke. Antithrombotic therapies are the mainstay for stroke prevention. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-sponsored Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) studies assessed the value of warfarin, aspirin, and their combination for preventing stroke in six multicenter trials involving 3950 participants. This review presents the major results and implications, which offer unique perspectives on antithrombotic therapies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Warfarin and aspirin reduce stroke. Anticoagulation substantially benefits high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, while many younger patients with atrial fibrillation have a low stroke rate when given aspirin. Pathogenetic and transesophageal echocardiographic correlations shed light on mechanisms by which antithrombotic agents prevent stroke. Warfarin inhibits formation of atrial appendage thrombi and markedly reduces cardioembolic strokes, while aspirin primarily prevents smaller, noncardioembolic strokes. The SPAF III stroke risk stratification scheme has been validated for identifying patients with high versus moderate versus low risk for stroke. Women with atrial fibrillation benefit from anticoagulation significantly more than men do. Many elderly patients with recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation have high rates of stroke. Antithrombotic prophylaxis should be individualized on the basis of the estimated risk for stroke during aspirin therapy and the risk for bleeding during anticoagulation. Overall, nearly one third of patients with atrial fibrillation are low risk and should be treated with aspirin, and about one third are high risk and should receive warfarin if it can be given safely. For patients at moderate risk for stroke, patient preferences and access to reliable anticoagulation monitoring are particularly relevant.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114hXpmi]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — anticoagulation recommendations specify the following: For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 3, treatment with warfarin, or preferably, evidence-based doses of direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 4, treatment with warfarin or labeled doses of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is reasonable to reduce the risk of stroke. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and who have end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis, it might be reasonable to prescribe warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Table 4 — post-ablation anticoagulation after atrial fibrillation ablation indicates that in patients who are not therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin at the time of AF ablation, low molecular weight heparin or intravenous heparin should be used as a bridge to resumption of systemic anticoagulation with warfarin following AF ablation, and initiation of a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor after ablation may be considered as an alternative post procedure anticoagulation strategy. Because of the increased risk of post procedure bleeding on full dose low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg bid) a reduction of the dose to 0.5 mg/kg should be considered. Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor is recommended for at least two months following an AF ablation procedure. Decisions regarding the continuation of systemic anticoagulation agents more than two months following ablation should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF, and discontinuation of systemic anticoagulation therapy post ablation is not recommended in patients who are at high risk of stroke as estimated by currently recommended schemes (CHADS2, or CHA2DS2-VASc).

### S35972, a direct-acting thrombin inhibitor with high oral bioavailability and antithrombotic efficacy [^114BS56R]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Dabigatran etexilate is the first oral thrombin inhibitor to demonstrate superior efficacy to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. This study describes the in vitro, ex vivo anticoagulant and in vivo antithrombotic effects of an oral thrombin inhibitor, S35972, in comparison with dabigatran etexilate.

Methods

Enzyme assays with thrombin and related serine proteases were performed. Clotting times, including activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin time (TT), were measured in vitro in different species and ex vivo in dogs and rats to determine pharmacologic bioavailabilities. The formation of occlusive venous and arterial thrombi in the rat vena cava and aorta was induced with stasis plus thromboplastin or ferrous chloride, respectively.

Results

S35972 inhibited human thrombin with an IC(50) of 3.7nm, and did not inhibit other serine proteases. The anticoagulant activities of S35972 in vitro were comparable in dog and human plasmas, and the sensitivity of the clotting times to S35972 was TT > APTT > prothrombin time. In the fasted dog, oral administration of 3 mg kg(-1) S35972 increased TT rapidly and for at least 8 h, and its pharmacologic bioavailability was 75.4% ± 0.1%. In the rat venous thrombosis model, 3 mg kg(-1) oral S35972 or dabigatran etexilate significantly decreased the thrombus weight. In the rat aortic thrombosis model, oral S35972 at 10mg kg(-1) significantly decreased thrombus weight, by approximately 50%, whereas, at this dose, no effect was obtained with dabigatran etexilate.

Conclusions

S35972 is a non-prodrug thrombin inhibitor with high selectivity, oral bioavailability, and antithrombotic efficacy.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors versus vitamin K antagonists for preventing cerebral or systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation [^112php6X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) prevents ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) but dose adjustment, coagulation monitoring and bleeding limits its use. Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) are under investigation as potential alternatives.

Objectives

To assess (1) the comparative efficacy of long-term anticoagulation using DTIs versus VKAs on vascular deaths and ischaemic events in people with non-valvular AF, and (2) the comparative safety of chronic anticoagulation using DTIs versus VKAs on (a) fatal and non-fatal major bleeding events including haemorrhagic strokes, (b) adverse events other than bleeding and ischaemic events that lead to treatment discontinuation and (c) all-cause mortality in people with non-valvular AF.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, May 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2013), EMBASE (1980 to October 2013), LILACS (1982 to October 2013) and trials registers (September 2013). We also searched the websites of clinical trials and pharmaceutical companies and handsearched the reference lists of articles and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DTIs versus VKAs for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular AF.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three review authors independently performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Primary analyses compared all DTIs combined versus warfarin. We performed post hoc analyses excluding ximelagatran because this drug was withdrawn from the market owing to safety concerns.

Main Results

We included eight studies involving a total of 27,557 participants with non-valvular AF and one or more risk factors for stroke; 26,601 of them were assigned to standard doses groups and included in the primary analysis. The DTIs: dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily (three studies, 12,355 participants), AZD0837 300 mg once per day (two studies, 233 participants) and ximelagatran 36 mg twice per day (three studies, 3726 participants) were compared with the VKA warfarin (10,287 participants). Overall risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity of the studies included were low. The odds of vascular death and ischaemic events were not significantly different between all DTIs and warfarin (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.05). Sensitivity analysis by dose of dabigatran on reduction in ischaemic events and vascular mortality indicated that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin although the effect estimate was of borderline statistical significance (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99). Sensitivity analyses by other factors did not alter the results. Fatal and non-fatal major bleeding events, including haemorrhagic strokes, were less frequent with the DTIs (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97). Adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment were significantly more frequent with the DTIs (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.61). All-cause mortality was similar between DTIs and warfarin (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01).

Authors' Conclusions

DTIs were as efficacious as VKAs for the composite outcome of vascular death and ischaemic events and only the dose of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was found to be superior to warfarin. DTIs were associated with fewer major haemorrhagic events, including haemorrhagic strokes. Adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment occurred more frequently with the DTIs. We detected no difference in death from all causes.

Atrial fibrillation — epidemiology and stroke risk: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. One in four individuals aged 40 years will develop AF during his or her lifetime, and it has been estimated that by the year 2050, up to 16 million Americans will have AF. Nonrheumatic AF is a strong, independent predictor of ischemic stroke associated with a fivefold increase in risk. Without thromboprophylaxis, the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with nonrheumatic AF, as seen in the control arms of the original trials of antithrombotic therapy in AF, is ~5% per year.

### Oral anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation: how should a clinician choose? [^117Kev5X]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia that occurs with increasing frequency in the aging population, is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. To ensure that patients receive adequate anticoagulant prophylaxis, clinical guidelines for anticoagulation advocate use of validated scoring systems to stratify patients by cardiovascular risk and predict the individual patient's risk of adverse effects of therapy. Recently approved oral anticoagulants-a direct thrombin inhibitor and the factor Xa inhibitors-may offer advantages over the 50-year standard, warfarin, for efficacy, safety, and ease of administration. Clinical trial experience with the newly approved agents and others, yet to be approved, will define their relative value in reducing the risk of thromboembolism associated with AF. This article discusses issues that may help clinicians choose among these newer agents and individualize treatment appropriately.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^116G4bYD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

NOACs directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or indirectly inhibit activated factor X (Xa) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) to prevent blood clot formation. Dabigatran, the first approved NOAC, exerts its anticoagulant effect by strongly, reversibly, and selectively inhibiting thrombin activity, with the intensity of its effects dependent on drug concentration. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit various states of factor Xa to reduce thrombin generation without interfering with existing thrombi, while having minimal impact on normal physiological haemostasis and non‐coagulation functions. Multiple guidelines recommend the use of NOACs for secondary prevention of non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of NOACs include minimal interactions with food and drugs, stable pharmacokinetics, no need for dose adjustments, no requirement for regular INR monitoring, rapid onset of action, good tolerability, and fewer side effects compared to warfarin. Compared to warfarin, NOACs have a lower incidence of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage, making them generally safer and more convenient. Reversal agents for NOACs, such as idarucizumab and exanetalfa, have been developed for the treatment of life‐threatening bleeding or in situations requiring urgent surgery. Some disadvantages of using NOACs, as opposed to vitamin K antagonists, include higher costs and the need for dose adjustments in individuals with renal impairment or extreme body weight.

Why it is important to do this review

The optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulant therapy in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate about early versus late initiation. Current guidelines lack consistency and clear recommendations on when to initiate anticoagulant therapy, primarily relying on expert consensus and limited evidence. For example, the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guideline suggests using the "1‐3‐6‐12" rule based on stroke severity to determine the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends initiating oral anticoagulant therapy between 4 and 14 days after symptom onset. Due to the inconsistent recommendations among various guidelines, physicians encounter challenges in determining the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy for people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related strokes. A survey conducted among stroke physicians in the UK revealed a lack of consensus on this matter, with 95% of respondents expressing uncertainty about the appropriate time to begin oral anticoagulation. Therefore, a systematic review of the optimal timing for starting oral anticoagulation therapy after acute ischaemic stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation is highly warranted.

### Direct effects of activation and inhibition of the coagulation system on the atrial Fibrillation substrate: is anticoagulation antiarrhythmic? [^113FLwmx]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent clinical problem that is becoming more common with population aging, and presents a broad range of therapeutic challenges. An improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is central to improving management options for the arrhythmia.

The most significant complication of AF is thromboembolism, particularly stroke. AF-related stroke is effectively prevented by oral anticoagulation (OAC), achieved traditionally by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin, and more recently by direct-acting agents (DOACs) such as the thrombin-antagonist dabigatran and the Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Because of the attendant bleeding risk, OAC therapy has been targeted to patients with elevated stroke risk, although with the reduced bleeding seen with DOACs versus VKAs, the threshold for OAC therapy has decreased and the emphasis has shifted to identifying true low-risk individuals who may safely be managed without OAC.

It has long been known that thrombin possesses proinflammatory effects mediated by protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1and that both thrombin and FXa have profibrotic effects. Furthermore, thrombin-inhibition has antifibrotic effects. Atrial fibrosis is a major potential contributor to the substrate for AF maintenance, and therefore beyond its role in clotting, activated thrombin or FXa could contribute to the progression of the AF substrate. Conversely, inhibitors of thrombin or FXa such as the DOACs could have an AF-suppressing effect.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^117PDjMZ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants

Currently marketed non-VKA anticoagulants comprise three factor-Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, inhibition of the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin) and the direct thrombin-inhibitor dabigatran (competitive inhibitor of thrombin, thereby inhibiting fibrin production), all of which are now recommended for primary or secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation over VKA. Compared to VKA these DOACs share similar pharmacokinetic properties such that elimination half-life is short ranging from 6 to 17 h across agents in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, effective OAC may theoretically not be present on admission, but importantly cannot be timely and validly excluded by routine diagnostics. Using conventional coagulation testing does not provide sufficient sensitivity or specificity, and currently, no data is available suggesting a definite threshold for all DOACs below which one can exclude DOAC effect. For a rough qualitative estimate of altered hemostasis in DOAC-treated patients in general, thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and/or activated partial thromboplastin time may be used. More specifically, if available, quantitative assessment (time-consuming, roughly 30 min) of dabigatran levels may be achieved with the dilute thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), and for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban with agent-specific anti-factor Xa levels, further point-of-care testing devices are currently under development or evaluation. Hence, patients with known DOAC intake and ICH should all receive immediate reversal treatment. Timing of last DOAC intake is important as early treatment (2–4 h after ingestion) with active charcoal (50 g), if safely tolerable by the patient, may have the potential to reduce drug absorption. Other more general options may theoretically comprise hemodialysis in dabigatran-related bleedings, but this seems not to be a sensible option in ICH where immediate reversal must be achieved. Currently, DOAC reversal comprises specific and unspecific approaches which will be highlighted in the following.

### Oral anticoagulant use around the time of atrial fibrillation ablation: a review of the current evidence of individual oral anticoagulant use for periprocedural atrial fibrillation ablation thromboembolic prophylaxis [^113iUtFc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and ablation is becoming more prevalent as a treatment option. Appropriate treatment of atrial fibrillation mandates thromboembolic prophylaxis, and atrial fibrillation ablation periprocedural management of oral anticoagulation is paramount because of the unique susceptibility for thromboembolism that exists for a patient undergoing ablation. Uninterrupted warfarin therapy is the current standard approach for periprocedural atrial fibrillation anticoagulation. Novel oral anticoagulants, including direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, are being used more frequently for thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation patients, but the best strategy for using novel oral anticoagulants in periprocedural anticoagulation is unknown. Optimal periprocedural anticoagulation management strategies with oral anticoagulants, limitations of using novel oral anticoagulants, and future directions in this field are discussed.

Monitoring and Reversibility With Novel Anticoagulants

Whereas VKAs are highly variable in pharmacokinetics necessitating frequent monitoring, the TSOAs have a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile and routine monitoring is not needed. However, there exist potential clinical scenarios for which monitoring and reversal of the anticoagulant effect would be highly desirable, such as with intracranial hemorrhage, life‐threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, urgent surgery, or trauma. These clinical situations may be especially hazardous in those patients with a baseline increased risk of bleeding, such as patients 65 years or older, and those with kidney failure or on antiplatelet therapy.

Although beneficial to have a test measuring the level of anticoagulation in these urgent situations and high‐risk patients, there is a lack of readily available accurate laboratory testing in most clinical settings. Dabigatran prolongs not only the INR but also the activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, and, to some extent, prothrombin time. The thrombin clotting time assay is the most accurate test in detecting the presence of dabigatran and increases with increasing drug concentration. This test, however, is not routinely available in most institution laboratories.–

The factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban can prolong the INR and prothrombin time, but the degree of prothrombin time prolongation does not reliably predict drug concentrations. There is a potential for drug monitoring with anti–factor Xa assays, but these assays may not be amply available to ensure a fast turnaround, which is critical in these emergent situations.

Currently, there are no available drug‐specific antidotes for the new oral anticoagulants, but several are under development. One such antidote is the monoclonal antibody directed against dabigatran, which has shown positive results in inhibiting its anticoagulant activity in both human and animal studies. There also exist potential factor Xa inhibitors (pd–factor Xa and r–factor Xa) that may be used to reverse rivaroxaban and apixaban. Studies showed these factors had the ability to neutralize anticoagulation test abnormalities associated with the Xa inhibitors. Four‐ and 3‐factor prothrombin complex concentrates are available for use, but additional study is ongoing to fully understand their efficacy in TSOA‐induced life‐threatening bleeds.

### Relation between dabigatran concentration, as assessed using the direct thrombin inhibitor assay, and activated clotting time / activated partial thromboplastin time in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112UAoxn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor that has been approved for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this study, we aimed to assess the associations between the dabigatran concentration (calculated through plasma-diluted thrombin time, as assessed using the Hemoclot assay) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT). We recruited 137 patients with atrial fibrillation who were receiving a normal dose of dabigatran (300 mg/d) or a reduced dose of dabigatran (220 mg/d, usually administered to patients who were elderly, had moderate renal dysfunction, or who were also receiving verapamil). We then assessed the aPTT, ACT, and Hemoclot results of the patients and calculated the plasma dabigatran concentration. The mean plasma concentration of dabigatran was 127 ± 88 ng/ml, although no significant differences in dabigatran concentration, ACT, or aPTT were observed when we compared the 2 doses of dabigatran (300 or 220 mg/d). The dabigatran concentration was within the therapeutic levels in most patients, although a high value (> 300 ng/ml) was observed in several patients, which indicated a high risk of bleeding. The dabigatran concentration was strongly and positively correlated with ACT and aPTT (r = 0.87, p < 0.001; and r = 0.76, p < 0.001; respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that verapamil use was independently associated with elevated dabigatran concentrations (p < 0.001). Therefore, ACT and aPTT may be useful for bedside assessment of the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran, and verapamil use may be a risk factor for elevated dabigatran concentrations.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitor AZD0837 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a phase II study of AZD0837 in patients who are appropriate for but unable or unwilling to take vitamin K antagonist therapy [^117S2wfG]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Some patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) cannot be treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and will therefore not receive effective thromboprophylaxis. The primary objective of the present Phase II trial (NCT00623779) was to assess the feasibility of conducting a study with a novel oral anticoagulant, the direct thrombin inhibitor AZD0837, in patients with AF unable or unwilling to take warfarin, by evaluation of dropout rates and compliance.

Methods

Patients were randomised to receive AZD0837 extended-release tablets 150 mg (n = 43) or 300 mg (n = 42) once daily, or standard therapy (no treatment, aspirin 75–325 mg or clopidogrel 75 mg once daily; n = 46) for a median treatment duration of 6 weeks.

Results

Reasons for patients not being treated with warfarin were: refusal or permanent cessation decided by the patient (64.8%), inability to keep international normalised ratio 2–3 over a 3-month period (23.2%), physician assessment that VKA was inappropriate (20.4%) and warfarin allergy (2.8%). Compliance with treatment (mean ± SD) was 97.0 ± 16.5% for AZD0837 150 mg and 99.8 ± 1.4% for 300 mg. Compliance with study visits was high (mean 93–98%). The numbers of dropouts were four, six and three, whilst minor or clinically significant minor bleeds were reported in zero, five and two patients in the AZD0837 150 mg, 300 mg and standard-therapy groups, respectively. No major bleeds were reported. Both doses of AZD0837 reduced levels of fibrin D-dimer and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, ecarin clotting time and thrombin clotting time.

Conclusions

AZD0837 had a good safety profile during this study, including a low incidence of bleeding events, with effective anticoagulation on pharmacodynamic parameters. A larger study in AF patients unable or unwilling to take warfarin is feasible, as judged by compliance and dropout rates.

### NOACs versus warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with AF: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iH4Ub]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Description of the condition

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia with a less efficient passage of blood through the atria with the potential for stasis and increased risk of thrombus formation particularly in the atrial appendage. This thrombus formation gives rise to the potential for embolism, which can manifest as ischaemic stroke.

Description of control/comparison

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, which exerts its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Regrettably, it is, however, prone to numerous drug and food interactions, which necessitates regular blood testing to maintain the international normalisation ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range. Significant patient time and medical resources are required and the effective vigilance of medical practitioners in the bespoke tailoring of warfarin dose to the individual is far from straight forward.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have a more specific mode of action directly targeting just one clotting factor. The factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors produce a more predictable and less labile anticoagulant effect, which is less susceptible to drug and food interactions and do not require regular monitoring.

Why it is important to do this review

There have been several reviews addressing similar interventions and outcomes, however, this review is an independent review, which aimed to identify all NOACs with high-quality phase II and III trials. In addition this review evaluated data from the end of the clinical trials when NOACs are stopped and participants are switched to warfarin. This has mostly gone unreported and is a key element of understanding the place of NOACs and particularly relevant considering the extent of discontinuation of around 20–24% in the clinical trial setting.

This review also applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for assessing the strength of evidence in a summary of findings table.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the NOACs with warfarin as a comparator as well as the end of trial 'switch' to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and an additional risk factor for stroke.
To formulate a GRADE summary of findings table.

### New anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1171akce]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder and a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. Antithrombotic therapy using vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is currently prescribed for prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with AF. A narrow therapeutic range and frequent food and drug interactions underly the need for regular monitoring of anticoagulation intensity and impairs the utility and safety of VKA, stimulating a quest for alternative anticoagulant agents. Recently developed anticoagulants include the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, to name those in the most advanced stages of clinical development. This review focuses on advances in the development of novel antithrombotic agents to provide practical information to clinicians on the use of these new drugs in patients with AF.

### Prevention of perioperative thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115MhRsC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this retrospective study was to review the safety and efficacy of two regimens for the prophylaxis of perioperative thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

From a database of 14 801 procedures, atrial fibrillation occurred in 1.9 per cent of patients. Those not on oral anticoagulation (n = 146) received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) before and after surgery (nadroparine 40 units per kg). Patients on oral anticoagulation before surgery (n = 136) received intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) after surgery at a dose adequate to maintain the thrombin time at a therapeutic level.

Results

The incidence of perioperative arterial or venous thromboembolism was independent of pre-existing risk factors and occurred in 4.6 per cent of patients, without significant difference between the two regimens (P = 0.780). Logistic regression revealed that thromboembolism was significantly associated with increased perioperative mortality (odds ratio 9.5, (95 per cent confidence interval 2.5 to 35.8); P = 0.001). The rate of postoperative bleeding was 4.8 per cent in patients who had LMWH and 17.6 per cent in those who had UFH (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Postoperative anticoagulation with therapeutic UFH in patients with atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased rate of bleeding without reducing the risk of thromboembolism.

### Spontaneous splenic hemorrhage after initiation of dabigatran (pradaxa) for atrial fibrillation [^116pCCs9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT) is an oral anticoagulant that produces a reliable, dose-dependent anticoagulant effect without the need for routine laboratory monitoring. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor, acting like other members in its class (bivalirudin, argatroban) to impede the clotting process through selective and reversible binding with both free and clot-bound thrombin. Dabigatran anticoagulates rapidly: plasma levels peak 2 hours after absorption, with a half-life that ranges between 12 and 17 hours. Dabigatran was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2010 after it compared favorably with warfarin in a large clinical trial studying its efficacy in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Currently, there is no laboratory test on the market by which a physician can quantify the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, nor is there any antidote to reverse a life-threatening bleed should it occur. We present a case of a patient with splenic hemorrhagic soon after initiation of dabigatran.

### New anticoagulants [^1163zdh6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Traditional anticoagulant drugs, including unfractionated heparin and warfarin, have several limitations. New anticoagulants have been developed that target a single coagulation factor and have predictable dose-response relationships. These include direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Two parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, lepirudin and argatroban, have FDA approval for the management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Bivalirudin is a parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor that is licensed for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions and for those with HIT who require percutaneous coronary interventions. Ximelagatran, an oral prodrug of the direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran, showed efficacy in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism as well as stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, due to nonhematologic safety concerns, it did not receive FDA approval in the US. Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide, which binds to antithrombin, thereby indirectly selectively inhibiting factor Xa. Fondaparinux demonstrated efficacy compared to low-molecular-weight heparin in randomized clinical trials and is FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. The OASIS 5 trial in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes recently demonstrated that the fondaparinux dose approved for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis is as efficacious with respect to ischemic outcomes as therapeutic doses of enoxaparin; fondaparinux, however, was associated with a substantial reduction in major bleeding at 9 days and mortality at 1 and 6 months. A number of oral direct factor Xa inhibitors as well as other oral direct thrombin inhibitors are in clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis; the current status of these anticoagulants is reviewed along with the challenges faced in designing pivotal clinical trials of these agents in comparison to existing anticoagulants.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^111Dw8YH]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

### The evolving field of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113ejckY]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard in stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation for decades, but several limitations make it difficult for patients to tolerate chronic anticoagulation treatment. New drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials, including direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel and aspirin are alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention but have proven less efficacious in trials. The only drug to have completed a Phase III trial successfully thus far is dabigatran. The 150-mg twice-a-day dose was superior to warfarin in efficacy and similar for major bleeding, whereas the 110-mg twice-a-day dose was noninferior for efficacy and reduced major bleeding. Both doses reduced intracranial hemorrhages substantially compared with warfarin. Dabigatran-assigned patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinically apparent myocardial infarction rates were slightly higher in the dabigatran groups than the warfarin group. Dabigatran is the first agent to show superiority over warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, raising the standard for newer agents.

Edoxaban — atrial fibrillation (AF) dose strategy and bleeding outcomes — was compared with warfarin in a phase 2 trial of 1,146 patients; the composite of major plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was higher with 30 or 60 mg bid than with warfarin (7.5%, 10.6%, and 3.2%, respectively), whereas once-daily 30 or 60 mg had rates similar to warfarin (3.0% and 3.8%). Based on these data, the phase 3 double-blind ENGAGE-AF-TIMI 48 trial compares 30 or 60 mg once daily (with dose adjustments for drug clearance) with warfarin (dose adjusted to achieve a target INR of 2–3), with enrollment completed and follow-up ongoing in this event-driven trial.

### Efficacy of prothrombin complex concentrates for the emergency reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation [^116wyzuA]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For more than 60 years, the only oral anticoagulants available for the prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) have been the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol. However, the need for coagulation monitoring and dose adjustments, as well as concerns about drug–drug or diet–drug interactions and the risk of bleeding, have restricted the use of VKAs for ischaemic stroke prevention in patients with AF. Several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved for this indication: the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, and oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban). Compared with VKAs, DOACs produce a more predictable anticoagulant effect and can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. The results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies indicate that DOACs are at least as effective as VKAs for stroke prevention in patients with AF, with reduced rates of intracranial bleeding and, at certain doses, a reduction in life-threatening bleeding.

Dabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate, has a rapid onset of action, and the plasma concentration peaks within 0.5–2.0 hours of administration. This anticoagulant has a half-life of 7–17 hours and is eliminated predominantly via renal excretion (80%). Dabigatran is licensed in many countries for several indications, including: primary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who have undergone elective total hip or knee arthroplasty (150 mg or 220 mg once daily); prevention of ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular AF (110 or 150 mg twice daily, except in the USA where 75 and 150 mg twice-daily doses are approved); and treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (110 and 150 mg twice daily, except in the USA where only the 150 mg twice-daily dose is approved).

### Ximelagatran: oral direct thrombin inhibition as anticoagulant therapy in atrial fibrillation [^117BnPtd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes 50,000 to 100,000 ischemic strokes annually in the U.S., most of which could be prevented by oral anticoagulant treatment of the highest-risk patients. The greatest barrier to such treatment is the narrow therapeutic index of the vitamin K antagonists ([VKAs]: warfarin and related coumarin derivatives), the only oral anticoagulant agents currently available. Safe and effective treatment with the VKAs requires careful monitoring, because they interact with many other drugs and foods, and their anticoagulant action is unpredictable. Besides vitamin K, candidate targets for anticoagulant therapy include thrombin, a key prothrombotic mediator. Ximelagatran, the oral direct thrombin inhibitor at the most advanced stage of clinical development, is rapidly absorbed and bioconverted to its active moiety, melagatran-a potent, competitive inhibitor of both free and clot-bound thrombin. Two large clinical trials have demonstrated that fixed-dose oral ximelagatran, 36 mg twice daily, administered without coagulation monitoring, prevents stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with nonvalvular AF as effectively as well-controlled, adjusted-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0). The overall risk of bleeding was lower with ximelagatran than warfarin, although differences in rates of major hemorrhage were not statistically significant. Elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels above 3x the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 6% of ximelagatran-treated patients but typically returned toward pretreatment levels without associated symptoms. In terms of preventing thromboembolism without hemorrhage, ximelagatran may have a more favorable benefit:risk profile than warfarin for patients with AF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

### Application value and safety analysis of warfarin, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran ester in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^11236exy]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Warfarin is one of the most commonly used intermediate‐effect anticoagulants. It plays an anticoagulant role mainly by blocking the synthesis of coagulation factors in liver cells and can effectively inhibit the shedding of thrombosis and prevent the expansion of thrombosis. Warfarin remains the only anticoagulant treatment option for patients with valvular disease‐associated atrial fibrillation and those with severe kidney disease. However, for the anticoagulant treatment of patients with NVAF, the effectiveness of NOAC is at least no worse than that of Warfarin, and the safety is improved. The subgroup analysis of Phase III clinical study of NOAC showed that the reduction of stroke and systemic embolism in the Asian population is better than that in the non‐Asian population.

Rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, has stable pharmacokinetic properties, does not interact with food and drugs, does not require INR detection, and is an ideal new oral anticoagulant. Dabigatran is a new oral anticoagulant. It is a direct thrombin inhibitor. After oral administration, it is converted into Dabigatran ester in the body, which selectively binds to the specific binding site of thrombin and prevents the decomposition of fibrinogen into fibrin, thus inhibiting thrombus formation. Clinical studies have shown that uninterrupted Dabigatran therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with NVAF ablation and has a lower risk of bleeding compared to uninterrupted Warfarin therapy. Compared with Warfarin monotherapy, NOAC monotherapy had a lower risk of bleeding at 45 days, but there was no significant difference in anticoagulant efficacy between NOAC and Warfarin. A meta‐review of the efficacy and safety of nonvitamin K oral antagonists (NOACs) versus Warfarin in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation suggested no significant difference in efficacy or safety between NOAC preparations. The results of this study showed that Warfarin, Rivaroxaban, and Dabigatran were effective in preventing thrombotic events in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, and rivaroxaban and Dabigatran were more effective Dabigatran.

### New anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation management [^112Zn4Zi]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Three new oral anticoagulants have been evaluated in large registration trials and are now available in many jurisdictions for patients with atrial fibrillation. Questions arise whether these drugs are equally effective and safe for all patients. Now when we are moving away from decades with only one orally available drug for anticoagulation there is opportunity to tailor the therapy according to patient characteristics and preferences. This review addresses the interaction of various patient characteristics with the treatment and what features can assist the physician in the choice of anticoagulant for the individual patient.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb: In patients 75 y of age and older at increased risk of bleeding but without frank contraindications, and in other patients with moderate risk factors for thromboembolism who are unable to safely tolerate anticoagulation at the standard intensity of INR 2.0 to 3.0, a lower INR target of 2.0 (range 1.6 to 2.5) may be considered for primary prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (Level of Evidence: C). When surgical procedures require interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy for longer than 1 wk in high-risk patients, unfractionated heparin may be administered or low-molecular-weight heparin given by subcutaneous injection, although the efficacy of these alternatives in this situation is uncertain (Level of Evidence: C).

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^1124kzwy]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Non-warfarin oral anticoagulants (NOACs, formerly 'novel' oral anticoagulants and now sometimes referred to as non-vitamin K OACs, target-specific OACs or direct OACs) are now appearing in clinical practice. For example, most patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation requiring a long-term OAC are still prescribed warfarin, but increasing numbers, currently approximately 17%, are prescribed the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, Connecticut, USA). Dabigatran has been approved for the reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5–10 days and for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE in previously treated patients.

The factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, New Jersey, USA) has been approved for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE prophylaxis after elective major joint replacement surgery. The FXa inhibitor apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, New York, New York, USA) also has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of VTE. Another agent in this class, edoxaban (Daiichi Sankyo Co, Tokyo, Japan), has recently completed pivotal clinical trialsand received FDA approval for the reduction of risk of stroke and SE in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment of DVT and PE subsequent to initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5–10 days. Therefore, while most patients presenting to the ED who are taking an OAC are likely to be taking warfarin, it is important for all emergency care providers to gain familiarity with the NOACs. The currently approved indications for use and recommended dosing for the approved NOACs can be found in table 1.

Target‐Specific Oral Anticoagulants in the Prevention of Stroke in AF

Background

The challenges associated with managing warfarin in clinical practice have prompted the extensive research and development of target‐specific oral anticoagulants (TSOAs) that are now available for use. This group of drugs exerts its anticoagulant effects through inhibition of factor Xa or thrombin (Figure). TSOAs are promising as safe and efficacious alternatives to warfarin with some favorable pharmacological qualities (Table 2). Not only do they offer quick time‐to‐peak effects, fixed dosing regimens, and no monitoring, but they also have fewer drug–drug and dietary interactions compared with warfarin. Disadvantages of these TSOAs include a current lack of accurate monitoring in cases of suspected toxicity, lack of antidote in cases of life‐threatening bleeds or urgent surgery, and the inability to administer to those individuals with stage V chronic kidney disease or a prosthetic heart valve. Safety and efficacy data of the TSOAs have been derived from multiple phase III randomized clinical trials, the largest of them being those in stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF (Table 3).

### Oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status, special situations, and unmet needs [^112rtM8j]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists reduces the risk of stroke by more than 60%. But vitamin K antagonists have limitations, including causing serious bleeding such as intracranial haemorrhage and the need for anticoagulation monitoring. In part related to these limitations, they are used in only about half of patients who should be treated according to guideline recommendations. In the past decade, oral agents have been developed that directly block the activity of thrombin (factor IIa), as well as drugs that directly inhibit activated factor X (Xa), which is the first protein in the final common pathway to the activation of thrombin. These novel non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been shown to be at least as good as warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and they have proved to have better safety profiles. Their net advantage is underscored by significantly lower all-cause mortality compared with warfarin in large clinical trials. Because of these features and their ease of use, they are recommended for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. They have also a fast onset and offset of action, but they currently lack specific antidotes. This paper addresses the role of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the era of NOACs, with a focus on special situations including management in the event of bleeding and around the time of procedures including cardioversion, catheter ablation, and device implantation. Also their use in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease, with advanced age, with chronic kidney disease, or with valvular heart disease will be discussed as well as the interaction of NOACs with other cardiac medication, and switching between anticoagulants.

### Hemorrhagic complications associated with dabigatran use [^112UdxFg]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor approved for anticoagulation in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and, in some countries, for thromboembolism prophylaxis following select orthopedic surgeries. Despite decreased rates of thromboembolism, bleeding remains a risk due to the inability to conveniently monitor anticoagulant effect and the lack of a reversal agent.

Case Series

We present four cases of dabigatran-related bleeding. A 79-year-old man on aspirin, clopidogrel, and dabigatran presented with rectal bleeding and epistaxis. He died despite transfusion and administration of prothrombin complex concentrate. A 73-year-old woman on dabigatran and aspirin survived after transfusion and an emergent sternotomy for cardiac tamponade. An 86 year-old man with kidney disease and thrombocytopenia received packed red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma for rectal bleeding while on dabigatran. An 80 year-old man on dabigatran had a subdural hematoma after falling and hitting his head. Serial imaging showed no progression.

Conclusion

The absence of a reversal agent for dabigatran raises concern for uncontrollable bleeding and death. Dabigatran's listed contraindications include active bleeding and a history of dabigatran hypersensitivity reaction. Wider use may result in bleeding rates higher than anticipated from clinical trials. Risks factors that may have contributed to bleeding in these patients include concomitant bleeding diathesis, antiplatelet agent use, renal insufficiency, advanced age, and fall risks.

### Patient perception and treatment convenience of dabigatran versus vitamin K antagonist when used for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation: real-world evaluation of long-term anticoagulant treatment experience (RE-LATE) study [^114qFbqZ]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is shown to increase the risk of stroke by five times. The severity of AF-related stroke is generally greater than stroke not related to AF. Stroke prevention by using anticoagulants is an essential part of the management of non-valvular AF (NVAF), and is associated with an improved quality of life (QoL) in these patients. Though the traditionally used vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol effectively prevent thromboembolism by providing optimal anticoagulation, they are associated with several food and drug interactions and require regular monitoring, both of which result in poor patient adherence and QoL. Since 2008, many non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as the direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and the factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) have been introduced as alternatives to VKA for stroke prevention in patients with AF, after their efficacy and safety was demonstrated in comparison with warfarin in four landmark clinical trials. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa, Boehringer Ingelheim) was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2010 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF. The drug subsequently obtained US FDA approval for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), and for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty.

### Short-and long-acting synthetic pentasaccharides [^1162Run4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Inhibition of activated coagulation factor X (FXa) is an attractive target for antithrombotic treatment strategies, because of the central position of FXa in the coagulation cascade. Most of the now available anticoagulant drugs have inhibitory effects not only on FXa, but also on thrombin. With the development of pentasaccharides, a new class of antithrombotic agents has emerged that acts by specific inhibition of FXa and lacks activity against FIIa. Fondaparinux, the first synthetic short-acting pentasaccharide, has been evaluated, in a large phase II and III clinical programme concerning prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and also in phase II studies in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Idraparinux, the long-acting pentasaccharide, has been studied in a dose-finding study in patients with established deep-vein thrombosis and phase III studies are now planned in patients with venous thromboembolism and in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Rivaroxaban-once daily, oral, direct factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation: rationale and design of the ROCKET AF study [^116Mdho3]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common significant cardiac arrhythmia, increases the risk of stroke, particularly in the elderly. Warfarin is effective in reducing stroke risk but is burdensome to patients and is difficult to control. Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor in advanced development as an alternative to warfarin for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.

Methods

ROCKET AF is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, event-driven trial, which aims to establish the noninferiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF who have a history of stroke or at least 2 additional independent risk factors for future stroke. Patients are randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban, 20 mg once daily (od), or dose-adjusted warfarin titrated to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0, inclusive) using point-of-care INR devices to receive true or sham INR values, depending on the study drug allocation. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of all-cause stroke and noncentral nervous system systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events. Over 14,000 patients have been randomized at 1,100 sites across 45 countries, and will be followed until 405 primary outcome events are observed.

Conclusion

The ROCKET AF study will determine the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban as an alternative to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with AF.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^111Sqney]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from XARELTO to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Left atrial thrombus formation after brief interruption of rivaroxaban [^115ChGzK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Every year, nearly 250000 atrial fibrillation patients require temporary interruption of anticoagulation therapy for invasive procedures, acute illness, or bleeding events. Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant that works by inhibiting factor Xa leading to a blockage of thrombin production, which inhibits platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. As with other anticoagulants, there is an increased risk of a thrombotic event occurring when rivaroxaban therapy is temporarily interrupted (TI) or prematurely discontinued. The 30-day rate of stroke or systemic embolism for rivaroxaban TI is 0.36%. Possible factors for higher than expected rates of embolic events include a prothrombotic perioperative environment among patients having TI for surgery and a prothrombotic environment associated with TI due to bleeding. The ROCKET AF study showed that there was no detectable difference in the risk of stroke and systemic embolism for participants treated with rivaroxaban vs warfarin undergoing TI. Another analysis suggested that the risk for stroke from TI is probably higher in the rivaroxaban group with 3 to 30 days discontinuation. Alternative anticoagulation therapy such as bridging should always be considered when stopping rivaroxaban.

AZD0837 — mechanism, pharmacokinetics, formulations, and phase 2 findings in atrial fibrillation: AZD0837 is a prodrug metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to AR-H067637, a selective and reversible direct inhibitor of thrombin; the half-life of AR-H067637 is 9 to 14 h in healthy subjects, and AZD0837 and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and the feces. The oral bioavailability of AZD0837 is in the range of 22% to 55%, with plasma levels peaking about 1.5 h after oral administration, and coadministration with food prolongs the time to peak by about 2 h. Both immediate-release and extended-release formulations have been developed, the extended-release form having potential for once-daily administration, and both formulations have been explored as alternatives to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. In a phase 2 study, the immediate release formulation (in doses of 150 or 350 mg) was compared with warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR of 2–3) in 250 patients; total bleeding events occurred in six patients at 150 mg, 15 at 350 mg, and eight with warfarin, and elevations in alanine aminotransferase were infrequent with similar rates to warfarin. An extended-release study compared 150, 300, and 450 mg once daily and 200 mg bid with warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR between 2.0 and 3.0) in 955 patients, with total bleeding events 5.3% to 14.7% with AZD0837 and 14.5% with warfarin; adverse events were similar overall, but gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea and nausea, were more frequent with AZD0837, and alanine aminotransferase elevations were similar. A second phase 2 study compared 150 or 300 mg once daily with standard therapy (nothing, aspirin, or clopidogrel) in 131 patients unwilling or unable to take a vitamin K antagonist for a median duration of 6 weeks; minor or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in none at 150 mg, five at 300 mg, and six with standard therapy, with no major bleeding events. Side effects of AZD0837 include dyspepsia and a reversible elevation in the serum creatinine level that appears to be the result of decreased inhibition of the tubular secretion of creatinine, and phase 3 trials have not yet been initiated.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^1138F3rb]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anticoagulants are a widely prescribed class of drugs used in both medical and surgical settings. In 2015 alone, 14.6 million prescriptions were dispensed in the community in England, the associated cost was over £222 million which represented an increase of £84 million on the previous year.

Oral anticoagulants include indirectly acting coumarin-derived oral anticoagulants, notably warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. In the UK, ~1.25 million patients receive long term oral anticoagulation, and worldwide warfarin remains the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant; however warfarin has now been superseded by apixaban as the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant in primary care in England. Parenteral anticoagulants include indirect acting unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), fondaparinux, and the less frequently prescribed direct acting drugs such as bivalirudin and argatroban.

Anticoagulants are primarily indicated in the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the prophylaxis of systemic (arterial) thromboembolism in predisposing conditions including atrial fibrillation (AF), following a mechanical heart valve implantation, and in constitutive thrombophilic conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome. Heuristically, parenteral anticoagulants are preferred for short term inpatient anticoagulation, whilst oral anticoagulants are indicated in longer term outpatient anticoagulation.

Clinically, it is evident that patients can respond differently to the same drug. Precision medicine is a therapeutic paradigm that aspires to tailor drug and/or dose selection to specific patient subgroups to enhance drug efficacy and/or minimise harm. There are three main facets to the precise use of therapeutics. First, patients warranting drug intervention need to be identified. For symptomatic conditions patients usually self-present, but asymptomatic conditions require screening. Opportunistic screening for AF for example increases overall AF detection, and the use of novel technologies may further facilitate and improve (paroxysmal) AF screening. Second, optimisation of physician conformity to existing therapeutic guidelines is required. For example, ~50% of patients with AF do not receive anticoagulation and of these patients, 25% have no documented reason, suggesting notable anticoagulant underuse. Further initiatives to understand the barriers limiting guideline adherence are necessary.

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116LPtpz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause.

Results

The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.95; P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P < 0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P = 0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P < 0.001), and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P = 0.42).

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer; ARISTOTLE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00412984.).

Introduction

Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading cause of potentially preventable death among trauma patients. Early coagulation abnormalities are frequent in severely injured trauma patients and are associated with substantially increased mortality. Patients' tendency towards perioperative and trauma-induced bleeding is further increased by anticoagulant medication. The direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is administered orally as the pro-drug dabigatran etexilate (DE) and is characterised by a rapid onset of action, few drug or food interactions, no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring and a short half-life of 12 to 14 hours.

Dabigatran is approved in many countries for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective total hip or total knee replacement surgery, and/or for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran directly inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin, and this impedes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thus preventing thrombus development. Results from a large multicentre randomised controlled trial including 18,113 patients with atrial fibrillation (RE-LY) suggest a low overall risk of bleeding complications. Because of this and the fact that clinical use of DOACs began relatively recently, experience in the management of bleeding complications associated with DOACs is limited. However, in the case of life-threatening bleeding following injury, immediate and prompt reversal of anticoagulation is required. At the present time, no specific antidotes are licensed for reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran.
