## Question

Why are the BHF PROTECT-TAVI results clinically significant for adopting cerebral embolic protection in TAVI, considering the confidence interval and event rates?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the BHF PROTECT-TAVI results are clinically significant for adopting cerebral embolic protection in TAVI, with attention to the confidence interval and event rates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and primary outcome. Then, I should verify the exact event rates and confidence interval. Next, I will interpret the statistical and clinical implications of those results. After that, I need to consider secondary outcomes and safety. Then, I should compare these findings with prior randomized data and meta-analyses. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical significance and translate this into practical recommendations for practice and future research.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and primary endpoint so I don't misstate anything. BHF PROTECT-TAVI was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-outcome-adjudicated trial that assigned 7,635 patients undergoing TAVI to routine SENTINEL CEP versus no CEP, with the primary outcome of stroke within 72 hours or before discharge, which is the same window used in PROTECTED TAVR and facilitates head-to-head comparability [^21ceb191] [^c2c137cf].

> I should double-check the exact event rates and confidence interval. In the intention-to-treat analysis, stroke occurred in 81 of 3,795 patients (2.1%) with CEP versus 82 of 3,799 patients (2.2%) without CEP, yielding an absolute difference of −0.02 percentage points with a 95% CI of −0.68 to 0.63 and a P value of 0.94, indicating no statistically significant benefit [^21ceb191] [^55c60149].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to interpret what this confidence interval means clinically. The 95% CI crosses zero and is very narrow, which tells us that if there is any true effect, it is likely extremely small — on the order of fractions of a percent — and far below any clinically meaningful absolute risk reduction. In other words, the data effectively exclude a clinically important benefit, and the posterior probability that CEP reduces stroke by a clinically relevant margin is essentially zero in Bayesian syntheses, reinforcing that routine use is unlikely to help patients [^6c0eacee] [^9bd1c59c].

> Next, I should review secondary outcomes to ensure there isn't a signal I'm missing. Disabling stroke occurred in 1.2% with CEP versus 1.4% without CEP, again not statistically significant, and death within 72 hours was 0.8% with CEP versus 0.7% without CEP, with no significant difference in composite death or stroke either, so there is no rescue signal in these secondary endpoints [^21ceb191] [^55c60149].

> I need to check safety and device delivery metrics. Serious adverse events related to the device were uncommon but numerically higher with CEP (0.6% vs 0.3%), and overall access-site complications were similar, while successful deployment was achieved in 81% of those assigned to CEP, which is lower than the 94% seen in PROTECTED TAVR and reminds me that real-world deployment success can limit effectiveness even if benefit existed, which it does not here [^21ceb191] [^c2c137cf].

> Let me consider the broader evidence base so I don't overgeneralize from a single trial. PROTECTED TAVR, the other large RCT, also found no significant reduction in the primary stroke endpoint (2.3% vs 2.9%; 95% CI, −1.7 to 0.5; P = 0.30), though a prespecified analysis suggested fewer disabling strokes, a finding that must be interpreted cautiously given multiplicity and lack of power for that endpoint [^c2c137cf]. Pooled meta-analyses of randomized trials consistently show no significant reduction in all-cause stroke or disabling stroke, and trial sequential analyses indicate that the current RCT corpus is underpowered to detect modest effects, yet the point estimates and CIs make a clinically important benefit unlikely with current devices [^f3688ccb] [^36f24630] [^3921e188].

> But wait, what if imaging surrogates tell a different story? MRI studies show that CEP can reduce lesion number or volume in protected territories, yet these imaging benefits have not translated into consistent reductions in clinical stroke across large RCTs, which is a classic disconnect between surrogate and hard outcomes and argues against routine adoption based on imaging alone [^459594e8] [^d570b46f] [^c2c137cf].

> I should confirm the clinical significance now. The BHF PROTECT-TAVI results are clinically significant because they provide high-quality, adequately powered evidence that routine SENTINEL CEP does not reduce periprocedural stroke in unselected TAVI patients, and the narrow CI essentially rules out a clinically meaningful benefit. This shifts the balance of evidence toward not recommending routine CEP use outside of trials, especially given added complexity, cost, and the lack of consistent signals in cognition or mortality [^21ceb191] [^6c0eacee] [^9bd1c59c].

> Let me translate this into practice. Routine use of SENTINEL CEP should not be adopted for all-comers undergoing TAVI. Instead, use should be limited to clinical trials, registries, or carefully selected scenarios where anatomy and risk profile might theoretically favor benefit, while we continue to investigate whether subgroups (for example, bicuspid valves, heavy arch calcification, or prior stroke) could derive meaningful benefit from CEP or from next-generation devices with broader cerebral coverage [^21ceb191] [^1b65b16e] [^31655734].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the totality of evidence. The convergence of BHF PROTECT-TAVI and PROTECTED TAVR, together with meta-analytic data, establishes that current-generation filter-based CEP does not reduce clinical stroke in routine TAVI, and the narrow confidence intervals around near-zero differences make a clinically important benefit implausible. Therefore, the clinical significance of BHF PROTECT-TAVI is that it closes the loop on routine CEP adoption and redirects effort toward better risk stratification, device innovation, and selective strategies rather than blanket use [^21ceb191] [^c2c137cf] [^6c0eacee].

The BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial shows that routine cerebral embolic protection (CEP) during TAVI **does not reduce stroke** [^21ceb191] or **cognitive decline** [^f8a14baf] compared with standard care. Stroke rates were 2.1% with CEP vs 2.2% without (difference −0.02%; 95% CI −0.68 to 0.63; P = 0.94) [^21ceb191], and cognitive outcomes were likewise unchanged [^f8a14baf]. The 95% CI is narrow and crosses zero, indicating **no clinically meaningful benefit** [^6c0eacee]. These results, aligned with PROTECTED TAVR [^c2c137cf], indicate CEP should not be used routinely in TAVI outside trials or select high-risk cases [^4adc5efe].

---

## Primary outcome: stroke incidence

- **Stroke rates**: 2.1% with CEP vs 2.2% without (difference −0.02%; 95% CI −0.68 to 0.63; P = 0.94) [^21ceb191].
- **Disabling stroke**: 1.2% with CEP vs 1.4% without (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.60–1.31) [^55c60149].
- **Confidence interval**: Narrow and crossing zero, indicating no significant benefit [^6c0eacee].

---

## Secondary outcome: cognitive function

Cognitive function was assessed with the telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA) at 6–8 weeks [^f8a14baf]; **mean change** was 0.83 with CEP vs 0.91 without (difference −0.07; 95% CI −0.22 to 0.09; P = 0.42) [^f8a14baf], and **≥ 3-point decline** occurred in 8.7% with CEP vs 8.0% without (risk difference 0.72%; 95% CI −1.10 to 2.55; P = 0.44) [^d4fa56d4].

---

## Clinical significance of confidence intervals

The 95% CI for the primary outcome (−0.68% to 0.63%) is narrow and includes zero, indicating **no statistically significant or clinically meaningful benefit** [^6c0eacee]. This precision allows us to exclude even modest benefits, supporting the conclusion that routine CEP does not improve stroke outcomes [^6c0eacee].

---

## Comparison with previous studies

The PROTECTED TAVR trial (n = 3,000) found no significant reduction in stroke with CEP (2.3% vs 2.9%; difference −0.6%; 95% CI −1.7 to 0.5; P = 0.30) [^c2c137cf]. Meta-analyses likewise show **no significant reduction** in stroke or cognitive decline with CEP [^f3688ccb] [^748fe595].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended given lack of benefit [^6c0eacee].
- **Selective use**: Consider in high-risk patients (e.g. prior stroke, severe calcification) or in trials [^4adc5efe].
- **Future research**: Focus on identifying subgroups that may benefit and on improving device coverage and deployment [^9bd1c59c].

---

## Limitations of the study

- **Device coverage**: Sentinel covers only 9 of 28 brain regions, limiting protection [^31655734].
- **Deployment success**: 81% successful deployment; failures may blunt benefit [^3497a11f].
- **Follow-up**: Short-term cognitive follow-up may miss delayed effects [^f4809617].

---

The BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial demonstrates that routine CEP during TAVI **does not reduce stroke or cognitive decline** [^21ceb191] [^f8a14baf]. The narrow 95% CI that includes zero supports the conclusion of no clinically meaningful benefit [^6c0eacee]. Therefore, routine CEP use is not recommended outside trials or select high-risk cases [^4adc5efe].

Background

Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with procedure-related stroke. Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices may reduce embolization to the cerebral circulation and hence the incidence of stroke.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial across 33 centers in the United Kingdom. We randomly assigned 7635 participants with aortic stenosis in a 1:1 ratio to undergo TAVI with a CEP device (CEP group) or TAVI without a CEP device (control group). The primary outcome was stroke within 72 hours after TAVI or before discharge from the hospital (if discharge occurred sooner).

Results

A total of 3815 participants were assigned to the CEP group and 3820 to the control group. A primary-outcome event occurred in 81 of 3795 participants (2.1%) in the CEP group and in 82 of 3799 participants (2.2%) in the control group (difference, -0.02 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.68 to 0.63; P = 0.94). Disabling stroke occurred in 47 participants (1.2%) in the CEP group and in 53 (1.4%) in the control group. Death occurred in 29 participants (0.8%) in the CEP group and in 26 (0.7%) in the control group. Overall access-site complications appeared to be similar in the two groups (8.1% in the CEP group and 7.7% in the control group). A total of 24 serious adverse events occurred in 22 of 3798 participants (0.6%) in the CEP group, and 13 serious adverse events occurred in 13 of 3803 participants (0.3%) in the control group.

Conclusions

Among participants undergoing TAVI, routine use of CEP did not decrease the incidence of stroke within 72 hours. (Funded by the British Heart Foundation and Boston Scientific; BHF PROTECT-TAVI ISRCTN Registry number, ISRCTN16665769.).

METHODS

Trial Design and Oversight

This is a secondary analysis of the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial, a UK-based prospective, open-label, blinded, outcome-adjudicated, multicenter, superiority parallel group, randomized, controlled trial. The BHF PROTECT-TAVI (registered on ISRCTN on June 23, 2020; URL:; unique identifier: ISRCTN16665769) trial design, analysis plan, and main results have been published previously. The trial evaluated the routine use of the SENTINEL CEP device (Boston Scientific) to prevent stroke in participants with aortic valve stenosis undergoing TAVI. The trial was investigator initiated and approved by the UK Health Research Authority (REC 20/WA/0121, IRAS276396). The British Heart Foundation (BHF clinical study No. CS/20/1/34732) funded the trial. Boston Scientific provided the SENTINEL CEP devices through an investigator-sponsored research grant (ISRCAR00332) but was not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of the trial. An independent trial steering committee (TSC) and data monitoring committee (DMC) oversaw the trial. An independent clinical events committee blinded to treatment allocation adjudicated the main trial's primary outcome of stroke. Patients were involved in the design of the trial, and 2 patient representatives served as independent members of the TSC. The trial was sponsored by University of Oxford. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Clinical Trials Unit coordinated the trial and performed the statistical analyses. The first authors drafted this manuscript, with all authors contributing to revisions and approving the submission for publication.

Participants

We enrolled trial participants with aortic stenosis who were scheduled to undergo TAVI and, in the opinion of the treating physician, were clinically and anatomically suitable for treatment with SENTINEL CEP. All participants were ≥ 18 years of age and provided written informed consent to participate in the trial. There were no specific exclusion criteria. The participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to undergo TAVI with SENTINEL CEP (CEP group) or without SENTINEL CEP (control group). Randomization was stratified according to trial site with the use of random permuted blocks (sizes 4 and 6). An independent statistician from Sealed Envelope Ltd (UK) prepared the randomization codes, and randomization was done via the secure Sealed Envelope website.

### Routine cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic-valve implantation [^55c60149]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study BHF PROTECT-TAVI was published by Rajesh K Kharbanda and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the trial question was: what is the effect of routine use of a cerebral embolic protection device in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI? In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the population was: 7601 patients (2945 female, 4656 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI. The key exclusion criteria were anatomically unsuitable for treatment with cerebral embolic protection device; clinical contraindications to the use of cerebral embolic protection device. In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the interventions were: n = 3798 cerebral embolic protection device (TAVI with a sentinel cerebral embolic protection device) n = 3803 no cerebral embolic protection device (TAVI without a sentinel cerebral embolic protection device). In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in stroke within 72 hours after TAVI or before discharge (2.1% vs. 2.2%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.73 to 1.34). In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of disabling stroke within 6–8 weeks after TAVI (1.2% vs. 1.4%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.31) No significant difference in severe stroke within 72 hours after TAVI or before discharge (0.5% vs. 0.5%; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.8) No significant difference in death or stroke within 72 hours after TAVI or before discharge (2.8% vs. 2.7%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.36). In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical complications and adverse events. In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI, cerebral embolic protection device was not superior to no cerebral embolic protection device with respect to stroke within 72 hours after TAVI or before discharge.

### Cerebral embolic protection by geographic region… [^3576c9b9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In this post hoc analysis, patients treated with CEP in the US cohort exhibited a 50% relative risk reduction for overall stroke and a 73% relative risk reduction for disabling stroke compared to TAVR alone; a treatment effect on stroke risk reduction was not observed in the OUS cohort. Conclusion and Relevance. The incidence of clinical stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge was significantly lower with use of CEP compared with TAVR alone group in the US cohort. The results of this post hoc analysis of the PROTECTED TAVR randomized clinical trial suggest that regional differences in procedural practices and patient characteristics may influence the effectiveness of the CEP in reducing TAVR-related stroke.

The use of CEP in the US cohort was associated with a 50% relative risk reduction in stroke rate at discharge or 72 hours and a 73% relative reduction in disabling stroke compared to TAVR alone, while a treatment effect on stroke risk reduction was not observed in the OUS cohort. The PROTECTED TAVR study found a 19% relative reduction in the primary end point of stroke at hospital discharge or 72 hours with CEP use; however, the difference in stroke rate between the CEP group and the control group was not statistically significant. 22 Despite this, a prespecified analysis revealed a 62% relative reduction in disabling stroke for the CEP group, an outcome that may be more meaningful for both patients and the health care system.

A recent comprehensive analysis of data from the TVT registry reporting on more than 400 000 patients undergoing TAVR in the US demonstrated CEP was associated with significant reductions in both in-hospital stroke and disabling stroke, as well as a 13% relative risk reduction for in-hospital disabling stroke with the use of CEP. 23 While there are limitations to inference from observational studies, the authors used several techniques to attempt to mitigate confounding and mimic randomization, including instrumental variable analysis.

Statistical Analysis

BHF PROTECT-TAVI had a calculated sample size of 7730 participants that would have 80% power at a 5% significance level to show the superiority of SENTINEL CEP if the incidence of stroke by 72 hours (or hospital discharge if discharge was sooner) was 3% in the control group and 2% in the CEP group, allowing for a 1% loss to follow-up. After a third interim analysis, the data monitoring committee recommended to the TSC that the trial discontinue enrollment, as the prespecified futility criterion had been met. Enrollment was discontinued on October 9, 2024, after the randomization of 7635 participants. The trial is expected to complete follow-up in November 2025.

During the trial, it became clear to the Trial Management Group that the collection of multiple MoCA assessments for each participant was resource intensive, and, to maximize recruitment for the primary outcome analysis, a proposal to stop collection of MoCA data was developed on the basis of blinded data from 4701 participants randomized up to July 21, 2023. Given that the primary outcome analysis was powered to detect differences in stroke incidence and based on low events rates, for continuous MoCA outcomes, BHF PROTECT-TAVI would provide additional power to detect even small differences between trial arms. Power calculations were submitted to the TSC based on these data, including the combined SDs at each time point and correlations between time points. As an example, a study population of 390 participants would give 90% power to detect a difference of 1 point on the MoCA with a conservative SD of 3.5 and correlation of 0.5 between baseline and follow-up. The proposal was accepted by the TSC, the trial protocol was amended, and MoCA data collection was stopped.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^f4809617]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

In this analysis, we used a change in MoCA score as the primary outcome to detect differences between the assigned treatment groups. However, it is important to consider how changes in MoCA score may be interpreted and the difference between the minimal detectable change at a population level and what may be clinically significant at an individual level. Although there is ongoing debate about the precise threshold, a change of 3 points is generally regarded as a robust threshold change for an individual, beyond normal testing variability. – In the primary analysis, small improvements in MoCA score were observed after TAVI, with corresponding CIs that were narrow and excluded differences large enough to be considered clinically significant. When a drop of at least 3 points was assessed, results were consistent with the primary analysis. Both analyses suggest no evidence of a clinically meaningful effect of CEP on cognitive function.

An important point to note, relevant for clinical practice, is that only approximately 1% of participants reported a history of cognitive impairment or dementia to research staff. While acknowledging that cognition was not the primary focus of BHF PROTECT-TAVI and that the baseline full MoCA scores were not population standardized, just > 50% of participants in this study had a full MoCA score of ≤ 25, much more in keeping with previous estimates of the incidence of mild cognitive impairment, at around a third of patients with severe aortic stenosis scheduled for TAVI. Both patient, and physician, factors have been implicated in the underreporting of impaired cognition. These findings point to the need to improve the identification of those with mild cognitive impairment in a cardiovascular clinic setting that may help anticipate the risk of post-TAVI complications, such as delirium.

Limitations of this study include the use of a single tool to assess cognitive function, the short timeframe for follow-up assessment, and loss to follow-up of a proportion of participants. Nevertheless, this is one of the largest reported series of MoCA assessments in a TAVI cohort and will inform future work in this area.

In this secondary analysis of the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial, the use of SENTINEL CEP did not impact cognition, as measured by t-MoCA after TAVI. Most participants' cognition was unchanged 6 to 8 weeks after TAVI. There was around 4 times the rate of a decline of 3 or more in total t-MoCA as stroke outcomes, pointing to the ongoing need to understand the long-term effects of central nervous system outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^f8a14baf]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

In addition to the risk of stroke, patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are susceptible to a decline of neurocognitive function. This may occur because of embolization of material (eg, valve or calcium) to the brain. Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices are engineered to capture this debris, potentially mitigating its incidence.

METHODS:

This is a secondary analysis of the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial (British Heart Foundation Randomized Trial of Routine Cerebral Embolic Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation), in which participants with aortic stenosis from across 33 centers in the United Kingdom were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to undergo TAVI with a CEP device (SENTINEL, Boston Scientific; SENTINEL CEP group) or TAVI without a CEP device (control group). This analysis is restricted to those who underwent cognitive assessment. The primary outcome was the mean change in the telephone version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA) between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks after TAVI. The secondary outcome was a ≥ 3-point drop in total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks after TAVI.

RESULTS:

A total of 3535 participants, 1763 in the SENTINEL CEP group and 1772 in the control group (mean age 81.0 years, 37.7% women) randomized in BHF PROTECT-TAVI were included in the modified intention-to-treat population for this analysis. The median t-MoCA at presentation was 18 (interquartile range, 16–20). The median t-MoCA at 6 to 8 weeks was 20 (interquartile range, 17–21). The mean change in total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks adjusted for the baseline score was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70–0.96) in the SENTINEL CEP group and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79–1.04) in the control group. There was no difference in means between the treatment groups (−0.07 [95% CI, −0.22 to 0.09], P = 0.42). The incidence of a ≥ 3-point drop in the total t-MoCA score was 154 of 1763 (8.7%) in the SENTINEL CEP group and 142 of 1772 (8.0%) in the control group. The corresponding risk difference was 0.72% (95% CI, −1.10 to 2.55; P = 0.44). These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. There was no evidence of an interaction between treatment assignment and any of the subgroups assessed.

CONCLUSIONS:

In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial, the use of CEP did not impact cognition after TAVI.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^672ef18a]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

MoCA data were available for 58 participants who had a stroke or transient ischemic attack 72 hours after TAVI (or hospital discharge if sooner) of 194 that occurred in the trial. Consequently, treatment effects for the primary outcome (difference in means, 1.25 [95% CI, −0.25 to 2.74]) and secondary outcome (risk difference, −21.7 [95% CI, −38.9 to −4.4]) among this cohort could not be estimated precisely and should be interpreted with caution.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^d17a1799]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

The choice of using an individual's change in total t-MoCA score over time as the primary outcome was to avoid the need for population standardization of the MoCA, as the participant would act as their own internal control for their age, education level, and other features that may affect performance during the assessment. No difference was seen in the primary outcome because the mean change in total t-MOCA increased similarly in both treatment arms. Similar improvements in cognitive function after TAVI have been identified before. – The reasons for this remain unclear. For instance, the recent CAPTIVA study (Cardiac Output, Cerebral Blood Flow and Cognition in Patients with Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) found no association between post-TAVI hemodynamic (cardiac output and cerebral blood flow) and cognitive change. Given the short time between testing, the identical MoCA version used, and the improvement in the delayed recall component, the increase in mean change in t-MoCA seen in BHF PROTECT-TAVI is most likely attributable to practice effects rather than a true cognitive improvement. The sensitivity analysis removing the delayed recall scores demonstrated no change in either treatment arm in mean t-MoCA scores with tight CIs, supporting previous observations that there is limited impact overall on cognition for most patients undergoing TAVI.

Overall, 8.4% of those undergoing cognitive assessment in BHF PROTECT-TAVI had a 3-point drop in the t-MoCA score. This matches the available evidence. This rate of cognitive decline is ≈4 times the adjudicated stroke rate seen in the control arm of BHF PROTECT-TAVI. The clinical and health economic implications for participants having this outcome will be explored upon completion of BHF PROTECT-TAVI and by long-term linkage to the UK National Health Service and other data sources.

Numerous tools are available for the assessment of cognitive function, but there is a lack of consensus about the optimal approach. MoCA is a widely used instrument in clinical studies. Compared with other cognitive screening tools, it is easy to administer and includes cognitive domains that make it effective in the setting of vascular cognitive impairment. The t-MoCA excludes tasks requiring visual or motor responses. One recent study has compared results from face-to-face MoCA 22 with t-MoCA and demonstrated that they are comparable.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction has long been acknowledged as a complication of cardiac surgery. As transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used as a treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis, so efforts to understand the incidence, risk factors, and longer-term consequences of cognitive changes have increased.

Two large randomized trials enrolling a combined total of > 10 000 participants have recently investigated the routine use of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) at the time of TAVI. Neither the PROTECTED TAVR nor the BHF PROTECT-TAVI (British Heart Foundation Randomized Trial of Routine Cerebral Embolic Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of stroke at 72 hours (or discharge if sooner), the primary outcome of each trial. In addition to the risk of stroke, CEP devices may mitigate the risk of a decline in neurocognitive function by capturing embolized debris (eg, valve or calcium). In this secondary analysis of the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial, we evaluated the change in cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)from baseline to 6 to 8 weeks after TAVI with CEP use.

Background

In addition to the risk of stroke, patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are susceptible to a decline in neurocognitive function. This may occur due to embolization of material (e.g., valve, calcium) to the brain. Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices are engineered to capture this debris, potentially mitigating its incidence.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial where participants with aortic stenosis from across 33 centers in the United Kingdom were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo TAVI with a CEP device (SENTINEL, Boston Scientific; Sentinel CEP group) or TAVI without a CEP device (control group). This analysis is restricted to those who underwent cognitive assessment. The primary outcome was the mean change in the telephone version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA) between baseline and 6–8 weeks post-TAVI. The secondary outcome was a ≥ 3-point drop in total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6–8 weeks post-TAVI.

Results

A total of 3535 participants,1763 in the Sentinel CEP group and 1772 in the Control group (mean age 81.0 years, 37.7% female) randomized in BHF PROTECT-TAVI were included in the modified ITT population for this analysis. The median t-MoCA at presentation was 18 (IQR: 16 to 20). The median t-MoCA at 6–8 weeks was 20 (IQR: 17 to 21). The mean change in total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6–8 weeks adjusted for the baseline score was 0.83 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) in the Sentinel CEP group, and 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.04) in the Control group. There was no difference in means between the treatment groups (-0.07; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.09; p = 0.42). The incidence of a ≥ 3-point drop in the total t-MoCA score was 154/1763 (8.7%) in the Sentinel CEP group and 142/1772 (8.0%) in the Control group. The corresponding RD was 0.72% (95% CI -1.10 to 2.55; p = 0.44). These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. There was no evidence for an interaction between treatment assignment and any of subgroups assessed.

Conclusions

In the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial, the use of CEP did not impact cognition following TAVI.

### Role of cerebral embolic protection devices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: an updated meta-analysis [^b3308355]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Although there are several theories that explain the failure of CEPD devices, in our opinion, factors that may contribute to the absence of notable clinical benefit with these devices can be largely categorized into patient‐related, periprocedural, trial‐design related, and device‐related factors. Individual patient factors like age, female sex, chronic kidney disease, and history of previous cerebrovascular disease have been associated with increased periprocedural stroke in TAVR. Although these factors may help us risk stratify our patients at risk for stroke, studies have been unable to identify consistent clinical predictors or a high‐risk population that may benefit from the selective use of CEPD, because many of these factors are inherently associated with higher risk of stroke outside of procedure‐related embolic phenomenon. So, even if we try to reduce embolism‐related stroke events through the use of CEPD, these residual factors may still contribute to stroke risk on short‐ or long‐term follow‐up. In addition, delayed periprocedural events that increase the risk of stroke including new onset atrial fibrillation, valve thrombosis, and plaque embolization would be unlikely to be affected by the intraprocedural use of CEPD. Furthermore, in real‐world practices unfavorable anatomy may preclude CEPD use in some patients especially those with poor radial access or torturous great vessels with high atherosclerotic burden. Therefore, it is possible that many of the patients who stand to benefit from CEPD the most might not even be candidates for these devices.

From a trial design perspective, it is important to note that sample size that was estimated to prove superiority of CEPD for one of the biggest trials (PROTECTED‐TAVR) was based on the assumption that the incidence of stroke was 4% in the control group and 2% in the CEPD group. But larger registry studies show that the rates of in‐hospital and 30‐day strokes after TAVR have decreased in the past decade to 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Thus, to prove statistical benefit of these devices we need studies with greater event rates or larger sample sizes. The ongoing BHF PROTECT‐TAVI (British Heart Foundation Randomized Trial of Routine Cerebral Embolic Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ISRCTN16665769) aims to recruit 7730 patients and is expected to be completed by 2026. The results from this large‐scale RCT may offer more insight on the benefit of CEPD in preventing strokes and improving mortality.

### Cerebral protection device effects on brain lesions after TAVI… [^d570b46f]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

For the primary end point, the number of new lesions was lower in the filter group, 4. 00 vs
10. 00 in the control group. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 100 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI, the use of a cerebral embolic protection device during the procedure significantly reduced the number of cerebral lesions in the potentially protected brain regions to 4 in the filter group vs 10 in the control group. Meaning Among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI, the use of a cerebral protection device reduced the frequency of ischemic cerebral lesions in potentially protected regions.

The Claret Embolic Protection and TAVI trial was a single-center, blinded, RCT performed at the Heart Center at the University of Leipzig, Germany. All patients provided written informed consent. Because the current study used a segmentation methodology to detect smaller lesions and a 3T MRI in the majority of the cases, it was anticipated that the absolute lesion number would be higher than previously reported. The primary hypothesis for clinically significant success was that the cerebral protection device would provide a 50% reduction in the number of positive DWMRI–perfused brain lesions following TAVI at 2 days relative to baseline in potentially protected territories. The median number of periprocedural high-intensity transient signals was 3196 in the filter group and 3674 in the control group.

TAVI resulted in improvement in aortic valve function and symptoms in both the control and filter groups. TAVI was associated with DWMRI-positive brain lesions, indicative of ischemic brain injury in almost every patient. However, use of a cerebral protection device during TAVI significantly reduced the number and volume of new lesions in the potentially protected regions and in the entire brain.

To be eligible for this analysis, the due date for the 6- to 8-week follow-up had to be before January 4, 2024, the date when the protocol amendment was issued.

The primary and secondary cognitive outcome measures were assessed on the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The modified ITT population included all randomized participants whose TAVI procedure was started, according to the group to which they were assigned, irrespective of whether they received the intervention as intended. The participant had to have a MoCA performed at baseline and at 6 to 8 weeks to be included in the modified ITT population. The TAVI procedure was considered to have started when the first arterial puncture was performed. The primary outcome was assessed using an analysis of covariance model adjusting for baseline t-MoCA scores. For the secondary outcome, risk differences were calculated using generalized linear models for binomial outcomes with an identity link function and without adjustment for baseline t-MoCA scores.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^31294de1]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this secondary analysis of the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial, we tested the effect of routine CEP on the incidence of cognitive change between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks in patients undergoing TAVI. When using the t-MoCA to assess change in overall cognitive status, there was no treatment effect seen in either the mean change in t-MoCA or when a threshold of a drop of ≥ 3 in total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks was used. Both results were robust to sensitivity analyses. No subgroup was identified as benefitting from the routine use of SENTINEL CEP during TAVI.

The MoCA enabled a simple overall cognitive assessment to be performed at each time point, validated to allow either face-to-face or telephone follow-up, which was essential, given that BHF PROTECT-TAVI recruited participants from across the whole of the United Kingdom. The use of a single MoCA version throughout and the absence of routine magentic resonance imaging for each patient was made to streamline trial procedures, allowing the BHF PROTECT-TAVI trial to maintain its primary focus on assessing the impact of SENTINEL CEP on stroke incidence after TAVI. These choices compromised the ability to explore the granularity of change across multiple cognitive domains (for example, MoCA has limited executive function testing) and the possible relationship of small brain infarcts to cognitive change. However, by the time MoCA data collection stopped, this focused approach had allowed the collection of the MoCA in > 3500 participants, a sample size large enough to have a power of > 90% to determine a possible treatment effect on overall cognitive status. Even so, we acknowledge that the attrition of participants over time because of death or loss to follow-up may have introduced selection bias.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^f4e06df3]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Several post hoc sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome was assessed after omitting the MoCA component with the greatest mean change from baseline to 6 to 8 weeks. For the secondary outcome, a complier average causal effect analysis was performed, using 2-stage least-squares instrumental variable regression to account for treatment nonadherence. The first stage of this analysis regressed treatment received on randomly assigned treatment, and the second stage regressed the primary outcome on the predicted probabilities of receiving SENTINEL CEP from the first stage. Additional sensitivity analyses included: (1) excluding participants with adjudicated stroke outcomes, (2) separate adjustment for absolute and relative hypotension, (3) multiple imputation of missing MoCA scores among the cohort with a single missing MoCA assessment at either baseline or 6 to 8 weeks, (4) reductions in the total t-MoCA of ≥ 2 and ≥ 4 between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks, (5) use of robust standard errors to provide additional protection against variance misspecification, and (6) participants who adhered to assigned treatment allocation using a per-protocol analysis. Multiple imputation by chained equations was used to create 20 imputed datasets, and results were combined using Rubin's rules. Imputations were performed separately in each treatment group using the following predictors: age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, CSHA (Canadian Study of Health and Aging) Clinical Frailty Scale, and t-MoCA scores at baseline, discharge, and 6 to 8 weeks.

### Cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^f39d41be]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our TSA findings were not able to confirm a significant portion of the results from a recently published meta‐analysis by Kaur et al. This meta‐analysis used random‐effects modeling to perform cMA, including the same 7 trials used in our study. No statistically significant differences in all strokes, disabling stroke, and all‐cause mortality were determined. Additional trial data are required for the remaining outcomes to achieve conclusive meta‐analytic evidence. The British Heart Foundation's Stroke PROTECTion With SEntinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (PROTECTED‐TAVI) trial is currently ongoing and intends to recruit 7730 patients.

Another option is Bayesian analysis, which starts with prior assumptions and adjusts these beliefs based on the data collected during the study. By providing a probabilistic framework for treatment effects and their clinical relevance, Bayesian analysis can provide a more nuanced interpretation of pooled RCT data. A recent meta‐analysis by Heuts et al used a Bayesian framework to determine the effects of CEPD use on disabling stroke. This analysis determined a high probability of a beneficial effect of CEPD use on disabling stroke but a low probability that the benefit was clinically relevant. The standard of clinical relevance was set at a 1.1% absolute risk reduction based on prior literature. The different interpretations of our TSA and the Bayesian analysis highlight the importance of different statistical approaches along with the limitations of relying solely on statistical significance derived from cMA.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^3c871165]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The present analysis was performed according to published PRISMA guidance. We prospectively registered the analysis at the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020214106). Ethical approval was not applicable in this case.

We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases from December 2010 through October 2020 for all randomized trials comparing cerebral embolic protection to control during TAVI. Our search strings included ("severe aortic stenosis" OR "severe symptomatic aortic stenosis") AND ("transcatheter aortic valve implantation" OR "transcatheter aortic valve replacement") AND ("embolic protection") OR ("cerebral protection"). We hand-searched the bibliographies of selected studies and meta-analyses to identify further eligible studies. There were no language restrictions. We also reviewed abstracts presented at conferences. Abstracts were reviewed for suitability and articles accordingly retrieved. Two independent authors performed the search and literature screening (YA and JH), with disputes resolved by consensus.

### Cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic-valve replacement [^c2c137cf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) for the treatment of aortic stenosis can lead to embolization of debris. Capture of debris by devices that provide cerebral embolic protection (CEP) may reduce the risk of stroke.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with aortic stenosis in a 1:1 ratio to undergo transfemoral TAVR with CEP (CEP group) or without CEP (control group). The primary end point was stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge (whichever came first) in the intention-to-treat population. Disabling stroke, death, transient ischemic attack, delirium, major or minor vascular complications at the CEP access site, and acute kidney injury were also assessed. A neurology professional examined all the patients at baseline and after TAVR.

Results

A total of 3000 patients across North America, Europe, and Australia underwent randomization; 1501 were assigned to the CEP group and 1499 to the control group. A CEP device was successfully deployed in 1406 of the 1489 patients (94.4%) in whom an attempt was made. The incidence of stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge did not differ significantly between the CEP group and the control group (2.3% vs. 2.9%; difference, -0.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.7 to 0.5; P = 0.30). Disabling stroke occurred in 0.5% of the patients in the CEP group and in 1.3% of those in the control group. There were no substantial differences between the CEP group and the control group in the percentage of patients who died (0.5% vs. 0.3%); had a stroke, a transient ischemic attack, or delirium (3.1% vs. 3.7%); or had acute kidney injury (0.5% vs. 0.5%). One patient (0.1%) had a vascular complication at the CEP access site.

Conclusions

Among patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR, the use of CEP did not have a significant effect on the incidence of periprocedural stroke, but on the basis of the 95% confidence interval around this outcome, the results may not rule out a benefit of CEP during TAVR.

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^11e98907]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of the present meta‐analysis can be summarized as follows:
The use of EPD during TAVI is not associated with reduced mortality.
The use of EPD during TAVI is associated with a lower rate of 30‐day stroke: This result is driven by study registries and is not confirmed when considering randomized controlled trials separately.
The use of EPD during TAVI is not associated with a reduced rate of new lesions as assessed by MRI.
The use of EPD during TAVI is associated with a smaller volume of single lesions and smaller total volume of lesions.

Of note, all these point estimates are affected by very large confidence intervals, meaning that any conclusive statement would be rather inappropriate from a methodological point of view.

The issue of cerebrovascular complications in the context of the TAVI procedure is well known since the first reports, and it was confirmed by the major randomized trials that compared TAVI versus surgery in high‐ and moderate‐risk patients. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 These trials focused on the rate of "clinically relevant" cerebrovascular accidents and obviously prompted the ideation and introduction of EPD currently in use or under investigation.

On the other hand, the availability of these devices spurred the cardiological community to increase the use of MRI to assess patients after TAVI, thus leading to the publication of several randomized studies and/or registries specifically focusing on cerebral embolic protection. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 All these studies, regardless of the design, arterial access, type of prosthesis, and the EPD, consistently showed that the rate of silent new ischemic cerebral lesions (as high as 80%) is much higher than the rate of clinically relevant cerebrovascular events (2–6%). 22 Long‐term consequences of these lesions are still unclear, but increasing evidence suggests that they represent silent brain infarctions that could be related to memory loss, cognitive decline, and dementia. 23

RESULTS

Participant Enrollment

A total of 5368 participants were eligible for this secondary analysis. The modified ITT population comprised 1763 in the SENTINEL CEP group and 1772 in the control group (Figure 1). No MoCA was collected at either baseline or at 6 to 8 weeks on 419 participants. The reasons leading to the MoCA not being collected at baseline and at 6 to 8 weeks follow-up are listed by treatment arm in. The multiple imputation population included 2482 in the SENTINEL CEP group and 2467 in the control group. Both filters of the SENTINEL CEP device were fully and correctly deployed for the duration of the procedure in 1418 of 1751 participants (81.0%, 12 with missing data) allocated to the SENTINEL CEP group.

Flow diagram. t-MoCA indicates telephone version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

The baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and procedural details of the modified ITT and multiple imputation populations are shown in Table 1 and, respectively. These were balanced between the groups, apart from the incidence of reported history of coronary artery disease, which was higher in the SENTINEL CEP group (641/1691 [37.9%]) compared with the control group (586/1693 [34.6%], P = 0.049). The mean age (SD) was 81.0 (6.5) years, and 37.7% of participants were women. As with the main trial, the study cohort was broadly representative of the UK population undergoing TAVI, except that participants from minority ethnic groups were underrepresented (1.7% in this study compared with 4.1% people having TAVI in the United Kingdom). Participants excluded from the modified ITT population were, on average, younger, less likely to have a previous stroke or severe aortic valve calcification and less likely to have a history of congestive heart failure or peripheral vascular disease than those included.

Baseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics of the Modified Intention-to-Treat Population

The incidence of death within 8 weeks after TAVI was similar in the control (50/2679, 1.9%) and SENTINEL CEP (51/2680, 1.9%) groups.

### Sex differences in stroke frequency and severity following transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^c3210fb4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings regarding differences in stroke and disabling stroke by sex have potentially important clinical implications. Specifically, as clinicians counsel patients regarding treatment options for aortic stenosis, they should be aware that women may face a heightened risk of disabling stroke, which carries significant prognostic and quality‐of‐life implications. This underscores the potential value of investigating tailored procedural strategies, such as the use of EPDs in women given their potential association with a reduction in disabling stroke in particular. Although the BHF PROTECT‐TAVI (British Heart Foundation Randomised Trial of Routine Cerebral Embolic Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial did not show any difference in all stroke or disabling stroke with EPD use, an individual patient data pooled meta‐analysis of BHF PROTECT‐TAVI and PROTECTED TAVR (Stroke Protection With Sentinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) did show a reduction in disabling stroke with EPD use in an age‐ and sex‐adjusted per protocol analysis when the device was deployed successfully. Further investigation into sex differences in efficacy of EPD use for disabling stroke may be warranted. More broadly, exploring whether targeted interventions to mitigate these risks, including individualized procedural planning, could improve outcomes for female TAVR patients remains a rich area for future inquiry.

Our results should be interpreted in context of their limitations. First, as a retrospective analysis, our findings are subject to the limitations inherent in administrative databases, including potential coding errors, absence of detailed clinical information such as surgical risk, procedure duration, periprocedural antithrombotic therapy, or use of therapies such as thrombolytics, and unmeasured confounding variables. Second, our definition of disabling stroke, although validated, relies on discharge disposition as a proxy for functional outcomes, which may not fully capture stroke‐related disability. It is possible that sex differences in stroke reporting or in discharge disposition independent of stroke could contribute to observed findings. Third, we were unable to assess long‐term outcomes or stroke severity beyond the in‐hospital period, though the acute period is more likely to reflect procedure‐related strokes relative to the longer term, during which sex differences in baseline stroke risk at the population level may be more dominant.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^4adc5efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

This is a study-level analysis, so we could not delineate whether there are subgroups of patients who may benefit from embolic protection. It is possible that there are certain higher-risk features which may lead to benefit with cerebral protection, such as prior stroke, heavy aortic arch calcification or heavy valve calcification. An individual patient data meta-analysis may help to illuminate some of these points. We also did not perform subgroup analysis by type of embolic protection device or type of TAVI valve, due to the small number of trials and patients.

One of the included trials has not yet been published; if the results change significantly in the published manuscript, we will update this analysis accordingly.

Finally, our analysis only includes randomized trials which typically enroll a much narrower spectrum of patients than those seen in clinical practice. Although this can potentially limit the broader applicability of RCTs and meta-analysis of these trials, randomization is the only way to compare the efficacy and safety of competing therapies without the impact of bias from both measured and unmeasured confounding factors. Our analysis is also broadly consistent with a recent large-scale observational dataset using instrumental variable methodology to approximate randomization.

In conclusion, cerebral embolic protection during TAVI is safe but there is no evidence of a statistically significant benefit on clinical outcomes or neuroimaging parameters. The use of cerebral embolic protection during TAVI should be restricted to randomized clinical trials, or in selected high-risk cases where clinical judgement suggests a role.

### When absence of evidence equates to evidence of absence: the case of routine use of cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^6c0eacee]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This updated hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis aims to integrate the latest randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into previously available data, providing a definite answer to the clinical effectiveness of CEP in TAVI patients.

Methods

A systematic search was updated on 31 March 2025. RCTs were included when comparing transfemoral TAVI with use of CEP versus transfemoral TAVI without CEP. The primary outcome was all stroke, while the secondary outcome was disabling stroke. A hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis was performed on the (log) relative risk (RR) scale and transformed to absolute risk differences (ARDs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs). The threshold for clinical relevance was based on published expert consensus and established on 1.1% ARD (NNT 91).

Results

The study was updated with one new RCT, totalling a number of eight RCTs (n = 11590, CEP n = 5921 patients, control n = 5669 patients). The prevalence of all stroke and disabling stroke was 2.9% and 1.4% in the control group. The median RR for all stroke was 0.94 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.72–1.25), translating to a mean of -0.17% ARD (NNT 588), and a posterior probability of a clinically relevant CEP effect of < 1%. The median RR for disabling stroke was 0.76 (95% CrI 0.44–1.23), translating to a mean of -0.36% ARD (NNT 278), and a posterior probability of a clinically relevant CEP effect of < 1%.

Conclusion

Current-generation CEP devices are ineffective in reducing periprocedural TAVI-stroke risk to a clinically relevant degree, rendering future trials with these devices futile.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^704932fa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, encompassing the totality of the randomized trial data for cerebral embolic protection during TAVI, we have shown that there is currently not a detectible statistically significant benefit of cerebral protection in terms of clinical stroke, and nor is there a statistically significant reduction in terms of total lesion volume or new cerebral lesions on MRI. The use of cerebral embolic protection appears to be safe, with no significant increase in any adverse event.

Despite significant advancements in TAVI technology and techniques, stroke rates have been largely static. The TVT registry has shown no significant decline for in-hospital strokes after TAVI between 2012 and 2019 with rates of roughly 2% per year. Stroke can have devastating clinical consequences as well as a significant economic impact, and patients consider stroke the most important clinical end point, even above death. There has thus been significant interest in strategies to reduce the risk of stroke after TAVI. To that end, cerebral embolic protection devices have been developed to mitigate stroke risk. Stroke is a relatively rare event, and the total number of patients randomized in cerebral protection trials to date is small; therefore, meta-analysis is appropriate to pool their results. In this analysis the risk of stroke was not significantly reduced by the use of cerebral embolic protection, although it must be noted that even this pooled analysis is underpowered to detect a significant effect on clinical stroke reduction.

In the modified ITT population, the incidence of a ≥ 3-point drop in the total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks was 154 of 1763 (8.7%) in the SENTINEL CEP group and 142 of 1772 (8.0%) in the control group. The corresponding risk difference was 0.72% (95% CI, −1.10 to 2.55; P = 0.44). The number of adjudicated strokes was 22 in the SENTINEL CEP group and 22 in the control group. Absolute hypotension was present in 857 of 1757 (48.8%) in the SENTINEL CEP group and 780 of 1767 (44.1%) in the control group. Relative hypotension was present in 1128 of 1757 (64.2%) in the SENTINEL CEP group and 1156 of 1767 (65.4%) in the control group.

### Cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^7d1d6033]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Random effects cMA of RCTs determined no significant difference in all strokes, disabling stroke, all‐cause mortality, and secondary outcomes between CEPD use and no CEPD use during TAVI. TSA determined that futility was reached for all‐cause mortality. Additionally, TSA determined that meta‐analytic findings of all strokes, disabling stroke, and most secondary outcomes had insufficient information size to draw conclusive evidence. Thus, this analysis does not find evidence for a reduction in disabling stroke with CEPD use; however, it acknowledges that this effect may be determined in meta‐analyses with additional RCT data.

### Cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^ae8b8052]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There were several notable findings of this study comparing CEPD and no CEPD use during TAVI. First, the pooled information size from available RCTs is insufficient to draw conclusive evidence for meta‐analytic findings of all strokes and disabling stroke. The relative effect size and CI indicate that there is a potential significant reduction of stroke outcomes with additional data. Second, futility was reached for the outcome of all‐cause mortality. Third, there was insufficient information size to draw conclusive evidence for the findings of most secondary safety and neurological outcomes. Thus, further and larger studies are required to determine firm meta‐analytic outcomes of CEPD use during TAVI.

Although a prior meta‐analysis of RCT data has shown no significant difference in all strokes and disabling strokes with CEPD use, there are discrepancies with findings from studies including nonrandomized data. A recent meta‐analysis of randomized trials and nonrandomized studies determined a reduction in all strokes. This effect was driven by the nonrandomized data, however, and not seen in sensitivity analysis restricted to the RCTs. Additionally, a propensity‐weighted analysis of > 400 000 patients from the STS/ACC TVT registry determined a statistically significant reduction in all strokes and disabling stroke. It is important to consider if differences in the methodology or execution of randomized studies may be masking the benefit of CEPD use seen in real‐world observational data. However, the insufficient sample size and power of available RCT data, as highlighted by our TSA, seems to be the more likely explanation for the inconsistency in findings.

However, this study has some limitations as well. Heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and endpoint definitions may introduce variability in pooled estimates. The observational studies included are also susceptible to confounding and selection bias, even after performing statistical adjustments. Additionally, device‐related data were limited to the Sentinel system, preventing generalizability to other CEPDs currently in development or use. The absence of individual patient‐level data also restricted the ability to perform subgroup analyses to identify populations that might derive the most benefit. Lastly, publication bias cannot be entirely excluded, as studies with neutral or negative findings may be underrepresented in the literature.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^90d58c2f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the most feared complications of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is stroke, with increased mortality and disability observed in patients suffering a stroke after TAVI. There has been no significant decline in stroke rates seen over the last 5 years; attention has therefore been given to strategies for cerebral embolic protection. With the emergence of new randomized trial data, we sought to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of cerebral embolic protection during TAVI both on clinical outcomes and on neuroimaging parameters. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of cerebral embolic protection during TAVI. The primary end point was the risk of stroke. The risk of stroke was not significantly different with the use of cerebral embolic protection: relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.36, p = 0.566. Nor was there a significant reduction in the risk of disabling stroke, non-disabling stroke or death. There was no significant difference in total lesion volume on MRI with cerebral embolic protection: mean difference -74.94, 95% CI -174.31 to 24.4, p = 0.139. There was also not a significant difference in the number of new ischemic lesions on MRI: mean difference -2.15, 95% -5.25 to 0.96, p = 0.176, although there was significant heterogeneity for the neuroimaging outcomes. In conclusion, cerebral embolic protection during TAVI is safe but there is no evidence of a statistically significant benefit on clinical outcomes or neuroimaging parameters.

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^6c132e0f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Outcomes at 30‐Day Follow‐Up

The EPD delivery success rate was reported in all studies and was achieved in 94.5% of patients, ranging from 64% to 100%. All‐cause mortality occurred in 1.9% of the patients treated with the use of an EPD; 2.8% in patients without. The incidence of stroke was 4.8% in patients treated with the use of EPD and 6% in patients without the use of EPD.

The use of EPD was not associated with significant differences in terms of 30‐day mortality (OR 0.43 [0.18–1.05], P = 0.3).

The use of EPD was associated with a lower rate of 30‐day stroke (OR 0.55 [0.31–0.98], P = 0.04), with this result driven by the registry of Seeger et al (Figure 2). The number needed to treat to save 1 stroke was 33. No differences were detected when restricting the analysis to randomized controlled trials (Figure 3).

We recalculated all the outcomes by means of a fixed‐effect model. The results were consistent with those obtained with the random effect: 30‐day mortality OR 0.44 (0.19–1.00), P = 0.05 and 30‐day stroke (OR 0.53 [0.31–0.92], P = 0.03). We opted to present the data with the random effect in order to provide more conservative and reliable results.

### Stroke reduction by cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^9bd1c59c]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The use of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been studied in several randomised trials. We aimed to perform a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of randomised CEP trials, focusing on a clinically relevant reduction in disabling stroke.

Methods

A systematic search was applied to three electronic databases, including trials that randomised TAVI patients to CEP versus standard treatment. The primary outcome was the risk of disabling stroke. Outcomes were presented as relative risk (RR), absolute risk differences (ARDs), numbers needed to treat (NNTs) and the 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The minimal clinically important difference was determined at 1.1% ARD, per expert consensus (NNT 91). The principal Bayesian meta-analysis was performed under a vague prior, and secondary analyses were performed under two informed literature-based priors.

Results

Seven randomised studies were included for meta-analysis (n = 3996: CEP n = 2126, control n = 1870). Under a vague prior, the estimated median RR of CEP use for disabling stroke was 0.56 (95% CrI 0.28 to 1.19, derived ARD 0.56% and NNT 179, I² = 0%). Although the estimated posterior probability of any benefit was 94.4%, the probability of a clinically relevant effect was 0–0.1% under the vague and informed literature-based priors. Results were robust across multiple sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

There is a high probability of a beneficial CEP treatment effect, but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. These findings suggest that future trials should focus on identifying TAVI patients with an increased baseline risk of stroke, and on the development of new generation devices.

### Impact of cerebral embolic protection on cognitive function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: data from the BHF PROTECT-TAVI randomized trial [^f6d9e6e4]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

In the modified ITT population, the median t-MoCA at presentation was 18 (interquartile range, 16–20;), and the median t-MoCA at 6 to 8 weeks was 20 (interquartile range, 17–21). The scores for each component of the t-MoCA at baseline and 6 to 8 weeks can be seen in Figure 2. The largest change in the mean score within an individual component was seen with delayed recall, which increased from a mean score of 2.57 at baseline to a mean score of 3.53 at 6 to 8 weeks (P < 0.0001).

Figure 2.

The mean change in total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks adjusted for the baseline score was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70–0.96) in the SENTINEL CEP group and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79–1.04) in the control group. There was no difference in means between the treatment groups (−0.07 [95% CI, −0.22 to 0.09], P = 0.42; Table 3; Figure 3). In a sensitivity analysis omitting the delayed recall scores, the mean changes from baseline were −0.11 (95% CI, −0.20 to −0.03) in the SENTINEL CEP group and −0.06 (95% CI, −0.14 to 0.02) in the control group. There was no difference in means between the treatment groups (−0.04 [95% CI, −0.14 to 0.06]; Table 2).

Trial Procedures

The SENTINEL CEP device is usually delivered from the right radial artery and deploys filters in the left common carotid (distal filter) and right innominate (proximal filter) arteries. There was no mandated screening of the aortic arch anatomy, and participant selection was left to the discretion of the treating physician. Full deployment of the SENTINEL CEP device was defined as correct placement of both filters for the duration of the TAVI procedure.

Participants underwent cognitive assessments using the MoCAbefore TAVI, 72 hours after TAVI (or before discharge if sooner), and at 6 to 8 weeks after TAVI. Given that no face-to-face assessments were mandated in the protocol after discharge, use of the full MoCA and the telephone version of the MoCA (t-MoCA)was allowed to complete the cognitive assessment at 6 to 8 weeks. The full MoCA is composed of 7 different scored components to test cognition with a maximum score of 30: visuospatial/executive (maximum 5 marks), naming (3 marks), attention (6 marks), language (3 marks), abstraction (2 marks), delayed recall/memory (5 marks), and orientation (6 marks). The t-MoCA is identical, but the visuospatial/executive and naming components are omitted, leaving a maximum possible score of 22. To allow the comparison of cognitive assessments between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks, only the t-MoCA scores were used. If the full MoCA score was available, then the scores for the visuospatial/executive and naming components were removed from the total. The same English version of the MoCA was used at all time points.

The case report form required entry of the blood pressure immediately before TAVI and the lowest blood pressure measured during the TAVI procedure.

Trial Outcomes

The primary outcome for this secondary analysis was the change in the total t-MoCA score between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks after TAVI. In addition, a secondary outcome, consisting of a drop in the total t-MoCA of ≥ 3 between baseline and 6 to 8 weeks, was assessed.

Periprocedural hypotension was defined in 2 ways: absolute, in which the lowest periprocedural blood pressure dropped below a mean arterial pressure of 70 mm Hg, and relative, in which the threshold to demonstrate a drop in blood pressure was adjusted for the preprocedural blood pressure measurement.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^99b90ef1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to preventing clinically-overt stroke, embolic protection may be postulated to prevent embolic debris to the brain which may have longer-term implications on neurocognitive function. The results of the present analysis do not demonstrate a significant reduction in total lesion volume or number of new lesions on MRI. This may be related to device factors, for example due to incomplete cerebral coverage during protection with filter-based devices. It is also conceivable that the act of manipulation of devices in the aortic arch itself can lead to debris travelling to the brain, thus obviating some benefit.

The results of this analysis are consistent with a recently presented analysis from the TVT registry. That observational study, using an instrumental variable analytic method, included over 120,000 patients and found no significant reduction in stroke with the use of cerebral embolic protection. This dataset also demonstrated that cerebral protection was used in 13% of patients in 2018 and 2019, with increasing utilization in each quarter as time went on. By the end of 2019, 8% of sites were using cerebral embolic protection in over 50% of cases despite there being no clinical trial evidence of a benefit on clinical outcomes.

There does not appear to be a clear penalty for using cerebral embolic protection, with no increased risk of major adverse events seen in this analysis such as vascular complications or acute kidney injury. However, there may be another more significant drawback to routine use of embolic protection; namely, hindrance of recruitment of patients into large-scale randomized clinical trials powered to detect an effect on clinical outcomes (NCT04149535). Rather than offering cerebral embolic protection as part of routine clinical care, operators should endeavor to randomize patients in order that a definitive answer can be provided on the role of cerebral embolic protection during TAVI.

We could only report the available data, and there are only six reported trials randomizing a total of 856 patients. The types of device are not uniform across trials, with some devices being filter-based to catch debris and some being deflectors. This is a potential source of heterogeneity, although there was zero or minimal heterogeneity observed for clinical outcomes. Larger scale trials are ongoing to help provide a more definitive answer on the role of cerebral embolic protection during TAVI. Clinicians should endeavor to recruit patients into these trials; until the results of the larger clinical trials is available, this analysis represents the best evidence available in the field.

### Cerebral embolic protection devices during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: systematic review and meta-analysis [^a3638df3]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Silent ischemic embolic lesions are common after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The use of embolic protection devices (EPD) may reduce the occurrence of these embolic lesions. Thus, a quantitative overview and credibility assessment of the literature was necessary to draw a robust message about EPD. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to study whether the use of EPD reduces silent ischemic and clinically evident cerebrovascular events associated with TAVI.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search to identify studies that evaluated patients undergoing TAVI with or without EPD. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the effect of EPD compared with no-EPD during TAVI using aggregate data.

Results

Sixteen studies involving 1170 patients (865/305 with/without EPD) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The EPD delivery success rate was reported in all studies and was achieved in 94.5% of patients. Meta-analyses evaluating EPD versus without EPD strategies could not confirm or exclude any differences in terms of clinically evident stroke (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38–1.29; P = 0.26) or 30-day mortality (relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.20–1.64; P = 0.30). There were no significant differences in new-single, multiple, or total number of lesions. The use of EPD was associated with a significantly smaller ischemic volume per lesion (standardized mean difference, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.20; P = 0.002) and smaller total volume of lesions (standardized mean difference, -0.23; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.03; P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis by type of valve showed an overall trend toward significant reduction in new lesions per patient using EPD (standardized mean difference, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.82 to 0.00; P = 0.05), driven by self-expanding devices.

Conclusions

The use of EPD during TAVI may be associated with smaller volume of silent ischemic lesions and smaller total volume of silent ischemic lesions. However, EPD may not reduce the number of new-single, multiple, or total number of lesions. There was only very low quality of evidence showing no significant differences between patients undergoing TAVI with or without EPD with respect to clinically evident stroke and mortality.

### Efficacy of cerebral embolic protection device in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^45057401]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely used to treat severe aortic stenosis; however, periprocedural stroke remains a significant concern. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate whether the use of cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) during TAVR reduces the risk of stroke and other complications. To conduct a network meta-analysis of relevant trials to assess the efficacy of CEPDs currently used in TAVR. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were systematically searched through April 2025 to identify studies comparing TAVR performed with and without CEPDs. Primary outcomes included stroke, all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and major vascular complications. Data were analyzed using RevMan (Version 5.4.1). A random-effects model was used for all analyses, applying the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes, reported as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. Twenty-four studies (9 randomized controlled trials and 15 observational studies), including a total of 437,487 patients (59,274 with CEPD and 384,213 without), were included in the analysis. The mean patient age was 80 years, and 46.4% were female. Compared to patients undergoing TAVR without protection, those receiving CEPDs had significantly lower risks of stroke (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60–0.82; p < 0.0001), all-cause mortality (RR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50–0.93; p = 0.02), disabling stroke (RR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26–0.75; p = 0.003), acute kidney injury (RR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79–0.89; p < 0.00001), and 30-day readmission (RR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60–0.95; p = 0.02). A reduction in major bleeding was also observed (RR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.59–1.17), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.29). No significant differences were found between groups in terms of major vascular complications, transient ischemic attack (TIA), new pacemaker implantation, or delirium. The use of CEPDs during TAVR is associated with reduced risks of stroke, disabling stroke, acute kidney injury, and 30-day readmission. However, discrepancies between randomized and observational studies warrant cautious interpretation. Further research is needed to clarify the benefits and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CEPD implementation in routine clinical practice.

### Cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^abf17d26]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a widely adopted treatment for severe aortic stenosis, expanding to younger and lower‐risk patients in recent years. Stroke after TAVI, however, remains a serious complication that presents at an incidence rate of 2.3%. To mitigate the risk of stroke and avoid resulting complications, cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) have been designed to capture embolic debris during TAVI. The efficacy of CEPDs remains under scrutiny, however. A recent analysis of the comprehensive STS‐ACC TVT (Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS]; American College of Cardiology [ACC]; Transcatheter Valve Therapy [TVT]) database has demonstrated a marginal statistically significant benefit of CEPDs in reducing all stroke and disabling stroke. On the other hand, a recent meta‐analysis involving randomized trials showed a lack of significant effect in stroke outcomes but was limited by its pooled sample size.

To evaluate the effectiveness of CEPDs with meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is essential to recognize limitations such as insufficient sample size and statistical heterogeneity. To reduce the risk of random error in a meta‐analysis of RCTs, trial sequential analysis (TSA) has been used as a method to account for type I error (false‐positive conclusions) and type II error (false‐negative conclusions).TSA is based on cumulative frequentist principles with components of a Bayesian approach.TSA produces trial sequential monitoring boundaries that adjust the required threshold for statistical significance based on the number of participants and events in the meta‐analysis. Additionally, futility boundaries are generated to determine when nonsignificant effects are highly improbable to become significant with future trials.

This study aimed to thoroughly evaluate the RCT data on CEPD use during TAVI, with a meta‐analysis followed by TSA.

1 Introduction

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well‐established intervention for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, which is the most common valvular disease in Europe and North America. It entails the insertion of a prosthetic valve via a catheter, without removing the diseased valve. The implanted valve is usually inserted through the femoral artery, although there are alternative vascular access options such as transapical and transaortic approaches as well. In patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVR has shown superiority over both medical therapy and surgical aortic valve replacement, and it has been associated with lower 1‐year mortality, improved cardiac symptoms, and enhanced hemodynamic performance. However, TAVR is not without complications, which may include paravalvular leak, stent migration, and stroke.

Post‐TAVR stroke, although relatively infrequent, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, making stroke prevention a clinical priority. For this purpose, cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) have been developed. They have been designed to capture or deflect embolic debris released during TAVR. Although several CEPDs such as the TriGUARD 3 and EMBOL‐X have been developed and are being studied, only the Sentinel CEP device (Boston Scientific) has been approved for clinical use in both the United States and Europe.

Although CEPDs have been proposed as a means to reduce ischemic brain injury during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), the evidence supporting their clinical benefit remains inconclusive. While some trials, such as SENTINEL, suggest a potential reduction in stroke risk, systematic reviews and meta‐analyses to date have not demonstrated a consistent or statistically significant benefit. Moreover, uncertainties persist regarding their cost‐effectiveness, real‐world clinical utility, and the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit. This inconsistency in the evidence base reveals a critical gap in our understanding of the true value of CEPDs in TAVI. To address this, our systematic review and meta‐analysis integrate data from both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, aiming to provide a more robust and comprehensive evaluation of CEPD efficacy by increasing statistical power and improving generalizability.

Statistical Analysis

Conventional meta‐analyses (cMAs) were conducted using random‐effects modeling for all outcomes using relative risks (RRs). These analyses were performed using a DerSimonian‐Laird estimator. These results were reanalyzed using fixed‐effects models to assess for differences in summary inferences. TSA was performed for primary and secondary end points to assess the cMA estimates on type I or II errors. The required information size (RIS) on the calculated effect size of the intervention was calculated considering a type I error of 5% and power of 90%. For sensitivity analysis, a type I error of 5% and a power of 99% was used as well. RIS was adjusted for heterogeneity/diversity, with increasing RIS and more restrictive boundaries for greater heterogeneity/diversity. Effect sizes were assessed sequentially until all available trials were used. Using TSA, the 95% CI was adjusted according to the type I and II errors, below named α‐spending adjusted CIs, using the α spending function approach, where every time a trial analysis is performed, part of the overall α is spent. Z curves were calculated to examine the benefit, harm, or futility of CEPD usage during TAVI. These could fall into multiple categories including surpassing both conventional and TSA thresholds (true positive in Figure 1B), surpassing only the conventional threshold (false positive in Figure 1B), falling below both TSA and conventional thresholds without reaching the TSA‐generated futility boundary (false negative in Figure 1B), and last, falling below both TSA and conventional thresholds but reaching the TSA‐generated futility boundary (true negative in Figure 1B). Evidence for each outcome effect estimate was graded according to the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group of evidence. Significance testing was performed at the 2‐tailed 5% significance level. Analyses were completed with TSA software (Copenhagen Trial Unit, Center for Clinical Intervention Research, Rigshospitalet).

### Impact of porcelain aorta on outcomes in transfemoral aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable valves [^faf36243]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

A cerebral embolic protection device (SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System, Boston Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) was rarely used in our population, with its being deployed in only 14 patients without PA (5.0%) and four patients with PA (2.8%, p = 0.444). The use of a cerebral embolic protection device was so seldom that it was not a variable used in matching. Given the possible morbidity, increased length of hospital stay and potential mortality associated with a procedure-related stroke, it is tempting to think that our findings may be a signal that cerebral protection devices should be used more often with BEV in patients with PA. The results of the PROTECTED-TAVR (Cerebral Embolic Protection during Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement) trial do not support this line of thought entirely. In PROTECTED-TAVR, the use of cerebral embolic protection did not change the incidence of preprocedural stroke, but a benefit from cardioembolic protection could not be excluded given the 95% CIs. Interestingly, on multivariate analysis, BEVs were associated with a lower risk of stroke. Furthermore, the rate of stroke overall in the PROTECTED-TAVR trial was low at 2.6% and did not differ significantly between those who received cerebral embolic protection and those who did not. This stroke rate of 2.6% is the same as the overall stroke rate in our study. (11 strokes occurred in the 423 patients.) Although we had an overall low stroke rate within 72 hours, it was still significantly higher in the patients with PA as compared with the patients without PA (3.5% vs 0.4%; OR 10.33 (95% CI 1.17 to 91.12); p = 0.017).

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^9b9a167c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The clinical trial evidence base for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is as compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has now been established across the spectrum of surgical risk. One of the most feared complications of TAVI is stroke, with increased mortality and disability observed in patients suffering a stroke after TAVI. Furthermore, it is not known whether silent cerebral lesions may lead to deterioration in neurocognitive function in the longer-term. Despite advances in TAVI technology and technique, in-hospital stroke rates are still in the order of 2%. Attention has therefore been given to strategies for cerebral embolic protection, where devices can be employed to either filter or deflect debris during TAVI. Embolic protection devices have thus far been tested in relatively small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) only; with the emergence of new randomized trial data, we sought to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of cerebral embolic protection during TAVI both on clinical outcomes and on neuroimaging parameters.

### Cerebral embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^36f24630]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to reevaluate randomized controlled trial data on outcomes of cerebral embolic protection device use during transcatheter aortic valve implantation. A conventional meta‐analysis followed by trial sequential analysis was conducted to evaluate the strength of the current evidence.

Methods and Results

Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials. Primary outcomes included all stroke, disabling stroke, and all‐cause mortality. Conventional study‐level meta‐analysis was performed using random‐effects modeling. Trial sequential analysis was conducted to generate adjusted significance boundaries, futility boundaries, and the required information size considering a type I error of 5% and a power of 90%. Seven trials were included with a total of 4031 patients, of whom 2171 were treated with a device and 1860 were not. Conventional meta‐analysis showed no significant difference in all stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.61–1.18]; P = 0.339) and disabling stroke (RR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.30–1.13]; P = 0.113) with device use. The trial sequential analysis determined an absence of evidence for all stroke (required information size of 71 650 [5.6%]) and disabling stroke (required information size of 337 256 [1.2%]). Conventional meta‐analysis determined no significant difference in all‐cause mortality (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.49–2.17]; P = 0.928) with device use. The trial sequential analysis determined that the futility boundary was reached (required information size of 5772 [69.3%]).

Conclusions

There are insufficient randomized controlled trial data on cerebral embolic protection device use to provide conclusive meta‐analytic findings for stroke outcomes.

There was no significant difference in disabling stroke between the CEPD and no‐CEPD groups for using cMA (RR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.30–1.13]; P = 0.113). The trials had insufficient information size to draw the TSA boundaries, meaning that significant additional information size is required to draw firm evidence for an RR reduction of 9.03% (3994 included patients for a RIS of 337 256 [1.2%]). The cumulative Z score fell below the conventional threshold and did not reach the TSA‐generated futility boundary (Figure 2B); therefore, these results can be interpreted as an absence of evidence. Sensitivity analysis using a power of 99% determined similar findings (Table S1). Reanalysis using fixed‐effects models demonstrated comparable summary inferences (Table S2).

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^d547000f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In the past decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) triggered a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Nonetheless, along with groundbreaking efficacy results, data concerning the risk of cerebrovascular complications have been consistently reported in studies using either diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW‐MRI) or high‐intensity transient signals as assessed by transcranial Doppler. 7, 8, 9, 10 Embolic protection devices (EPDs) have been ideated and introduced with the aim of reducing such an inherent risk, but they have been tested in relatively small populations, providing inconclusive results. We thus aimed at summarizing, by means of a meta‐analytic approach, the available evidence concerning the safety and efficacy profile of current EPDs in the setting of TAVI.

### Role of cerebral embolic protection devices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: an updated meta-analysis [^4166ccbb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Periprocedural stroke after TAVR continues to be an unpredictable and devastating complication leading to a prolonged hospital stay, a reduced chance of returning to one's baseline level of independence, and an increased mortality rate. It not only increases the cost of index hospitalization but also poses extra economic burden on annual health care costs owing to the long‐term chronic needs in these patients. Thus, stroke prevention is critical in patients undergoing TAVR and becomes even more imperative as TAVR expands to the asymptomatic and younger population carrying a lower surgical risk. To that end, CEPDs were developed to mitigate the risk of various cerebrovascular events, including clinically overt disabling and nondisabling strokes. Given the prior evidence that confirms debris capture by CEPD, it was expected that CEPD would reduce clinical complications and mortality rates in patients undergoing TAVR; however, these trials have been underpowered for various clinical and neurological outcomes. We conducted an extensive literature search to identify randomized trials evaluating CEPD use in TAVR and combined results from 7 trials involving > 4000 patients in this meta‐analysis.

### Rate of peri-procedural stroke observed with cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a patient-level propensity-matched analysis [^7f67d243]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The role of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains controversial. Randomized trials have not been powered to demonstrate a reduction in stroke rates. The aim of this patient level pooled analysis was to validate the impact of the dual-filter CEP device (Claret Medical Inc, CA, USA) on peri-procedural stroke in a large number of TAVR patients.

Methods and Results

Patients from the SENTINEL US IDE trial were combined with the CLEAN-TAVI and SENTINEL-Ulm study in a patient level pooled analysis (N = 1306). Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for possible confounders. The primary endpoint was procedural stroke within 72h post-TAVR according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The secondary endpoint was the combination of all-cause mortality or all-stroke within 72h after TAVR. In the propensity-matched population, 533 patients underwent TAVR without CEP and 533 patients underwent TAVR with CEP. TAVR patients without vs. with CEP were similar with respect to baseline characteristics, procedural approach, or valve type. In patients undergoing TAVR with dual-filter CEP, procedural all-stroke was significantly lower compared with unprotected procedures [1.88% vs. 5.44%, odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17–0.72, relative risk reduction 65%, P = 0.0028]. In addition, all-cause mortality and all-stroke were significantly lower (2.06% vs. 6.00%, odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.17–0.68, relative risk reduction 66%, P = 0.0013).

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that TAVR with the dual-filter CEP device is associated with a significant lower rate of peri-procedural stroke compared with unprotected procedures. However, randomized trials are still needed to clarify this issue.

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^70ebf903]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The use of an EPD in the setting of TAVI is not associated with a reduction in the rate of overall mortality. The use of EPD, although according to evidence coming from a single nonrandomized study, seems able to reduce the rate of stroke.

The number of new ischemic cerebral lesions seems unaffected by the use of an EPD. However, the use of an EPD is associated with smaller volume of ischemic lesions, smaller total volume of ischemic lesions, and better neurocognitive parameters at follow‐up. Available evidence is of low quality.

### Sentinel cerebral protection system in TAVI: an updated meta-analysis of randomized and propensity-matched studies [^464500dc]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Stroke remains a serious complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The Sentinel cerebral embolic protection (CEP) system is designed to mitigate this risk by capturing embolic debris, but its clinical benefit remains uncertain.

Aims

This meta-analysis evaluated the impact of Sentinel CEP on stroke and related outcomes in TAVI.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score-matched (PSM) studies comparing TAVI with and without Sentinel CEP. The outcomes were periprocedural ischemic stroke, total stroke, disabling stroke, 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, composite death or stroke, acute kidney injury (AKI), and major vascular complications. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model.

Results

Eight studies (five RCTs, three PSM studies) encompassing 33,111 patients were analyzed, with 50.1% receiving Sentinel. In pooled analysis, Sentinel CEP significantly reduced 30-day mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58–0.97; p = 0.03) and AKI (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82–0.98; p = 0.01). No significant effect was observed for periprocedural ischemic stroke (RR 0.92, CI 0.79–1.07; p = 0.28), total stroke (RR 0.79, CI 0.59–1.05; p = 0.10), in-hospital mortality (RR 0.86, CI 0.57–1.31; p = 0.47), composite death or stroke, or major vascular complications. RCT-only analyses confirmed no significant effect on any outcome.

Conclusions

Sentinel CEP was associated with lower 30-day mortality and AKI in pooled cohorts, but did not reduce stroke. The absence of benefit in RCTs underscores the need for further studies in high-risk TAVI populations.

Limitations

The main limitation of this meta‐analysis comes from the small number and the quality of the studies. Patient‐level data were not available, thus precluding any adjustments for possible confounders, and the wide confidence intervals make any conclusive statement possibly unreliable. Other sources of heterogeneity relate to the type of EPD, type of MRI scanner adopted, the timing of DW‐MRI, and neurocognitive assessment.

### Cerebrovascular events in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a pooled patient-level study [^c294624e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite lower‐risk patients, improved valve design, and growing operator experience, stroke rates did not decline over the years. To reduce cerebrovascular event rates, various anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies have been evaluated.

The GALILEO (Global Study Comparing a Rivaroxaban‐based Antithrombotic Strategy to an Antiplatelet‐based Strategy after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Optimize Clinical Outcomes) trial randomized 1644 patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation to either rivaroxaban with aspirin (plus 3 months clopidogrel) or aspirin only (plus 3 months clopidogrel). The trial was halted prematurely due to higher bleeding and death rates in the rivaroxaban group, whereas there was no difference in cerebrovascular event rates.

The ATLANTIS (Anti‐Thrombotic Strategy to Lower All Cardiovascular and Neurologic Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Events after Trans‐Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) trial stratum 2 randomized 1049 patients without an indication for anticoagulation to apixaban or standard of care (single or dual antiplatelet therapy). There were no differences in the combined primary end point of death, stroke, major bleeding, systemic embolism, cardiac or valve thrombosis.

POPular TAVI (Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic‐Valve Implantation) trial randomized 690 patients without an indication for anticoagulation to aspirin plus 3 months clopidogrel or aspirin only. Aspirin only was superior for reduction of bleeding, but there was no difference in cerebrovascular event rates between treatment groups.

Cerebral protection devices were developed to prevent cerebrovascular events by periprocedural capturing (or deflection) of emboli. These devices capture debris in up to 99% of patients. The PROTECTED‐TAVR (Stroke Protection with Sentinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) study randomized 3000 patients to TAVI with versus without cerebral protection. There was no reduction in clinical stroke, but rates of disabling stroke were lower. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution, because disabling stroke was 1 of 15 secondary end points for which the study was not powered.

In summary, more intensive anticoagulation resulted in higher bleeding risk without a benefit on cerebrovascular event rates. Also, routine use of cerebral protection devices did not reduce overall cerebrovascular event rates.

In the current study, major bleeding incidence in patients with stroke was higher than in patients without stroke, which may be explained by hemorrhagic strokes or as a result of stroke therapy with thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Alternatively, frail patients are at increased risk for both bleeding and thromboembolic events.

### Cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement significantly reduces death and stroke compared with unprotected procedures [^657c6b98]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of cerebral embolic protection on stroke-free survival in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Background

Imaging data on cerebral embolic protection devices have demonstrated a significant reduction in number and volume of cerebral lesions.

Methods

A total of 802 consecutive patients were enrolled. The Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device (Claret Medical Inc, Santa Rosa, California) was used in 34.9% (n = 280) of consecutive patients. In 65.1% (n = 522) of patients TAVR was performed in the identical setting except without cerebral embolic protection. Neurological follow-up was done within 7 days post-procedure. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or all-stroke according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria within 7 days. Propensity score matching was performed to account for possible confounders.

Results

Both filters of the device were successfully positioned in 280 of 305 (91.8%) consecutive patients. With use of cerebral embolic protection rate of disabling and nondisabling stroke was significantly reduced from 4.6% to 1.4% (p = 0.03; odds ratio: 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.10 to 0.93) in the propensity-matched population (n = 560). The primary endpoint occurred significantly less frequently, with 2.1% (n = 6 of 280) in the protected group compared with 6.8% (n = 19 of 280) in the control group (p = 0.01; odds ratio: 0.30; 95% confidence interval: 0.12 to 0.77). In multivariable analysis Society of Thoracic Surgeons score for mortality (p = 0.02) and TAVR without protection (p = 0.02) were independent predictors for the primary endpoint.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing TAVR use of a cerebral embolic protection device demonstrated a significant higher rate of stroke-free survival compared with unprotected TAVR.

RESULTS

Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias Assessment

Seven trials, were included in our analysis (Figure 1A). Eligible trials contained outcomes on all stroke, disabling stroke, and all‐cause mortality. There was a total of 4031 patients (2171 CEPD and 1860 no CEPD). The characteristics of the included trials are summarized in Table 1. All trials had a low overall risk of bias (Figure S1). Some concerns arose about the randomization process, deviation from intended interventions, and missing outcome data.

Table 1
Characteristics of Included Randomized Controlled Trials

Analysis of Primary Outcomes

The results of the cMA and TSA for primary outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Forest plots for primary outcomes are displayed in Figure S2. All 7 available trials had data for the primary outcomes. There was no significant difference in all stroke between the CEPD and no‐CEPD groups for both cMA and TSA (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.61–1.18]; P = 0.339 [α‐spending adjusted CI, 0.22–3.28]). The RIS was not achieved for an RR reduction of 9.24% (3995 included patients for a RIS of 71 650 [5.6%]). The cumulative Z score fell below the conventional threshold and did not reach the TSA‐generated futility boundary (Figure 2A). Thus, firm meta‐analytic evidence could not be obtained, and these results can be interpreted as an absence of evidence. Sensitivity analysis using a power of 99% determined similar findings (Table S1). Reanalysis using fixed‐effects models demonstrated comparable summary inferences (Table S2).

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^b48a0914]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

A further source of heterogeneity in the interpretation of the data comes from the different EPDs. As such, the double‐filter technology (the SENTINEL actually covers only 9 of 28 brain regions because of the dual blood supply of the posterior circulation) conceivably appears less effective as compared with the deflection technique of the TriGuard or Embrella devices, which are theoretically able to provide complete protection. On the other hand, although in a study registry with propensity‐matched population, the SENTINEL devices were the only ones associated with a positive impact on stroke and mortality. 22

There is no direct comparison between different EPDs; however, it is likely that no device can be completely protective against embolic material, and protection obviously depends on the position and stability of the device as well as the patient's anatomy. Of note, the positioning of the EPD itself can cause embolic debris. The manipulation of these devices, in terms of ease of use, fluoroscopy time, contrast media, and possible disturbance to the navigation of the prosthesis in particular for transfemoral devices, is associated with a specific learning curve and it is impossible to make a thorough comparison.

The issue of cerebral embolization while treating aortic valve stenosis is not exclusive to the transcatheter approach. Indeed, new cerebral ischemic lesions were reported in the surgical setting in up to 60% of patients: Lesions were often multiple and clinically silent. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 One study suggested that they were of a smaller volume when compared with TAVI. 7, 28

Currently, the magnitude of this phenomenon is evident and the research in this field must proceed towards a robust demonstration of a "clinical" benefit from the reduction in number and volume of ischemic cerebral lesions. Ideally, this benefit should be evident from large randomized controlled trials and appreciable at both short and long term (ie, an EPD should be able to reduce the rate of stroke in the periprocedural period [as suggested by the propensity‐matched population analyzed at 7‐day follow‐up by Seeger et al 22]) as well as to minimize the neurocognitive impairment after TAVI. Both issues are becoming even more crucial considering that TAVI is shifting towards younger and lower‐risk patients.

### Efficacy of cerebral embolic protection device in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c1e61775]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This systematic review and meta‐analysis, encompassing a total of 437,457 patients across 24 studies, examined all currently available data on CEPD use in patients undergoing TAVR. Our findings indicated that CEPD use is associated with statistically significant reductions in the incidence of stroke, disabling stroke, AKI, major bleeding, and 30‐day hospital readmission. These outcomes demonstrate the potential protective role of CEPDs in not just preventing neurologic complications but also in reducing systemic embolic events and morbidity. However, it is important to note that the rates of vascular complications, TIA, new PPM implantation, and postoperative delirium were comparable between groups with and without CEPD use.

Stroke is by far the most serious complication of TAVI with a 30‐day incidence of approximately 2.3%. Early meta‐analyses assessing CEPDs did not demonstrate a significant reduction in clinical stroke rates. However, other studies suggest that CEPDs may offer benefits in reducing stroke and the volume of cerebral ischemic lesions. For instance, the CLEAN‐TAVI and MISTRAL‐C trials reported that the use of a CEPD reduced both the number and volume of new cerebral lesions detected by MRI in patients undergoing TAVR. The pathophysiology of stroke in TAVR patients is multifactorial, involving both patient‐related and procedural factors. Patient‐related risk factors include advanced age, prior cerebrovascular events, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. Procedural factors include manipulation of calcified aortic valves, which can dislodge debris, and the presence of complex aortic arch atheroma, which increases the chances of embolization during catheter navigation. Notably, the majority of ischemic strokes occur within the first 2 days postprocedure, so it is likely that factors surrounding the procedure are the ones contributing significantly to the risk.

TAVI-related stroke

There are several accepted therapies to treat severe aortic stenosis but each is associated with significant risks. The 'Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER' PARTNER trial and other smaller studies have demonstrated the superiority of TAVI to standard medical therapy for inoperable patients with aortic stenosis and its non-inferiority to surgical valve replacement for high risk patients, with such findings evident up to 2 years post procedure. Further implementation of TAVI is limited by the risk of stroke, a devastating contributor to morbidity and mortality in the typically older and relatively frailer patient population undergoing such endovascular procedures.

Indeed, the PARTNER trial demonstrated a two to three times higher risk of stroke with TAVI compared with standard medical therapy or surgery, and the rate of TAVI-related stroke is estimated to be between 0% to 11%, depending on patient and procedural characteristics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cited the rate of neurological adverse events as a significant concern in approving the Edwards SAPIEN device. Importantly, advances in device technology have led to lower contemporary estimates of periprocedural stroke. In a recent meta-analysis of > 10,000 patients, Eggebrecht et al. determined the incidence of stroke within the first 24 h of TAVI to be 1.5% ± 1.4%; other studies have found similar results. Further, when compared to high-risk surgical cohorts, the rates of complications in TAVI may even be similar to those of surgical valve replacement. Improved operator experience and smaller insertion profiles may also decrease the incidence of stroke below that reported in the PARTNER trial.

The TAVI procedure involves the introduction of bulky devices into atherosclerotic arteries and a calcified aortic valve, and thus lends itself to cerebral embolization of plaque debris. The majority of TAVI-related strokes are in fact periprocedural and > 50% occur within the first 24 h of the procedure. The cause of periprocedural neurological events during TAVI is probably multifactorial but the pattern of cerebral ischemia following the procedure suggests mechanical embolization of atherosclerotic debris. It has been shown that the highest rates of cerebral embolization occur during valve positioning and implantation. Key steps that pose major risk include balloon valvuloplasty, passage of a large-bore catheter, retrograde travel through the aortic arch, and crushing of the native valve leaflets. Hypoperfusion due to rapid ventricular pacing during balloon valvuloplasty or valve implantation is also a possible contributor.

### Neurological outcomes with embolic protection devices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized Controlled trials [^aa6fa69b]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of intraprocedural embolic protection (EP) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of EP devices during TAVR were relatively underpowered.

Methods

A systematic review and study-level meta-analysis was performed of randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy and safety of EP during TAVR. Trials using any type of EP and TAVR vascular access were included. Primary imaging efficacy endpoints were total lesion volume and number of new ischemic lesions. Primary clinical efficacy endpoints were any deterioration in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at hospital discharge. Primary analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat approach.

Results

Four randomized clinical trials (total n = 252) were included. Use of EP was associated with lower total lesion volume (standardized mean difference -0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.06 to -0.25; p = 0.002) and smaller number of new ischemic lesions (standardized mean difference -1.27; 95% CI: -2.45 to -0.09; p = 0.03). EP was associated with a trend toward lower risk for deterioration in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at discharge (risk ratio: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.09; p = 0.09) and higher Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (standardized mean difference 0.40; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; p = 0.03). Risk for overt stroke and all-cause mortality were nonsignificantly lower in the EP group.

Conclusions

Use of EP seems to be associated with reductions in imaging markers of cerebral infarction and early clinical neurological effectiveness in patients undergoing TAVR.

### Randomized evaluation of triGuard 3 cerebral embolic protection after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: REFLECT II [^f359d315]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The REFLECT II (Randomized Evaluation of TriGuard 3 Cerebral Embolic Protection After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the TriGUARD 3 (TG3) cerebral embolic protection in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Background

Cerebral embolization occurs frequently following transcatheter aortic valve replacement and procedure-related ischemic stroke occurs in 2% to 6% of patients at 30 days. Whether cerebral protection with TriGuard 3 is safe and effective in reducing procedure-related cerebral injury is not known.

Methods

This prospective, multicenter, single-blind, 2:1 randomized (TG3 vs. no TG3) study was designed to enroll up to 345 patients. The primary 30-day safety endpoint (Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 defined) was compared with a performance goal (PG). The primary hierarchical composite efficacy endpoint (including death or stroke at 30 days, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score worsening in hospital, and cerebral ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 2 to 5 days) was compared using the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method.

Results

REFLECT II enrolled 220 of the planned 345 patients (63.8%), including 41 roll-in and 179 randomized patients (121 TG3 and 58 control subjects) at 18 US sites. The sponsor closed the study early after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended enrollment suspension for unblinded safety data review. The trial met its primary safety endpoint compared with the PG (15.9% vs. 34.4% (p < 0.0001). The primary hierarchal efficacy endpoint at 30 days was not met (mean scores [higher is better]: -8.58 TG3 vs. 8.08 control; p = 0.857). A post hoc diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging analysis of per-patient total lesion volume above incremental thresholds showed numeric reductions in total lesion volume > 500 mm³ (-9.7%) and > 1,000 mm³ (-44.5%) in the TG3 group, which were more pronounced among patients with full TG3 coverage: -51.1% (> 500 mm³) and -82.9% (> 1,000 mm³).

Conclusions

The REFLECT II trial demonstrated that the TG3 was safe compared with a historical PG but did not meet its pre-specified primary superiority efficacy endpoint.

### Cerebral protection devices during transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^66fce08d]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with aortic valve stenosis is associated with an improvement of clinical outcomes, quality of life, and self-sufficiency. The most feared TAVI-related complication is the occurrence of stroke. In order to reduce peri-procedural cerebral embolizations, diverse cerebral protection devices have been developed. These devices work though deflection or filtering of emboli, and are in different stages of testing. Silent cerebral infarctions identified by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) are used as surrogate primary outcomes, but the clinical significance is still unclear. This review provides a synopsis of the diverse cerebral protection devices and summarizes the current evidence on their efficacy during TAVI.

### Embolic protection devices in transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^7be03628]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

The initially reported periprocedural neurological events rates associated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement raised concerns that ultimately led to the development and to the clinical research of novel embolic protection devices. Although the reduction of clinical stroke is a desired goal, the current research design of embolic protection devices focuses on surrogate markers of the clinical disease, primarily on silent central nervous system lesions observed in postprocedural diffuse-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive function testing. As the mere presence of particulate debris in brain matter may not correlate with the extent of brain injury, cognitive function, or quality of life, the clinical significance of embolic protection devices has yet to be determined, and interpretation of study results with regard to real-life clinical use should be viewed accordingly. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the updated ongoing clinical research on embolic protection devices and present its major caveats.

### Cerebral embolic protection and outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the transcatheter valve therapy registry [^f0ba924f]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke remains a devastating complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which has persisted despite refinements in technique and increased operator experience. While cerebral embolic protection devices (EPDs) have been developed to mitigate this risk, data regarding their impact on stroke and other outcomes after TAVR are limited.

Methods

We performed an observational study using data from the Society for Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. Patients were included if they underwent elective or urgent transfemoral TAVR between January 2018 and December 2019. The primary outcome was in-hospital stroke. To adjust for confounding, the association between EPD use and clinical outcomes was evaluated using instrumental variable analysis, a technique designed to support causal inference from observational data, with site-level preference for EPD use within the same quarter of the procedure as the instrument. We also performed a propensity score-based secondary analysis using overlap weights.

Results

Our analytic sample included 123 186 patients from 599 sites. The use of EPD during TAVR increased over time, reaching 28% of sites and 13% of TAVR procedures by December 2019. There was wide variation in EPD use across hospitals, with 8% of sites performing > 50% of TAVR procedures with an EPD and 72% performing no procedures with an EPD in the last quarter of 2019. In our primary analysis using the instrumental variable model, there was no association between EPD use and in-hospital stroke (adjusted relative risk, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.68–1.13]; absolute risk difference, -0.15% [95% CI, -0.49 to 0.20]). However, in our secondary analysis using the propensity score-based model, EPD use was associated with 18% lower odds of in-hospital stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69–0.97]; absolute risk difference, -0.28% [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.03]). Results were generally consistent across the secondary end points, as well as subgroup analyses.

Conclusions

In this nationally representative observational study, we did not find an association between EPD use for TAVR and in-hospital stroke in our primary instrumental variable analysis, and found only a modestly lower risk of in-hospital stroke in our secondary propensity-weighted analysis. These findings provide a strong basis for large-scale randomized, controlled trials to test whether EPDs provide meaningful clinical benefit for patients undergoing TAVR.

### Meta-analysis of stroke and mortality rates in patients undergoing valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^6c71b203]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

Stroke Prevention

Cerebral embolic events following TAVR might stay silent, but each clinically relevant stroke is meaningful for the individual patient. Stroke was previously described as an independent risk factor for increased mortality following TAVR. 44 Discussions about higher stroke rates for viv procedures are often raised, but larger or randomized studies on stroke rates for viv‐TAVR or a comparison to native TAVR procedures is missing. The argument on the stroke incidence often leads to a debate about the need for embolic protection devices.

Studies on cerebral protection were mainly performed for native aortic stenosis and demonstrated that cerebral protection seems to be beneficial in these patients. 45, 46, 47, 48 Predominantly, the filtered debris contained thrombus, valve tissue, aortic wall, or calcification, resulting from structures that were touched during the TAVR procedure. 45, 49, 50, 51 Debris material captured by an embolic protection device during viv‐TAVR is similar to the findings after native TAVR procedures. 52 Higher stroke rates following viv‐TAVR attributable to friable material from degenerated bioprostheses cannot be concluded from these data. Therefore, on the basis of the stroke rates presented above, the discussion on embolic protection seems not to be different for viv‐TAVR than in native TAVR procedures (Figure 3A). The individual patient stroke risk following viv‐TAVR might depend on the history of stroke, supraventricular arrhythmia, and cerebrovascular risk factors.

In addition to antithrombotic therapy, patients undergoing TAVI may also benefit from the use of cerebral protection devices. The temporal pattern and location of cerebral infarcts and silent ischemic lesions following TAVI indicate periprocedural mechanical embolization as the most likely pathophysiologic mechanism of periprocedural stroke. We thus believe that there is a role for cerebral protection devices in preventing stroke associated with TAVI. The ideal protection device is safe, effective, easy to use, can accommodate various anatomies, demonstrates minimal interference with the TAVI procedure, and importantly, covers all three major cerebral inflow aortic arch vessels. Notably, using protection devices may make the TAVI procedure more cumbersome, complicated, and time consuming, and may thus drive up costs. Results from the 'Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN Controlled Evaluation' (ADVANCE) study link procedural time with the incidence of stroke, suggesting that a fast and simple procedure may be one of the most important factors for stroke prevention (Johan Bosmans, University Hospital of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, personal communication). In addition, lower contemporary stroke rates associated with TAVI raise the question of whether cerebral protection devices and/or adjunctive pharmacotherapy should be recommended for all patients undergoing the procedure. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to determine which patient groups would benefit from these preventative measures. If the increased stroke risk associated with TAVI remains an issue in the future, the implementation of embolic protection devices may be valuable in reducing both clinically evident and occult strokes; however, if further studies suggest that these risks have already been reduced, additional devices may not be warranted.

### Cerebrovascular events in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a review [^74eb3977]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebrovascular events (CVEs) are a dreaded complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). They are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and reduced quality of life and impose a significant burden to health care systems. Although the rates of clinical stroke have reduced since the advent of TAVR, it remains an important complication, particularly as TAVR is increasingly utilized. CVE may occur at the time of the TAVR, as a direct consequence of the procedure, or may occur later, related to thrombosis of the prosthetic valve, atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities. Imaging of the brain has revealed a high prevalence of subclinical cerebral infarcts (68%-98%) associated with the TAVR procedure. Although their clinical significance has not been fully established, clinically evident CVE ranges between 3% and 5% in patients considered at high operative risk to between 1% and 3% in low operative risk patients. Periprocedural CVEs are largely the result of embolization of the thrombus and tissue derived from the valve, vasculature, or myocardium. Cerebral embolic protection devices have been studied in multiple trials, with some evidence supporting a reduction in new cerebral lesion volume, number, and potentially disabling strokes. However, thus far, there is no robust evidence that they reduce the overall stroke rate. The number and severity of comorbidities, in particular, new-onset atrial fibrillation, are associated with CVEs. Valve thrombosis diagnosed using computed tomography as areas of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening has been identified in 10% to 15% of patients. This is a dynamic process associated with an increase in CVEs, but that resolves with anticoagulation or sometimes without it. Routine use of anticoagulation compared with a single antiplatelet agent is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, without any additional alleviation in risk of thromboembolism. Future studies to improve risk stratification could facilitate the tailoring of preventive therapies to patients at high risk of CVE, who stand to gain the most benefit.

### Efficacy of cerebral embolic protection device in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^64d1f969]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

The reduction in disabling stroke observed in our meta‐analysis aligns with previous findings. Butala et al. demonstrated a 13% relative decrease in disabling stroke with embolic protection use, and in patients with a history of prior stroke, the risk was 40% lower. However, our results also contradict Kolte et al. who found no significant reduction in mortality associated with the use of CEPDs, as well as a more recent propensity‐matched analysis conducted in 2024. Other results, such as AKI, bleeding, and vascular complications, are affected by a variety of factors and individual circumstances as well. These effects could be influenced by systemic embolism or inflammatory response mitigation, but may also be due to differences in patient selection or specific differences between procedures. Major vascular complications, TIA, PPM placement, and delirium were comparable between groups, indicating that CEPD use does not bring about a substantial difference in these outcomes.

Subgroup analysis showed that there are some contradictions in our findings between RCTs and observational studies. We noticed that stroke, disabling stroke, and mortality were significantly reduced in observational studies compared to RCTs. There may be several reasons for this; observational studies are inherently prone to problems like selection bias, confounding by indication, and unmeasured variables that may influence outcomes. On the other hand, RCTs reduce these biases through randomization but often involve smaller sample sizes and include only specific patient groups, which may not reflect typical clinical settings. RCTs are also usually done in centers with more experienced operators and strict protocols, which might reduce the visible difference between patients with and without CEPDs. This suggests that CEPDs may work better in real‐world settings than in controlled trial environments.

The Sentinel device was used in the majority of the trials in this meta‐analysis. Although it is the most widely studied CEPD, there are several flaws in its design. It only protects the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries, leaving the left vertebral artery, and therefore the posterior circulation, unprotected. Since the left vertebral artery also generally has a greater vascular territory, and the volume and size of embolic debris passing through it during TAVR is comparable to that in the protected arteries, its exclusion from the Sentinel's protection is particularly worrisome. The Sentinel is available in only one filter size, which may not fit all arch anatomies optimally. The procedure also requires separate arterial access, which adds complexity and increases fluoroscopy time. These factors can contribute to a learning curve that may hinder widespread adoption and limit consistent benefit across different centers.

### Effect of cerebral embolic protection device on new cerebral embolism during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a prospective sentinel registry [^1857bca6]. American Heart Journal (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral embolization is a common complication following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices have the potential to reduce embolic burden to the cerebral circulation; however, their effectiveness in real-world patients at high risk of stroke remains insufficiently studied.

Methods

As part of imaging study of the prospective Sentinel registry (NCT05217888), we evaluated the effect of CEP on new cerebral embolism as determined by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR who were considered at high risk for stroke. The primary endpoint was the number and volume of new cerebral lesions on brain MRI at post-procedure (2 to 7 days) compared to baseline in protected brain territories. The control group consists of enrolled patients in the ADAPT-TAVR trial (NCT03284827), in which TAVR was performed without the use of a CEP device.

Results

A total of 219 patients was included (49 in the SENTINEL registry and 170 patients in the ADAPT-TAVR trial). For the primary endpoint, the number and volume of new cerebral lesions was significantly lower in the CEP group than in the control group: the median no. of lesions; 1 (interquartile range [IQR], 1 to 2) vs. 6 (IQR, 3 to 10), respectively; difference, -4 [IQR, -6 to -3]; P < 0.001, and the median volume of lesions; 113.5 mm³ (IQR, 42.4 to 206.9) vs. 283.5 mm³ (IQR, 129.7 to 682.4), respectively; difference, -145.9 [IQR, -296.7 to -67.1]; P < 0.001). Strokes at 30 days occurred in 1 patient (2.0%) in the CEP group and 2 patients (1.2%) in the control group (P = 0.64).

Conclusions

Among patients who are at high risk for stroke undergoing TAVR, the use of CEP was associated with a significant reduction of new cerebral embolism in protected brain territories. Because the study was underpowered to detect clinically relevant events, the results cannot be considered clinically directive.

### Stroke events after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: temporal relationships and affected brain regions [^bc7ecc7a]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite continuous improvements in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), periprocedural strokes remain a devastating complication. Randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a reduction in clinically apparent strokes or mortality after TAVI due to cerebral embolic protection (CEP). To identify potential targets of CEP strategies during TAVI, we evaluated affected brain regions, and temporal patterns of stroke onset in a routine clinical sample.

Methods and Results

A total of 3,164 consecutive patients treated with TAVI from 2008 to 2019 at a single center were screened for cerebrovascular events. Affected cerebral regions were determined according to clinical symptoms and brain imaging. Rates of disabling stroke and non-disabling stroke at 30 days were 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. The frequency of all strokes decreased from 5.0% to 3.0% over time (P = 0.012). Patients with impaired left-ventricular function (OR 2.19), increased CHA2DS2-VASc (OR 1.39) and moderate/severe spontaneous echo contrast (OR 3.60) had a higher stroke risk. Acute symptom onset occurred during TAVI (19.4%), within 24 hours (40.3%) or later (25.0%); 98.3% of strokes were of ischemic origin. In intraprocedural strokes, 53.2% of lesions were found in locations considered protected by current CEP devices, and 37.5% of patients with intraprocedural strokes were exclusively affected in these areas. Baseline or procedural parameters were not associated with embolic distribution patterns.

Conclusions

Most strokes occurred early after TAVI - but not necessarily during the procedure - and affected multiple brain regions only partially protected by current CEP devices. Efficient prevention of cerebrovascular events may require strategies beyond the TAVI procedure to minimize stroke risk and additional randomized controlled trials will be required to clarify the role of CEP in efficient stroke prevention during TAVI.

### Outcomes and predictors of stroke after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the cerebral protection device era [^fc04eb1f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has gained popularity in the past decade owing to its minimally invasive approach and promising data in patients with severe aortic stenosis at all surgical risk levels. Despite technical advancements, including new valve types, and operator experience, stroke remains a feared complication affecting nearly 2% of patients undergoing TAVR. Besides patient‐related factors such as prior history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and severe calcification, procedural factors such as embolization during valve implantation, prolonged procedure time, rapid pacing, and extensive manipulation of the aorta have all been described as factors leading to stroke following TAVR. To mitigate the risks of stroke and stroke‐related morbidity and death, cerebral protection devices (CPDs) have been developed.

The SENTINEL CPD (Boston Scientific Corp. Boston, MA) is designed to capture and remove debris elaborated during TAVR. The pivotal trial of the device randomized 363 high‐risk patients with aortic stenosis 1:1:1 into a safety arm, device arm, and control arm. The trial demonstrated its safety and led to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration despite the lack of a significant difference in stroke as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Recently, the results of the PROTECTED TAVR (Stroke Protection With Sentinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) trial, which randomized 3000 patients undergoing TAVR from > 50 global sites and all surgical risk levels to either the SENTINEL CPD group (n = 1501) or no‐CPD group (n = 1499) were published. The investigators reported no significant difference in the primary end point of clinical stroke within 72 hours of TAVR or before discharge between the groups (2.3% with CPD versus 2.9% with no CPD; P = 0.30). However, the secondary end point of disabling stroke was less among the protected group (0.5% versus 1.3%; P = 0.02). This latter finding falls in line with a number of single‐center and registry‐based analyses that suggest a 60% to 80% relative risk reduction in stroke with SENTINEL. Despite the aforementioned data, use of the device is still quite limited with the majority of TAVR centers citing a lack of clear‐cut randomized trial evidence for its benefit, coupled with a challenging economic climate for a currently nonreimbursed device.

To better understand the larger effects of CPD use during TAVR, we sought to analyze the hospital outcomes, readmission rates, and predictors of stroke from a nationally representative all‐comers database.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerebrovascular and microembolism risk after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — embolic mechanisms, observed rates, and uncertainties are noted: the TAVR procedure is associated with a high risk of dislodgement of microdebris from arch atheroma or from the valve itself with subsequent embolic stroke, and clinical cerebrovascular event rates are around 3% to 5% at 30 days, but subclinical microembolism may be more common; the long-term effect of these microemboli is unclear and further research on timing, frequency, reduction techniques, and prognostic implications is of interest.

### Outcomes of cerebral embolic protection for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1b65b16e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study supported CEP use during TAVR for BAV stenosis, which was associated with a significantly reduced risk of any stroke within the hospitalization as well as less of the composite safety end point of in‐hospital death and stroke without burdening the patient with a high hospitalization cost. However, the findings should be interpreted as an association rather than causality, and RCTs were warranted to ultimately validate the efficacy and safety of the CEP device for BAV stenosis.

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^f7d56716]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The use of embolic protection devices may theoretically reduce the occurrence of cerebral embolic lesions during transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Available evidence from single studies is inconclusive. The aim of the present meta‐analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy profile of current.

Methods and Results

Major medical databases were searched up to December 2017 for studies that evaluated patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation with or without. End points of interest were 30‐day mortality, 30‐day stroke, the total number of new lesions, the ischemic volume per lesion, and the total volume of lesions. Eight studies involving 1285 patients were included. Thedelivery success rate was reported in all studies and was achieved in 94.5% of patients. The use ofwas not associated with significant differences in terms of 30‐day mortality (odds ratio 0.43 [0.18–1.05], P = 0.3) but it was associated with a lower rate of 30‐day stroke (odds ratio 0.55 [0.31–0.98], P = 0.04). No differences were detected with respect to the number of new lesions (standardized mean difference −0.19 [−0.71 to 0.34], P = 0.49). The use ofwas associated with a significantly smaller ischemic volume per lesion (standardized mean difference, −0.52 [−0.85 to −0.20], P = 0.002) and smaller total volume of lesions (standardized mean difference, −0.23 [−0.42 to −0.03], P = 0.02).

Conclusions

The use ofis not associated with a reduced rate of mortality and new ischemic cerebral lesions. The use ofduring transcatheter aortic valve implantation seems to be associated with a lower 30‐day stroke rate, although this result is driven by a single nonrandomized study. The use ofis associated with a smaller volume of ischemic lesions, and smaller total volume of ischemic lesions.

### Protection against cerebral embolism during transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^2a8063d9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neurological complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be reduced with transcatheter cerebral embolic protection (TCEP).

Objectives

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of TCEP during TAVR.

Methods

Nineteen centers randomized 363 patients undergoing TAVR to a safety arm (n = 123), device imaging (n = 121), and control imaging (n = 119). The primary safety endpoint consisted of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30 days, and the primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in new lesion volume in protected brain territories on magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 to 7 days. Patients underwent neurocognitive assessments, and the debris captured was analyzed.

Results

The rate of MACCE (7.3%) was noninferior to the performance goal (18.3%, p noninferior < 0.001) and not statistically different from that of the control group (9.9%; p = 0.41). New lesion volume was 178.0 mm 3 in control subjects and 102.8 mm 3 in the device arm (p = 0.33). A post hoc multivariable analysis identified pre-existing lesion volume and valve type as predictors of new lesion volume. Strokes at 30 days were 9.1% in control subjects and 5.6% in patients with devices (p = 0.25) Neurocognitive function was similar in control subjects and patients with devices, but there was a correlation between lesion volume and neurocognitive decline (p = 0.0022). Debris found within filters in 99% of patients included thrombus, calcification, valve tissue, artery wall, and foreign material.

Conclusions

TCEP was safe, captured embolic debris in 99% of patients, and did not change neurocognitive function. Reduction in new lesion volume on magnetic resonance scans was not statistically significant. (Cerebral Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement [SENTINEL]; NCT02214277).

Table 2
Baseline Characteristics of the Included Cohorts

All‐cause stroke was reported in all 7 studies. For the primary clinical end point of all‐cause stroke, the RR with CEPD was 15% lower than without CEPD (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.61–1.18]; P = 0.34; I² = 0%; Figure 2). Although not statistically significant, this indicates that the RR of CEPD to no‐CEPD in this sample was 0.85, with the true value represented in a range of 0.61 (risk decreasing 39%) to 1.18 (risk increasing 18%) in the patient population. Sensitivity analysis after excluding REFLECT I showed similar results (Figure S12). For the secondary clinical end point of disabling stroke, although not statistically significant, the RR with CEPD was 42% lower than without CEPD (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.29–1.13]; P = 0.11, I² = 0%; Figure 3), with the true value represented in a range of 0.29 (risk decreasing 71%) to 1.13 (risk increasing 13%). For all‐cause mortality, the RR with CEPD was 3% higher than without CEPD, with true value represented in a range of 0.49 (risk decreasing 51%) to 2.17 (risk increasing 117%) (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.49–2.17]; P = 0.93, I² = 0%; Figure 4), although this did not reach statistical significance. Worsening of NIHSS score from baseline at discharge was reported in 5 RCTs. The RR with CEPD was 21% higher than without CEPD (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.77–1.91]; P = 0.41; I² = 0%; Figure 5). Although not statistically significant, this indicates that the RR of CEPD to no‐CEPD in this sample is 1.21, with the true value represented in a range of 0.77 (risk decreasing 23%) to 1.91 (risk increasing 91%). Worsening of MoCA score from baseline at discharge was reported in 4 RCTs. The RR with CEPD was 10% lower than without CEPD (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.58–1.38]; P = 0.63; I² = 28%; Figure 6). Although not statistically significant, this indicates that the RR of CEPD to no‐CEPD in this sample is 0.90, with the true value represented in a range of 0.58 (risk decreasing 42%) to 1.38 (risk increasing 38%). Also, there was no statistically significant difference in the presence of new ischemic lesions (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.95–1.04]; P = 0.70; I² = 0%; Figure 7) and total lesion volume (standardized mean difference, ‐0.53 [95% CI, −1.20 to 0.14]; P = 0.12; I² = 95%; Figure 8) seen on DW‐MRI in those with and without CEPD. Safety outcomes including major or minor vascular complications and stage 2 or 3 AKI did not show any statistically significant differences between the CEPD and no‐CEPD groups. The RR for major or minor vascular complications (RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.61–2.24]; P = 0.63, I² = 56%) was 17% higher in the CEPD group (Figure 9) and the RR for stage 2 or 3 AKI groups (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.44–2.11]; P = 0.93, I² = 0%; Figure 10) was almost similar between the 2. However, it must be noted that both these outcomes had a wide range of CIs. For major or minor vascular complications, the CEPD group showed an RR of 1.17 with true value ranging from 0.61 (risk decreasing 39%) to 2.24 (risk increasing 124%). Similarly for stage 2 or 3 AKI, the RR of CEPD to no‐CEPD was 0.96, with true value ranging from 0.44 (risk decreasing 56%) to 2.11 (risk increasing 111%).

### Critical analysis of distal protection devices [^21eb4f07]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence that embolization takes place universally during all carotid stenting procedures. In addition, the development of sophisticated distal protection devices and their availability made the concept of cerebral protection widely acceptable, and currently there is a consensus among specialists that protection devices need to be used routinely. The results of the SAFER trial as well as the SAPPHIRE trial have further increased the enthusiasm for routine use of protection devices. However, each additional step to an existing procedure adds potential risks to the procedure. This is true for cerebral protection devices. The problems associated with the use of a distal protection device relate to (1) difficulties in introducing and deploying the device, (2) effectiveness of emboli capture, (3) protection device induced vessel injury, and (4) difficulties in retrieving the device. This article reviews the early clinical experience with various protection devices and summarizes some of the disadvantages of these devices.

### Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^c5368421]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Data Analyses

We used RevMan (Review Manager version 5.1.7, Nordic Cochrane Center) to perform random‐effects meta‐analysis using the Mantel–Haenszel method to determine pooled odds ratio (OR) of EPD compared with non‐EPD for dichotomous data. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to assess differences in continuous outcomes. The standardized mean difference is used as a summary statistic in meta‐analysis when the studies all assess the same outcome but measure it in a variety of ways. In this circumstance it is necessary to standardize the results of the studies to a uniform scale before they can be combined. We thus made the choice of using the standardized mean difference because the MRI scans have been done with different machines (1.5 and/or 3 T), different protocols of acquisition, and as a consequence, a source of heterogeneity was clearly envisionable. Analyses were performed on an intention‐to‐treat approach. When only median and interquartile range were available, we estimated mean and SD using formulas proposed by Wan et al. 14

When only 95% confidence interval was available, normal distribution was assumed when sample size was ≥ 100, and we calculated SD using the equation proposed by the Cochrane Handbook. 13

The I² statistic was used to assess the heterogeneity across studies.

Cohen K scores between the 2 reviewers with respect to title/abstract and full‐text screening were 0.78 and 0.70, respectively, indicating moderate agreement.

The likelihood of publication bias was assessed graphically by generating a funnel plot for the combined end point of major adverse cardiovascular events and mathematically by means of Egger's test (P for significant asymmetry < 0.1). 13

Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether the type of bioprosthesis and the design of the study influenced the treatment effect. Two‐sided P values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Conclusions

The use of EPD is not associated with a reduced rate of mortality and new ischemic cerebral lesions. The use of EPD during transcatheter aortic valve implantation seems to be associated with a lower 30-day stroke rate, although this result is driven by a single nonrandomized study. The use of EPD is associated with a smaller volume of ischemic lesions, and smaller total volume of ischemic lesions.

Table 5
RoB Assessment (ROBINS‐I)

In the evaluation of viv‐TAVR versus native TAVR, data from controlled trials (eg, case‐control studies with matched pairs) were included. Nevertheless, we judge the overall risk of bias as moderate, because we observed moderate risk of bias for most categories and no sufficient information for management of missing data or selection of reported outcomes in some trials (Table 5).

Finally, we decided to not perform any form of additional testing to address heterogeneity (eg, subgroup or sensitivity analysis) because of low event rates in total.

In addition, a source of detection bias was identified, because 7 trials did not describe the precise definition of stroke (Tables 1, 2, 3).

To produce reliable data on our research question randomized or at least larger, controlled prospective trials are needed to preserve more valid results.

### Effect of a cerebral protection device on brain lesions following transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with severe aortic stenosis: the CLEAN-TAVI randomized clinical trial [^459594e8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Stroke remains a major predictor of mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Cerebral protection devices might reduce brain injury as determined by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI).

Objective

To determine the effect of a cerebral protection device on the number and volume of cerebral lesions in patients undergoing TAVI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Investigator-initiated, single center, blinded, randomized clinical trial in higher-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI at the University of Leipzig Heart Center. Brain MRI was performed at baseline, 2 days, and 7 days after TAVI. Between April 2013 and June 2014, patients were randomly assigned to undergo TAVI with a cerebral protection device (filter group) or without a cerebral protection device (control group). The last 1-month follow-up occurred in July 2014.

Interventions

TAVI with or without a cerebral protection device (filter system).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the numerical difference in new positive postprocedure DWMRI brain lesions at 2 days after TAVI in potentially protected territories. The first hierarchical secondary outcome was the difference in volume of new lesions after TAVI in potentially protected territories.

Results

Among the 100 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 80.0 (5.1) years in the filter group (n = 50) and 79.1 (4.1) years in the control group (n = 50), and the mean (SD) procedural risk scores (logistic EuroScores) were 16.4% (10.0%) in the filter group and 14.5% (8.7%) in the control group. For the primary end point, the number of new lesions was lower in the filter group, 4.00 (interquartile range [IQR], 3.00–7.25) vs 10.00 (IQR, 6.75–17.00) in the control group (difference, 5.00 [IQR, 2.00–8.00]; P < .001). For the first hierarchical secondary end point, new lesion volume after TAVI was lower in the filter group (242 mm³ [95% CI, 159–353]) vs in the control group (527 mm³ [95% CI, 364–830]) (difference, 234 mm³ [95% CI, 91–406]; P = 0.001). Considering adverse events, 1 patient in the control group died prior to the 30-day visit. Life-threatening hemorrhages occurred in 1 patient in the filter group and 1 in the control group. Major vascular complications occurred in 5 patients in the filter group and 6 patients in the control group. One patient in the filter group and 5 in the control group had acute kidney injury, and 3 patients in the filter group had a thoracotomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI, the use of a cerebral protection device reduced the frequency of ischemic cerebral lesions in potentially protected regions. Larger studies are needed to assess the effect of cerebral protection device use on neurological and cognitive function after TAVI and to devise methods that will provide more complete coverage of the brain to prevent new lesions.

### Outcomes of cerebral embolic protection for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^45e4e4af]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide retrospective cohort study of CEP use during TAVR for BAV stenosis, the device use rate was significantly rising over the study period, and almost 1 in 5 TAVR procedures on BAV stenosis were assisted with the CEP device. The PS‐matched cohort and multivariable analysis indicated CEP use for BAV stenosis was independently associated with a reduced rate of periprocedural stroke within the index hospitalization, which supported CEP use during TAVR for BAV stenosis.

Postprocedural ischemic stroke in the acute phase could be predominantly attributed to cerebral embolism by debris falling off during catheter manipulations and balloon dilation. Based on this theory, CEP is designed to deflect or capture the dislodged debris, preventing it from flowing into cerebral artery circulation. Histological analysis indicated debris captured by CEP could be found in nearly 98% of TAVR procedures, but the actual rate of clinically apparent stroke within the first 72 hours after TAVR is only 2% to 4%. Considering the low incidence of stroke, early RCTs evaluating the efficiency of CEP were small and underpowered to demonstrate significant protection from brain injury. The MISTRAL‐C (MRI Investigation in TAVI With Claret) trial equally randomized a total of 65 patients with aortic stenosis to transfemoral TAVR with versus without CEP; however, in the CEP group only a numerically lower incidence of disabling stroke was found (0/32 versus 2/33; 7%). The sample size of the Cerebral Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (SENTINEL trial), which enrolled 363 patients, was comparatively large, but it also failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in cerebrovascular accidents. The PROTECTED TAVR (Stroke Protection With Sentinel During TAVR) trial, which is the largest RCT on the CEP device at present, involved 3000 subjects 1:1 randomized to transfemoral TAVR with or without CEP, and still, no significant difference in the incidence of periprocedural stroke was found between the 2 groups.

### Eight-year outcomes for patients with aortic valve stenosis at low surgical risk randomized to transcatheter vs. surgical aortic valve replacement [^9fb0d94c]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The NOTION trial included patients with symptomatic severe AS at low surgical risk. After 8 years of follow-up, the risk of all-cause mortality, stroke or myocardial infarction as a composite outcome, and the individual components were not significantly different after TAVI and SAVR. The risk of SVD was significantly lower after TAVI than after SAVR, and the rate of BVF continued to be low and not different in both groups.

The long-term results are reassuring for TAVI both regarding clinical outcomes and THV durability, as TAVI is now indicated for patients with longer life expectancy. Still, further long-term data are needed including data on all types of THVs.

### A prospective randomized evaluation of the triGuard ™ HDH embolic DEFLECTion device during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: results from the DEFLECT III trial [^0f24bde9]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and performance of the TriGuard™ HDH Embolic Deflection Device (TriGuard) compared with no cerebral protection in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

Methods and Results

From February 2014 to March 2015, 85 subjects undergoing TAVI at 13 centres in Europe and Israel were randomized to TriGuard protection vs. no protection. Subjects underwent neurologic and cognitive evaluation at baseline, pre-discharge and 30 days; cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 4 ± 2 days post-procedure and at 30 days. Technical success, which included complete 3-vessel cerebral coverage, was achieved in 88.9% (40/45) of cases. The primary in-hospital procedural safety endpoint (death, stroke, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury, or major vascular complications) occurred in 21.7% of TriGuard and 30.8% of control subjects (P = 0.34). In the Per Treatment population (subjects with complete three-vessel cerebral coverage), TriGuard use was associated with greater freedom from new ischaemic brain lesions (26.9 vs. 11.5%), fewer new neurologic deficits detected by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (3.1 vs. 15.4%), improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, better performance on a delayed memory task (P = 0.028) at discharge, and a > 2-fold increase in recovery of normal cognitive function (MoCA score > 26) at 30 days.

Conclusion

TriGuard cerebral protection during TAVI is safe and complete cerebral vessel coverage was achieved in 89% of subjects. In this exploratory study, subjects undergoing protected TAVI had more freedom from ischaemic brain lesions, fewer neurologic deficits, and improved cognitive function in some domains at discharge and 30 days compared with controls.

### Impact of complications during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement: how can they Be avoided and managed? [^31655734]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 6
Cerebral embolic protection device. The upper panel shows the degree of cerebral protection provided by currently available embolic protection devices. Devices that cover the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid arteries protect only 9 of 28 brain regions, considering the dual blood supply of the posterior cerebral circulation. TAVR indicates transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

The TriGuard device (Keystone Heart Ltd. Herzliya, Israel) is the only commercially available CEPD that allows complete coverage of the supra‐aortic vessels. In the DEFLECT III (Prospective, Randomized Evaluation of the TriGuard HDH Embolic Deflection Device During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial, this device was successfully positioned in 89% of cases and appeared to mitigate new neurological deficits and cognitive impairment after transcatheter aortic valve implantation yielding a numeric greater freedom from new cerebral ischemic lesions (26.9% versus 11.5%) and smaller lesion volume (19.6 mm³ versus 34.8 mm³; P = 0.07) and improved cognitive function compared with the control arm (P = 0.028). 74

Several new CEPDs that provide full coverage of the aortic arch are under evaluation for clinical use, 75 including the Emblock Embolic Protection System (Innovative Cardiovascular Solutions, LLC, Grand Rapids, MI) and the Emboliner Embolic Protection Catheter (Emboline Inc, Santa Cruz, CA). The Emblock device incorporates a 4F pigtail catheter to facilitate TAVR device positioning, while the Emboliner captures both cerebral and noncerebral emboli to provide full‐body embolic protection.

The optimal combination (single versus double) and duration of antiplatelet therapy to mitigate the risk of thrombosis after TAVR has not been established, 76 and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) for 3 to 6 months is the most commonly used regime.

How to Manage

Diagnosis of periprocedural stroke is often delayed because patients are often under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. When stroke is considered, prompt access to computed tomography of the brain, computed tomography cerebral angiography, and specialist care by a dedicated stroke team are essential. Anectodal experiences suggest that mechanical thrombectomy may have a role in acute and late‐presenting stroke following TAVR. 77

### Neurologic dysfunction and neuroprotection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^c18771f7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a fast-growing procedure. Expanding to low-risk patients, it has surpassed surgical aortic valve implantation in frequency and has been associated with excellent outcomes. Stroke is a devastating complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Silent brain infarcts identified by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging are present in most patients following TAVI. Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction are common neurologic complications. The stroke and silent brain infarcts are likely caused by particulate emboli released during the procedure. Intravascularly positioned cerebral embolic protection devices are designed to prevent debris from entering the aortic arch vessels to avoid stroke. Despite promising design, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated a reduction in stroke in patients receiving cerebral embolic protection devices. Similarly, the association of cerebral embolic protection devices with silent brain infarcts, postoperative delirium, and cognitive dysfunction is uncertain. Monitored anesthesia care or conscious sedation is as safe as general anesthesia and is associated with lower cost, but different anesthetic techniques have not been shown to decrease stroke risk, postoperative delirium, or cognitive dysfunction. Anesthesiologists play important roles in providing perioperative care including management of neurologic events in patients undergoing TAVI. Large randomized clinical trials are needed that focus on the correlation between perioperative interventions and neurologic outcomes.

### Cerebral embolic protection and severity of stroke following transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^83777016]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The present study demonstrates that the use of Sentinel CEP may be associated with lower risk of moderate or severe stroke despite no significant difference in overall stroke incidence following TF‐TAVR. The present study provides a hypothesis that the clinical benefit of CEP use may lie in the effect of attenuating the severity of stroke. Further large‐scale prospective studies are needed to address this hypothesis about the role of CEP use during TAVR and confirm our findings.

### Role of cerebral embolic protection devices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: an updated meta-analysis [^748fe595]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) capture embolic material in an attempt to reduce ischemic brain injury during transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Prior reports have indicated mixed results regarding the benefits of these devices. With new data emerging, we performed an updated meta-analysis examining the effect of CEPD during transcatheter aortic valve replacement on various clinical, neurological, and safety parameters.

Methods and Results

A comprehensive review of electronic databases was performed comparing CEPD and no-CEPD in transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Primary clinical outcome was all-cause stroke. Secondary clinical outcomes were disabling stroke and all-cause mortality. Neurological outcomes included worsening of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment score from baseline at discharge, presence of new ischemic lesions, and total lesion volume on neuroimaging. Safety outcomes included major or minor vascular complications and stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury. Seven randomized controlled trials with 4016 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary clinical outcome of all-cause stroke; secondary clinical outcomes of disabling stroke, all-cause mortality, neurological outcomes of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score worsening, Montreal Cognitive Assessment worsening, presence of new ischemic lesions, or total lesion volume on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging between CEPD versus control groups. There was no statistically significant difference in major or minor vascular complications or stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury between the groups.

Conclusions

The use of CEPD in transcatheter aortic valve replacement was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of clinical, neurological, and safety outcomes.

### Early clinical impact of cerebral embolic protection in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^7001aced]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background We aimed to compare the rate of neurological events in patients with or without cerebral embolic protection (CEP) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods and Results Data on clinical end points including neurological events ≤ 30 days post-TAVR were collected for all patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR in 2 academic tertiary care institutions. Patients were matched through propensity scoring, which resulted in 333 pairs of patients with versus without CEP out of a total of 831 consecutive patients. The median age was 81 (76–85) years, and the median logistic EuroScore was 14% (9%-20%). The CEP group experienced less neurological events at 24 hours (1% versus 4%; P = 0.035) and at 30 days (3% versus 7%; P = 0.029). There were significantly more disabling strokes in unprotected patients at 30 days (1% versus 4%; P = 0.039). CEP was associated with significantly fewer neurological events at 24 hours after TAVR (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06–0.73; P = 0.015) by multiple regression analysis, while age and valve type did not contribute significantly. Overall, 67% (2 of 3) in the CEP versus 83% (10 of 12) in the non-CEP cohort experienced neurological events in protected areas (ie, not dependent on the left vertebral artery). Conclusions The use of filter-based CEP during TAVR was associated with less neurological events, especially in CEP-protected brain territories.

### Meta-analysis of stroke and mortality rates in patients undergoing valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^0806d5ed]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This meta‐analysis was conducted using a prespecified protocol and explicit reproducible plan for literature search and synthesis, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. 12 The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. The study selection was independently performed by 2 reviewers (S.M. and M.M.). In case of any disagreement, this was resolved by consensus with the senior author (T.S.). We included all trials fitting the following inclusion criteria: case series including at least 10 patients and case‐control studies and randomized controlled trials reporting on ischemic cerebrovascular events and mortality after viv‐TAVR. Articles published in either German or English were eligible for analysis. Case reports, case series with < 10 patients, and publications written in other languages were excluded. Trials with no sufficient report on stroke or mortality data were excluded, too. We performed an electronic search of the bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and hand searching of reference lists. We used the following search terms, "valve‐in‐valve TAVR", "valve in valve TAVR", "valve‐in‐valve TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation)", "valve in valve TAVI", "stroke", "cerebral infarction", and "embolism", and connected these terms with Boolean operators.

Stroke incidence after AVR in general was preliminary defined as primary outcome of this review. We extracted data on the 30‐day and 1‐year stroke incidence. Secondary end point was death from any cause at 30 days and at 1 year. All data were collected from text, tables, and figures.

We collected the following data from the original trials: first author, year of publication, country, operation period, number of patients enrolled, patients' age, sex distribution, prosthesis type, prosthesis failure mechanism, study design, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, stroke rates, and mortality rates.

### Outcomes of cerebral embolic protection for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^bb451b3f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

As previously mentioned, Fan et aldemonstrated that the size per lesion and the total lesion volume per patient identified on postprocedural magnetic resonance imaging of patients with BAV stenosis were significantly bigger than those of TAV stenosis when no CEP was used during TAVR. However, the association of CEP use with brain lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging was uncertain, and no such study was designed specifically for BAV stenosis. In the CLEAN‐TAVI (Claret Embolic Protection and TAVI) trial with 100 patients randomly assigned to TAVR with versus without CEP, brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 2 and 7 days after the procedure indicated CEP use would significantly decrease the new brain lesions volume. In contrast, 1 meta‐analysis showed neither the percentage of patients with new brain lesions nor the lesion number of each patient was statistically decreased with CEP use. Pitifully, we were unable to identify the number or volume of brain lesions limited to the ICD‐10 coding system, but such imaging studies were essential to establish more comprehensive evidence of the merits of CEP for BAV stenosis.

Megaly et al, by querying the 2017 NIS database when no reimbursement to CEP by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, demonstrated the hospitalization cost was higher with the device use. Our stratified analysis, consistent with the previous study, indicated that CEP use for BAV stenosis was associated with an increased cost of hospitalization before October 2018, but the cost with and without CEP use has been comparable since then. Reimbursement to the CEP device by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from October 2018 contributed to the cut in cost to some extent, which may promote the application of the CEP device. Accordingly, contemporary CEP use for BAV stenosis could protect from periprocedural cerebrovascular events without burdening the patients.

### Evidence for cerebral embolic prevention in transcatheter aortic valve implantation and thoracic endovascular aortic repair [^5186998a]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Embolic stroke is a formidable complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Mechanical strategies to reduce the risk of ischemic embolic lesions include embolic protection devices (EPDs) and carbon dioxide flushing (CDF). This study aims to assess the efficacy for EPD and CDF uses in TAVI and TEVAR.

Methods

A literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. All searches were performed via PubMed, OvidSP, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library. Conference abstracts and proceedings were included. Those that were out of scope of interest and review articles were excluded.

Results

Eighteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the 456 articles searched. Regarding EPD use in TAVI, systematic review comparing EPD with no-EPD showed smaller total volume of cerebral lesions and smaller volume per lesion in patients with EPD in all studies. They also performed better in postoperative neurocognitive assessments but could not demonstrate clinical prevention of embolic stroke in all studies. While for EPD use in TEVAR, capture of embolic debris and absence of early postoperative neurocognitive deficit were demonstrated in all cases of 2 prospective pilot studies. Concerning CDF in TEVAR, significant reduction in gaseous emboli released during stent-graft deployment was shown by 1 in vitro study. Successful CDF application in all patients, with only 1 case of postoperative nondisabling stroke, was also demonstrated by 1 cohort study.

Conclusions

This systematic review of medical literature has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of EPD use in TAVI. Although improvements in clinical outcomes have yet been demonstrated, there was level I evidence showing reduced embolic lesions in imaging. The use of EPD and CDF in TEVAR was suggested, but evidence remained inadequate to support routine clinical use.

### Intraaortic protection from embolization in patients undergoing transaortic transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^cbe58021]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) results in the dislodgement of debris with risk of cerebral lesions or stroke. The EMBOL-X protection device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) is positioned within the ascending aorta to capture such debris.

Description

Between July 2012 and April 2014 we randomly assigned 30 high-risk patients to undergo transaortic TAVI with the SAPIEN XT prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences) combined with either the EMBOL-X device (group-1, n = 14) or without (group-2, n = 16). Periprocedural cerebral lesions were assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at baseline and within 7 days post-procedurally.

Evaluation

New foci of restricted diffusion on cerebral DW-MRI were found in 69% in group-2 and 50% in group-1. Lesion size was smaller in patients treated with the EMBOL-X device than in those without (88 ± 60 vs 168 ± 217 mm³, p = 0.27, t = 1.2, degrees of freedom = 10). Transaortic TAVI patients treated with the EMBOL-X device had significantly smaller lesion volumes in the supply region of the middle cerebral artery (33 ± 29 vs 76 ± 67 mm³, p = 0.04). There were no neurologic events after transaortic TAVI.

Conclusions

The intraaortic protection device seems to reduce both the incidence and the volume of new cerebral lesions (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01735513).

### Effect of transcatheter aortic valve implantation vs surgical aortic valve replacement on all-cause mortality in patients with aortic stenosis: a randomized clinical trial [^e58d9ff4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement and is the treatment of choice for patients at high operative risk. The role of TAVI in patients at lower risk is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether TAVI is noninferior to surgery in patients at moderately increased operative risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized clinical trial conducted at 34 UK centers, 913 patients aged 70 years or older with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and moderately increased operative risk due to age or comorbidity were enrolled between April 2014 and April 2018 and followed up through April 2019.

Interventions

TAVI using any valve with a CE mark (indicating conformity of the valve with all legal and safety requirements for sale throughout the European Economic Area) and any access route (n = 458) or surgical aortic valve replacement (surgery; n = 455).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year. The primary hypothesis was that TAVI was noninferior to surgery, with a noninferiority margin of 5% for the upper limit of the 1-sided 97.5% CI for the absolute between-group difference in mortality. There were 36 secondary outcomes (30 reported herein), including duration of hospital stay, major bleeding events, vascular complications, conduction disturbance requiring pacemaker implantation, and aortic regurgitation.

Results

Among 913 patients randomized (median age, 81 years [IQR, 78 to 84 years]; 424 [46%] were female; median Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score, 2.6% [IQR, 2.0% to 3.4%]), 912 (99.9%) completed follow-up and were included in the noninferiority analysis. At 1 year, there were 21 deaths (4.6%) in the TAVI group and 30 deaths (6.6%) in the surgery group, with an adjusted absolute risk difference of -2.0% (1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 1.2%; P < .001 for noninferiority). Of 30 prespecified secondary outcomes reported herein, 24 showed no significant difference at 1 year. TAVI was associated with significantly shorter postprocedural hospitalization (median of 3 days [IQR, 2 to 5 days] vs 8 days [IQR, 6 to 13 days] in the surgery group). At 1 year, there were significantly fewer major bleeding events after TAVI compared with surgery (7.2% vs 20.2%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.45]) but significantly more vascular complications (10.3% vs 2.4%; adjusted HR, 4.42 [95% CI, 2.54 to 7.71]), conduction disturbances requiring pacemaker implantation (14.2% vs 7.3%; adjusted HR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.43 to 2.94]), and mild (38.3% vs 11.7%) or moderate (2.3% vs 0.6%) aortic regurgitation (adjusted odds ratio for mild, moderate, or severe [no instance of severe reported] aortic regurgitation combined vs none, 4.89 [95% CI, 3.08 to 7.75]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients aged 70 years or older with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and moderately increased operative risk, TAVI was noninferior to surgery with respect to all-cause mortality at 1 year.

### Effect of cerebral embolic protection devices on CNS infarction in surgical aortic valve replacement: a randomized clinical trial [^d6a7c775]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Stroke is a major complication of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

Objective

To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of cerebral embolic protection devices in reducing ischemic central nervous system (CNS) injury during SAVR.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial of patients with calcific aortic stenosis undergoing SAVR at 18 North American centers between March 2015 and July 2016. The end of follow-up was December 2016.

Interventions

Use of 1 of 2 cerebral embolic protection devices (n = 118 for suction-based extraction and n = 133 for intra-aortic filtration device) vs a standard aortic cannula (control; n = 132) at the time of SAVR.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was freedom from clinical or radiographic CNS infarction at 7 days (± 3 days) after the procedure. Secondary end points included a composite of mortality, clinical ischemic stroke, and acute kidney injury within 30 days after surgery; delirium; mortality; serious adverse events; and neurocognition.

Results

Among 383 randomized patients (mean age, 73.9 years; 38.4% women; 368 [96.1%] completed the trial), the rate of freedom from CNS infarction at 7 days was 32.0% with suction-based extraction vs 33.3% with control (between-group difference, -1.3%; 95% CI, -13.8% to 11.2%) and 25.6% with intra-aortic filtration vs 32.4% with control (between-group difference, -6.9%; 95% CI, -17.9% to 4.2%). The 30-day composite end point was not significantly different between suction-based extraction and control (21.4% vs 24.2%, respectively; between-group difference, -2.8% [95% CI, -13.5% to 7.9%]) nor between intra-aortic filtration and control (33.3% vs 23.7%; between-group difference, 9.7% [95% CI, -1.2% to 20.5%]). There were no significant differences in mortality (3.4% for suction-based extraction vs 1.7% for control; and 2.3% for intra-aortic filtration vs 1.5% for control) or clinical stroke (5.1% for suction-based extraction vs 5.8% for control; and 8.3% for intra-aortic filtration vs 6.1% for control). Delirium at postoperative day 7 was 6.3% for suction-based extraction vs 15.3% for control (between-group difference, -9.1%; 95% CI, -17.1% to -1.0%) and 8.1% for intra-aortic filtration vs 15.6% for control (between-group difference, -7.4%; 95% CI, -15.5% to 0.6%). Mortality and overall serious adverse events at 90 days were not significantly different across groups. Patients in the intra-aortic filtration group vs patients in the control group experienced significantly more acute kidney injury events (14 vs 4, respectively; P = 0.02) and cardiac arrhythmias (57 vs 30; P = 0.004).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing SAVR, cerebral embolic protection devices compared with a standard aortic cannula did not significantly reduce the risk of CNS infarction at 7 days. Potential benefits for reduction in delirium, cognition, and symptomatic stroke merit larger trials with longer follow-up.
