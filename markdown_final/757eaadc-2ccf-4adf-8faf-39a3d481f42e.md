## Question

Indication for surgery in liver hemangioma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when surgery is indicated for hepatic hemangioma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline principle that most hemangiomas require no intervention. Then, I should define absolute surgical indications grounded in high-quality guidelines. Next, I will clarify how to handle "symptomatic" presentations, explicitly separating true compression from nonspecific pain. After that, I must debunk size-based thresholds. I will then address diagnostic uncertainty and the role of imaging versus biopsy. Subsequently, I should consider non-surgical alternatives, special populations such as pregnancy and pediatrics, and synthesize a practical decision pathway while acknowledging evidence limitations before stating the final clinical indications succinctly.

> Let me first confirm the baseline principle so I do not anchor incorrectly on rare complications. The highest quality guidelines consistently emphasize that typical hepatic hemangiomas are benign, usually asymptomatic, and require neither treatment nor routine follow-up once confidently diagnosed, even when large, and this conservative stance is reiterated across multiple ACG and EASL documents, with the caveat of different handling in cirrhosis or HBV where HCC surveillance may apply rather than hemangioma surveillance [^114AeBLe] [^113pJuNr] [^112uzvsS] [^116dPPyq] [^112HcR5U] [^1122dgze].

> Now, I should define absolute indications for surgery and make sure I am not overextending them. The ACG 2024 guideline explicitly recommends resection for hemangioma-related rupture or intralesional hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy such as Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, and clinically significant organ or vascular compression, which are objective complications signifying direct harm; compression scenarios include biliary obstruction, inferior vena cava compression, portal hypertension, and in pediatric vascular tumors high-output heart failure, with case data illustrating portal hypertension from mass effect resolving post-resection and pediatric series highlighting cardiac failure and coagulopathy as critical triggers for intervention [^112HcR5U] [^111Lgd9f] [^113K2fF8] [^113X7QkX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pain alone, because attribution bias is common. I need to check the "symptomatic" gray zone carefully, since abdominal pain is frequently unrelated to the hemangioma and often due to other gastrointestinal disorders, and higher-quality guidance reserves intervention for symptoms due to demonstrable compression rather than nonspecific discomfort; thus, before considering surgery for symptoms, I should verify exclusion of other etiologies, temporal correlation with the lesion, severity with QoL impact, and an anatomic rationale linking lesion location to symptoms, aligning with EASL's phrasing of "symptomatic by compression" rather than pain alone [^114Ddo87] [^113whwUz] [^113X7QkX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, size is often misused as a criterion, so I must explicitly reject it as an independent indication. ACG advises against resection for asymptomatic large cavernous hemangiomas, generally greater than 10 cm, and EASL provides no size thresholds; multiple series concur that tumor diameter does not independently justify resection, and even growth alone may be followed by spontaneous regression in a minority, so rapid enlargement without complications should not be reflexively equated with surgical necessity, though I should acknowledge that pregnancy with large or exophytic lesions raises nuanced rupture considerations that I will revisit in special populations [^114AeBLe] [^113X7QkX] [^112FPcWW] [^112yFZcd] [^113jCiPQ] [^114193uY].

> I need to ensure diagnostic certainty without exposing the patient to bleeding risk from biopsy. Guidelines advise avoiding biopsy of suspected hemangiomas, instead relying on characteristic contrast-enhanced imaging for diagnosis and reserving resection for the uncommon scenario where high-quality imaging remains indeterminate and malignancy cannot be excluded after multidisciplinary review; typical features on multiphasic MRI, CT, or CEUS usually suffice, while awareness of mimickers helps prevent misclassification and unnecessary procedures [^116eERKL] [^116eERKL] [^111W4vae] [^111jDHpg] [^115BAgU7] [^114RAtT3] [^117WCPjF] [^113Cy2J4].

> Let me consider alternatives in patients who meet indications for intervention but are poor surgical candidates. ACG supports considering transarterial embolization, ablation modalities such as radiofrequency or microwave, and rarely radiation or even transplantation in extreme, refractory cases, with small series suggesting symptom relief and lesion shrinkage after embolization or ablation, albeit with limited quality and heterogeneity that should temper overconfidence in these strategies [^117WrMHd] [^11396FdY] [^115zgAmV] [^1126GpdY] [^115MzN75].

> But wait, special populations may need tailored decisions, and I should double-check for any conflicting guidance. In pregnancy, EASL 2023 suggests trimester imaging for large or exophytic lesions at higher rupture risk, whereas ACG 2024 indicates not monitoring hemangiomas in pregnancy even if large, so a pragmatic, individualized approach with multidisciplinary input is wise when lesions are large and exophytic in pregnant patients; in infants and children, infantile hepatic hemangioma is a different entity with indications dominated by high-output cardiac failure, consumptive coagulopathy, hypothyroidism, or failure of medical therapy such as propranolol, where surgery or embolization may be necessary, which are not adult criteria; in cirrhosis or chronic HBV under HCC surveillance, suspected hemangiomas may warrant short-interval imaging to confirm stability despite the otherwise conservative approach [^114193uY] [^114K7dTX] [^115fMZWv] [^115fMZWv] [^113K2fF8] [^1122dgze].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision pathway, but I should verify that each step aligns with guidelines. First, confirm the diagnosis with high-quality contrast-enhanced imaging and avoid biopsy; second, check for absolute indications such as rupture, intralesional hemorrhage, Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, or clinically significant compression and proceed to surgery if present; third, if asymptomatic with typical imaging, do not treat or follow; fourth, if symptomatic, exclude other causes and confirm compression-based mechanism before considering elective resection; fifth, if imaging is indeterminate with persistent concern for malignancy, resection can be both diagnostic and therapeutic after multidisciplinary review; sixth, if surgery is contraindicated, consider embolization or ablation as alternatives [^114RAtT3] [^112HcR5U] [^114AeBLe] [^113X7QkX] [^113Cy2J4] [^117WrMHd].

> Hold on, I should acknowledge the evidence limitations so as not to overstate surgical benefits. Much of the surgical literature consists of case series with selection bias and heterogeneous indications, and a Cochrane overview of elective surgery for benign liver tumors underscores the lack of randomized evidence and nontrivial perioperative risks in historical cohorts, whereas contemporary expert guidelines consistently center conservative management for typical hemangioma, reminding me to keep surgery the exception rather than the rule [^114dDXK4] [^116dPPyq] [^114AeBLe].

> Let me reconsider any potential misstatements before concluding. I initially almost listed rapid growth as a standalone surgical indication, but on review, growth by itself, in the absence of compression, bleeding, coagulopathy, or diagnostic uncertainty, is not a guideline-supported reason for resection, particularly given documented cases of subsequent regression; growth only matters when it contributes to complications or raises unresolved diagnostic concern after optimal imaging and multidisciplinary review [^113jCiPQ] [^113X7QkX] [^113Cy2J4].

> Finalizing the synthesis, I should state the indications concisely and precisely. Indications for surgery in hepatic hemangioma are limited to life-threatening complications such as rupture or intralesional hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, clinically significant compression of adjacent structures causing objective impairment, diagnostic uncertainty where malignancy cannot be excluded despite optimal imaging, and carefully selected symptomatic cases only after exclusion of other causes and demonstration of a compression mechanism, with size alone never constituting an indication and asymptomatic typical lesions managed conservatively without surveillance once confirmed [^112HcR5U] [^114AeBLe] [^113X7QkX] [^114RAtT3] [^116eERKL] [^115ioVNj].

---

Surgery for liver hemangioma is indicated only for **complications or diagnostic uncertainty**. The main indications are: (1) **rupture or intralesional hemorrhage**; (2) **Kasabach-Merritt syndrome** (consumptive coagulopathy); (3) **severe, persistent symptoms** from organ or vessel compression; and (4) **inability to confirm diagnosis** on imaging, especially with malignancy risk. Size alone is **not an indication**, and asymptomatic lesions, even if large, should not be resected [^114AeBLe] [^111AWUYz]. Minimally invasive surgery is preferred when feasible, and alternatives such as embolization or ablation may be considered if surgery is high risk or not possible [^114SAPfm] [^117WrMHd] [^1126GpdY].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

### Absolute indications

- **Rupture or intralesional hemorrhage**: Spontaneous or traumatic rupture with hemorrhage is a clear indication for urgent surgery [^112HcR5U].

- **Kasabach-Merritt syndrome**: Consumptive coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia requires surgical resection.

- **Severe, persistent symptoms**: Significant pain, early satiety, or respiratory compromise from organ or vessel compression warrants surgery [^113UwHKZ].

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Inability to confirm hemangioma on imaging, especially with malignancy risk, justifies resection.

---

### Relative indications

Relative indications include **rapid growth** [^113myAWW], in which progressive enlargement with impending complications may justify surgery after multidisciplinary review, and **patient preference**, in which persistent anxiety or cosmetic concerns after counseling may be considered but are not routine.

---

## Contraindications to surgery

Asymptomatic lesions should **not undergo surgery** regardless of size [^114AeBLe] [^111AWUYz]. A high surgical risk due to significant comorbidities or poor liver reserve contraindicates operative management. Multiple hemangiomas without symptoms or complications should be managed conservatively [^116dPPyq].

---

## Surgical techniques and approaches

- **Enucleation**: Preferred for symptomatic or complicated hemangiomas, preserving liver parenchyma [^111neBVS].

- **Anatomic resection**: Used when enucleation is not feasible due to location or size [^114KSf4n].

- **Minimally invasive surgery**: Laparoscopic or robotic approaches are increasingly used [^1122XJZd], with less blood loss, shorter stay, and faster recovery [^113cYJdd].

---

## Alternative treatments

- **Transarterial embolization (TAE)**: Option for symptomatic or enlarging hemangiomas when surgery is high risk or not feasible [^115zgAmV] [^1126GpdY].

- **Ablation techniques**: Radiofrequency or microwave ablation may be considered for selected symptomatic lesions [^117WrMHd] [^115MzN75].

- **Liver transplantation**: Rarely considered for diffuse, unresectable hemangiomas with severe complications [^117WrMHd] [^113UwHKZ].

---

## Postoperative outcomes and complications

Postoperative outcomes include potential **complications** — bleeding, infection, bile leak, and liver failure — with minimally invasive approaches reducing these risks [^113cYJdd] [^1122XJZd]. Recurrence is **rare** after complete resection, and long-term outcomes are excellent [^112yFZcd].

### Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic liver resection for cavernous hemangioma: a propensity score matching study [^1122XJZd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Cavernous hemangioma represents the most common benign lesion of the liver. Most hemangiomas do not require any treatment, as the natural history of liver hemangioma is generally uncomplicated. Surgery should only be considered for patients with complicated or symptomatic lesions, or when malignancy cannot be excluded. Surgical treatment is the only effective treatment for liver hemangiomas. Although minimally invasive liver resection has been increasingly adopted for many benign or malignant liver lesions, there has been no consensus on whether robot-assisted liver resection (RALR) can provide better treatment outcomes than conventional laparoscopic liver resection (LLR).

Shin et al. reported that laparoscopic liver resection for liver hemangioma produced better perioperative outcomes than open surgery. A recently reported study using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis showed similar findings. However, other studies revealed no significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, or major morbidity and mortality rates between laparoscopic and open surgery. A small study comparing the perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted, laparoscopic, and open hemihepatectomy for giant hemangiomas over 10 cm showed robotic hemihepatectomy to be associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss and a shorter operative time and postoperative hospital stay than laparoscopic surgery.

The results of our study showed that both robot-assisted and laparoscopic liver resection were feasible, safe, and effective in treating large to giant hemangiomas. There were no significant differences in blood loss, conversion, or postoperative overall morbidity.

### Is laparoscopic hepatectomy suitable for giant hepatic hemangioma larger than 10 cm in diameter [^1132mjXe]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of giant hepatic hemangioma larger than 10 cm in diameter often requires major laparoscopic liver resection (LLR), which is very difficult and has a high risk of bleeding. There is no consensus as to whether giant hepatic hemangioma is an indication or a contraindication for laparoscopic surgery.

- **Methods**: From September 2011 to May 2018, 58 patients with giant hepatic hemangioma larger than 10 cm underwent laparoscopic surgery. They were divided into high-difficulty (HD) and low-difficulty (LD) groups according to the operation difficulty score. The perioperative data of the two groups were analyzed and compared.

- **Results**: There were 30 patients in the LD group and 28 in the HD group. No differences were shown in sex, age, ASA grade, tumor size, operation time, conversion rate, intraoperative and post-operative blood transfusion rate, and post-operative complications between the two groups. The amount of bleeding in the HD group was significantly higher than in the LD group (285.7 ± 224.0 vs. 189.6 ± 157.6 ml, p = 0.007). The time of hepatic hilar occlusion in the HD group was longer than in the LD group (25.4 ± 8.8 vs. 20.6 ± 7.3 min, p = 0.001), and the rate of hepatic hilar occlusion in the HD group was also higher than in the LD group (71.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.004). The incidence of hospitalization days and discharge time in the LD group were shorter than those in the HD group (6.3 ± 1.6 vs. 8.2 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.000; 16.4 ± 5.5 vs. 21.9 ± 4.6 hours, p = 0.019). There was no significant difference in enzymatic parameters between the two groups after operation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® liver lesion-initial characterization [^111W4vae]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatic hemangioma, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced multiphase CT or contrast-enhanced MRI for an indeterminate liver lesion greater than 1 cm on initial non-contrast or single-phase CT, or non-contrast MRI. This applies to patients with a normal liver and no suspicion or evidence of extrahepatic malignancy or underlying liver disease.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma [^111MU5PB]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common tumors of childhood. Unlike other tumors, they have the unique ability to involute after proliferation, often leading primary care providers to assume they will resolve without intervention or consequence. Unfortunately, a subset of IHs rapidly develop complications, resulting in pain, functional impairment, or permanent disfigurement.

As a result, the primary clinician has the task of determining which lesions require early consultation with a specialist. Although several recent reviews have been published, this clinical report is the first based on input from individuals representing the many specialties involved in the treatment of IH. Its purpose is to update the pediatric community regarding recent discoveries in IH pathogenesis, treatment, and clinical associations and to provide a basis for clinical decision-making in the management of IH.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatic hemangioma, more specifically with respect to contrast-enhanced ultrasound, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced abdominal ultrasound of an indeterminate > 1 cm liver lesion on initial ultrasound in patients with a normal liver. This recommendation is pertinent when there is no suspicion or evidence of extrahepatic malignancy or underlying liver disease.

### Infrahepatic inferior vena cava clamping with Pringle maneuvers for laparoscopic extracapsular enucleation of giant liver hemangiomas [^116cJZUi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention, principally including liver anatomical resection and tumor enucleation, is the definitively curative treatment for liver hemangiomas. Recent advances in surgical techniques and established perioperative management have made liver resection or enucleation safe in most specialized units. When surgery is indicated, extracapsular enucleation is advocated by most surgeons. This surgical option can retain the maximum amount of normal liver parenchyma, minimize intraoperative blood loss, and decrease the incidence of postoperative biliary fistula in open surgery. However, with some liver hemangiomas, the distress caused by open surgery may be far worse than the tumor-related discomfort; therefore, we prefer the laparoscopic approach for the treatment of hemangiomas.

With the progress of minimally invasive techniques, laparoscopic surgery for hepatic procedures has been rapidly developing. More complicated laparoscopic liver resections are now possible, including right hepatectomies, left hepatectomies, and even extended right and left hepatectomies. Compared with open surgical resection, laparoscopic resection offers many advantages, such as a shorter hospital stay, improved cosmetic results, and potential improvements to immunological outcomes. In order to reduce bleeding, in previous studies, laparoscopic anatomical liver resection was used for the removal of hepatic hemangiomas, but the procedure tends to result in excessive loss of liver tissues or even gallbladder. In our study, 36 cases of liver hemangiomas were adjacent to the main portal.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^112Fe1HR]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

The classification and risk stratification of infantile hemangiomas are crucial according to the AAP 2019 guidelines. An infantile hemangioma is considered high risk if there is evidence or potential for:

- **Life-threatening complications**: Immediate and significant health dangers.
- **Functional impairment or ulceration**: Hindrance in bodily functions or the presence of painful sores.
- **Structural anomalies**: Conditions such as PHACE syndrome or LUMBAR syndrome.
- **Permanent disfigurement**: Long-lasting visible changes to appearance.

These guidelines provide a clear framework for identifying and managing high-risk hemangiomas effectively.

### Measuring the impact of clinical practice guidelines on infantile hemangioma referrals [^114KyVJQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

High-risk infantile hemangiomas may be associated with significant patient comorbidity. The American Academy of Pediatrics published clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to refer high-risk hemangiomas early. The results of this study suggest that these guidelines may have resulted in an earlier referral age of patients with high-risk infantile hemangiomas to hemangioma specialists.

### Size of lesion is not a criterion for resection during management of giant liver haemangioma [^112FPcWW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The unknown natural history and risk of complications of large haemangiomas may pose therapeutic dilemmas. The authors describe their experience with the management of giant haemangiomas.

- **Methods**: Patients with a giant haemangioma were identified by a survey of the hospital database. Forty-nine patients with a haemangioma of at least 4 cm in diameter presented between January 1990 and December 2000. Medical records were analyzed retrospectively.

- **Results**: Eleven patients had surgical treatment and 38 were managed conservatively. The median diameter of the tumors was 8.0 cm in surgically treated patients and 6.0 cm in the group managed by observation. Surgery-related morbidity occurred in three patients, and abdominal complaints persisted in three of ten patients with a symptomatic lesion. During a median follow-up of 52 months, 12 non-operated patients had mild abdominal complaints, considered to be unrelated to the lesion. In these patients, symptoms either diminished or became minimal during follow-up. Complications did not occur.

- **Conclusion**: Observation of giant haemangiomas can be performed safely. The authors advocate resection of cavernous liver haemangiomas only in patients with persistent severe symptoms.

### Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for treatment of a huge symptomatic hepatic cavernous hemangioma [^115MzN75]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatic cavernous hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the liver. Appropriate management of this tumor remains a controversial topic. We have accumulated a number of cases with successful management of local hepatic tumors. Here we report a case where we performed an ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of a symptomatic hemangioma. A 36-year-old female patient visited Kyungpook National University Hospital because of persistent right upper abdominal pain caused by an enlarging hemangioma. After two sessions of radiofrequency ablation, the hemangioma was significantly reduced in size. After 36 months, a follow-up abdominal CT revealed remarkably diminished necrotic areas of the ablated hemangioma. The size of the hemangioma was decreased to almost one-third of the original longitudinal diameter. The patient remains asymptomatic regarding the hemangioma.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^117WCPjF]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Focal liver lesions are frequently encountered during imaging studies, and hemangiomas represent the most common solid liver lesion. Liver hemangiomas usually exhibit characteristic imaging features that enable characterization without the need for biopsy or follow-up. However, many benign and malignant liver lesions may display one or more imaging features resembling hemangiomas, which radiologists must be aware of. In this article, we review the typical imaging features of liver hemangiomas and present a series of potential liver hemangiomas' mimickers, providing radiologists with insights for improving differential diagnoses.

- **Critical relevance statement**: The knowledge of imaging features of potential liver hemangiomas mimickers is fundamental to avoid misinterpretation.

- **Key points**:
	- Liver hemangiomas typically show imaging features that help avoid a biopsy.
	- Many benign and malignant liver lesions show imaging features resembling hemangiomas.
	- Radiologists must know the potentially misleading imaging features of hemangiomas' mimickers.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^1145YTew]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Liver hemangiomas represent the most common primary benign liver tumor, with a prevalence of 2–20% in autoptic studies and a female-to-male ratio of 2:1–5:1. Hemangiomas are increasingly encountered in everyday clinical practice because of the vast number of imaging studies performed. According to published series, hemangiomas may be detected in 5% of CT examinations and in 2–4% of US examinations. Hemangiomas have distinctive imaging features that enable accurate diagnosis using contrast-enhanced imaging modalities. No percutaneous biopsy or surgical resection is needed for lesions with typical US appearance in non-oncological patients with a "healthy liver" or in lesions with a typical enhancement pattern. Conversely, many benign and malignant liver lesions may show misleading imaging features that radiologists must be aware of to avoid misdiagnosis.

In this article, we will review multimodality imaging features of liver hemangiomas and present a series of potential hemangioma mimickers.

### ACG clinical guideline: Focal liver lesions [^1122dgze]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for focal liver lesions, more specifically with respect to patients with hepatic hemangioma, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining continued imaging surveillance every 3–6 months for at least 1 year in patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B meeting criteria for HCC surveillance and having a suspected hemangioma.

### Liver imaging and pregnancy: What to expect when your patient is expecting [^112iTkXg]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

During or after pregnancy, hemangiomas can grow (Fig. 11), but they are indolent. Spontaneous hepatic rupture is exceptional. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is asymptomatic, does not grow, and does not require follow-up.

- **Figure 11**: During a routine ultrasound (US) (a), hyperechoic hepatic lesions (arrows) were seen in a 37-year-old pregnant woman. These lesions showed no vascularization on Doppler US nor stiffness, and the liver had no signs of chronic liver disease, so they were classified as hemangiomas. Months later, one lesion slightly grew, and an unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) was performed (b), showing high T2 signal with low T1 signal (upper row) and no diffusion restriction (lower row), thus confirming the diagnosis of hemangiomas.

If an unknown lesion presents fat, hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is suggested. HCAs have non-specific imaging characteristics on US and computed tomography (CT); therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed. If malignancy is suspected, breast cancer should be suspected as it is the most common primary cancer in pregnancy and is characterized by hypoenhancing liver metastases. Cystic components may suggest mucinous gastrointestinal or ovarian primary, while hyperenhancing lesions suggest metastatic choriocarcinoma, sarcoma, and renal or neuroendocrine tumor.

Ultrasound surveillance is recommended each trimester in pregnant patients with a history of extrahepatic cancers known to metastasize to the liver. Biopsy may also be considered whenever needed in incidental focal lesions, severe liver dysfunction in transplanted patients, or in cases of severe liver disease. Liver biopsy appears to be safe and well-tolerated in the first trimester.

### Management strategies and outcomes in primary liver angiosarcoma [^117KQRym]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Standardized treatment data for primary hepatic angiosarcoma is limited, given the small number of case reports and case series in the literature. Surgical resection is the only known curative treatment modality for primary hepatic angiosarcoma. In our study, we found that the two patients who underwent surgical resection had a higher overall survival (OS) of 24.7 and 100.8 months compared with the median OS of 6 months. Surgery was able to confer long-term survival in one of these patients. This is consistent with the literature illustrating a significantly higher OS for patients with hepatic angiosarcoma who underwent surgery compared to those who did not. Importantly, patients who are surgical candidates have a lower tumor burden than those who are not surgical candidates.

A prospective study conducted by Tripke et al. reported a median OS of 59 months and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 11 months for patients who underwent surgical resection with negative margins. It is important to note that hepatic resection is only beneficial when the lesion is localized to one lobe of the liver in the absence of metastatic disease. Therefore, most hepatic angiosarcomas at the time of diagnosis are deemed unresectable. Only 14% of the patients in our study underwent surgical resection, which is comparable to other retrospective studies.

- **Surgical resection**: Surgical resection is most beneficial when the tumor size is less than 10 cm, as the risk of intraoperative complications, such as intraperitoneal hemorrhage, increases with tumor size. Hepatic angiosarcoma is also considered an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis.

Hepatic cavernous hemangiomas are usually small and asymptomatic. They are often discovered incidentally, and only a few require treatment. However, giant hemangiomas may cause symptoms, which are indications for intervention. In this study, we describe four cases of symptomatic giant hepatic hemangiomas successfully treated with transcatheter arterial embolization, performed with polyvinyl alcohol particles. There were no complications observed. Follow-up clinical and imaging examinations demonstrated the disappearance of symptoms and a decrease in the size of lesions.

### Management of hemangioma of the liver: Surgical therapy or observation [^113UwHKZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Elective surgery for liver hemangioma is controversial. We reviewed long-term outcomes following elective hepatectomy or observation only for symptomatic and asymptomatic liver hemangioma.

- **Methods**: All patients (n = 307) with liver hemangioma referred to our hospital for surgical evaluation from January 1988 to December 2009 were identified, and imaging results, tumor characteristics, surgical indication, surgical mode, outcome of observation, clinical and/or postoperative outcome, and adverse events were retrospectively evaluated.

- **Results**: Complete median follow-up for 246 patients was 124 months. Elective surgery was performed in 103 patients (symptomatic [n = 62] and asymptomatic [n = 41]). Postoperative morbidity occurred in 17% of the patients and was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients (p = 0.002). No perioperative mortality was registered. Surgery relieved complaints in most (88%) patients. In the observation group (n = 143), 56% of patients had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms. Major hemangioma-related complications occurred in 12 patients (9%) during the follow-up period, and 2 patients died after traumatic hemangioma rupture. Overall, the rate of adverse events was by trend lower in the surgical group than in the observation group (35 versus 57%; p = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: The majority of patients with liver hemangioma can be safely managed by clinical observation. In a subset of patients, especially those with giant hemangioma and/or occurrence of symptoms, surgical treatment could be considered and is justified.

### Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic liver resection for cavernous hemangioma: A propensity score matching study [^1121Ssgz]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

During the study period, 287 patients with liver hemangiomas underwent minimally invasive liver resection. There were 43 patients who underwent robot-assisted liver resection (RALR) and 244 who underwent laparoscopic liver resection (LLR).

The patient demographics and preoperative characteristics are as follows: there were 196 female and 91 male patients, with a median age of 48 years (range 24–66). Fifty-six of the 287 patients were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were upper abdominal discomfort (n = 76), right or left quadrant abdominal pain (n = 79), and abdominal mass (n = 1). An important indication for surgery was rapid growth (n = 75). The median hemangioma size was 8.6 cm (range 5–25). One hundred ninety-two patients (66.9%) had a single hemangioma, while 95 patients (33.1%) had multiple hemangiomas.

The lesions were located in the right hemilivers in 88 patients (30.7%), left hemilivers in 170 patients (59.2%), and bilateral hemilivers in 29 patients (10.1%). Eighty-seven patients had their hemangiomas in the posterosuperior segments, whereas 200 patients had them in the anteroperipheral segments. In 107 patients, the liver hemangioma was in close proximity to major hepatic veins or the inferior vena cava, and in 23 patients, it was close to the porta hepatis.

Significant values are presented in bold (p < 0.05).

### Critical infantile hepatic hemangioma: Results of a nationwide survey by the Japanese Infantile Hepatic Hemangioma Study Group [^113K2fF8]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The survey aimed to describe the clinical features of critical infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) and the implications of recent treatments.

- **Materials and methods**: A nationwide survey of critical IHH patients treated between 2005 and 2010 was performed in all 117 registered pediatric surgical hospitals in Japan. As a result, 19 patients were identified and reviewed using statistical analysis.

- **Results**: Abdominal distention (47.4%), high-output cardiac failure (47.4%), coagulopathy (42.1%), and respiratory distress (31.6%) were the major symptoms. Three patients died (1 of coagulopathy, 1 of cardiac failure, and 1 of both). An accompanying portovenous shunt was also highlighted. Infantile hepatic hemangioma was totally insensitive to steroid treatment in 3 (23.1%) of the 13 patients, and 9 (47.4%) of the 19 patients required other treatments. Surgical resection and β-blocker improved the hematologic data, whereas hepatic arterial ligation and embolization seemed to produce a limited effect. Among the deceased patients, several hematologic parameters were significantly worse: the thrombocyte count (pretherapeutic: 73,000 vs. 300,000/mm³, deceased vs. survivor respectively [P < .03]; posttherapeutic: 66,000 vs. 388,700/mm³ [P < .003]) and the prothrombin time (posttherapeutic, 35.0 vs 12.1 seconds [P < .0001], deceased vs. survivor respectively).

- **Conclusion**: For critical IHH cases with steroid-insensitive hematologic disorders, alternative treatments including β-blocker therapy, surgery, and liver transplantation should be considered.

### Haemangioma: Clinical course, complications and management [^1157xLi3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite their high incidence, most infantile haemangiomas (IH) do not require treatment as they regress spontaneously and most do not leave significant sequelae. For the subset of haemangiomas that require treatment, indications for intervention can be divided into three main categories: ulceration, disfigurement, and impairment of function or vital structures. In addition, certain IH have a risk of associated structural anomalies. Given the wide heterogeneity of haemangiomas, deciding which haemangiomas need intervention and when to intervene requires a detailed knowledge of natural history and clinical indicators of increased risk.

### Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic liver resection for cavernous hemangioma: a propensity score matching study [^113cYJdd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Liver hemangioma is a benign disease, with enucleation being the preferred surgical treatment as it avoids unnecessary loss of healthy liver parenchyma. The identification of a plane between the pseudocapsule of a hemangioma and liver parenchyma is the most challenging part of the procedure. Delicate detachment of the lesion from the pseudocapsule carries a risk of bleeding, especially when the hemangioma is adjacent to major vascular structures.

Our study showed robotic surgery to have a significant advantage in reducing intraoperative blood loss over traditional laparoscopic surgery for patients with hemangioma in close proximity to major vascular structures. Possible reasons include the following:

- **Robotic surgery system benefits**: The system provides a stable and three-dimensional view with magnification of the field of operation. The high-quality images allow surgeons to detect the plane between the hemangioma and normal liver parenchyma and to identify the blood vessels supplying the hemangioma more easily.

- **Application to liver parenchymal transection**: The robotic surgery system is particularly applicable to liver parenchymal transection through a curved parenchymal plane. The combination of the EndoWristed Maryland bipolar forceps and a harmonic scalpel facilitates enucleation of liver hemangioma.

- **EndoWristed technology advantages**: With seven degrees of freedom, the technology allows rapid and precise suturing of vascular branches coming from the major vascular structures to the hemangioma.

### Hepatic hemangiomas: Subtype classification and development of a clinical practice algorithm and registry [^117TsTvz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangiomas, though histologically benign, may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in afflicted infants. The literature presents much confusion regarding the natural history and treatment options for hepatic hemangiomas. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic self-limiting lesions to congestive heart failure associated with high-volume vascular shunting to fulminant hepatic failure with hypothyroidism, abdominal compartment syndrome, and death. There has been little rationale to choose among observation, corticosteroids, other pharmacologic agents, arterial embolization, hepatic artery ligation, resection, or liver transplantation for any given patient.

We analyzed several recent retrospective radiologic analyses and pathologic studies to determine whether hepatic hemangiomas could be categorized, allowing prediction of their natural history and rational choice of therapies based upon their clinical presentation and radiographic appearance.

We propose that hepatic hemangiomas do not represent a single entity but, rather, three principal categories of lesions: focal, multifocal, and diffuse. Because these categories represent different anatomical and physiological variants, they may respond differently to previously anecdotally applied treatment regimens. With input from international multidisciplinary authorities on hemangiomas, we developed and proposed a clinical practice algorithm for the evaluation and management of hepatic hemangiomas. Toward that end, we propose a plan to institute a web-based international registry for tracking treatment outcomes and refining management strategies.

### Elective surgery for benign liver tumours [^114dDXK4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Benign liver tumours, including haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma, have different prevalence and prognosis. Spontaneous rupture and malignant transformation can complicate hepatic adenoma. Elective surgery is controversial, with indications including uncertain diagnosis, presence of symptoms, and prevention of major complications.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of elective surgery for benign liver tumours. We identified 31 case series, which were small (with less than 60 participants) and included mixed types of tumours. These studies reported no significant mortality; however, in the six studies with mortality, it ranged from 1% to 17%.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (searches in Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) were searched as of December 2005. Further searches included the proceedings of major hepatological and surgical congresses, such as the Annual Meetings of the American Association for the Study of the Liver (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), as well as examination of the references of relevant papers and reference lists of identified studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials in adult patients with benign liver tumours without indications for emergency surgery, comparing elective surgery (resection) versus no intervention or sham operation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All trials were considered in the analysis.

### Guidance document for hepatic hemangioma (infantile and congenital) evaluation and monitoring [^115fMZWv]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

To define the types of hepatic hemangiomas, we utilized the updated International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification. This allowed us to create a set of guidelines for their diagnostic evaluation and monitoring.

- **Study design**: We employed a rigorous, transparent consensus protocol defined by an approved methodology, with input from multiple pediatric experts in vascular anomalies from hematology-oncology, surgery, pathology, radiology, and gastroenterology.

- **Results**: In the first section, we define the subtypes of hepatic hemangiomas based on the clinical course, histology, and radiologic characteristics. We recommend against using the term "hemangioma" for any vascular malformations affecting the liver or any hypervascular tumors that are not characterized by the approved definitions. We also advise against using the term "hemangioendothelioma" for infantile or congenital hemangioma. The following two sections dedicated to infantile hepatic hemangioma and congenital hepatic hemangioma individually describe these subtypes in further detail, including complications to be considered during monitoring and the recommended screening evaluations.

- **Conclusions**: While variations in institutional practices may exist for specific clinical details, a clear understanding of the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas affecting children and the potential complications requiring monitoring should be standardized. Given that children with hepatic hemangiomas are managed by various medical and surgical specialties, we provide a multidisciplinary expert opinion consensus.

### Tumor size is not a criterion for resection during the management of giant hemangioma of the liver [^112yFZcd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors. The management of giant (≥ 5 cm) hemangioma of the liver remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of tumor size on postoperative outcomes after hepatectomy in patients with giant hemangioma of the liver.

- **Methods**: Patients who were subjected to resection because of giant liver hemangioma between December 2006 and July 2012 were grouped by the largest tumor size: 5–10 cm (group A) and 10–15 cm (group B). All patients underwent detailed preoperative assessments. Clinicopathologic features were analyzed, and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors that correlated independently with any complication, as well as the intraoperative red blood cell transfusion requirement. Long-term outcomes were assessed with a median follow-up of 56 months.

- **Results**: One hundred and ninety patients, mean age 46 years, were included. The 146 patients with tumors 5–10 cm in size were compared with the remaining 44 patients with tumors 10–15 cm in size. The differences in postoperative morbidity (29.86% vs. 41.30%, P = 0.150) and duration of hospitalization (11.06 ± 7.02 vs. 12.17 ± 7.74 days, P = 0.465) between group A and group B did not reach statistical significance. Operation time, blood loss, and transfusion volume of group B were greater than those of group A. No perioperative deaths occurred, and no recurrences were registered during follow-up in both groups. The results of univariate and multivariate analysis showed that diameter was not an independent risk factor of postoperative complications.

### Spontaneous regression of liver hemangiomas: a single-institution analysis of 46 patients [^113jCiPQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the nature of spontaneous regression of liver hemangiomas. The records of the liver hemangioma patients who attended the outpatient clinic between 1988 and 2018 were evaluated. The data of the 716 adult patients who were followed for at least 3 years with cross-sectional imaging were analyzed.

Spontaneous regression was documented in 46 patients (6.4%). Twenty-eight patients had a single hemangioma (61%), eight (17%) had two hemangiomas, and the other ten patients had 3–6 hemangiomas. Of the 87 lesions in 46 patients, 69 actually regressed during the study. Twelve patients with more than one lesion exhibited discordant courses — one of the hemangiomas of a patient with multiple lesions regressed, whereas the other enlarged or remained stable. Eleven of the regressed hemangiomas exhibited enlargement first, followed by spontaneous regression. Fourteen (20%) of the regressed hemangiomas acquired atypical characteristics that would have suggested a malignancy had the original films been unavailable.

Spontaneous regression of liver hemangiomas is an underrecognized phenomenon. Enlargement should not be a straightforward indication for intervention because it may be followed by regression. A regressed hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of liver lesions suspicious for malignancy.

### Cavernous hemangioma of the liver: Factors affecting disease progression in general hepatology practice [^114Ddo87]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Although conservative management is generally recommended for asymptomatic hepatic hemangiomas, factors affecting the disease course are still not very well understood.

- **Aim**: To determine disease characteristics of cavernous hemangioma and factors affecting its progression in patients from a general hepatology clinic in Tehran, Iran.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical records of 198 patients with cavernous hemangioma of the liver visiting a large private hepatology clinic in Tehran from 1997 to 2007. Of a total of 198 cases, 129 could be followed up for a period of 3.2 ± 2.5 years, and 80 of these had 1–5 repeated sonographies.

- **Results**: Patients were between 27 and 84 years old (mean age: 44.3 ± 10.9 years), and 131 (66.2%) were female. Thirty-six patients (18.2%) had giant hemangiomas. Abdominal pain was the primary reason for evaluation in 100 (50.5%) patients. Abdominal pain at the beginning of the follow-up was significantly associated with having irritable bowel syndrome (OR = 8.3; 95% CI: 3.1–28.7) or other gastrointestinal diseases (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.6–10.2), but not with hemangioma size, number, or location. During follow-up, having a single giant lesion at the time of diagnosis, adjusted for age, sex, and presence of irritable bowel syndrome, was a strong predictor of persistent pain during follow-up (OR = 11.1; 95% CI: 3.2–38.6). In repeated sonographies, 35% showed an increased size, which was significantly associated only with having a single lesion (P = 0.04).

- **Conclusion**: Many symptoms in hepatic hemangioma are attributable.

### Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic liver resection for cavernous hemangioma: a propensity score matching study [^112RMAnv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

The surgical techniques involving robotic-assisted and laparoscopic liver resection at our institution have been previously detailed in reports. All procedures were performed by seasoned hepatobiliary surgeons who had successfully navigated the learning curves of robot-assisted laparoscopic resections (RALR) and laparoscopic liver resections (LLR).

Patients were placed in a reversed Trendelenburg position. The semileft lateral decubitus position was used when the hemangioma was situated in the right posterior section or liver segments 6, 7, and 8. The da Vinci S Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) was employed for robot-assisted procedures. Five trocars were used: a 12-mm camera port, two or three working 8-mm robotic ports, and one or two assistant ports for intraoperative ultrasound, suction, operative instruments, and endovascular staplers. The robotic cart was docked at the patient's head.

For laparoscopic surgery, five ports (5–12 mm) were positioned based on the hemangioma's location, with trocars arranged around the lesion in a fan-shaped pattern. CO2 pneumoperitoneum was established and maintained at 12–14 mmHg. Intraoperative ultrasound (Aloka, Inc, Tokyo, Japan) was routinely used to identify the relationship between the liver hemangioma and the major blood vessels.

### Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic liver resection for cavernous hemangioma: a propensity score matching study [^114VLpUT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

The feeding artery to the liver hemangioma was identified early and controlled with a bulldog clamp. A urinary catheter was used to encircle the liver pedicle to perform Pringle's maneuver before liver parenchymal transection. Central venous pressure was controlled below 5 mmHg during liver parenchymal transection. Enucleation was carried out using the technique described previously.

For laparoscopic liver resection or enucleation, parenchymal transection was performed by using a harmonic scalpel (Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH, USA). For robot-assisted procedures, a harmonic scalpel was used for transections along straight planes, while the Kelly clamp crushing technique using the endowristed Maryland bipolar forceps (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used for hemangiomas in close proximity to major vascular structures that required a curved transection plane. Divided small diameter vessels were bipolar electrocoagulated, while larger vessels and bile ducts were transected after clamping with Hem-o-Loks (Weck Surgical Instruments, Teleflex Medical, Durham, NC, USA) or with Endoscopic Rotating Multiple Clips (Ethicon Endo-Surgery). Laparoscopic linear staplers (EndoGIA, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) were used to transect the major vascular structures.

After the liver hemangioma was resected, any residual bleeding sites were controlled with suture ligation or electrocautery. The raw surface of the liver was checked for bile leaks. The specimen was inserted into a plastic bag and extracted through a suprapubic transverse incision. A silicone drain was applied.

### Early surgical intervention for Japanese children with infantile hemangioma of the craniofacial region [^116j63HX]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Although the indications for surgical intervention in patients with infantile hemangioma during the proliferation and early involution are controversial, it is considered in certain cases. Thirty-two Japanese patients (3 boys and 29 girls) were surgically treated at 24 months or earlier to resolve complications such as obstruction of the visual axis, ulceration and bleeding, and deviation of the nasal septal cartilage, or to achieve esthetic improvement. Results were evaluated by three indicators: outcome, scarring, and resolution of the functional problem. Excellent or good surgical results were obtained in 81.2% of all patients and in 95% of patients in nonorbital areas. Earlier surgical intervention can be an option for treating infantile hemangioma in the craniofacial region.

The average follow-up time of patients was 7.88 ± 5.49 months, and the first re-examination was done 2.92 ± 0.76 months after TAE treatment (Fig. 1). Radiological examinations suggested that the average maximal lesion diameter was reduced to 10.96 ± 3.66 cm from 13.14 ± 3.27 cm before TAE (z = −4.287, P < 0.001) and the average maximal volume decreased from 839.43 ± 722.39 cm³ before TAE to 509.38 ± 459.76 cm³ (z = −4.286, P < 0.001). Thirteen patients were followed up for the second time 9.07 ± 3.67 months after the first follow-up. Follow-up radiological examinations showed that the maximal lesion diameter and volume were decreased from 9.28 ± 2.64 cm and 343.37 ± 356.68 cm³ to 7.20 ± 2.37 cm (z = −3.18, P = 0.001) and 196.26 ± 231.10 cm³ (z = −3.04, P = 0.002), respectively.

### Infrahepatic inferior vena cava clamping with Pringle maneuvers for laparoscopic extracapsular enucleation of giant liver hemangiomas [^114KSf4n]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Cavernous hemangioma is the most common benign hepatic tumor, with an estimated prevalence of 3–20%. For most patients, the natural history of cavernous hemangiomas in the liver remains constant in size over time, and a giant hemangioma is no longer a necessary indication for surgery based on its size alone. Routine follow-up observations and corresponding imaging examinations of asymptomatic lesions are generally adequate. However, some cavernous hemangiomas may gradually grow into a large size and subsequently become symptomatic. The presence of progressive abdominal symptoms, spontaneous or traumatic rupture, rapidly enlarging lesions, Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, and uncertain diagnosis of liver hemangiomas are indications for surgical resection.

Surgery remains the sole curative treatment for giant liver hemangiomas. Anatomical liver resection and extracapsular enucleation are the most commonly used surgical approaches for giant hemangiomas. Anatomical resection involves resection of the hemangioma along with the ligation of related hepatic pedicle and division of hepatic parenchyma. This method results in the loss of normal liver tissues and gallbladder, especially right hemihepatectomy. Hence, extracapsular enucleation of hemangioma is the preferable treatment option. However, for a benign tumor, the distress caused by open surgery may be far greater than tumor-related discomfort. Most surgeons advocate laparoscopic liver resection of liver hemangiomas because of faster postoperative recovery, fewer overall complications, and shorter hospital stay compared to open surgery.

### Superselective transarterial chemoembolization as an alternative to surgery in symptomatic/enlarging liver hemangiomas [^1126GpdY]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Transarterial embolization of liver hemangiomas has not been considered consistently effective.

- **Methods**: The charts of 25 patients who underwent superselective transarterial chemoembolization with the bleomycin-lipiodol emulsion were evaluated retrospectively.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients experienced abdominal pain; asymptomatic or vaguely symptomatic enlargement was the treatment indication in three patients. A single session was conducted in 17 patients, two sessions in 7, and three sessions in one. After the first session, lesion volume decreased by a median (range) of 51% (10–92%) from a median (range) of 634 (226–8435) to 372 (28–4710) cm³ (p < 0.01), following a median period of 4 months (range 2–8). A second session was performed in eight patients (median (range) initial volume 1276 (441–8435) cm³) with persistent complaints and/or large lesions receiving feeders from both right and left hepatic arteries (a staged treatment). The median (range) lesion size decreased further from 806 (245–4710) to 464 (159–2150) cm³ (p < 0.01). Three patients experienced a postembolization syndrome that persisted after the first week. Seventeen of the 22 symptomatic patients (77%) reported resolution or marked amelioration of complaints. Regrowth after initial regression was not observed during a median (range) of 14 (8–39) months of follow-up (n:18).

- **Conclusion**: Transarterial chemoembolization with the bleomycin-lipiodol emulsion is a potential alternative to surgery for symptomatic or enlarging liver hemangiomas. Volume reduction is universal, and symptom control is satisfactory.

### Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic liver resection for cavernous hemangioma: a propensity score matching study [^114SAPfm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Liver cavernous hemangioma is the most common benign liver lesion, with an estimated prevalence of 5–20%. These lesions occur most frequently in adult women and are usually detected between the third and fifth decades of life. Liver hemangioma is typically asymptomatic and is incidentally diagnosed on imaging studies. Once diagnosed, the majority of these lesions do not require clinical intervention, and observation of asymptomatic lesions using routine follow-up and imaging is usually adequate.

Surgical resection is the only curative treatment. Indications for surgery include progressive symptoms, spontaneous or traumatic rupture, rapidly enlarging lesions, Kasabach–Merritt syndrome, and an unclear diagnosis. Traditional open liver resection for hemangioma requires a long subcostal incision, followed by a long postoperative recovery and a high complication rate. Moreover, massive intraoperative hemorrhage remains a major challenge during liver resection or enucleation for hemangiomas.

Minimally invasive surgery is now widely adopted by liver surgeons to treat benign and malignant liver lesions. Compared to open liver resection, minimally invasive resection offers advantages such as decreased intraoperative blood loss, minimized postoperative pain, lower overall morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and quicker recovery. In past decades, laparoscopic hepatectomy has gradually been accepted as safe and feasible. In selected patients, it is a preferable treatment over open liver resection. However, several inherent limitations have hindered its usage.

### A retrospective study to classify surgical indications for infantile hemangiomas [^116jSwAg]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) spontaneously involute, but some leave contour deformities necessitating surgical correction. There is a paucity of data reviewing predictive risk factors associated with a need for surgery to guide clinicians when counseling parents. Patients undergoing IH resection by a single surgeon from August 2004 to August 2011 were reviewed to determine patient (age, gender, birth history) and IH characteristics (size, location) associated with surgical intervention. Data were compared to published data from the Hemangioma Investigator Group (HIG). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, odds ratio, and logistic regression analysis.

Out of 196 referred patients, 112 underwent surgery. There was a female preponderance (3.5:1). Two-thirds of patients (64.9%) first presented to the surgeon at ≤ 2 years of age, but most underwent surgery between 2 and 3 years (52.7%; average lag time, 11 months). Eighteen patients underwent surgery at ≤ 1 year of age. IH patients with preterm birth history had an increased risk for needing surgical intervention (odds ratio 2.124, CI 1.31–3.44; p < 0.0012). A majority (84.7%) of resected IHs were located on the head or neck, significantly higher than the distribution from the HIG data (62.2%; p < 0.0001). Resected head and neck IHs were smaller than those below the neck (average, 8.85 cm² vs. 22.35 cm², p = 0.017). Preterm birth is associated with higher risk for requiring surgical intervention. IHs on the head and neck are more likely to be removed when compared to those below the neck, and at a smaller size threshold.

### Historical and contemporary management of infantile hepatic hemangioma: A 30-year single-center experience [^116Tx2A6]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the outcomes of infants with hemangiomas of the liver.

Infantile hepatic hemangiomas exhibit a diverse phenotype. This study reports a 30-year experience and describes optimal management based on precise radiological classification.

Methods included a retrospective review of 124 infants (66 female) from 1986 to 2016, employing categorical analysis with Chi-squared and nonparametric comparison. Data is expressed as median (range), with P < 0.05 considered significant.

Results showed lesions classified as focal (n = 70, 56%), multifocal (n = 47, 38%), or diffuse (n = 7, 6%). Of these, 80 (65%) were symptomatic (e.g. cardiac failure n = 39, 31%; thrombocytopenia n = 12, 10%). Increased hepatic artery velocity was observed in 63 (56%). Median hepatic artery velocity was greatest in diffuse lesions [245 (175–376) cm/s] versus focal [120 (34–242) cm/s] and multifocal [93 (36–313) cm/s; P = 0.0001]. Expectant management alone was followed in 55 (44%). Medical therapy was utilized in 57 (46%) and was sufficient for symptom control in 29 out of 57 (51%). Propranolol therapy, employed from 2008, was sufficient for symptom control in 22 out of 28 cases (79%). Surgery (hepatic artery ligation n = 26; resection n = 13; embolization n = 1) was required in 40 (32%). Median maximal lesion diameter was 3 (0.5–17.1) cm and was greater in those requiring surgery (7 cm vs 4.9 cm; P = 0.04). The proportion requiring surgery decreased markedly in the propranolol era [pre-propranolol 25/48 (52%) vs post-propranolol 16/76 (21%); P = 0.0003]. Systematic follow-up with ultrasound to a median of 2.6 (0.02–16) years was implemented.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^1149k5mZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

**Limitations**: Indications for surgical resection vary among papers, and differences in patient background must be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of resection. Many reports suggest that surgical resection was performed in combination with sclerotherapy; however, these resections often occurred when more favorable outcomes were anticipated from resection rather than sclerotherapy. The criteria for selecting resection over other treatments are unclear, introducing a significant bias based on individual circumstances. Consequently, it is evident that it is impossible to conclusively state that resection is uniformly effective.

### Diagnosis and management of solid benign liver lesions [^1159PRBN]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

More asymptomatic benign liver tumors are being discovered incidentally and can be categorized into regenerative lesions and true neoplastic lesions. The most common regenerative lesions include hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver. Neoplastic lesions encompass hepatocellular adenomas and angiomyolipomas.

Regenerative lesions rarely increase in volume, do not pose a higher risk of complications, and usually do not require treatment. By contrast, hepatocellular adenomas and angiomyolipomas can increase in volume and are associated with a risk of complications. Large hepatocellular adenomas (> 5 cm in diameter) are particularly associated with a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation, especially the inflammatory (also known as telangiectatic) and β-catenin mutated subtypes.

Accurate diagnosis is essential to select patients eligible for surgical resection. MRI has significantly improved diagnosis and can help identify the major hepatocellular adenoma subtypes. The utility of biopsy results to inform the decision for resection remains questionable. However, when diagnosis remains uncertain after imaging, percutaneous biopsy can improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Clinically significant ascites as an indication for resection of rapidly involuting congenital hepatic hemangiomas [^1136Eb5F]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumor of infancy and are divided into two main types: rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICH) and non-involuting congenital hemangiomas. RICH typically involute by 12 months and are often asymptomatic. Surgical resection is rare. Indications for surgical resection include rupture, rapid growth, consumptive coagulopathy, and abdominal pain. We present two patients from different institutions who both developed clinically significant ascites as the RICH involuted, prompting surgical resection. This is a new indication for resection.

### Giant liver hemangioma: Therapy by enucleation or liver resection [^111neBVS]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Hemangioma is the most common primary tumor of the liver. The widespread use of ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) has made the diagnosis more common. Although the vast majority of hemangiomas are diagnosed incidentally and are asymptomatic, treatment remains controversial. Surgery is the treatment of choice, especially in giant, symptomatic hemangiomas and situations of diagnostic uncertainty.

Twenty-two patients, with a median age of 46 years, underwent either resection (n = 12) or enucleation (n = 10) for liver hemangioma from 1989 to 2002. Abdominal pain was the primary indication for surgery. Ten patients treated by enucleation were compared to twelve patients who underwent liver resection. The mean tumor size was 90 mm, ranging from 40 to 270 mm. There were no statistically significant differences in tumor size, preoperative liver function tests, hemoglobin levels, and platelet counts between the two groups.

Operative time was longer in the resection group, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.048). Blood transfusion requirement and blood loss during the intraoperative period were higher in the resection group (p = 0.025 and p = 0.01, respectively). There were three postoperative complications: one in the enucleation group (pleural effusion) and two in the resection group (liver abscess and wound infection). There was no surgery-related mortality in either group. Although most hemangiomas can be removed by enucleation or liver resection with low morbidity and mortality, if the location and number of hemangiomas are appropriate, enucleation is the preferred choice of treatment.

### Surgery for a symptomatic massive liver haemangioma [^111Lgd9f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Liver haemangiomas are the most common benign hepatic tumors, but secondary portal hypertension resulting from haemangiomas is exceedingly uncommon. We present a case of a man in his 50s who had a progressively enlarging mass in the right upper abdomen. CT of the liver revealed a large hypodense lesion involving the right lobe, with two smaller lesions in the left lobe. The portal vein was compressed by the tumor, causing portal hypertension. The patient underwent right hepatectomy.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful course, and a 3-month follow-up demonstrated resolution of the oesophageal varices and portal gastropathy, with hypertrophy of the left lobe. This case report highlights the successful surgical management of a rare massive hepatic haemangioma causing portal hypertension with surgical resection, emphasizing the potential benefits of surgical intervention with minimal complications.

### Invasive management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma [^113zAM5P]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangioma is common among benign liver tumors and usually grows slowly. About 50–70% of hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic, and management is not necessary; however, management should be considered in symptomatic patients. The optimal management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma depends on multiple factors.

- **Invasive management**: Invasive management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma mainly consists of surgery and interventional radiology, including transarterial embolization, ablation, percutaneous sclerotherapy, and percutaneous argon-helium cryotherapy. Although both surgery and interventional radiology are promising in the management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma, multiple and/or giant hemangiomas represent a clinical dilemma because the complication rate and recurrence rate are relatively high, and symptom relief is not always achieved.

However, a review of recent advances in treatment is lacking. We therefore summarized the invasive management techniques for symptomatic hepatic hemangioma to potentially facilitate clinical decision-making.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis and follow-up of a special type of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma [^1145eRpe]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). High credibility.

There is no consensus on the dynamic monitoring and treatment of hepatic hemangiomas, and management is tailored to tumor classification and the newborn's clinical condition. Fetuses with hepatic hemangiomas should have an ultrasound scan immediately after birth, particularly for giant fetal hepatic hemangioma. Asymptomatic infants are generally monitored for at least 1 year, as most hemangiomas regress spontaneously by age 1 year. Symptomatic cases presenting with dyspnea, heart failure, or hypothyroidism require medical treatment, transhepatic arterial embolization, or surgical resection.

Propranolol is the first choice for treating hepatic hemangiomas in infants and children. In addition, combining rapamycin with propranolol and glucocorticoids may enhance therapeutic outcomes. However, their side effects are greater. In children with poor response to medical treatment, high-flow arteriovenous shunting, and rapidly deteriorating cardiac function, urgent transcatheter hepatic arteriovenous fistula embolization is highly effective. When medical treatment fails and symptoms are severe, with focal or multiple lesions, surgical resection is effective. Regardless of the treatment plan, regular follow-up evaluations should be conducted through ultrasound examination to make the most reasonable adjustments promptly.

Ultrasound is non-invasive, effective, inexpensive, and practical for diagnosing hepatic hemangiomas. Its continuous dynamic scanning and color Doppler US provide detailed insights into the blood supply of the tumor and the function of other blood vessels.

### Spectrum of hepatic hemangiomas: Management and outcome [^1123Bdaw]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Infants with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas often present with hepatic hemangiomas, which can follow a benign clinical course or require complex management. This study reviewed our experience in the management of hepatic hemangiomas.

We conducted a retrospective review of patients (1996–2007) with hepatic hemangiomas treated at our institution. Twenty-six patients were diagnosed with hepatic hemangiomas as follows: 8 focal, 12 multiple, and 6 diffuse lesions. Nineteen (73%) patients had associated cutaneous hemangiomas, with 16 having multiple and 3 having single cutaneous hemangiomas. All patients with multiple or diffuse liver lesions were screened for heart failure and hypothyroidism.

Congestive heart failure developed in 4 patients; 3 of these patients had diffuse lesions. Two patients required thyroid replacement due to elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone. Due to disease progression, 9 patients required steroid treatment. Two patients were treated with vincristine, and 3 received alpha-interferon due to poor response to steroid treatment. Two patients underwent surgical resection for failed response to medical management and worsening heart failure, which included left lobectomy and liver transplant; both had uncomplicated postoperative courses.

Five patients had a previously undescribed constellation of rapidly involuting cutaneous hemangiomas (resolved by 3 months, Glut-1-negative) with associated liver lesions also resolving at a faster pace (mean resolution of cutaneous hemangiomas, 1.9 vs. 7.9 months; p = 0.001).
