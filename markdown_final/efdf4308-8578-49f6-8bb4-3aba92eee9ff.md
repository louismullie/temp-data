## Question

how to manage hepatitis B vaccine non-responder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing hepatitis B vaccine non-responders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define a non-responder and the timing of post-vaccination serologic testing. Then, I should verify the initial workup to exclude occult infection or other causes of apparent non-response. Next, I will consider first-line revaccination strategies, including higher antigen dose, alternative formulations, and intradermal options. After that, I need to check what to do if two full series fail, including when to stop and how to label true non-responders. Finally, I should review long-term risk mitigation, post-exposure prophylaxis, special populations, and counseling points, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition of a non-responder and the timing of testing, because misclassification is common if testing is too early or too late. A non-responder is typically defined as anti-HBs less than 10 mIU/mL measured 1 to 2 months after completing a standard 3-dose series, and testing earlier than 1 month or substantially later can underestimate seroprotection due to waning, so timing matters for accuracy [^113ocRqF] [^113Vf5hB] [^116YScPR].

> Wait, let me verify the initial workup before labeling someone a non-responder. I need to check HBsAg and total anti-HBc to exclude current or past HBV infection, because chronic HBV can masquerade as vaccine non-response and would change management entirely; if HBsAg is positive, the patient needs chronic HBV evaluation rather than more vaccine, and if anti-HBc is positive with negative HBsAg, that suggests resolved infection and durable immunity despite low anti-HBs, so further vaccination is usually unnecessary [^113Vf5hB] [^115C2U9u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about repeating the same series. I should confirm that the original series was actually completed and administered correctly, including intramuscular deltoid injection and appropriate intervals; improper administration is a recognized cause of apparent non-response, and ACIP emphasizes accepting only written, dated records and ensuring correct IM administration before declaring non-response [^115f4ruu] [^1117Nsjs].

> Next, I should review first-line revaccination strategies. For immunocompetent adults who fail a standard series, repeating a complete series with higher antigen dose is reasonable, such as Engerix-B 40 mcg or Recombivax-HB 20 mcg given at 0, 1, and 6 months, and I should recheck anti-HBs 1 to 2 months after the final dose to document response; this approach is supported by CDC/ACIP and aligns with occupational health guidance for healthcare personnel [^113ocRqF] [^114HBLX2].

> But wait, what if I want to optimize immunogenicity with fewer doses or a different adjuvant. Heplisav-B, a CpG-adjuvanted vaccine given as 2 doses at 0 and 4 weeks, achieves high seroprotection and is particularly useful in populations with lower response rates; ACIP supports its use in adults, and HIV-specific guidance recommends Heplisav-B as preferred for prior non-responders, with consideration of a third dose at 24 weeks if response is suboptimal, although data for a third dose are limited and this is a BIII suggestion [^1145fTdr] [^115UEsC3] [^113xwGJH].

> I need to check alternatives when Heplisav-B is not available or contraindicated. Switching to a different platform can improve response; for example, Fendrix, an AS04-adjuvanted vaccine, yielded higher seroconversion than HBVaxPro-40 in a randomized trial of healthy non-responders, and observational data in healthcare workers also suggest superior response with Fendrix compared with HBVaxPro-40, supporting a brand-switch strategy in selected non-responders [^114HBLX2] [^114s7J6s].

> Let me consider intradermal vaccination for high-risk non-responders, especially those with advanced kidney disease. Evidence suggests intradermal administration can be more immunogenic than intramuscular in hemodialysis patients who failed standard IM regimens, though it requires expertise and may not be universally available; this is a niche but evidence-supported option for select non-responders [^1143GsLi] [^1117Nsjs].

> I should double-check the approach after two complete series fail. If anti-HBs remains less than 10 mIU/mL after two properly administered series with optimized strategies, the individual should be labeled a true non-responder; at this point, further vaccination is generally not recommended because the likelihood of benefit is low, and the focus should shift to risk mitigation and exposure management rather than repeated ineffective immunization [^1126Ce9e].

> Next, I should review long-term risk mitigation for true non-responders. Annual anti-HBs testing is advised for immunocompromised persons and those at high risk, with boosters if titers fall below the institutional threshold, commonly 100 mIU/mL in dialysis settings; counseling on HBV exposure avoidance and prompt reporting of exposures is essential, and in occupational settings, institutions should ensure policies for enhanced precautions and post-exposure prophylaxis are in place [^1126Ce9e].

> I will now examine post-exposure prophylaxis, because this is where non-responders are most vulnerable. For percutaneous or sexual exposures to an HBsAg-positive source, non-responders should receive HBIG as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours, and a single vaccine booster can be considered if the exposure occurred in a partially vaccinated or untested individual; if the source is HBsAg-positive and the exposed non-responder has already completed two series, two doses of HBIG one month apart are recommended, with the first dose given immediately after exposure [^115vAeni].

> Let me think about special populations where strategies differ. In people with HIV, response rates are lower and vaccination is preferred when CD4 counts are higher, though vaccination should not be deferred if risk is high; Heplisav-B is preferred and double-dose regimens can be considered, with revaccination if anti-HBs remains less than 10 mIU/mL after the series, and some clinicians delay revaccination until virologic suppression and CD4 recovery if initial vaccination occurred at low CD4 counts [^113xwGJH] [^115NY6sP] [^115f4ruu].

> For hemodialysis patients, I should confirm that higher-dose, more frequent schedules and intradermal options are reasonable, and that annual anti-HBs monitoring with boosters is standard because titers wane quickly; these patients are a prime example where aggressive vaccination strategies and vigilant serologic follow-up are justified [^1117Nsjs] [^111TTp3R].

> For patients with cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, I need to ensure early vaccination before decompensation when feasible, and if they fail standard regimens, reinforced strategies such as three additional 40 mcg doses monthly can outperform a single booster, though response remains suboptimal in advanced disease; this reinforces the principle that earlier vaccination yields better outcomes than rescue after liver disease progresses [^112yjgUr] [^111VZvyK].

> Let me reconsider the role of combined or alternative formulations. Twinrix can be useful when both HAV and HBV immunity are needed, and in some immunocompromised settings, using the combination vaccine may improve adherence and sometimes immunogenicity, though data in non-responders are mixed and brand-switching to more immunogenic HBV components may be preferable when available [^114HBLX2] [^113xwGJH].

> I should confirm counseling elements for all non-responders. They remain susceptible to HBV, should avoid high-risk behaviors, disclose their status to sexual and household contacts, and seek prompt care after exposures; in occupational settings, institutions should maintain clear policies for post-exposure management and, when feasible, restrict exposure-prone procedures for personnel with documented non-response until risk is mitigated [^116H1cHQ] [^111TTp3R].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are not overlooked. All vaccine doses, dates, and serologic results should be recorded in immunization information systems, and patients should carry documentation of their non-responder status to expedite appropriate post-exposure care; this operational step is essential to close the loop on prevention and safety [^115f4ruu] [^113ocRqF].

For HBV vaccine non-responders, **confirm anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL 1–2 months after a complete series** [^113ocRqF] and exclude occult HBV with HBsAg/anti-HBc [^1174EpAi]. Give a **single challenge dose** and recheck anti-HBs in 1–2 months; if still < 10 mIU/mL, repeat a full 3-dose series (prefer Heplisav-B or double-dose Engerix/Recombivax) and test again 1–2 months after completion [^115UEsC3] [^112Xka3b]. If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL after two series, label as a true non-responder, stop further vaccination, and provide HBIG for exposures; in high-risk settings (dialysis, HIV, immunocompromised), consider intradermal or adjuvanted vaccines and annual anti-HBs monitoring with boosters if titers fall below 100 mIU/mL [^111TTp3R] [^1126Ce9e] [^1143GsLi] [^1117Nsjs].

---

## Definition and confirmation of non-response

Non-response is defined as **anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL** measured 1–2 months after completing a full vaccination series [^113ocRqF]. Confirm non-response by **testing 1–2 months after the final dose** using a quantitative assay that detects ≥ 10 mIU/mL [^113ocRqF] [^113Vf5hB].

---

## Initial evaluation and exclusion of occult infection

Before labeling a patient as a non-responder, **exclude occult HBV infection** by testing for HBsAg and anti-HBc [^1174EpAi]. If HBsAg is positive, manage as chronic HBV infection rather than vaccine non-response [^113ocRqF].

---

## Revaccination strategies

### General population

- **Challenge dose**: Administer a single challenge dose of HBV vaccine and recheck anti-HBs in 1–2 months [^112Xka3b].

- **Second series**: If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL, repeat a complete 3-dose series (standard or double dose) and recheck anti-HBs 1–2 months after completion [^114HBLX2].

- **True non-responders**: If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL after two complete series, label as a true non-responder and discontinue further vaccination [^115vAeni].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

- **Higher dose regimens**: Use double-dose vaccines (e.g. Engerix-B 40 mcg or Recombivax-HB 20 mcg) in 3- or 4-dose schedules [^117CcvUv] [^113xwGJH].

- **Adjuvanted vaccines**: Consider Heplisav-B (CpG-adjuvanted) for improved immunogenicity [^113xwGJH].

- **Intradermal vaccination**: Consider intradermal administration for hemodialysis patients and other high-risk groups [^1143GsLi] [^1117Nsjs].

---

### Special populations

- **Hemodialysis patients**: Use high-dose, frequent dosing, or intradermal routes; monitor anti-HBs annually and provide boosters if titers fall below 100 mIU/mL [^111TTp3R] [^1117Nsjs].

- **HIV-infected patients**: Use double-dose regimens or Heplisav-B; consider delaying revaccination until CD4 counts improve with antiretroviral therapy [^112Xj5dH] [^113xwGJH].

- **Healthcare workers**: Follow occupational health guidelines, including post-exposure prophylaxis with HBIG if exposed [^115vAeni] [^1133qRWJ].

---

## Post-exposure prophylaxis

True non-responders should receive **HBIG** as soon as possible after exposure to HBV, preferably within 24 hours [^115TSmZN]. For high-risk exposures, **HBIG plus vaccine** may be considered, although vaccination alone is often sufficient in previously vaccinated individuals [^112pw3Uh].

---

## Long-term management and monitoring

Provide **annual anti-HBs testing** for immunocompromised patients, hemodialysis patients, and other high-risk groups [^113ocRqF]. Maintain **clear documentation** of vaccination history, serologic responses, and non-responder status [^115f4ruu]. Counsel on risk reduction, including safe sex practices, avoiding shared needles, and standard precautions in healthcare settings [^11393JeB].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm non-response (anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL 1–2 months after complete series) [^113ocRqF] |
| 2 | Exclude occult HBV infection (HBsAg, anti-HBc) [^113Vf5hB] |
| 3 | Administer challenge dose and recheck anti-HBs in 1–2 months [^112Xka3b] |
| 4 | If still < 10 mIU/mL, repeat complete series (standard or double dose) [^113ocRqF] |
| 5 | If still < 10 mIU/mL after two series, label as true non-responder [^1126Ce9e] |
| 6 | Provide HBIG for exposures; consider intradermal or adjuvanted vaccines in high-risk groups [^115TSmZN] [^1143GsLi] [^1117Nsjs] |
| 7 | Annual anti-HBs monitoring and boosters if titers fall below 100 mIU/mL in high-risk groups [^111TTp3R] |

---

Managing HBV vaccine non-responders involves confirming non-response, excluding occult infection, and using targeted revaccination strategies. For true non-responders, provide HBIG for exposures and monitor high-risk patients annually.

### An evidence-based practical guide to vaccination for hepatitis B virus [^113LmWRR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly infectious, with over 292 million chronically infected people worldwide and up to 2.4 million in the United States. Following infection, clinically silent liver damage can ensue, but symptoms or signs of advanced disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, can take decades to emerge. HBV has the heaviest public health burden of all hepatitis viruses and has now surpassed other major communicable diseases (eg, HIV, diarrheal disease, malaria, tuberculosis) as a leading cause of death globally. Preventing transmission is essential, and efforts are in place to reinforce screening, vaccination, and routine follow-up. Three safe and effective vaccines are available in the United States and other countries for HBV prevention, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing infection and its sequelae have been substantiated. For the first time in over 25 years, a new Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine is available that offers a high degree of immunogenicity after 2, rather than 3, injections. Persistent challenges include the underutilization of vaccination, choice of vaccine, incomplete vaccinations, varying needs in different populations, management of nonresponders or those with undocumented or incompletely documented vaccination courses, and questions about whether and when booster injections may be needed. A panel of US academic hepatologists with expertise and experience in preventing and managing HBV infection have collaborated to write this practical clinical paper intended to guide clinicians in vaccinating for HBV and address questions that regularly arise in the clinic.

### Accelerating the momentum to achieve global elimination of hepatitis B infection: a scoping review of hepatitis B guidelines to reduce mother to child transmission [^114fkoE3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 5–10% of individuals failed to develop adequate antibodies after the primary series of HBV vaccination. These vaccine non-responders are vulnerable to horizontal HBV transmission. Only twelve CPGs addressed the management of vaccine non-responders and their suggestions varied. Administering three additional doses of HBV vaccine can induce immunity in 85.3% of infant non-responders. Immunogenic response to revaccination could be increased by increasing number of doses, using a higher antigen dose or a more potent adjuvant.

The strengths of this systematic review include the utilization of a comprehensive search strategy (without language restrictions), and rigorous methodology informed by the AGREE instrument. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyzed all recommendations and information to provide a comprehensive picture that may help researchers identify knowledge gaps requiring further research. Our study had limitations. We simply analyzed the guidelines without going through the evidence behind the recommendations individually. We also could not draw conclusions on certain aspects, such as the timing to discontinue antiviral after delivery, the timing of post-vaccination serological testing and the optimal management of vaccine non-responders. In addition, social factors such as stigma and discrimination, social marginalization, poor education, and limited access to healthcare services are possible barriers to prevention of MTCT and were not explored in this review of CPGs. However, our aims were to draw attention on the deficiency of current CPGs to eliminate HBV, highlight the discrepancies among CPGs and identify any research gaps (Table 5).

Table 5
Research gaps arising from deficiencies of CPGs.

We highlighted the current insufficiency among CPGs regarding the management of hepatitis B infected pregnant individuals. Current CPGs may miss the opportunity to offer earlier HBV assessment and treatment or suggest an alternative to utilizing HBV DNA to triage women for antiviral prophylaxis. Further evaluation is required on the clinical impact and feasibility of earlier treatment from early second trimester (i.e. 14–20 weeks), expanding the indication of antiviral prophylaxis to all HBV infected pregnant women when triaging investigation is unavailable, and giving the neonatal birth dose vaccination as soon as possible and within 2 h of delivery. These strategies are potential solutions to accelerate the momentum to achieve global elimination of hepatitis B infection.

Further evidence is required to identify the optimal management of hepatitis B infected pregnant individuals to prevent MTCT. The clinical impact and feasibility of earlier initiation and wider application of antiviral prophylaxis, as well as neonatal birth dose vaccination within 2 h should be explored.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^1133qRWJ]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination and serologic management for health care workers — Hepatitis B vaccination has resulted in a 98% decline in HBV incidence among health care workers during the past 30 years, and without vaccine protection, percutaneous exposure to HBV-infected blood is associated with a seroconversion risk of 1–6% if a source patient is e-antigen negative, but 22–31% if the source patient is e-antigen positive; HBV may survive on environmental surfaces for up to one week. Workers with reasonably anticipated potential blood and body fluid exposure must, according to federal regulation, be offered vaccination for hepatitis B, and health care workers who decline to be vaccinated should sign a written declination form, as specified in the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard. Those previously vaccinated for hepatitis B should have documentation of hepatitis B surface antibody response to the vaccine, and hepatitis B surface antibody testing should be carried out among previously vaccinated personnel without such documentation. Reasonable management of such individuals as a part of the pre-placement evaluation includes offering another dose of vaccine, followed 4–6 weeks later by retesting of hepatitis B surface antibody; those who remain hepatitis B surface antibody-negative should have the vaccine series repeated, with surface antibody testing thereafter. Because chronic hepatitis B infection is a reason for vaccine nonresponse, non-responders should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, and in general, vaccine non-responders should receive hepatitis B immune globulin if exposed to a hepatitis B-positive source patient.

Guideline 5.6 – BBV infection: identification and management of 'non-responders' to the immunisation programme

We suggest that patients should be regarded as an inadequate-responder if the anti HBs antibody titre is < 100mIU/ml 8 weeks after completing the first complete immunisation schedule. (1C).

We would suggest the following strategies:
If the anti HBs Ab titre is between 10 IU/ml and 100 IU/ml we recommend administering a booster dose of the vaccine. (1C)
If the anti HBs titre is < 10 IU/ml we recommend repeating the entire vaccination course with the high concentration of the vaccine (or the appropriate dose for children age < 16 years). (1C) Follow up with an anti-HBs antibody titre test 4 to 6 weeks following the last injection to ensure it is greater than 10 m IU/l.
If after two full vaccination courses the Anti HBs titre remains < 10mIU/ml we recommend that the patient is labeled as a non-responder to the vaccine, and therefore not immune to HBV.
A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and the recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B)

Guideline 5.7 – BBV infection: management of patients prior to overseas travel or high risk exposure

We recommend that responders to the HBV vaccine should have the anti HBs titre checked prior to travel overseas or high risk exposure (1C), with a booster dose administered if the Anti HBs antibody titre is < 100miU/ml. (1C).

Immunisation of staff against Hepatitis B virus (guidelines 6.1–6.2)

Guideline 6.1 – BBV infection: immunisation of staff against hepatitis B

We recommend that staff members who have clinical contact with patients should be immunised against HBV and demonstrate that they are immune to, and are not infected with HBV. (1A). Staff members who have current infection with HBV require occupational health clearance and ongoing monitoring in order to perform clinical duties. They would not usually be employed to work clinically on a dialysis unit.

Guideline 6.2 – BBV infection: immunisation of staff against hepatitis B

We suggest that staff that are not immune to HBV and are not HBV infective should not dialyse patients who are HBV infective. (2B).

Hepatitis B vaccination — management of prior non-responders (Anti-HBs < 10 mIU/ml) 1 Month After Complete Vaccine Series states that if prior Engerix-B or Recombivax HB vaccination failed, administer HepBCpG (Heplisav-B) IM at 0 and 4 weeks (AI) with consideration for a third dose of HepBCpG at 24 weeks (BIII), and if a prior two-dose HepBCpG (Heplisav-B) vaccination failed, there are no data but clinicians can consider a third dose of HepBCpG (Heplisav-B) IM at 24 weeks after first dose (BIII).

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^1126Ce9e]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

We recommend that non-responders to HBV should receive no further immunisation - the likelihood of benefit is low, compared to the cost burden. However there is some evidence that non-responders to a 4 dose 40 μg schedule might subsequently respond to a large dose given intra-dermally. In high risk groups (potential transplant recipients, individuals intending to dialyse away from base in a high risk area) this should be considered. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those more likely to respond to second courses include non-smokers, low BMI, age < 40, or high levels of immunosuppressive drugs at the time of the first vaccination.

A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B).

They should also be advised about the risks of overseas travel and dialysis away from base. Patients who are not immune to HBV who dialyse in units where the prevalence of risk of HBV is higher should undergo a period of enhanced surveillance on their return to the UK, and be dialysed on their own machine, ideally in a segregated area. (1C).

Guideline 5.7 – BBV infection: management of patients prior to overseas travel or high risk exposure

We recommend that responders to the HBV vaccine should have the anti HBs titre checked prior to travel overseas or high risk exposure (1C), with a booster dose administered if the Anti HBs antibody titre is < 100miU/ml. (1C).

Rationale

Haemodialysis patients who mount a good response to vaccine appear unable to maintain high antibody levels. Fleming et al. showed that 57% of haemodialysis patients who mounted a good response had lost detectable anti-HBs within 6 months of immunisation, and therefore will need a booster dose of the vaccine to maintain their immunity.

Future Considerations

Postlicensure surveillance studies and additional data pertaining to the use of HepB-CpG will be reviewed by ACIP as they become available, and recommendations will be updated as needed. Future economic analyses might inform cost-effectiveness considerations of HepB-CpG, including its use among persons at an increased risk for vaccine nonresponse.

### Management of non-response to hepatitis B re-vaccination [^114s7J6s]. Occupational Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bloodborne viruses, including Hepatitis B (HBV), are a known occupational hazard for healthcare workers (HCWs), particularly those involved in exposure-prone procedures. Whilst standard vaccines can provide immunity, 5–10% of people remain non-responders (anti-HBs titre < 10IU/L) despite repeated vaccinations. Fendrix® (HBV recombinant DNA vaccine) has been shown to be highly effective in renal patients and those with human immunodeficiency virus, implying it may also have benefits for healthy non-responders.

Aims

Our analysis set out to identify and compare response rates to re-vaccination (with Fendrix® or HBvaxPro40®) in HCWs with non-response to standard vaccination procedures.

Methods

Between 1 March 2010 and 30 April 2024, either Fendrix® or HBvaxPro40® was offered to HCWs with inadequate response to two courses of Engerix B® standard vaccination. Antibody tests were performed 6weeks post-final vaccine dose. Serological results from this period were retrospectively statistically analysed to compare differential vaccine responses.

Results

Eighty-five HCWs were identified as non-responders and offered further vaccination (42 received Fendrix® and 43 received HBvaxPro40®). Fendrix® resulted in a seroconversion rate of 95% (40/42) compared to 72% (31/43) with HBvaxPro40®; a significantly higher number responded more strongly to Fendrix® (74% versus 23%).

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate the rationale for offering additional vaccination with Fendrix® to HCWs when standard vaccination and repeated administration has not elicited an adequate immune response. Multi-centre evaluation of this vaccination strategy for non-responder HCWs should be considered to generate evidence for the most acceptable and efficacious approach.

### HBV seroprevalence after 25 years of universal mass vaccination and management of non-responders to the anti-hepatitis B vaccine: an Italian study among medical students [^113xHku6]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

According to international guidelines, healthcare workers and medical students immunized against HBV are periodically tested for anti-HBs IgG. Subjects who show an anti-HBs titre < 10 mUI/mL must receive additional vaccine doses to induce a measurable antibody response. This study aimed to evaluate the long-time immunogenicity of anti-hepatitis B vaccination in a sample of medical students and residents of the University of Bari who attended the Hygiene Department for biological risk assessment (April 2014-June 2017). The strategy for the management of nonresponder subjects was evaluated. A total of 3676 students and residents were invited for testing according to a standardized protocol. Anti-HBs IgG was tested for in 3140 (85.4%) subjects: 1174/3140 (37.7%) subjects were negative. 14.6% (128/808) of subjects who received the vaccine during their 12th year of life and 45.8% (1056/2305) of subjects immunized during the first year of life (P < 0.0001) were negative. 1005/1174 (85.6%) seronegative subjects received a booster dose, and 903/1005 (89.9%) were tested for anti-HBs 1 month after the booster dose: 82/903 (9.1%) subjects were still negative. Of these, 56/82 (68.3%) received 2 additional doses of vaccine and 52/56 (92.9%) were tested 1 month after the third dose: 50/52 subjects (96.2%) developed a positive titre. In conclusion, several medical students, immunized at birth or at young age against HBV, did not develop protective titres against the virus. Our management strategy (booster retest; for negative subjects, 2 doses and retest) seems consistent with the purpose of evidencing immunological memory.

Exposure to a Source Who Is HBsAg Positive

Unvaccinated persons or persons known not to have responded to a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should receive both HBIG and hepatitis vaccine as soon as possible (preferably ≤ 24 hours) after a discrete, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood from a person with HBsAg (Table 7). Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomic site, and the vaccine series should be completed by using the age-appropriate vaccine dose and schedule (Table 6). Exposed persons who are not fully vaccinated because they have not completed the vaccine series should receive HBIG (i.e. 0.06 mL/kg body weight) and complete the vaccine series. Persons who have written documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series who did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single vaccine booster dose. Exposed persons who are known to have responded to vaccination by postvaccination testing are considered protected; therefore, they need no additional doses of vaccine or HBIG. All persons with an occupational exposure to blood or body fluids that contain HBV should be managed according to guidelines.

TABLE 7
Guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis* of persons with nonoccupational exposure † to blood or body fluids that contain blood, by exposure type and hepatitis B vaccination status

Sources: CDC. CDC guidance for evaluating health-care personnel for hepatitis B virus protection and for administering postexposure management. MMWR Recomm Rep 2013;62(No. RR-10); CDC. Postexposure prophylaxis to prevent hepatitis B virus infection. MMWR Recomm Rep 2006;55(No. RR-16).

Abbreviations: HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen.

* When indicated, immunoprophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Studies are limited regarding the maximum interval after exposure during which postexposure prophylaxis is effective, but the interval is unlikely to exceed 7 days for percutaneous exposures or 14 days for sexual exposures. The hepatitis B vaccine series should be completed. These guidelines apply to nonoccupational exposures.

### Hepatitis B immune globulin (human) (nabi-HB) [^111poJ3R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For persons who refuse hepatitis B vaccine or are known non-responders to vaccine, a second dose of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) should be given one month after the first dose12.

Prophylaxis of Infants Born to Mothers who are Positive for HBsAg with or without HBeAg

Table 3 contains the recommended schedule of hepatitis B prophylaxis for infants born to mothers that are either known to be positive for HBsAg or have not been screened. Infants born to mothers known to be HBsAg-positive should receive 0.5 mL Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) after physiologic stabilization of the infant and preferably within 12 hours of birth. The hepatitis B vaccine series should be initiated simultaneously, if not contraindicated, with the first dose of the vaccine given concurrently with the Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human), but at a different site. Subsequent doses of the vaccine should be administered in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer.

Women admitted for delivery, who were not screened for HBsAg during the prenatal period, should be tested. While test results are pending, the newborn infant should receive hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth (see manufacturers' recommendations for dose). If the mother is later found to be HBsAg-positive, the infant should receive 0.5 mL Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) as soon as possible and within seven days of birth; however, the efficacy of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) administered after 48 hours of age is not known10,19. Testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs is recommended at 12–15 months of age. If HBsAg is not detectable and anti-HBs is present, the child has been protected12.

Revaccination strategies for hepatitis B non-responders with HIV — among persons with HIV infection who did not respond (anti-HBs titers < 10 mIU/mL) to a primary 3-dose recombinant vaccine series, 25% to 50% responded to an additional vaccine dose and 44% to 100% responded to a 3-dose revaccination series; therefore, persons with HIV infection who do not respond to a complete recombinant series should receive a 3-dose revaccination series (BIII), although some specialists might delay revaccination until antiretroviral therapy results in a sustained increase in CD4 cell count (CIII). Two randomised controlled trials have shown that using 4 doses of double-dose of the recombinant vaccine produces higher anti-HBs titers than 3 doses of standard-dose vaccine, and one study also showed a higher overall response rate.

### Safety and immunogenicity of double-dose versus standard-dose hepatitis B revaccination in non-responding adults with HIV-1 (ANRS HB04 B-BOOST): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113LBaio]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Revaccination with double-dose hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended in HIV-infected patients who do not respond to standard vaccination, but has not yet been assessed. We aimed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a reinforced hepatitis B revaccination protocol with the standard revaccination schedule in HIV-infected patients not responding to primary vaccination.

Methods

We did this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, at 53 centres in France. HIV-infected adults (aged ≥ 18 years), with CD4 counts of 200 cells per μL or more and no response to a previous hepatitis B vaccination or a 20 μg booster dose, were randomly assigned (1:1), according to a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks (block sizes of two to six), to receive either standard-dose (20 μg) or double-dose (40 μg) recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 24. Randomisation was stratified by baseline CD4 count (200–349 vs ≥ 350 cells per μL). Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but the randomisation list was concealed from the investigators who assigned participants to the vaccination groups. The primary endpoint was the proportion of responders, defined as patients with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titres of 10 mIU/mL or more, at week 28. We did analysis by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00670839.

Findings

Between May 19, 2008, and May 8, 2011, 178 participants were randomly assigned to the standard-dose group (n = 90) or the double-dose group (n = 88), of whom 176 (98%) participants were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At week 28, we recorded a response in 60 patients (67%, 95% CI 57–77) in the standard-dose group versus 64 patients (74%, 63–82) in the double-dose group (p = 0.334). Except for more frequent local reactions in the double-dose group than the standard-dose group (13 [15%] vs four [4%] patients; p = 0.020), there was no difference in safety between groups.

Interpretation

In adults with HIV-1 who have not responded to previous hepatitis B vaccination, double-dose revaccination did not achieve a higher response rate than did revaccination with standard single-dose regimen. However, the safety profile was similar between treatment groups. Our results should be assessed in future studies before double-dose vaccine can be considered for the standard of care of vaccine non-responders.

Nonoccupational Settings

HBsAg-Positive Source

This section provides recommendations for management of persons who are exposed to HBV through a distinct, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood, in nonoccupational settings (Table 6). The exposed person does not need to undergo postvaccination serologic testing following vaccination based solely on being exposed.

TABLE 6
Postexposure management after distinct nonoccupational percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids

Abbreviations: HepB = hepatitis B; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin.

* Exposures include percutaneous (e.g. bite or needlestick) or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids, sex or needle-sharing contact, or victim of sexual assault/abuse.

Exposed persons who have written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series and who did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single dose of HepB vaccine.
Exposed persons who are in the process of being vaccinated but who have not completed the vaccine series should receive a dose of HBIG and complete the HepB vaccine series (it is not necessary to restart the HepB vaccine series). HepB vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomical injection site (e.g. separate limb).
Exposed unvaccinated persons should receive both HBIG and HepB vaccine as soon as possible after exposure (preferably within 24 hours). HepB vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomical injection site (e.g. separate limbs). Studies are limited on the maximum interval after exposure during which postexposure prophylaxis is effective, but the interval is unlikely to exceed 7 days for percutaneous exposure and 14 days for sexual exposures. The HepB vaccine series should be completed according to the vaccination schedule.

HBsAg-Unknown Source

Exposed persons with written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series require no further treatment.
Exposed persons who are in the process of being vaccinated but who are not fully vaccinated should complete the HepB vaccine series (it is not necessary to restart the vaccination series).
Exposed unvaccinated persons should receive the HepB vaccine series with the first dose administered as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within 24 hours. Studies are limited on the maximum interval after exposure during which postexposure prophylaxis is effective, but the interval is unlikely to exceed 7 days for percutaneous exposure and 14 days for sexual exposures. The vaccine series should be completed according to the vaccination schedule.

Guideline 7.1.1 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit

We recommend that when a new case of HBV infection is identified, the affected patient should be referred to HBV specialist for further evaluation and consideration of antiviral treatment.

Antiviral therapy against HBV is effective in reducing the viral load to undetectable levels and as a result reducing both the infectivity of the patient and the potential for long term sequelae of HBV.

Guideline 7.1.2 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit - surveillance of prevalent Haemodialysis population

We recommend that, whenever a previously unidentified case of HBV infection is identified, units should carry out enhanced HBV surveillance (as described in section 3.6) on all patients who are not adequately immune to HBV (anti HBs titre > 100mIU/mL within the six months) who have had a dialysis session in that unit since the index patient's last negative test. (1B).

Guideline 7.1.3 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit – immunisation of prevalent Haemodialysis population

We recommend that, whenever a previously unidentified case of HBV infection is found, those patients who have anti-HB titre 10–100mIU/ml in the preceding 6 months, who have had a dialysis session in that unit since the index patient's last negative test should also be given a booster dose of Hep B vaccine. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) should be considered for previous non-responders to Hepatitis B vaccine (anti-HBs < 10mIU/ml) who may have been exposed in the previous 7 days. (1B) (Table 2).

### Serological response to three alternative series of hepatitis B revaccination (fendrix, twinrix, and HBVaxPro-40) in healthy non-responders: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, superiority trial [^114HBLX2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Serological non-response can be present after hepatitis B vaccination in healthy adults. We aimed to establish which of three revaccination regimens is most effective at inducing protective immunity METHODS: Healthy adults (aged 18–80 years) from 16 Dutch centres (13 public health services, two university hospitals, and one travel clinic) were included in this multicentre, parallel group, randomised, controlled, superiority trial. The inclusion criterion was vaccine non-response (hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] titre < 10 IU/L) after a primary series with three doses of one type of recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B virus (either HBVaxPro-10 or Engerix-B at months 0, 1, and 6). Participants were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to a vaccination series of repeated initial vaccination (HBVaxPro 10 μg or Engerix-B 20 μg) as the control, or to Twinrix 20 μg, Fendrix 20 μg, or HBVaxPro 40 μg. We used a web-based randomisation programme, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. Participants and centres were unmasked to assignment after randomisation. Laboratory staff and investigators were masked to vaccine-group assignment. All revaccination schedules were identical, with intramuscular vaccinations at 0, 1, and 2 months. Anti-HBs was measured at 0, 1, 2, and 3 months. The primary outcome was the percentage of responders (anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 IU/L) at 3 months. Immunogenicity and safety analyses were based on an intention-to-vaccinate analysis, the immunogenicity analysis with last observation carried forward for missing data, and the Bonferroni and the Benjamini-Hochberg method were applied to correct for multiple testing. The trial was registered in the Dutch National Trial Register and inclusion has been stopped (identifier NL3011; EudraCT-number 2011–005627–40).

Findings

The participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017. 480 participants were randomly assigned and included in intention-to-vaccinate analyses: 124 (26%) to control, 118 (25%) to Twinrix, 114 (24%) to HBVaxPro-40, and 124 (26%) to Fendrix. At month 3 the percentage of responders was 83 (67%) of 124 (95% CI 57.9–75.1 in the control group, 94 (80%) of the 118 (71.3–86.5) in the Twinrix group, 95 (83%) of 114 (75.2–89.7) in the HBVaxPro-40 group, and 108 (87%) of 124 (79.9–92.4) in the Fendrix group. Compared with the control group, the percentage of responders was superior for the HBVaxPro-40 group (adjusted difference 21.6% [95% CI 10.4–32.7], p = 0.0204 [Bonferroni corrected p value]) and the Fendrix group (26.3% [15.4–37.3], p = 0.0006), but not the Twinrix group (25.0% [13.0–37.0]; p = 0.0846). One serious adverse event occurred (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) in the Fendrix group, which was not attributed to the vaccine.

Interpretation

Revaccinating healthy non-responders with Fendrix or HBVaxPro-40 resulted in significantly higher proportions of responders and therefore indication for these vaccines should be expanded to enable revaccination of non-responders.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^1117Nsjs]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.4 – BBV infection: immunisation schedule for vaccination against Hepatitis B virus

We recommend that the initial HBV immunisation schedule should involve high doses, frequent doses or both of the available preparations.

We recommend that the vaccines are administered intramuscularly as per their licensed route (deltoid muscle) but, if sufficient expertise exists, the intradermal route may more effective. (1A) (Table 1).

The DOH has now developed a model patient group direction for use of HBV vaccines in advanced renal failure -

We recognise that there is a fine balance to be had with frequent hospital attendances versus pragmatic vaccination schedules. Although schedules indicated provide immunity as rapidly as possible, some flexibility around scheduling is possible with, for instance, vaccinations given every 3 months to tie in with appointments. The vital element is to ensure that there is a gap of at least 4 weeks between first and second vaccine. Extension of the vaccine schedule prolongs time to protection, but longer intervals between the doses do improve immune response. Patients should be tested 4–8 weeks after their primary immunisation course for evidence of response, and annually thereafter, with booster doses, as required.

Rationale

There are several reports of increased success of immunisation if higher individual doses of vaccine are used, a greater number of doses are given, and if the intradermal route is used.

Most studies have shown that a 4 dose double dose schedule over 6 months is superior to the conventional 3 dose immunisation schedule. This is also logistically easier than identifying non-responders to the 3 dose schedule and administering a booster dose.

There is some evidence that HBV vaccine with the adjuvant ASO4 (Fendrix) is more immunogenic than Engerix B.

There has been recent interest in adding immunostimulants to improve the success of HBV immunisation in patients with CKD but it is too early to make a firm recommendation and reports have, in some cases, had conflicting conclusions.

The World Health Organisation recommended universal childhood vaccination against HBV in 1992 and by 2003, 79% of member states had implemented this. The UK adopted this approach in August 2017. Countries that have implemented this have seen exceptional falls in their childhood prevalence rates of Hepatitis B. Cost-benefit analyses have strongly supported the introduction of universal vaccination against HBV to newborns, outside the UK, as part of a vaccination programme. Results of children's vaccination, which were evaluated in the six-year outcome of the programme, showed neither new cases of HBsAg de novo nor seroconversion to anti-HBc positivity.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

Epidemiology and Risk Factors

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^117VTzCt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Guidance

ACIP recommends that adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with risk factors for hepatitis B should receive HepB vaccines, and that adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors for hepatitis B may receive HepB vaccines. In previous HepB vaccine recommendations, providers were advised to administer HepB vaccine to all patients who requested it. The new language for adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors is intended to prompt all providers to offer HepB vaccination to patients in that cohort, rather than wait for a patient to request vaccination, thus shifting the responsibility of initiating the consideration of HepB vaccination from the patient to the provider.

Persons who have completed a HepB vaccination series at any point or who have a history of HBV infection should not receive additional HepB vaccination, although there is no evidence that receiving additional vaccine doses is harmful. However, there are cases where revaccination might be indicated as specified in the 2018 ACIP recommendation (e.g. nonresponder infants born to persons testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], health care providers, and persons on hemodialysis). Providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination. Vaccination of persons immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or HepB vaccination does not increase the risk for adverse events. However, in settings in which the patient population has a high rate of previous HBV infection, prevaccination testing, which may be performed concomitantly with administration of the first dose of vaccine, might reduce costs by avoiding complete vaccination of persons who are already immune. Prevaccination testing consists of testing for HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). The presence of HBsAg indicates current HBV infection. The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating immunity, either from HepB vaccination after a complete series or after recovery from HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV. Detailed interpretations of serologic markers for HBV infection are available (2). Lack of access to serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially in populations that are difficult to reach. Testing is not a requirement for vaccination, and in settings where testing is not feasible, vaccination of persons recommended to receive the vaccine should continue.

### Booster dose vaccination for preventing hepatitis B [^111f5Ybm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) wane over time after vaccination for hepatitis B (HB); hence, the duration of protection provided by the vaccine is still unknown but may be evaluated indirectly by measuring the anamnestic immune response to booster doses of vaccine.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of booster dose hepatitis B vaccination for preventing HB infection.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 4, 2010) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, conference databases, and reference lists of articles to May 2010. We also contacted authors of articles and manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials addressing anamnestic immune response to booster of HB vaccine five years or more after primary vaccination in apparently healthy participants, vaccinated in a 3-dose or 4-dose schedules of HB vaccine without receiving additional dose or immunoglobulin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors made the decisions if the identified publications on studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Primary outcome measures included the proportion with anamnestic immune response in non-protected participants and signs of hepatitis B virus infection. Secondary outcomes were the proportion with local and systemic adverse event events developed following booster dose injection. Weighted proportion were planned to be reported with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

There were no eligible randomised clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify randomised clinical trials on the topic. We need randomised clinical trials to formulate future booster policies for preventing hepatitis B infection.

### Hepatitis A and B immunizations of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^115vXM8J]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

All persons at risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, including men who have sex with men, those with multiple heterosexual contacts, abusers of illegal injection drugs, and persons frequently exposed to blood and blood products, are also at high risk for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. HIV can prolong the duration and increase the level of HAV viremia and augment HAV-related liver abnormalities. HIV also magnifies HBV viremia and the risk of HBV reactivation, chronic active HBV infection, cirrhosis, and death. Because of these concerns, hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all HIV-positive/HAV seronegative persons, with 2 standard doses given 6 to 12 months apart. Immune response to hepatitis A vaccines is excellent, even in moderately immune-suppressed individuals. Hepatitis B vaccination is also recommended for all HIV-positive persons lacking prior immunity. However, immune reactivity to hepatitis B vaccines is frequently suboptimal in terms of patients' rate of response, antibody titer, and durability. Relatively high CD4+ T-cell counts (≥ 500/mm3) and low levels of HIV viremia (< 1,000 RNA genome copies/mL plasma) are necessary to ensure adequate hepatitis B vaccine response. Higher hepatitis B vaccine doses, prolongation of the vaccination schedule, or both, as prescribed for many patients with non-HIV-related immune deficiencies, may be considered initially. Revaccination should be instituted if postvaccination titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are < 10 mIU/mL (< 10 IU/L). Nonresponders may also react to a subsequent vaccine course if CD4+ T-cell counts rise to 500/mm3 following institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy; vaccine adjuvant trials are under way. Universal, age-based immunization of all young and middle-aged adults appears to be the most comprehensive way of protecting all populations who are at high risk.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

Moreover, there may be several factors leading to vulnerability to infection even if this conversation is carried out, including vaccine hesitancy or unwillingness to be vaccinated, mis-remembering vaccination status, non-response to the vaccination, etc. Finally, ensuring a full vaccination course and a seroprotective antibody response level prior to potential exposure is impractical or impossible in many scenarios (such as waiting a full 6 months before unprotected intimate contact). In summary, current approaches do not bring to bear the full range of precautions to prevent transmission and the existing measures to reduce transmission are not infallible.

Reduction of transmission is of particular concern during adolescence and young adulthood. Most adolescents and young adults living with hepatitis B have been untreated despite high viral load, as they fall outside treatment criteria outlined by most national society guidelines to date. This puts them at greater risk of transmitting the virus during coming-of-age eras that include social and sexual explorationand is a concern for both sexual and perinatal transmission. Every year, an estimated 12 million adolescents between the ages of 15–19 give birth, primarily in resource limited settings. There is a heavy burden for young people with hepatitis B, who deal with fears of transmitting the virus, along with the tribulations of navigating disclosure and facing discrimination and isolation. WHO guidelines have expanded treatment down to those age 12 years, which is a positive advance in meeting the needs of this population. However, it is worthwhile re-framing discussion of treatment for young people to include the goal of reducing viral loads before initiation of higher-risk behaviors associated with adolescence.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111Xfdm4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination — HIV-infected adults and adolescents: Patients without chronic HBV or without immunity to HBV (i.e., anti-HBs < 10 international units/ mL) (AII) should be targeted, and vaccination is recommended before CD4 count falls below 350 cells/µL (AII). Preferred regimens include HBV vaccine IM (intramuscular) (Engerix-B 20 µg/mL or Recombivax HB 10 µg/ mL), 0, 1, and 6 months (AII), or HBV vaccine IM (Engerix-B 40 µg/mL or Recombivax HB 20 µg/mL), 0, 1, 2 and 6 months (BI), and combined HAV and HBV vaccine (Twinrix®), 1 mL IM as a 3-dose (0, 1, and 6 months) or 4-dose series (days 0, 7, 21 to 30, and 12 months) (AII). Anti-HBs should be obtained 1 month after completion of the vaccine series; patients with anti-HBs < 10 international units/mL at 1 month are considered non-responders (BIII). For patients with isolated anti-HBc, one standard dose of HBV vaccine followed by anti-HBs at 1–2 months is described; if the titer is ≥ 100 IU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if it is < 100 IU/mL, a complete series of HBV vaccine should be completed followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). Vaccine non-responders should be re-vaccinated with a second vaccine series (BIII), and some experts recommend vaccinating with 40-µg doses of either HBV vaccine (CIII); for patients with low CD4 counts at time of first vaccine series, some experts might delay revaccination until after a sustained increase in CD4 count with ART (CIII).

### Protective efficacy, immunotherapeutic potential, and safety of hepatitis B vaccines [^1112D9aW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccines are highly effective and safe and have been incorporated into national immunization programs in over 150 countries. The major humoral immune response is to the common a determinant of the surface antigen protein of the virus. Approximately 5–10% of healthy immunocompetent subjects do not mount an antibody response (anti-HBs). Non-response is associated with different HLA-DR alleles and impaired Th cell response, among other factors such as route of injection, age, gender, body mass, and other factors. Important hepatitis B surface antigen variants have also been identified, which may have a potential impact on immunization and routine screening of blood, blood products and tissues, and organs for transplantation. Strategies for hepatitis B immunization are reviewed. Over 1,000 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine have been used with an outstanding record of safety. There is no evidence of an association between hepatitis B vaccines and the sudden infant death syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Several studies are in progress on treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection by immunization with multiple antigenic components, combination of vaccine with antiviral drugs and cytokines, T cell vaccines, DNA vaccines alone or with DNA encoded immunomodulatory cytokines, and direct genetic manipulation of antigen presenting cells.

### Hepatitis B virus promotes liver cancer by modulating the immune response to environmental carcinogens [^112jiJR3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic DNA virus that can cause persistent infection in primates –. It is estimated that the prevalence of HBV infection is around 250 million cases worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of hepatitis and HCC. HBV's high prevalence has led to the development of a vaccine using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). However, HBV remains a significant global health threat. Key contributing factors include limited access to the HBV vaccine in certain countries, noncompliance with multi-dose regimens, and the presence of vaccine non-responders, estimated at 16% of the population, which are more prevalent among older individuals, those with obesity, and smokers –. Importantly, these same risk factors have well-known carcinogenic effects and may be the primary drivers of hepatitis and HCC in HBV-infected liver. As such, it is essential to determine the underlying mechanism linking HBV infection to hepatitis and HCC in order to effectively address this global challenge.

Guideline 7.4 - BBV infection: review of practice within Haemodialysis units following any BBV infection

We recommend that, when there is a new case of a BBV infection within a haemodialysis unit, there should be a review of adherence to infection control procedures related to the management of BBV. There should be a review of cleaning and disinfection procedures.

Rationale

Whenever a new case of blood borne virus infection is identified in the renal unit there is a risk that other patients may be incubating the same infection. For this reason it is necessary to perform enhanced surveillance of all at-risk patients. The screening should be coordinated and regularly reviewed by a senior member of the unit staff to ensure all patient contacts are adequately followed up.

In addition the risk of spread of HBV within the renal unit may be reduced by passive immunisation of non-responders to HBV vaccine using HBIG and by the administration of a booster dose of Hepatitis vaccine to all patients who had borderline HBsAb B titres in the preceding 12 months.

The assistance of the local virology and infection prevention and control services in co-ordinating surveillance and prevention measures is invaluable. The virology service should be requested to supervise the overall management of the new BBV infection(s) until no further cases are detected.

When Hepatitis B and C outbreaks in health care settings have been reviewed, the majority of outbreaks relate to incomplete adherence to infection control procedures - both standard - and those specific to haemodialysis. Cases due to machine contamination were rare (1 in 16) as were cases due to use of contaminated blood products.

### Three double-dose reinforced hepatitis B revaccination scheme for patients with cirrhosis unresponsive to the standard regimen: an open-label randomised clinical trial [^112yjgUr]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to compare the response rates between two different hepatitis B virus vaccination schedules for cirrhotic subjects who were non-responders to the first three 40µg doses (month 0–1–2), and identify factors associated with the final response.

Design

A total of 120 cirrhotic patients (72.5% decompensated) were randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 40µg booster vaccination at month 6 (classical arm) versus an additional round of three new 40µg doses administered at monthly intervals (experimental arm). The main outcome was the rate of postvaccinal anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL.

Results

Efficacy by ITT analysis was higher in the experimental arm (46.7%) than in the classical one (25%); OR 2.63, p = 0.013. The experimental arm increased response rates compared with the classical one from 31% to 68% (OR 4.72; p = 0.007), from 24.4% to 50% (OR 3.09; p = 0.012) and from 24.4% to 53.8% (OR 3.62; p = 0.007), in Child A, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) < 15 and MELD-Na < 15 patients, respectively. Patients with more advanced liver disease did not benefit from the reinforced scheme. Both regimens showed similar safety profiles. Multivariable analysis showed that the experimental treatment was independently response associated when adjusted across three logistic regression models indicating equivalent cirrhosis severity.

Conclusion

For cirrhotic patients, the revaccination of non-responders to the first three dose cycle, with three additional 40µg doses, achieved significantly better response rates to those obtained with an isolated 40µg booster dose.

Trial Registration Number

Immunoprophylaxis for the infants

80.9% (38/47) CPGs addressed HBV vaccination of infants. Among these, 42% (16/38) CPGs emphasized that the vaccine should be administered as soon as possible and should be given within 24 h (n = 8), 12 h (n = 6), 4 h (n = 1), and one did not specify a time. Nineteen CPGs only recommended vaccination within 24 h (n = 4), 12 h (n = 14), 12–24 h (n = 1), without emphasizing "as soon as possible". Furthermore, three CPGs advised vaccinating all infants without reporting any specific timeframe.

72.3% (34/47) CPGs addressed the administration of HBIG of infants. Among these, 35.3% (12/34) of these emphasized that HBIG should be administered as soon as possible and should be given within 24 h (n = 3), 12 h (n = 5), 4 h (n = 1), 72 h (n = 1), within 12–24 h (n = 1), and one did not specify a time. Eighteen CPGs advised HBIG administration within 24 h (n = 1), 12 h (n = 16), 12–24 h (n = 1), without highlighting "as soon as possible". Additionally, four CPGs advocated for administering HBIG to all infants, without specifying a particular timeframe.

Timing of post vaccination serologic testing of infants was addressed in 44.7% (21/47) CPGs. The most common recommendation was to test serology between 9 and 12 months of age (n = 7). Various other defined months of age were recommended by 7 CPGs, while 3 CPGs recommended serologic testing at different defined timings after the last vaccine. Four CPGs suggested utilizing a combination of age and timing after the last vaccine.

Follow-up for vaccine non-responders was addressed in 25.5% (12/47) CPGs. Among these, seven CPGs recommended on three-dose revaccinations, while three CPGs suggested revaccination with one or three doses of vaccine. Another CPG advised revaccination with a single dose of vaccine. The other CPG simply mentioned revaccination without specifying doses of vaccine.

Persons with Resolved (Past) HBV Infection

Patients should be counseled about their history of HBV infection and risk for reactivation. Therapies with the highest risk for reactivation include B-cell depleting agents (e.g. rituximab and ofatumumab). American Society of Clinical Oncology and AASLD guidelines have more information on therapies and conditions associated with increased risk for reactivation, as well as recommendations for treatment. Antiviral therapy for HBV infection, when initiated before immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy, can prevent reactivation of disease. The systematic review indicated the prevalence of resolved HBV infection (i.e. HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive) in the general population ranges from 4.8% to 14.0% (median = 6.2%). Notification, testing, and vaccination of household, sex partners, and needle-sharing contacts of patients with HBV infection or a history of HBV infection are recommended, as appropriate.

Persons Who Are Susceptible to HBV Infection

Persons who are susceptible to HBV infection should be told that they have never been infected with HBV and are not protected from future infection. All persons who are susceptible to infection should be offered HepB vaccine per ACIP recommendations. Anti-HBs concentrations can wane over time among vaccine responders. For persons with a clearly documented vaccination series who test negative for anti-HBs, refer to Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Vaccine should be offered to persons who have initiated, but not completed, the HepB vaccine series, regardless of anti-HBs status. HepB vaccine series completion is important for long-term immunogenicity.

Persons who are susceptible, refuse vaccination, and are at increased risk for HBV infection should be periodically tested. Frequency of periodic testing should be a shared decision between the patient and provider and be based on individual risk factors and immune status.

Persons Who Are Fully Vaccinated Against HBV Infection

Persons are considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a HepB vaccine series and can be reassured about protection against future illness. Vaccination status should be clearly documented in the medical record. Anti-HBs concentrations can wane over time among vaccine responders. For persons with a clearly documented vaccination series who test negative for anti-HBs, refer to Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for specific populations for whom revaccination might be recommended (e.g. patients on hemodialysis). Revaccination or booster doses are not routinely recommended for persons who are immunocompetent.

### Hepatitis B immunisation in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis B or with unknown exposure status [^117T8qNG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and harms of hepatitis B vaccination in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis B infection or with unknown exposure status have not been established.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of hepatitis B vaccination in people not previously exposed to hepatitis B infection or with unknown exposure status.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded (last search, March 2007). Additionally, we contacted experts and vaccine manufacturers, and read through reference lists for eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing hepatitis B vaccine versus placebo, no intervention, or another vaccine in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis B (HBsAg negative) or with unknown exposure status.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was hepatitis B infection (detecting HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA, or anti-HBc). Secondary outcomes were lack of sero-protection, antibody titre, clinical complications, adverse events, lack of compliance, and cost-effectiveness. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using intention-to-treat analysis assuming an unfavourable event for missing data. Sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality (risk of bias), available data analysis, intention-to-treat analysis assuming a favourable event for missing data, best-case scenario, and worst-case scenario were conducted.

Main Results

Twelve trials were eligible. All had high risk of bias and reporting was inconsistent. Hepatitis B vaccine did not show a clear effect on the risk of developing HBsAg (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03, 4 trials, 1230 participants) and anti-HBc (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; 4 trials, 1230 participants, random-effects) when data were analysed using intention-to-treat analysis assuming an unfavourable event for missing data. Analysis based on data of available participants showed reduced risk of developing HBsAg (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44, 4 trials, 576 participants) and anti-HBc (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.76, 4 trials, 576 participants, random-effects). Intention-to-treat analysis assuming favourable outcome for missing data showed similar reduction in risk. Hepatitis B vaccination had an unclear effect on the risk of lacking protective antibody levels (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.27, 3 trials, 1210 participants, random-effects). Development of adverse events was sparsely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

In people not previously exposed to hepatitis B, vaccination has unclear effect on the risk of developing infection, as compared to no vaccination. The risk of lacking protective antibody levels as well as serious and non-serious adverse events appear comparable among recipients and non-recipients of hepatitis B vaccine.

### Review: hepatitis B immune globulin for prevention of hepatitis B infection [^111khb8K]. Journal of Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Specific hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) contains a high titer of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigens and provides immediate passive protection against infection with hepatitis B virus, after acute exposure to infection. It is now generally combined with active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine. The principal indications for administration of HBIG are: a single acute percutaneous exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV); mucocutaneous exposure; unprotected sexual exposure; mother-to-infant transmission; prevention of re-infection after liver transplantation; non-responders to hepatitis B vaccine and immunosuppressed patients.

### Management of healthcare personnel living with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus in US healthcare institutions [^1174EpAi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in healthcare personnel (HCP) — vaccination follow-up and transmission data: The current CDC guidelines recommend that negative persons be tested 1–2 months after the last dose of the HBV vaccination series, and the vaccination series be followed by assessment of post-vaccination immunity (anti-HBs). If anti-HBs determination is negative, CDC recommends re-vaccination; if the second course does not produce protective levels of anti-HBs, CDC recommends that HCP be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) to determine infectivity. A report documented 4 instances of chronic HBV infection in HCP who failed to respond to 2 courses of vaccination. Since the previous guidance, only 2 instances of HCP-to-patient transmission of HBV have been reported, and in both events the HCP had viral loads > 10⁸ (ie, ~2.0 × 10⁷ IU/mL).

### Booster dose vaccination for preventing hepatitis B [^112mUsMu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) wane over time following hepatitis B immunisation; hence, it is unclear whether people vaccinated in three-dose or four-dose schedules of the hepatitis B vaccine are still immune when the hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) level in their body is undetectable, or lower than the level usually considered protective. This question may potentially be answered indirectly by measuring the anamnestic immune response to a booster dose of vaccine. The term 'booster' (or revaccination) refers to an additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) given some time post-primary vaccination to induce immune memory and improve protection against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of booster dose hepatitis B vaccination, more than five years after the primary vaccination, for preventing HBV infection in healthy individuals previously vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine, and with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels below 10 mIU/mL.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, conference databases, and reference lists of articles to January 2016. We also contacted authors of articles. In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials (May 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials addressing anamnestic immune response to a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine, more than five years after the primary vaccination, in apparently healthy participants, vaccinated in a three-dose or four-dose schedule of the hepatitis B vaccine during the primary vaccination, without receiving an additional dose or immunoglobulin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors decided if the identified studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants with anamnestic immune response in non-protected participants and signs of HBV infection. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants that developed local and systemic adverse events following a booster dose injection. We planned to report the weighted proportion with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

There were no eligible randomised clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to include any randomised clinical trials on the topic; only randomised clinical trials will be able to provide an answer as to whether a booster dose vaccination is able to protect against hepatitis B infection.

### High non-responsiveness of males and the elderly to standard hepatitis B vaccination among a large cohort of healthy employees [^116QY4WK]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B virus infection is a major health problem. Although non-response is known to increase with age, hepatitis B vaccinations are considered to have only minor non-response rates (anti-HBs < 10IU/L) in healthy subjects.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to quantify immunosenescence in a large retrospective cohort of 11,439 healthy adults who received HBV immunisation according to the standard vaccination regime.

Study Design

We evaluated the response to the standard three-dose vaccination regimen, consisting of 20-μg doses of the HbsAg recombinant DNA hepatitis B vaccine, among 11,439 healthy employees using a retrospective cohort design. Logistic regression was applied to predict the non-response rate, and multivariate regression analysis was applied to predict antibody response. Predictors of responsiveness included sex, age and time between the last vaccination and antibody titre measurement.

Results

From the age of 29 on in men and 43 on in women, more than 5% of subjects did not respond. Compared with women, men had a higher risk of non-response and exhibited a steeper decline in antibody titres produced with increasing age.

Conclusions

This retrospective cohort study demonstrates that immunosenescence starts at young age, especially among men, underlining the importance of vaccination at a young age to achieve long-lasting immunity. Moreover, HBV vaccination should always include testing for antibodies to facilitate the performance of necessary interventions to prevent long-term fatal complications.

Methods

From February 2016 to January 2018, the ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group † participated in three teleconference meetings to review the quality of evidence for immunogenicity and safety of HepB-CpG and implementation issues. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for evaluating evidence was adopted by ACIP in 2010. The Work Group identified critical and important outcomes for inclusion in the GRADE tables, conducted a systematic review of the evidence, and subsequently reviewed and discussed findings and evidence quality. Key outcomes were designated as critical (hepatitis B infection, severe adverse events, and cardiovascular safety) or important (mild adverse events). Factors considered in determining the recommendation included benefits and harms and evidence type. Values and preferences and economic factors were not systematically considered.

The scientific literature was searched through a systematic review of Medline (Ovid), CAB Abstracts, Embase, Global Health (Ovid), Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Search terms included "Heplisav", "HBV-ISS", "HBsAg-1018", "1018 immunostimulatory sequence", and "hepatitis B surface antigen-1018 ISS". To qualify as a candidate for inclusion in the review, a study had to present immunogenicity or disease endpoints or safety data on HepB-CpG. Studies were excluded if they were basic science, a secondary data analysis, immunogenicity outcomes for a nonlicensed formulation or use of HepB-CpG, a general review or opinion perspective, conducted on nonhuman primates, or if data could not be abstracted. Supporting evidence for the Work Group's findings is available online.

A summary of Work Group discussions was presented to ACIP on October 25, 2017, and February 21, 2018. At the February 2018 meeting, a proposed recommendation was presented to the committee, and, after a public comment period, was approved by the voting ACIP members as follows: HepB-CpG is recommended as an option for HepB vaccination for persons aged ≥ 18 years (14 voted in favor, with none opposed, none abstained, and none recused). This report summarizes the data considered, the quality of evidence, and the rationale for the recommendation.

Booster doses could play a major role in no responders or low responders to primary hepatitis B (HB) vaccine. Planed time point for hepatitis A vaccination in China provides a good opportunity to carry out HB booster dose by using combined hepatitis A and B vaccine.

Methods

A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety of toddlers 18–24 months of age receiving 3 different vaccination regimens: 2 doses of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (group 1), 1 dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine plus 1 dose of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (group 2) or 2 doses of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (group 3).

Results

All 3 groups showed 100% seroprotection for antihepatitis A virus antibody after vaccination. Seroprotection rate for anti-HB antibody before vaccination ranged from 79.5% to 92.9% in the 3 groups. After second inoculation, anti-HBs seroprotection increased from 92.9% to 100% in group 2 with postvaccination geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 2258.3 mIU/mL and from 79.5% to 98.9% in group 3 with postvaccination GMC of 2055.3 mIU/mL. The adverse events were not statistically different among groups (P = 0.345).

Conclusions

Combined hepatitis A and B vaccine could stimulate high level of both antihepatitis A virus and anti-HBs antibodies and not increase adverse events, providing a new choice for HB booster.

Vaccinated HCP

For vaccinated HCP (who have written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series) with subsequent documented anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL, testing the source patient for HBsAg is unnecessary. No postexposure prophylaxis for HBV is necessary, regardless of the source patient's HBsAg status (Table 5). TABLE 5 Postexposure management of health care personnel after occupational percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids, by health care personnel HepB vaccination and response status Abbreviations: anti HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HCP = health care personnel; N/A = not applicable. * Not indicated.
For vaccinated HCP (who have written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series) without previous anti-HBs testing, the HCP should be tested for anti-HBs and the source patient (if known) should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing the source patient and the HCP should occur simultaneously; testing the source patient should not be delayed while waiting for the HCP anti-HBs test results, and likewise, testing the HCP should not be delayed while waiting for the source patient's HBsAg results (Table 5). If the HCP has anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status, the HCP should receive 1 dose of HBIG and be revaccinated as soon as possible after the exposure. HepB vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomical injection site (e.g. separate limb). The HCP should then receive the second 2 doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series (likely 6 doses total when accounting for the original series) according to the vaccination schedule. So the HCP's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose. If the HCP has anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg-negative, the HCP should receive an additional single HepB vaccine dose, followed by repeat anti-HBs testing 1–2 months later. HCP whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL should undergo revaccination with two more doses (likely 6 doses total when accounting for the original series). So the HCP's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. If the HCP has anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL at the time of the exposure, no postexposure HBV management is necessary, regardless of the source patient's HBsAg status.
For vaccinated HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after two complete HepB vaccine series, the source patient should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. If the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has unknown HBsAg status, the HCP should receive 2 doses of HBIG. The first dose should be administered as soon as possible after the exposure, and the second dose should be administered 1 month later. HepB vaccine is not recommended for the exposed HCP who has previously completed two HepB vaccine series. If the source patient is HBsAg-negative, neither HBIG nor HepB vaccine is necessary (Table 5).

Management of Infants Born to Women Who Are HBsAg-Positive

All infants born to HBsAg-positive women should receive HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites (e.g. separate limbs). Only single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the birth dose (Table 3).
Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exists (e.g. presence of HBV DNA, HBeAg-positive, or mother known to be chronically infected with HBV) should be managed as if born to an HBsAg-positive mother (new recommendation).
The HepB vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). Although not indicated in the manufacturers' package labeling, Pediarix may be used for infants aged ≥ 6 weeks born to HBsAg-positive mothers to complete the vaccine series after receipt of a birth dose of single-antigen HepB vaccine and HBIG.
For infants weighing < 2,000 grams, the birth dose (i.e. the initial HepB vaccine dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of HepB vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
Postvaccination serologic testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series at age 9–12 months (generally at the next well-child visit following completion of the HepB vaccine series). Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing should not be performed before age nine months to avoid detection of passive anti-HBs from HBIG administered at birth and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers up to age 24 months. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later (new recommendation). Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Available data do not suggest a benefit from administering additional HepB vaccine doses to infants who have not attained anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL following receipt of two complete HepB vaccine series. HBsAg-positive infants should be referred for appropriate follow-up.
Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and receive postexposure prophylaxis may be breastfed beginning immediately after birth.
For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g. hospital with higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant's HepB vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered in a timely manner (new recommendation).

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^113RJ4Ap]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination in oncology — testing, dosing, and monitoring are described as follows: Although testing is not specifically required prior to hepatitis B vaccination, screening can assess immunity and vaccination status, and hepatitis B surface antibody concentrations can be lower during chemotherapy; ACIP recommends that immunocompromised patients receive a higher antigen dose, and a complete vaccine series improves seroprotection in nonresponders. Postvaccination antisurface antibody titers should be checked 1–2 months after the last dose, and the series should be repeated if hepatitis B surface antibody concentrations > 10 mIU/mL are not achieved. Accelerated schedules and newer two-dose or adjuvanted formulations have not been thoroughly evaluated in patients with cancer or other immunocompromising conditions.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113xwGJH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination in people with HIV — HepB-CpG performance, alternatives, and thresholds are detailed as follows: At 24 weeks (after 2 doses and prior to the third dose), 98.5% had seroprotective titers, and at 28 weeks (4 weeks after the third dose), 83.8% had titers > 1000 mIU/mL. Until additional data are available, if a titer > 10 mIU/ mL is not achieved, consider the patient to be a nonresponder, and a full revaccination series is recommended. If HepB-CpG is not available, alternatives include Engerix-B or Recombivax-HB using a double dose at 0, 1, and 6 months or combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B recombinant vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months. In individuals with low CD4 counts, either 2 or 3 doses of HepB-CpG was superior to 3 single-strength doses of Engerix-B, with seroprotection responses of 93.1%, 99.4%, and 80.6%, respectively; a 2-dose strategy may suffice for many, with HBsAb checked 2 months after dose 2 to determine if a third dose should be given at 6 months. No safety data on HepB-CpG are available in pregnancy; therefore, HepB-CpG should be avoided, and for those initially vaccinated when the CD4 count was < 200 cells/μL, improved response may be observed after virologic suppression and a CD4 count > 200 cells/μL are achieved.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines: autoimmune hepatitis [^111Xt4py]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Follow up before and during treatment

Patients under conventional or budesonide/azathioprine schedules should be followed with baseline and weekly tests for transaminases, albumin, prothrombin time, fasting glucose and full blood count during the first month. In patients under prednisolone/MMF, the above data could be obtained at 2–3–month intervals, along with IgG determination. After corticosteroid tapering, monitoring intervals can be every 3 months and every 3–6 months during maintenance therapy.

STATEMENT 10

Only a very small proportion of patients stay in remission without maintenance therapy with the conventional treatment regimens (II-2)

RECOMMENDATIONS 37–38

In AIH patients who have been in persistent complete biochemical remission for at least the last 2 years of immunosuppression, a liver biopsy should be recommended before treatment discontinuation (II-2)
The decision about treatment withdrawal should be based on direct collaboration between patients and doctors (II-2)

Baseline hepatitis B (HBV) and A serology is recommended before treatment, along with the respective vaccination for those not indicating previous vaccination or virus exposure. For HBV surface antigen-positive (HBsAg) patients, preemptive therapy with either entecavir or tenofovir is strongly recommended according to the EASL and the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) CPG. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, along with yearly influenza vaccination, should also be given to all patients.

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning assessment before treatment initiation and at 1–5-years intervals seems rational, but there are no specific data to support this assertion. Likewise, though no specific data exist concerning the use of calcium and vitamin D in patients under immunosuppression, such treatment seems reasonable, as in other diseases under corticosteroids.

Specific conditions and difficult-to-treat patients

Non-responders

Non-response includes a partial or incomplete response and treatment failure (null response), associated or not with an acute/severe form of the disease.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114hBctn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

HBV immunity assessment and vaccination around anticancer therapy are outlined. Anti-HBs testing allows for assessing immunity, and individuals who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc, as well as anti-HBs, have never been exposed to HBV, are not immune, and thus are susceptible to HBV infection. Vaccination can be recommended, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing, although insufficient data exist to recommend vaccination specifically for immunocompromised individuals. Some recommendations suggest waiting 3–6 months after cessation of anticancer treatment, and because anticancer therapy can dampen immunogenicity of HBV vaccination, higher doses or more intensive vaccination regimens may be needed to achieve protective levels of anti-HBs. If immunocompromised patients receive vaccination, postvaccination serology testing has been suggested. Among patients who have isolated anti-HBc–positive with negative HBsAg and anti-HBs, studies have shown that protective levels of anti-HBs can decrease risk of HBV reactivation.

### Efficacy of an accelerated double-dose hepatitis B vaccine regimen in patients with cirrhosis [^111VZvyK]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine is recommended in unvaccinated adults with cirrhosis, despite its low efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the response to a double-dose/accelerated vaccine schedule in patients with cirrhosis admitted into a hepatology ward. All patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hepatology ward without exclusion criteria were offered the HBV HBVAXPRO 40mcg vaccine at months 0, 1 and 2. Non-responders received a second cycle. We evaluated 468 patients and only 19% were seroprotected against HBV. In 196 patients without exclusion criteria for HBV vaccination, the per protocol response rate (anti-HBs > 10 U/ml) was 23% after a first cycle and 59% after a second cycle. The overall response per intention to treat was only 23%. We have not identified predictors of response. Only one patient had a mild adverse event. Most patients with cirrhosis admitted in the hepatology ward are unprotected against HBV. Although a second HBV vaccination cycle increases the response rate, the poor overall response reinforces the implementation of HBV vaccination before the development of cirrhosis.

Previously Vaccinated HCP

Providers should only accept written, dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination.
An increasing number of HCP have received routine HepB vaccination during childhood. No postvaccination serologic testing is recommended after routine infant or adolescent HepB vaccination. Because vaccine-induced anti-HBs wanes over time, testing HCP for anti-HBs years after vaccination might not distinguish vaccine nonresponders from responders. Pre-exposure assessment of current or past anti-HBs results upon hire or matriculation, followed by one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine for HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL and retesting anti-HBs, if necessary, helps to ensure that HCP will be protected if they have an exposure to HBV-containing blood or body fluids (Box 5; Figure 3). BOX 5 Testing anti-HBs for health care personnel (HCP) vaccinated in the past The issue: An increasing number of HCP have received routine hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination during childhood. No postvaccination serologic testing is recommended after routine infant or adolescent HepB vaccination. Because vaccine-induced antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) wanes over time, testing HCP for anti-HBs years after vaccination might not distinguish vaccine nonresponders from responders. Guidance for health care institutions: Health care institutions may measure anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation for HCP who have documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series in the past (e.g. as part of routine infant or adolescent vaccination). HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL should receive one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine and retesting (Figure 3). Institutions that decide to not measure anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation for HCP who have documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series in the past should ensure timely assessment and postexposure prophylaxis following an exposure (Table 5). Considerations: The risk for occupational HBV infection for vaccinated HCP might be low enough in certain settings so that assessment of anti-HBs status and appropriate follow-up should be done at the time of exposure to potentially infectious blood or body fluids. This approach relies on HCP recognizing and reporting blood and body fluid exposures and therefore may be applied on the basis of documented low risk, implementation, and cost considerations. Certain HCP occupations have lower risk for occupational blood and body fluid exposures (e.g. occupations involving counseling versus performing procedures), and nontrainees have lower risks for blood and body fluid exposures than trainees. Some settings also will have a lower prevalence of HBV infection in the patient population served than in other settings, which will influence the risk for HCP exposure to HBsAg-positive blood and body fluids. FIGURE 3 Pre-exposure evaluation for health care personnel previously vaccinated with complete, ≥ 3-dose HepB vaccine series who have not had postvaccination serologic testing* * Should be performed 1–2 months after the last dose of vaccine using a quantitative method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL) (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). HCP who cannot provide documentation of 3 doses of HepB vaccine should be considered unvaccinated and should complete the vaccine series. Postvaccination serologic testing for anti-HBs is recommended 1–2 months after the third vaccine dose. HCP who are inadvertently tested before receiving 3 documented doses of HepB vaccine and have anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL should not be considered immune because anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL is a known correlate of protection only when testing follows a documented 3-dose series. Health care facilities are encouraged to try to locate vaccine records for HCP and to enter all vaccine doses in their state immunization information system.

### Comparative efficacy of a high-dose vs standard-dose hepatitis B revaccination schedule among patients with HIV: a randomized clinical trial [^113xkXii]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy of a high-dose vaccine schedule compared with standard dosage for hepatitis B virus (HBV) revaccination in patients living with HIV?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 107 adults at a single HIV and hepatology clinic in Chile, 72% of patients receiving a high dose of HBV vaccine achieved serological response as compared with 51% in the standard-dose group. Higher and longer-lasting hepatitis B surface antibody titers were seen in the high-dose group as well.

Meaning

These results suggest that a high-dose regimen may be superior to a standard-dose schedule for HBV revaccination to achieve seroprotection in patients living with HIV.

### Vaccinations for healthcare personnel: update on influenza, hepatitis B, and pertussis [^112rNf2Q]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at risk for exposure to and transmission of potentially life-threatening vaccine preventable diseases to patients and colleagues. The Centers for Disease Control and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend routine influenza immunization and maintenance of immunity to hepatitis B and pertussis, among others. In this article, we aim to review recently approved influenza vaccines, as well as address some of the issues regarding hepatitis B and pertussis vaccinations in HCP.

Recent Findings

Several new formulations of influenza vaccines are now available, including quadrivalent vaccines and non-egg-based vaccines; their use in HCP requires further study. An alarming rise in pertussis rates has led to a revision of ACIP guidelines recommending vaccination for women during each pregnancy. Persistent lack of immunity to hepatitis B after vaccine series remains a problem for many HCP.

Summary

Inactivated trivalent influenza vaccines remain the safest and most widely studied influenza vaccinations for healthcare workers. A pertussis booster in the form of Tdap is now recommended for most HCP. More studies are needed regarding the issue of nonresponders in HCP who receive the three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series, as there are some promising strategies available that may boost immune responses.

### NASPGHAN clinical report: surveillance, diagnosis, and prevention of infectious diseases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors [^114eKBAT]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination and revaccination in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — immunogenicity and management include that one study of mostly adolescent patients with IBD found that only 56% (49/87) had protective levels against HBV infection despite completing the 3‑dose vaccine series. In the group of 38 patients who were nonimmune despite receiving a full HBV series, 34 received a single booster dose; 26 of these 34 patients (76%) had an adequate response noted 4 weeks later, and patients receiving infliximab therapy were at increased risk for inadequate response. Pediatric patients with IBD with inadequate HBV antibody levels after the primary vaccine series should complete the 3‑dose series, and the immune response should be rechecked 2 months after completion of the third dose; the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine may be more immunogenic than the monovalent HBV vaccine and may offer an advantage, and no recommendations are available on how to proceed if a patient continues to have inadequate response after HBV revaccination.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115NY6sP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination — CD4 count and other factors affecting response in people with HIV: The magnitude and duration of immunogenicity to HepB vaccination with Engerix-B and Recombivax HB in adults with HIV are significantly lower than in healthy adults who are HIV seronegative, and factors associated with poor response include low CD4 cell counts, presence of detectable HIV RNA, HCV coinfection, occult HBV infection, and the general health status of the host. Vaccine response to the two recombinant vaccines is better when CD4 counts are > 350 cells/mm3; vaccination should not be deferred until CD4 counts increase to > 350 cells/mm3 in those at high risk for HBV infection because some people with HIV with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm3 do respond to vaccination (AII).

### Timing of primary three-dose hepatitis B vaccination and postvaccination serologic testing among a large cohort of healthy adults [^116YScPR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This is the first study assessing the optimal interval of three hepatitis B vaccine doses and PVST among a large cohort of healthy hepatitis B naïve adults. Our data indicate that PVST should be obtained 1–2 months after the last vaccination and a delayed PVST was the major determinant of a lower seroprotection rate after primary three‐dose hepatitis B vaccination schedule. Whenever the PVST is obtained at 1–2 months, the interval between first and second vaccine might be as low as 26 days and as high as 10 months without considerable changes in seroprotection rates. Although the first and second vaccine interval had minimal/no influence on seroprotection rates, the second and third vaccine interval was shown to moderately affect the seroprotection rates.

As expected, age > 40 years and male gender were associated with a lower seroprotection rate in our study cohort, as has been described previously. We found no effect of race, this might be related to the fact that the majority of our population was of Caucasian race.

The results of this study are important in respect to Public Health. Primary hepatitis B vaccination generally consists of three vaccinations at 0, 1, and 6 months, and elicits seroprotection in 95% of the general adult population. However, the remaining 5% of the population with an inadequate immune response are called hepatitis B vaccine nonresponders and remain susceptible for HBV infection and its serious sequelae such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Nonetheless, one should acknowledge the importance of a timely PVST for the definition of a hepatitis B vaccine nonresponder. As illustrated by our study, when compared with the high 98.2% seroprotection rate after a timely PVST (1–2 months after completion of the primary vaccination schedule), seroprotection rates were as low as 90.6% for PVST at 3–6 months and 88.4% for PVST at ≥ 7 months after vaccination. This study highlights that intervals > 3 months between final hepatitis B vaccine dose and PVST are associated with waning anti‐HBs levels, which might fail to confirm seroprotection and results in unnecessary revaccination. Our results are therefore in line with previous findings in infants and dictate the importance of defining hepatitis B vaccine nonresponder based on a timely PVST 1–2 months after the last vaccination.

### AGA clinical practice update on noncolorectal cancer screening and vaccinations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^112Xka3b]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Best practice advice 7 — hepatitis B vaccination strategy in IBD: All adult patients with IBD should be evaluated for latent hepatitis B infection. Patients who have previously completed a full hepatitis B vaccine series but are not seroprotected (hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] < 10 mIU/mL) should receive a single challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine; Four to 8 weeks after this challenge dose, their anti-HBs levels should be measured to evaluate for an anamnestic response. An anamnestic response, indicated by an anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL (seroprotection), suggests immunologic memory, and no further doses are needed; if no anamnestic response is observed, the patient should complete a second full 2- or 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccination.

### Evaluating existing recommendations for hepatitis A and B vaccination [^113n9h4s]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines are now widely available throughout the United States, Europe, and most of the rest of the world. A recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1986, followed by hepatitis A vaccine in 1995. Official recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were published for hepatitis B vaccine in 1990, with revisions in 1991, and for hepatitis A vaccine in 1999. Unfortunately, the recommendations are not closely followed, and an insufficient number of persons who are at risk receive these vaccines. In addition, the available recommendations may not cover all who are at risk for infection. This article reviews existing recommendations for the use of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines and offers suggestions for situations in which additional recommendations may be useful. The rationale for revising and expanding the existing recommendations is based on questions raised about the value of risk-based recommendations, data demonstrating increasing rates of hepatitis A and B infections in specific age groups, and the failure to protect 50% of individuals who become infected with vaccine-preventable hepatitis.

### Effect of GM-CSF in combination with hepatitis B vaccine on revacination of healthy adult non-responders [^117WZjdN]. The Journal of Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the immune effects and safety of using GM-CSF with the yeast-recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine for the re-vaccination of healthy adults who did not respond to a previous vaccination.

Methods

Study participants included 1784 healthy adults and 100 individuals diagnosed as non-responders. These healthy non-responders were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: Group A (34 individuals) was given 150 microg of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) the first day, then 20 microg of the vaccine; Group B (33 individuals) was given 40 microg of the vaccine only; and, group C (33 individuals) was injected with 20 microg of vaccine each time. All participants were injected three times, at time of study enrollment and one and six months later. Anti-HB surface antigen (HBs) antibody titers were tested before treatment and at one (T1), two (T2) and eight (T8) months post-first injection.

Results

At T1, the rate of anti-HBs antibody(+) in groups A, B and C was 26.47%, 48.48% and 18.18%, respectively (p = .027). At T8, the seropositive rate of group A (64.71%) and group B (75.76%) was significantly higher than in group C (39.39%) (p = .011); the geometric mean of the antibody titer for groups A and B was higher than for group C (p = .0173). All three treatments were safe and well-tolerated.

Conclusions

Augmentation of the vaccine dose and co-administration of GM-CSF and the standard vaccine dose are effective for HBV vaccine non-responders. In fact, changing the vaccine dose had a better seropositive response than injecting the vaccine in combination with GM-CSF.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^116zE2K8]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B epidemiology and prevention in the United States are outlined as follows: CHB affects ~258 million individuals (2022) globally and leads to an estimated 1.1 million deaths annually; data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017–2020) identified an estimated 660,000 (Confidence Interval (CI): 410,000–1,000,000) persons with HBV infection, but with adjustments among foreign-born persons immigrating to the United States the estimated disease burden may be as high as 1.8 million (C. I.: 1.3–2.6 million); importantly, half of those infected are unaware of their diagnosis; to reduce morbidity and mortality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening for hepatitis B in all adults aged ≥ 18 years at least once during a lifetime and all pregnant persons during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing using a triple panel (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc); HBV vaccination is recommended for all infants, all children and adolescents younger than 19 who have not been vaccinated, all adults aged 19–59 years regardless of risk factors and adults aged 60 years and older with risk factors for HBV or without known risk factors but who desire protection.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^112v2DyV]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for high-risk transmission scenarios in CHB — Individuals who are viremic and in high-risk scenarios for transmission may be offered antiviral treatment to reduce risk of transmission, though there are limited data on this issue, with shared decision making critical to evaluate exposure and transmission risk and to consider the vaccine and immunity status of those potentially exposed, favoring antiviral treatment if they are unvaccinated, may have inadequate response to vaccine, have compromised immune systems, and/or have unknown vaccine status; when risks may not be disclosed, individuals requesting treatment for prevention of transmission can be prescribed antiviral medication. It is essential to avoid stigmatizing practices or messages, people with CHB should not be restricted in daily activities and should not be required to take antivirals in those settings, and routine contact, sharing meals, and hugging are not considered routes of transmission, though sharing of personal hygiene items should be avoided. In healthcare settings, most healthcare workers with CHB are not in high-risk scenarios to transmit HBV, but those performing Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) category III exposure-prone procedures are at higher risk, should follow guidelines from SHEA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and may require antiviral treatment to reduce transmission risk; both CDC and SHEA recommend against the need for healthcare worker disclosure to patients and staff, and CHB is a protected condition by the American with Disabilities Act with protections from discrimination and that all cases of discrimination should be reported to appropriate authorities.

### Institute of medicine recommendations for the prevention and control of hepatitis B and C [^114HZphY]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Despite federal, state, and local public health efforts to prevent and control hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, these diseases remain serious health problems in the United States. About 1%-2% of the U.S. population has chronic HBV or HCV infections, and each year about 15,000 people die from liver cancer or liver disease related to these preventable infections. The Institute of Medicine formed an expert committee to determine ways to reduce new HBV and HCV infections and the morbidity and mortality related to chronic viral hepatitis and released its findings in a report. The major factor found to impede current efforts to prevent and control HBV and HCV is lack of knowledge and awareness about these diseases among healthcare and social-service providers, members of the public, and policy makers. Because the extent and seriousness of this public health problem is not appreciated, inadequate resources are being allocated to prevention, control, and surveillance programs. This situation has led to continued transmission of HBV and HCV and inadequate identification of and medical management for chronically infected people.

Conclusion

To address the situation, the Institute of Medicine report makes recommendations in four areas: improved surveillance for HBV and HCV; improved knowledge and awareness among healthcare and social-service providers and the public, especially at-risk people; improved HBV vaccine coverage; and improved viral hepatitis services and access to those services.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^11721bij]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.2.1.3.1 Non-live vaccines

IBD patients have a greater risk of contracting influenza than non-IBD populations (incidence rate ratio 1.58; 95% CI 1.49 to 1.68) and are more likely to require admission to hospital. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all immunosuppressed patients, although vaccine efficacy may be reduced, particularly in those on anti-TNF therapy. It should be remembered that the nasal influenza vaccine contains live virus and so should be avoided, with the injection favoured instead.

Assessment of hepatitis B serology and vaccination in all seronegative patients at diagnosis is recommended in ECCO guidelines, although the value of this in low prevalence countries has been questioned, and in the UK it may be more appropriate to offer this to high-risk groups on the basis of lifestyle, occupation or other factors. Efficacy of vaccination may be impaired in active IBDand in those on immunosuppressive drugs. After hepatitis B vaccination, anti-HBs response should be measured as higher doses may be required. Accelerated double-dose vaccination in IBD has been shown to improve response, with double-dose Engerix-B vaccine at 0, 1 and 2 months.

Pneumococcal vaccination is also affected by immunosuppression and should ideally be administered at least 2 weeks before starting immunomodulators. Three pneumococcal vaccines are licensed in the UK: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23, containing polysaccharide from 23 capsular types of pneumococcus) and two variants of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 and PCV10, containing polysaccharide from 13 and 10 capsular types of pneumococcus). The current recommendation for adults on immunosuppression is a single dose of PCV13 followed by PPV23 at least 2 months later; however, we recommend reviewing the Green Book for further detail. Booster pneumococcal vaccination with PPV23 is recommended after 5 years in patients who are asplenic, who have reduced splenic function or chronic renal disease. It seems reasonable to give boosters to patients on long-term immunomodulator therapy also, although there is little evidence in this group.

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^111WJjmX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tdap, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations — ACIP-aligned preventive care in IBD: Vaccination against Tdap, HAV, HBV, and HPV should be administered as per ACIP guidelines (conditional recommendation, with very low level of evidence). All adult patients with IBD should receive non-live vaccines per national guidelines, and for HBV care clinicians should recognize reactivation risk and, before anti-TNF's, perform testing for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb with vaccination of the nonimmune patient. HBV vaccine response is high in healthy individuals (> 95%) but lower in IBD (33–76%); in immunocompromised patients hepatitis B surface antibody levels should be checked 1–3 months after completing the series, some experts advise checking every 12–24 months, there is debate on protective titers (above 10 vs above 100 IU/l), and if titers do not rise appropriately consider administration of another 3 vaccination series at the regular dose.

### CDC guidance for evaluating health-care personnel for hepatitis B virus protection and for administering postexposure management [^1158ALUn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This report contains CDC guidance that augments the 2011 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for evaluating hepatitis B protection among health-care personnel (HCP) and administering post-exposure prophylaxis. Explicit guidance is provided for persons working, training, or volunteering in health-care settings who have documented hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination years before hire or matriculation (e.g., when HepB vaccination was received as part of routine infant [recommended since 1991] or catch-up adolescent [recommended since 1995] vaccination). In the United States, 2,890 cases of acute hepatitis B were reported to CDC in 2011, and an estimated 18,800 new cases of hepatitis B occurred after accounting for underreporting of cases and asymptomatic infection. Although the rate of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections have declined approximately 89% during 1990–2011, from 8.5 to 0.9 cases per 100,000 population in the United States, the risk for occupationally acquired HBV among HCP persists, largely from exposures to patients with chronic HBV infection. ACIP recommends HepB vaccination for unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated HCP with reasonably anticipated risk for blood or body fluid exposure. ACIP also recommends that vaccinated HCP receive postvaccination serologic testing (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine is administered (CDC. Immunization of health-care personnel: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2011;60 [No. RR-7]). Increasing numbers of HCP have received routine HepB vaccination either as infants (recommended since 1991) or as catch-up vaccination (recommended since 1995) in adolescence. HepB vaccination results in protective anti-HBs responses among approximately 95% of healthy-term infants. Certain institutions test vaccinated HCP by measuring anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation, even when anti-HBs testing occurs greater than 2 months after vaccination. This guidance can assist clinicians, occupational health and student health providers, infection-control specialists, hospital and health-care training program administrators, and others in selection of an approach for assessing HBV protection for vaccinated HCP. This report emphasizes the importance of administering HepB vaccination for all HCP, provides explicit guidance for evaluating hepatitis B protection among previously vaccinated HCP (particularly those who were vaccinated in infancy or adolescence), and clarifies recommendations for postexposure management of HCP exposed to blood or body fluids.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113Nq6fi]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection — antenatal testing and perinatal prophylaxis in pregnant women with HIV: All pregnant women with HIV should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during the first trimester of each pregnancy, with testing repeated in late pregnancy or at hospital admission for delivery for HBsAg-negative people at high risk, and pregnant women with HIV who do not have documentation of HepB vaccination should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (strong, moderate); HBsAg-positive pregnant women should also have an HBV DNA quantitative test and a hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) test and be referred for hepatitis B–related clinical management. Prevention for newborns relies on a birth dose (within 12 hours after birth is optimal) of the HepB vaccine for all infants, with infants of HBsAg-positive women also receiving hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth; if the mother's HBsAg status is unknown, infants should receive HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth with HBIG provided within 12 hours of birth for infants (weighing < 2,000 grams) or within 7 days (for infants ≥ 2,000 grams), and when indicated HBIG should be administered concurrently with the first HepB vaccine dose at a different anatomic site, while infants of HBsAg-negative women with other evidence of HBV infection should be managed as though born to HBsAg-positive women.

Infant hepatitis B prevention after maternal HIV/HBV coinfection — All infants born to HBsAg-positive people should receive HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours after birth, a second dose of HepB vaccine at age 1 to 2 months, and a third dose at age ≥ 6 months but not before 24 weeks (see text below for adjustments for infants < 2,000 grams) (strong, high). Infants who test negative for HIV and who do not have a response on postvaccination serologic testing to the initial vaccine series may receive a challenge dose, and if the anti-HBs titer is ≤ 10 mIU/mL, then revaccination with the standard series should be performed.

For clinicians, "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who are HBsAg-positive should not perform exposure prone procedures without prior counseling and advice from an expert review panel", and "CDC does not use serum HBV DNA levels as criteria for restriction of clinical procedures, several European countries use a threshold level varying from 200 to 20,000 IU/mL to determine if HBsAg-positive health care workers are allowed to perform exposure prone procedures".

Postvaccination Serologic Testing

Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary after routine vaccination of infants, children, or adults.
Testing for anti-HBs after vaccination is recommended for the following persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status (Box 7): BOX 7 Persons recommended to receive postvaccination serologic testing * following a complete series of HepB vaccination
- Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)–positive mothers or mothers whose HBsAg status remains unknown (e.g. when a parent or person with lawful custody safely surrenders an infant confidentially shortly after birth infants safely surrendered at or shortly after birth) †
- Health care personnel and public safety workers
- Hemodialysis patients and others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g. predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis)
- HIV-infected persons
- Other immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy)
- Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons * Postvaccination serologic testing for persons other than infants born to HBsAg-positive (or HBsAg-unknown) mothers consists of anti-HBs. † Postvaccination serologic testing for infants born to HBsAg-positive (or HBsAg-unknown) mothers consists of anti-HBs and HBsAg. Persons with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers or mothers with an unknown HBsAg status should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later. Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. For others with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after the primary series, administration of 3 additional HepB vaccine doses on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after ≥ 1 dose of vaccine. infants born to HBsAg-positive women and infants born to women whose HBsAg status remains unknown (e.g. infants safely surrendered shortly after birth). Postvaccination serologic testing should consist of testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg; HCP and public safety workers at risk for blood or body fluid exposure; hemodialysis patients (and other persons who might require outpatient hemodialysis), HIV-infected persons, and other immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy), to determine the need for revaccination and the type of follow-up testing; and sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons, to determine the need for revaccination and for other methods of protection against HBV infection.
Testing should be performed 1–2 months after administration of the final dose of the vaccine series using a method that allows determination of a protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Persons found to have anti-HBs concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series are considered to be immune. Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti-HBs levels. Immunocompromised persons might need annual testing to assess anti-HBs concentrations (See Revaccination). Persons found to have anti-HBs concentrations of < 10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Administration of all doses in the second series, on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after one or more doses of vaccine (except for when revaccinating infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers). Persons who do not have a protective concentration of anti-HBs after revaccination should be tested for HBsAg. If the HBsAg test result is positive, the person should receive appropriate management, and any household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts should be identified and vaccinated. Prevaccination testing (consisting of anti-HBc, HBsAg, and anti-HBs) to identify infected persons is recommended for household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts of HBsAg-positive persons; serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination, and the first HepB vaccine dose should be administered immediately after collection of the blood for serologic testing. Persons who test negative for HBsAg should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled about precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG postexposure prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to an HBsAg-positive source.
Testing HCP with documentation of complete HepB vaccination for anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation (i.e. pre-exposure assessment of prior response to HepB vaccination), followed by one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine for HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL, helps to ensure that HCP will be protected if they have an exposure to HBV-containing blood or body fluids.
Anti-HBs levels of ≥ 10 mIU/mL are generally considered seroprotective; however, different assays have different assay cutoff values based on which reported levels of anti-HBs might vary depending on the assay used. Refer to the package insert of the test for the determination of actual/correct levels of anti-HBs antibodies.

### The antibody response to hepatitis B virus vaccination is negatively influenced by the hepatitis C virus viral load in patients with chronic hepatitis C: a case-control study [^11348iiD]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this work was to evaluate in a case-control study the immunogenicity of a recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Seventy-seven patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis were included in a prospective trial and matched for sex and age to 231 healthy adult subjects. Recombinant HBV vaccine was administered at a dose of 20 microg at months 0, 1 and 2. The definition of 'responder to vaccination' was anti-HBs titre > 10 mIU/ml after the three injections. Forty-nine (63.6%) chronic hepatitis C patients were responders to vaccination, compared with 217 (93.9%) controls (P < 0.0001). After the three injections, anti-HBs titres were 156 ± 260 and 615 ± 435 mIU/ml (P < 0.0001), respectively. Chronic hepatitis C patients who were non-responders to vaccination had significantly higher viral load than responders to vaccination. Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between viral load and anti-HBs concentration (r = -0.36, P = 0.003). No significant side effects were observed. There was no effect of vaccination on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load during or after vaccination. In multivariate analysis, the main predictive factors of response to HBV vaccine were absence of anti-HCV antibodies (OR = 7.65, P < 0.0001), weight < 75 kg (OR = 1.99, P < 0.035), and age < 50 years (OR = 1.58, P < 0.082). Our results suggest that viral load seems to negatively influence the response to HBV vaccine.

### Response to challenge dose among young adults vaccinated for hepatitis B as infants: importance of detectable residual antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [^1147ZsTo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a difference in antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) response to a hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose existed among persons with a baseline anti-HBs level of 0 mIU/mL (group 1) and those with "non-zero" levels of 0.1–4.9 (group 2) and 5.0–9.9 (group 3) mIU/mL, according to the VITROS ECi anti-HBs assay.

Design

Subanalysis of randomized clinical trial. Response was defined as a postchallenge anti-HBs level of at least 10 mIU/mL and 4-fold rise in anti-HBs level 2 weeks after a single challenge dose of 10 vs 20 µg Engerix-B. Baseline was defined as the anti-HBs level immediately before administration of the challenge dose.

Setting

Pediatric integrated healthcare system near Houston, Texas.

Participants

Three hundred nineteen US-born 16–19-year-olds who completed the hepatitis B vaccine series during the first year of life.

Results

One hundred seventy-eight persons had zero (group 1) and 141 (114 group 2 and 27 group 3) had non-zero anti-HBs levels at baseline. Response to the challenge dose was significantly higher among those with non-zero vs zero anti-HBs levels, irrespective of challenge dosage; only 1 person with a non-zero anti-HBs level failed to respond to the challenge dose (group 3, 27/27 [100%] vs group 2, 113/114 [99%] vs group 1, 145/178 [82%]; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Among participants with residual anti-HBs levels less than 10 mIU/mL 16–19 years after primary hepatitis B vaccination during infancy, non-zero anti-HBs levels, with rare exception, indicated persistence of immune memory to HBsAg.

### Efficacy of repeated high-dose hepatitis B vaccine (80 microg) in patients with chronic liver disease [^116gTDss]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) respond poorly to standard hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine given as sequential 20 microg IM shots because of an overall impaired immune response. Many of these patients go on to liver transplantation and are at risk of acquiring recurrent or de novo HBV infection. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose (80 microg) IM HBV vaccination in patients with CLD who had previously failed to respond to a standard three-dose schedule of 40 microg IM vaccine given monthly. A retrospective review was undertaken at our institution of 79 patients with CLD who were treated with high-dose (80 microg) HBV vaccinations. All had previously failed a three-dose course of 40 microg HBV vaccine. An HBV vaccine response was defined as an anti-HBs titer greater than 100 mIU/ml. Liver enzymes, creatinine, age, prothrombin time, total vaccine dose, and MELD score were recorded. No adverse events were reported. Seventy-two per cent (57/79) of the subjects had an adequate response after receiving a mean total dose of 220 mug vaccine (range 80–800 microg). Twenty-eight per cent (22/79) of the subjects did not respond after receiving a mean total dose of 420 microg vaccine (range 240–720 microg). Non-responders had more severe hepatic disease defined as a higher mean total bilirubin level (p = 0.003) and a lower mean albumin level (p < 0.05). Age, prothrombin time, MELD score, and creatinine were not statistically significant between the responders and non-responders. Repeated high-dose (80 microg) HBV vaccination, in patients who do not respond to standard HBV vaccine doses, is safe and effective in the majority of patients with CLD.

### Biomarkers distinguish HBeAg seroconverted from non-converted individuals in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with a therapeutic vaccine [^113Z9Mut]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Cytokine assays of host immune responses to vaccination can indicate vaccine efficacy. Here we tested the hypothesis that assays of the cytokine status of infected individuals prior to therapeutic vaccination might provide a guide to vaccine therapeutic efficacy. If so, cytokine analysis might be used to select appropriate patients for therapeutic vaccination. Data were obtained from a panel of 14 cytokine/chemokine assays that were done during a phase III clinical trial of HBsAg-HBIG therapeutic vaccine (YIC) treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Summarized assay results were compared between patients who responded by HBeAg-seroconversion and non-responders. Though no single cytokine or chemokine showed clear correlation with responsiveness, by bio-mathematical analysis with Boolean modelling, the combined results revealed that plasma IL-10, IL-33 and MIP-1α together correlated best with responsiveness. However, the difference between HBeAg seroconverted and non-converted YIC-treated CHB patients was maximized when results of all 14 cytokine/chemokine assays were included and showed a sensitivity around 0.59, and a specificity of 0.8. It suggested that the combined analysis of these elements may be useful to screen appropriate CHB patients for therapeutic vaccination with YIC.

### Clinical study on the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in hepatitis C virus related chronic liver diseases in Egypt [^1168k9u5]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

To identify factors independently associated with an anti-HBs titer (< 10 IU/L) instudy, a logistic regression analysis was performed with gender; age at vaccination, type of school attended, and years elapsed from vaccination as the variables. The analysis identified age at vaccination as the only independent predictor of low anti-HBs titer.

reported that cirrhosis in non-responders was more common than that in responders (57.1% vs. 49.2%); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Anti-HBs seroconversion rates after vaccination instudy was lower than expected for patients with end-stage liver diseases.

This study has some limitations. Because all patients got three vaccination doses, we were unable to determine the duration it took for seroconversion and, as a result, any potential variance in response rates.

### Hepatitis B vaccine… [^111WVeiu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends hepatitis B vaccination among all infants at birth, unvaccinated children younger than 19 years of age, adults aged 19–59 years, and adults aged 60 years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B or without identified risk factors but seeking protection. Who should be vaccinated ACIP recommends that the following people should receive hepatitis B vaccination:

- All infants.
- Unvaccinated children younger than 19 years of age.
- Adults 19–59 years.
- Adults 60 years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B. The following groups may also receive HepB vaccination:

- Adults 60 years and older without known risk factors for hepatitis B. Recommendations for screening, testing, and vaccination The table below provides recommendations for screening, testing, and vaccination among adults and all persons with risk.

Prevaccination testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible people, especially in populations that have less engagement with or access to health care. In settings where testing is not feasible or is refused by the patient, the clinician should offer vaccination and, at future visits, should offer testing again. Population Screening and testing recommendation Vaccination recommendation Adults with no known risk factors for hepatitis B
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Vaccinate §adults aged 19–59 years. People with risk factors, regardless of age.
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Unless less than aged 18 years and completed a vaccine series as an infant
- If previously screened, but still unvaccinated, offer testing to people who have ongoing risk for exposure
- Vaccinate.

People with additional risk factors, such as:

- Residents and staff of facilities for people with developmental disabilities
- Health care and public safety personnel with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids
- People with diabetes at the discretion of the treating clinician
- International travelers to countries with high or intermediate levels of endemic hepatitis B virus infection
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Unless less than aged 18 years and completed a vaccine series as an infant
- Vaccinate. † § * For additional considerations for patients on dialysis, see Footnote A. † For additional considerations for healthcare personnel see B Footnote B. § Vaccinate susceptible persons without documentation of a completed hepatitis B vaccination series; testing should not be a barrier to vaccination.

For testing recommendations and assistance interpreting B screening results, see hepatitis B testing guidelines. Composition and dosage The United States Food and Drug Administration has licensed three single-antigen vaccines, and three combination vaccines to protect against hepatitis B. All vaccines contain yeast protein and aluminum adjuvant or a small synthetic nucleotide immunostimulant. No differences in immunogenicity have been observed when one or 2 doses of hepatitis B vaccine produced by one manufacturer are followed by doses from a different manufacturer. Whenever feasible, the same vaccine should be used for the subsequent doses; however, if a different brand is administered, the dose should be considered valid and do not need to be repeated.

### Responding to HBV exposures in health care settings… [^115GzRfs]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Other considerations for exposures in occupational settings
- Some people will not respond to HepB vaccines. These patients should receive HBIG as soon as possible.
- Clinicians who are susceptible to HBV infection should receive both HepB vaccine and HBIG as soon as possible. The following guidelines are for people exposed to HBV* in places outside a health care facility. These are considered. non-occupational settings. For cases in which the source patient is known HBsAg positive, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- If you have been vaccinated but have not had post-vaccination testing, you should receive a single dose of HepB vaccine after exposure.
- If you are vaccinated and had post-vaccination testing that confirms anti-HBs levels ≥ 10mlU/ml. ǂindicating adequate immunity, no further treatment is necessary.
- If you are exposed in the process of being vaccinated, you should receive a dose of hepatitis B immune globulin and complete the full HepB vaccine series.
- If you are not vaccinated or don't know if you were ever vaccinated, you should receive both HBIG and HepB vaccine as soon as possible after exposure. For cases in which the source patient's HBsAg status is unknown, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- If you have been vaccinated with written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series, you do not require any further treatment
- If you are exposed in the process of being vaccinated, you should complete the full HepB vaccine series.
- If you are not vaccinated or don't know if you were ever vaccinated, you should receive the HepB vaccine series with the first dose administered as soon as possible after exposure. The anti-HBs test should allow for detection of the concentration of anti-HBs that is considered protective. See Table 1 for quick reference. If the clinician has anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status, the clinician should receive one dose of HBIG and be revaccinated as soon as possible after the exposure. HepB vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG but must be administered in a different anatomical injection site. The clinician should then receive the second two doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series according to the vaccination schedule.

Anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose so the clinician's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures. If the clinician has anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg- negative, the clinician should receive an additional single HepB vaccine dose, followed by repeat anti-HBs testing 1–2 months later. Clinicians whose anti-HBs remains less than 10 mIU/mL should undergo revaccination with two more doses. Anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Vaccinated clinicians with low anti-HBs levels For vaccinated clinicians with anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL after two complete HepB vaccine series, the source patient should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. If the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has unknown HBsAg status, the clinician should receive two doses of HBIG.

### NCT03415672 | Hepatitis B vaccine for non-responders… [^1167Yvik]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Worldwide, people are suffering from the consequences of Hepatitis B virus infection. Currently available vaccines are protective in most of the vaccinees, however, a small part of the population does not respond to these vaccines. A new adjuvant has been developed by CyTuVax to improve the standard Hepatitis B vaccine for the protection of non-responders. The phase 1 clinical trial showed that the HBAI20 vaccine was well tolerated and it induced protective anti Hepatitis B antibody titers in 9 out of 10 non-responders. The phase 2 clinical trial will be conducted in order to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the AI20 adjuvant and further test if the AI20 adjuvanted Hepatitis B vaccine induces protective antibody titers in the vaccinated non-responders. Objective: In the current study, the investigators study the efficacy of the HBAI20 vaccine to induce seroprotection.

Furthermore, the investigators will compare the safety of the HBAI20 vaccine with the HBVaxPro-10μg. Study design: Multicenter double blinded randomized controlled intervention phase II study. Study population: Registered non-responders after at least 3 HBV vaccinations 18–59 years of age, males and females. Intervention: The study will include 2 groups. HB vaccine registered non-responder subjects after at least 3 vaccinations are randomized into group 1 or 2 at a 1 to 3 ratio. No less than 40% of the subjects of each group should have received only 1 series of Hepatitis B vaccination. "Group 1" subjects receive the standard HB vaccine and "Group 2" subjects receive the HBAI20 vaccine. All study subjects will receive 3 vaccinations separated by one month in accordance with the recommended vaccination schedule for non-responders in the Netherlands.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Study subjects will be vaccinated 3 times at 0, 1, and 2 months from the beginning of the study and invited to the hospital or vaccination centre for 4 or 5 visits. The risks associated with participation in this study are considered to be low and comparable with standard vaccines. Physical discomfort after vaccine administration can occur at the injection site and systemically. Effects are expected to occur for a short period of time. In addition subjects may experience adverse reactions to the cytokine component of the adjuvant. Because of the very low dose of the cytokine component of the adjuvant, which will be gradually released, the risks are expected to be low.
- Having a signed informed consent form
- Documented non-responders: Subjects with documented one or more cycles of Hepatitis B vaccination and titer analysis 1 to 3 months after the last vaccination that show that they have not developed the Hepatitis B antibody titer recommended after standard vaccination: HBsAg antibody titer superior to 10mIU/ml. In case the subjects do not have a titer analysis performed 1 to 3 months after their last recorded vaccination, the potential subject can be included after permission from the project leader after analysis of the case file.

### Hepatitis B vaccine for non-responders… [^112SaFdF]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Worldwide, people are suffering from the consequences of Hepatitis B virus infection. Currently available vaccines are protective in most of the vaccinees, however, a small part of the population does not respond to these vaccines. A new adjuvant has been developed by CyTuVax to improve the standard Hepatitis B vaccine for the protection of non-responders. The AI20 adjuvant consists of depot-attached rhuIL-2 molecules attached to alum), facilitating the slow release of highly concentrated IL-2 nano aggregates. In preclinical experiments, vaccination of mice, rats, and rabbits with the new HBAI20 vaccine results in higher and earlier immune responses to HBsAg compared to vaccination with one of the standard Hepatitis B vaccines.

The phase 1 clinical trial showed that the HBAI20 vaccine was well tolerated and it induced protective anti Hepatitis B antibody titers in 9 out of 10 non-responders. The phase 2 clinical trial will be conducted in order to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the AI20 adjuvant and further test if the AI20 adjuvanted Hepatitis B vaccine induces protective antibody titers in the vaccinated non-responders.

### Hepatitis B FAQs for health professionals | CDC… [^112SL7En]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

For infants born to people who test positive for HBsAg, postvaccination testing should be performed 1–2 months after completion of ≥ 3 doses of a licensed hepatitis B vaccine series. Testing should not be performed before age 9 months in order to avoid detection of anti-HBs from hepatitis B immune globulin administered during infancy and to avoid detection of HBsAg from vaccine. If there is an interruption between doses of hepatitis B vaccine, does the vaccine series need to be restarted. No. The provider does not need to restart the series, but should consider the following:

- If the vaccine series was interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be administered as soon as possible.
- The second and third doses should be separated by an interval of at least 8 weeks.
- If only the third dose is delayed, it should be administered as soon as possible.

### Clinical care and treatment… [^117S5KTU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Clinicians should work with patients to monitor and slow liver damage.
- Although treatment is not considered curative, antiviral treatment, monitoring, and liver cancer surveillance can reduce morbidity and mortality.
- People with chronic hepatitis B should be under the care of a clinician with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Treatment options Clinicians should make supportive care treatment decisions based on the patient. Typically, rest and a balanced diet with healthy food and plenty of fluids are enough to treat symptoms. The decision to hospitalize patients should be individualized. There are several antiviral medications available for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. However, not every person with chronic hepatitis needs medication, and the drugs may cause side effects in some patients.

Treatment recommendations Clinicians typically use supportive care to treat patients with acute HBV infection, depending on the patient's symptoms. Treatment for chronic hepatitis B will depend on several factors.
- See guidance on whether and how to initiate treatment from the University of Washington Infectious Diseases Education & Assessment program.
- See practice guidelines for treating chronic hepatitis B from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Postexposure prophylaxis If a person has been exposed to HBV, clinicians should give appropriate prophylaxis as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours, to effectively prevent infection. The mainstay of postexposure immunoprophylaxis is hepatitis B vaccine, in certain circumstances, the addition of hepatitis B immune globulin provides increased protection. For more information about treatment of HBV exposure and postexposure prophylaxis, see:

Treatment precautions Treatment approaches will differ depending on several factors including the patient's medical history, existing risk factors, pregnancy status, and the presence of comorbidities. Pregnant patients The AASLD recommends giving pregnant patients with HBV DNA levels greater than 200, 000 IU/ML antiviral therapy to reduce perinatal HBV transmission. In addition, clinicians should advise pregnant patients with hepatitis B that their newborns should receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG at the time of birth. For more information on treating pregnant patients with HBV infection, visit our hepatitis B perinatal provider clinical overview. Coinfected patients Patients coinfected with HCV infection and HBV infection who are receiving direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV infection are at risk of HBV reactivation.

Clinicians should test all patients starting hepatitis C treatment with DAA therapy for HBV infection with HBsAg, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. Monitor patients and consider HBV antiviral treatment for patients during HCV treatment if they have evidence of HBV infection. For more information about reactivation risks, see long-term effects of HBV infection. For more information about treating HBV/HCV coinfected patients, see resources from AASLD and Hepatitis B Online. Helping patients stay well People with chronic hepatitis B should be under the care of a clinician with expertise in managing hepatitis B. To help patients stay healthy, clinicians should talk to their patients about:

- Getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and tested for hepatitis C.
- Limiting alcohol use.
- Following a healthy diet.

### Hepatitis B vaccine administration… [^117Snne9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends hepatitis B vaccination among all infants at birth, unvaccinated children younger than 19 years of age, adults aged 19–59 years, and adults aged 60 years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B or without identified risk factors but seeking protection. Who should be vaccinated ACIP recommends that the following people should receive hepatitis B vaccination:

- All infants.
- Unvaccinated children younger than 19 years of age.
- Adults 19–59 years.
- Adults 60 years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B. The following groups may also receive HepB vaccination:

- Adults 60 years and older without known risk factors for hepatitis B. Recommendations for screening, testing, and vaccination The table below provides recommendations for screening, testing, and vaccination among adults and all persons with risk.

Prevaccination testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible people, especially in populations that have less engagement with or access to health care. In settings where testing is not feasible or is refused by the patient, the clinician should offer vaccination and, at future visits, should offer testing again. Population Screening and testing recommendation Vaccination recommendation Adults with no known risk factors for hepatitis B
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Vaccinate §adults aged 19–59 years. People with risk factors, regardless of age.
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Unless less than aged 18 years and completed a vaccine series as an infant
- If previously screened, but still unvaccinated, offer testing to people who have ongoing risk for exposure
- Vaccinate.

People with additional risk factors, such as:

- Residents and staff of facilities for people with developmental disabilities
- Health care and public safety personnel with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids
- People with diabetes at the discretion of the treating clinician
- International travelers to countries with high or intermediate levels of endemic hepatitis B virus infection
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Unless less than aged 18 years and completed a vaccine series as an infant
- Vaccinate. † § * For additional considerations for patients on dialysis, see Footnote A. † For additional considerations for healthcare personnel see B Footnote B. § Vaccinate susceptible persons without documentation of a completed hepatitis B vaccination series; testing should not be a barrier to vaccination.

For testing recommendations and assistance interpreting B screening results, see hepatitis B testing guidelines. Composition and dosage The United States Food and Drug Administration has licensed three single-antigen vaccines, and three combination vaccines to protect against hepatitis B. All vaccines contain yeast protein and aluminum adjuvant or a small synthetic nucleotide immunostimulant. No differences in immunogenicity have been observed when one or 2 doses of hepatitis B vaccine produced by one manufacturer are followed by doses from a different manufacturer. Whenever feasible, the same vaccine should be used for the subsequent doses; however, if a different brand is administered, the dose should be considered valid and do not need to be repeated. Engerix-B For persons from birth through adulthood People aged 19 years and younger should receive three doses.
