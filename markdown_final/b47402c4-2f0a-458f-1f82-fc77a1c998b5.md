## Question

when should a wound vac be discontinued

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a wound vac (negative pressure wound therapy, NPWT) should be discontinued. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that NPWT is a bridge therapy rather than definitive closure. Then, I should verify objective clinical endpoints that justify stopping, such as adequate granulation, infection control, and wound readiness for closure. Next, I will consider special scenarios like closed-incision NPWT, open abdomen, and infected hardware. After that, I need to check for complications or device issues that mandate immediate discontinuation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and confirm durations from high-quality trials and guidelines to anchor timing recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: NPWT is an interim modality to prepare the wound bed for closure, not a destination therapy, so discontinuation should occur once the wound is ready for surgical closure, secondary intention, or when the clinical objective has been achieved. I should double-check that this principle is explicit in randomized trials and consensus statements, and yes, the SAWHI RCT explicitly discontinued NPWT once the wound was suitable for closure by epithelialization or surgery, which aligns with this principle [^f7aaee19].

> Next, I should review objective clinical endpoints that justify stopping NPWT. Adequate granulation tissue with a healthy, well-perfused wound bed is a key endpoint. I need to ensure this is supported by data showing faster granulation with NPWT, which it is in diabetic foot wounds and other complex wounds, supporting the idea that once granulation is established, NPWT has fulfilled a major part of its role [^f4ab7f48] [^47b3e5b2]. Infection control is another endpoint; I should confirm that cultures turn negative and systemic signs resolve before stopping, and in sternal infections, some centers use serial negative cultures as a trigger for closure, which is a reasonable approach to adopt more broadly when infection was the indication for NPWT [^1db57f70]. Wound size reduction to a point where closure is feasible, often a substantial reduction such as around 50–80% depending on context, is also used as a practical endpoint, and sternal series document roughly 54–80% size reduction before discontinuation, which helps calibrate expectations across wound types [^f0c040bd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single duration fitting all wounds. I should verify timing ranges from high-quality evidence. The SAWHI RCT capped therapy at 42 days and stopped when ready for closure, which sets an upper bound for many open wounds, whereas closed-incision NPWT is typically 5–7 days postoperatively in trials and practice, and some sternal infection series report 2–5 weeks before definitive reconstruction, reflecting the need to individualize by wound type and healing trajectory [^f7aaee19] [^9a0b6581] [^cfa3b07b]. But wait, what if the wound is not improving? I need to ensure we address nonresponders; if there is no meaningful reduction in size or improvement in granulation after a reasonable interval, often 2–4 weeks, reassessment for occult infection, ischemia, or malnutrition is warranted before continuing NPWT indefinitely [^notfound].

> I will now examine special scenarios that modify the stopping rule. For closed-incision NPWT, the device is generally removed at 5–7 days or at discharge, unless there is a leak, device malfunction, or skin intolerance, in which case it should be discontinued earlier. I should confirm this with contemporary series, and yes, perineal and abdominal surgery cohorts consistently use 4–7 days with early removal for leaks or malfunction, which operationalizes this endpoint [^7b40f932] [^9a0b6581]. For open abdomen, NPWT is continued until definitive fascial closure is achievable, typically aiming for closure within about 8 days when feasible, balancing edema, infection control, and nutrition; I should double-check that this target is supported by trial protocols, and the VACOR trial protocol aligns with this approach [^8bb0137a]. For infected hardware, NPWT can be used as a bridge to control local sepsis while preserving fixation; if there is no improvement after 1–2 months or if infection worsens, hardware removal should be reconsidered, which I should confirm with case-based evidence and reviews, and the spinal literature supports this timeline and strategy [^68a8fe1d] [^1b653a3c].

> But wait, what if complications arise? I need to ensure I list red flags that mandate immediate discontinuation. Active bleeding, exposed vessels or tendons, new or worsening infection with systemic instability, device malfunction with persistent loss of seal, and patient safety concerns such as severe pain or noncompliance are all reasons to stop NPWT and reassess. I should confirm that these are reflected in device safety communications and clinical reviews, and the FDA materials and practical wound care reviews reinforce these contraindications and precautions, including prompt action if therapy is off for more than a couple of hours or if infection advances [^897726ed] [^47b3e5b2].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence. Discontinue NPWT when any of the following occur: the wound is ready for definitive closure by primary intention, secondary intention, or skin graft/flap; predetermined clinical endpoints are met such as adequate granulation, infection control with negative cultures, and substantial size reduction; the maximum reasonable trial period has elapsed without improvement, prompting reassessment; or complications arise requiring cessation. This framework mirrors the RCT stopping rules and consensus-based endpoints used across surgical specialties, and it balances efficacy with safety and resource utilization [^f7aaee19] [^47b3e5b2].

> Finally, I should confirm concrete durations to guide expectations while emphasizing individualization. For closed-incision NPWT, 5–7 days is typical. For open wounds, many programs use 1–6 weeks depending on size and complexity, with an upper bound around 6 weeks in trials. For sternal infections, 2–5 weeks before reconstruction is common. For open abdomen, continue until safe fascial closure, ideally within about 8 days when possible. And for nonresponders, reassess at 2–4 weeks rather than persisting indefinitely. These ranges are anchored to RCTs, prospective series, and guideline-style protocols and should be adapted to wound type, patient factors, and healing response [^9a0b6581] [^f7aaee19] [^cfa3b07b] [^8bb0137a].

---

A wound vac (NPWT) should be discontinued when the wound is **ready for closure** (primary, secondary, or graft/flap) [^f7aaee19], when **granulation tissue is adequate** (typically 50–75% of the wound bed) [^notfound], or when the wound has **closed by epithelialization**. It should also be stopped for **complications** such as uncontrolled infection, bleeding, exposed vessels or organs, or device malfunction [^897726ed], and when there is no improvement after 2–4 weeks despite correct use. For closed incisions, NPWT is usually discontinued after 5–7 days or when the incision is healed [^9a0b6581] [^7b40f932]. Always reassess at each dressing change and tailor discontinuation to clinical judgment and wound progress [^47b3e5b2].

## Clinical indications for discontinuation

### Wound readiness for closure

- **Primary closure**: The wound edges are approximated, and the tissue is viable for suturing or stapling [^f7aaee19].
- **Secondary intention**: The wound has granulated sufficiently and is contracting appropriately [^47b3e5b2].
- **Skin graft or flap**: The wound bed is adequately prepared with healthy granulation tissue, and the wound size has reduced sufficiently to allow grafting or flap coverage [^f4ab7f48].

---

### Achievement of treatment goals

- **Granulation tissue**: Adequate granulation tissue formation, typically covering 50–75% of the wound bed [^notfound].
- **Infection control**: Reduction or resolution of infection, evidenced by decreased bacterial load, absence of purulent discharge, and improved wound appearance [^fb42f825].
- **Wound size reduction**: Significant reduction in wound size, often by 50% or more, indicating effective wound healing progression [^f0c040bd].

---

### Complications or adverse events

- **Uncontrolled infection**: Persistent or worsening infection despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and wound care [^897726ed].
- **Bleeding**: Significant bleeding or hematoma formation at the wound site [^ea0cf7ac].
- **Exposed structures**: Exposure of blood vessels, nerves, tendons, or organs [^d247e774].
- **Device malfunction**: Persistent leakage, inability to maintain negative pressure, or mechanical failure of the NPWT system [^7b40f932].

---

### Lack of progress

If there is **no improvement** — no reduction in wound size, no granulation tissue formation, or no improvement in wound appearance after 2–4 weeks of appropriate NPWT — the therapy should be reconsidered [^effb086f].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and guidelines

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indications for discontinuation** |
|-|-|
| Diabetic foot ulcers | - Adequate granulation tissue <br/> - Wound ready for closure <br/> - Infection controlled [^f4ab7f48] |
| Sternal wounds | - Adequate granulation <br/> - Infection controlled <br/> - Wound ready for surgical closure or flap coverage [^f0c040bd] |
| Open abdominal wounds | - Fascial closure achieved <br/> - Wound ready for skin closure <br/> - Infection controlled [^8bb0137a] |
| Closed surgical incisions | - Incision healed <br/> - No signs of infection or dehiscence <br/> - Typically 5–7 days postoperatively [^9a0b6581] [^7b40f932] |

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

Regular assessment is essential to determine when to discontinue NPWT. Clinicians should evaluate **wound size, depth, and granulation** at each dressing change [^47b3e5b2]. They should also monitor for infection — including erythema, warmth, swelling, purulent discharge, and systemic signs — and watch for complications such as bleeding, hematoma, device malfunction, and patient discomfort [^897726ed].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing discontinuation

Several patient-specific factors influence the timing of NPWT discontinuation:

- **Age**: Elderly patients may require longer NPWT duration due to slower healing.
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, obesity, and vascular disease may prolong healing and NPWT duration [^b35bae3f].
- **Nutritional status**: Poor nutrition delays healing and may necessitate prolonged NPWT.
- **Patient preference**: Patient comfort and preference should be considered, especially if NPWT causes significant discomfort or impacts quality of life [^c1b9a73d].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Discontinue NPWT when the wound is ready for closure**, when adequate granulation tissue has formed, or when the wound has closed by epithelialization.
- **Stop NPWT immediately** if complications occur, such as uncontrolled infection, bleeding, exposed structures, or device malfunction [^897726ed].
- **Reassess the treatment plan** if there is no improvement after 2–4 weeks of appropriate NPWT [^effb086f].
- **Consider patient-specific factors**, including age, comorbidities, nutritional status, and patient preference, when deciding to discontinue NPWT.

---

Discontinuing a wound vac depends on **wound readiness**, **treatment goals**, **complications**, and **patient factors**. Regular clinical assessment and individualized decision-making are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize risks [^47b3e5b2].

### Negative pressure therapy: theory and practice [^fbc71393]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Negative pressure (wound) therapy, synonymous with topical negative pressure or vacuum therapy mainly cited as branded VAC® (vacuum-assisted closure) therapy, is a mode of therapy used to encourage wound healing. It is used both as primary treatment of chronic and complex wounds and as an adjunct for temporary closure and wound bed preparation preceding surgical procedures such as skin grafts and flap surgery. The device has come into wide and successful use, although the physiological basis of its effect is not yet fully understood, and with a delay, increasingly evidence-based data become available. A meta-analysis was made of peer-reviewed publications (PubMed-Medline) chosen on the basis of inclusion of the terms randomized clinical trial, vacuum-assisted closure, and topical negative pressure. Scientific data were evaluated from experimental animal studies, randomized clinical trials, observations of clinical applications, and case reports on all known effects of VAC therapy. Systematic analysis of the data shows efficacy concerning induction of wound healing mechanisms, especially in the early stage. Increased perfusion can be considered proven. Data analysis shows positive efficacy for treatment of infection. Although this therapy appears effective and its superiority to conventional techniques has been demonstrated, there are still some critical votes concerning efficacy. Because its mechanisms of action remain unclear, and because there is still some gap between evidence-based data and the excellent clinical results, further prospective, randomized, blinded studies are needed. Even so, we conclude that vacuum therapy, used when indicated and especially by experienced surgeons, is an excellent tool to support wound healing.

### The effect of vacuum-assisted closure on the bacterial load and type of bacteria: a systematic review [^fb42f825]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Significance: A high bacterial load interferes with the healing process of a wound. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is a wound healing therapy that utilizes a dressing system that continuously or intermittently applies a negative pressure to the wound surface. Recent Advances: VAC stimulates wound healing, but data on changes in the bacterial load and changes in the bacterial spectrum are scarce. Critical Issues: While VAC supposedly removes bacteria from the treated wounds and therefore reduces the risk of infection, this relationship has not yet been clinically proven. If VAC increases the bacterial load instead of decreasing it, then this may be a reason not to use VAC on certain types of wounds. Only seven small and heterogeneous studies reporting on the relationship between VAC usage and the bacterial load and type of bacteria in the treated wounds in clinical practice were found in the literature. Although there is some low quality evidence that VAC therapy does not change the bacterial load, no definite conclusions on changes in the bacterial load and type of bacteria during VAC can be drawn. Future Directions: Prospectively monitoring changes in the bacterial load and bacterial spectrum in patients that will receive VAC treatment on indication might be an effective way to find out whether it should indeed be used on specific wounds.

ISHLT consensus — nursing and local wound care for active MCS infection advises that optimal nursing care and ongoing patient education regarding management of the infected DLES should continue; surgical debridement of an exit site abscess may require removal of infected drive-line material or drive-line repositioning; negative pressure therapy with a wound VAC device has an increasing role and its benefits include removal of fluid and local debris, decreased local edema, increased peripheral wound perfusion, promotion of granulation tissue formation, and a more rapid decrease in wound size; the appropriate dressing depends on wound-healing pace and institutional policy, and care should be taken to check with the MCS manufacturer for compatibility before applying a dressing that may affect the integrity of the drive-line.

### Negative pressure wound therapy vs conventional wound treatment in subcutaneous abdominal wound healing impairment: the SAWHI randomized clinical trial [^f7aaee19]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Procedures

At baseline, patients received an extensive examination of the study wound, actual surgical history, and overall health status. After wound debridement or thorough wound cleansing, study therapy started either in-hospital or outpatient and should to be continued in outpatient care whenever possible. In the intervention arm, commercially available CE-marked Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) Therapy systems of the manufacturer Kinetic Concepts Incorporated, an Acelity company, were used in the discretion of the clinical investigator and according to manufacturer's instructions. Mainly GranuFoam dressings were used as indicated for dehisced wounds. WhiteFoam dressings (Acelity) and GranuFoamSilver dressings (Acelity) were used for superficial and sensitive wounds and for wounds with need for barrier to bacterial penetration, respectively. Negative pressure wound therapy as interim therapy was discontinued once the condition of a wound was suitable for closing, either by epithelialization or surgically. Control therapy was any local wound treatment regularly used in the respective study site that did not have an experimental status or was NPWT according to the hospitals' local clinical standards and guidelines. The applied wound therapy included wound cleansing; surgical debridement; measures for wound margin protection; wound drainage; and the application of dressings of the following categories: gauze, hydrocolloid, alginate, hydrofiber, foam, collagen, antimicrobial materials, active coal compresses, hydrogel, elastomeric matrices, transparent films, and composite dressings. Application was based on the individual needs of the wound in the process of healing with special attention to the amount of exudate and the local infections status. Study visits needed to be performed weekly until the end of maximum study treatment time at day 42 and included a complete wound examination. All study participants were followed up until 132 days after randomization. An additional follow-up was performed on day 87 for study participants with open wounds on day 42.

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure of deep sternal infections in high-risk patients after cardiac surgery [^f0c040bd]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Sternal wound infections are a serious complication arising from cardiac surgery. Recently, the general application of negative pressure to wounds by vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy has shown enhanced granulation and wound contraction. Here we examine the effect of VAC on sternal wounds.

Methods

We collected and statistically analyzed quantitative VAC performance data and outcomes with a retrospective review on a consecutive cohort of 22 patients treated with VAC for post-cardiac surgery wound complications.

Results

Sternal wound infections became evident on average at 21.0 days after surgery, associated with dehiscence (82%), sternal instability (59%), fluid collection by computed tomography (73%), and osteomyelitis (41%). Cultures most commonly identified Staphylococcus aureus (50%). Prompt irrigation and debridement were performed on all patients, and VAC therapy was applied at approximately 7.3 days after diagnosis. Vacuum-assisted closure induced granulation of 71% of the sternal wound area by 7 days, with a daily drainage of approximately 84 mL. By 14 days, there was a 54% reduction in wound size, and patients were discharged after approximately 19.5 days and placed on home therapy. Vacuum-assisted closure was discontinued at approximately 36.7 days with an average reduction in sternal wound size of 80%. Extensive secondary surgical closure, requiring muscle flaps, was avoided in 64% of patients, whereas 28% of patients required no surgical reconstruction for wound closure. No complications were related to VAC use.

Conclusions

In contrast to our earlier studies, adjunctive VAC therapy markedly reduced required surgical interventions, reoperation for persistent infections, and the hospitalization period. Thus, VAC provides a viable and efficacious adjunctive method by which to treat postoperative wound infection after medial sternotomy.

### Quantifying bacterial bioburden during negative pressure wound therapy: does the wound VAC enhance bacterial clearance? [^40b889c5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The bacterial colonization of a wound is a recognized detrimental factor in the multifactorial process of wound healing. The harmful effects on wound healing are recognized to correspond to a level of > 10(5) colonies of bacteria per gram of tissue. Negative pressure wound therapy has become an accepted treatment modality for acute and chronic wounds with accelerated healing rates observed. It has been previously reported that this therapy enhances bacterial clearance, which may account for the wound healing effects noted. We retrospectively reviewed 25 patients' charts undergoing Wound VAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure Device; KCI International, San Antonio, TX) therapy with serial quantitative cultures and found that there is not a consistent effect of bacterial clearance with the Wound VAC. Furthermore, bacterial colonization increased significantly with Wound VAC therapy and remained in a range of 10(4)-10(6). Despite this finding, the beneficial effects of this treatment modality on wound healing were noted in most cases.

### VAC therapy for wound management in patients with contraindications to surgical treatment [^35743f67]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of complex wounds often requires multiple surgical debridement and eventually reconstruction with skin grafts or flaps, under local or general anesthesia. When the patient's general conditions contraindicate surgical procedures, topical negative pressure with vacuum assisted closure (VAC)) device can achieve wound healing with reduction of healing time and simpler management. We treated with VAC device four patients with complex wounds and important contraindications to surgery. In all the patients, we used VAC device with common protocol of topical negative pressure. The healing was obtained in a period variable between 18 and 40 days; the results were satisfactory in three cases, one patient developed an aesthetically unpleasant scar. We present our experience to propose VAC when surgical procedures are contraindicated.

### Wound-healing and onboard care during long-duration human deep space exploration from a surgical perspective through the lens of a scoping review [^7831d7e8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Vacuum-assisted closure

Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is often used to enhance wound healing for patients with complicated healing processes (like thrombosis-induced ulceration or infected, necrotic tissues). It has shown an ability to effectively treat wounds as combat wounds, surgical wounds healing by second intention, and open fractures. VAC can improve wound contraction, reduce wound size and depth, create a sealed environment which preserves moisture, prevent contamination, and remove exudate, which decreases the inflammatory cascade that can impair wound-healing. Although such serious wounds are not anticipated in long-duration spaceflight, considering the impaired wound-healing in space, dysregulated immune response, challenges with sterilization, and difficulty managing exudate in microgravity, VAC is an effective strategy to prevent further complications and promote expedited tissue regeneration. Although not previously used in space, VAC's potential for ease of applicability, wound stabilization, improved wound-healing, coupled with its manageable mass and volume, promote inclusion in wound care strategies for long-duration missions where repatriation for treatment may not be feasible. Further VAC analog testing is required to determine effectiveness and sustainability in an extreme environment.

### A systematic review of topical negative pressure therapy for acute and chronic wounds [^fcd2f5ec]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy is becoming increasingly popular for all kinds of wounds. Its clinical and cost effectiveness is unclear.

Methods

A search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TNP in adult patients with all kinds of wounds in all settings was undertaken in Medline, Embase, Cinahl (to October 2007) and the Cochrane Library (to issue 4, 2007). Information was also sought from manufacturer of the VAC device. Selection of trials for analysis, quality assessment, data abstraction and data synthesis were conducted by two authors independently. The primary endpoint was any measure of wound healing. Secondary endpoints were infection, pain, quality of life, oedema, microcirculation, bacterial load, adverse events, duration of hospital stay and cost.

Results

The search identified 15 publications on 13 RCTs. These reported on patients with chronic wounds, diabetic wounds, pressure ulcers, skin grafts and acute wounds. In chronic and diabetic wounds, TNP did not allow earlier complete wound healing. It was, however, associated with a 1–10 day reduction in the time needed to prepare the wound for secondary closure surgery. In one trial on acute wounds, 17 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.02 to 0.32) per cent more wounds appeared to heal with TNP; the number needed to treat was six. This was, however, at the cost of an 11 (95 per cent c.i. 0.01 to 0.21) per cent higher complication rate; the number needed to harm was nine.

Conclusion

There is little evidence to support the use of TNP in the treatment of wounds.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^64a1c7ea]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Source control of necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

The most critical factors for reducing mortality from necrotizing soft tissue infections are early recognition and urgent operative debridement.

Surgical debridement must be aggressive to halt progression of infection. Cultures of infected fluid and tissues should be obtained during the initial surgical debridement and the results used to tailor specific antibiotic management.

Radical surgical debridement of the entire affected area should be performed, continuing the debridement into the healthy-looking tissue.

In the setting of Fournier's gangrene, diverting colostomy has been demonstrated to improve the outcome and the need for fecal diversion depends upon severity of the disease. It helps in decreasing sepsis by minimizing bacterial load in the perineal wound thus controlling infection.

Diverting colostomy does not eliminate the necessity of multiple debridements, nor reduces the number of these procedures.

Recently rectal diversion devices have been marketed. They are silicone catheters designed to divert fecal matter in patients with diarrhea, local burns, or skin ulcers. The devices protect the wounds from fecal contamination and reduce in the same way a colostomy does, both the risk of skin breakdown and repeated inoculation with colonic microbial flora. Estrada et al. showed that it was effective way for fecal diversion and forms an alternative to colostomy.

Postoperative wound care starts with meticulous haemostasis. Non-adherent compressive dressings should be applied, followed by repeat wound inspection in ≤ 24 hours.

Any patient with extensive necrosis or who is considered to have not be adequately debrided at the initial operation should be returned to the operating room in 24–48 hours for a second look.

Further debridement should be repeated until the infection is controlled.

Several reports have documented the utility of vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC) therapy for managing patients who have acute NSTI demonstrating that VAC technique of wound closure is effective in managing non-healing limb wounds consequential to surgical treatment for patients suffering from acute necrotizing fasciitis. Negative pressure therapies should be reserved for use only after adequate source control has been obtained.

### Prevention of infection in open fractures: where are the pendulums now? [^533274a8]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue management and fracture fixation including initial external fixation in Gustilo-Anderson type II and type III open fractures are cornerstones in the treatment but details on timing and type of wound closure, irrigation and debridement, systemic and local antibiotics, antimicrobial-coated implants and the use of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 remain controversial. This article looks at current clinical evidence of these items for the management of open fractures. Timing of debridement and wound closure remains critical. Early debridement by an experienced team within 24 h seems adequate while gross contamination, a devascularized limb, a multi-injured patient and compartment syndrome require immediate surgical intervention. Wound closure during the first surgery was shown to result in reduced rates for infections and nonunion. If soft-tissue reconstruction is needed, it should be performed within the first 7 days. Regarding types of irrigation fluid, antiseptic and antibacterial solutions did not prove to be superior to saline. High pressure irrigation has not been demonstrated to be beneficial whereas antibiotic administration as soon as possible has been proven to be favorable. Administration of more than 72 h was not superior to shorter systemic antibiotic intervals. For Gustilo-Anderson type I and II, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is reasonable. Additional aminoglycosides for broader coverage are recommended in Gustilo-Anderson type III fractures. There is newer literature on the beneficial effects of the use of local antibiotics, e.g. by antibiotic beads. Coating of internal fixation devices is a modern approach to improve infection prophylaxis and gentamicin-coated implants have been demonstrated to be safe in clinical application. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) could not evidence negative pressure wound therapy to reduce infection risk, improve self-rated disability or quality of life in open fractures, however, enhance treatment costs. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins (rhBMP)-2 showed promising data in Gustilo-Anderson type III open tibial shaft fractures with lower rates of invasive secondary procedures. In conclusion, there is evidence for thorough debridement and irrigation with saline, early soft tissue coverage and the use of systemic and local antibiotics. Except for a short-term soft tissue coverage VAC seems not to be beneficial and rhBMP-2 is an additional tool in Gustilo-Anderson type III open fractures.

### Gauze-soaked with suction wall: an alternative technique for negative pressure wound therapy [^d247e774]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the inception of medical practice, wound care and healing have evolved through the development of innovative treatment methods. With advancements in modern medicine and evidence-based research, emphasis has increased on optimizing wound healing through appropriate, resource-efficient, and new dressing techniques. An appropriate dressing is essential for optimal healing as it protects against contamination and physical harm. Moreover, it should be non-adherent and easily removable to prevent traumatic injury to newly formed tissue. Comfort is also a critical factor when selecting the type of dressing, particularly when applied over mobile areas such as joints.

One dressing method widely used by physicians is negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), which creates a negative vacuum at the wound site to isolate it from the surrounding environment. This system offers multiple clinical benefits, including faster wound healing, reduced overall costs by decreasing the frequency of changing dressings, preparing wounds for grafting, and improving graft survival. The main mechanisms contributing to these benefits include the drainage of exudates, enhancement of granulation tissue formation, provision of an isolated environment, increased blood flow, and reduced tissue edema. The most well-known form of NPWT is vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing, which consists of a polythene porous foam applied to the wound site by an adhesive drape, a tube connecting the dressing to a pump that creates a vacuum with adjustable pressure ranging from 50 mm Hg to 125 mm Hg, and a canister that collects drainage. The VAC machine can operate in two settings: continuous and intermittent, with the suction after a cycle of 5 minutes on and 2 minutes off. Indications for using NPWT include diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, graft fixation, and approximation of wound edges. Despite its benefits, NPWT cannot be applied in certain situations, such as active wound infection, exposed blood vessels or tendons, or the absence of experienced personnel for application. Availability and cost must also be considered, as not all facilities are equipped with such systems.

### Early anastomotic complications in colorectal surgery: a systematic review of techniques for endoscopic salvage [^ba46071b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Vacuum-assisted closure

Vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC) devices, in particular the Endo-SPONGE® (B. Braun Medical Ltd) is an open-cell, cylindrical polyurethane sponge connected to a drainage tube linked to a vacuum system exerting constant suction. VAC therapy promotes healing of wounds by enhancing formation of granulation tissue, reducing oedema, increasing vascularity and decreasing bacterial colonisation. Their use is well established for post-operative wound care and is being increasingly considered as a non-surgical alternative in the management of anastomotic leaks.

A total of 14 case series or cohort studies consisting of 197 patients were reviewed. A summary of these are shown in Table 3. The overall rate of anastomotic salvage in patients without generalised peritonitis and deemed suitable for vacuum therapy was 88.8% (range 66.6–100%), with very few adverse outcomes reported.

Table 3
The role of vacuum therapy in the management of colorectal anastomotic leak

The first study detailing its use for this indication was published in 2008 by Weidenhagen et al. examining the results of endoscopic vacuum therapy over a 2-year period in 34 patients with an anastomotic leak following low anterior resection. 29 patients were deemed eligible to continue treatment (giving informed consent, with no development of secondary complications), 21 of whom had covering stomas at the time of initial surgery and a further four requiring faecal diversion alongside VAC therapy. Two patients required return to theatre after commencement of VAC due to anastomotic necrosis. Of these 29 patients, definitive healing was achieved in 90.3% of patients including nine (31%) requiring fibrin injections to close a resulting small defect. Ambulatory management was possible in 86.2%, with minor rectal bleeding commonly reported post-sponge change due to increased vascularity in granulation tissue.

Acute and chronic wound infections are the main reasons for the observed increase in mortality rate and represent a significant risk factor in hospitalisation. From the patient's perspective, wound therapy is an uncomfortable, painful and long-term treatment. Modern sternal-wound-treatment systems would be expected to shorten wound healing and hospital stay periods. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is a system that promotes wound healing through the application of negative pressure by controlled suction to the wound surface. The application of controlled levels of negative pressure accelerates healing in many types of wounds. There are a number of scientific publications that have used meta-analysis to compare VAC and traditional therapy, considering changes in wound size. This article surveys the research literature focussing on the management of wound infections. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of VAC compared with conventional therapy on length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Six articles were selected that included a total of 321 patients (169 for VAC therapy and 152 for conventional therapy). The meta-analysis showed that VAC therapy resulted in a decrease of 7.18 days in hospital LOS (confidence interval (CI) 95%: 10.82, 3.54), with no significant impact on mortality. Our data provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of VAC therapy.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for skin grafts and surgical wounds healing by primary intention [^06b8bea1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broadening with a range of systems on the market, including those designed for use on clean, closed incisions and skin grafts. Reviews have concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT remains uncertain. However, this is a rapidly evolving therapy. Consequently, a systematic review of the evidence for the effects of NPWT on postoperative wounds expected to heal by primary intention is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NPWT on surgical wounds (primary closure or skin grafting) that are expected to heal by primary intention.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases to identify reports of relevant randomised clinical trials: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 11 November 2011); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2005 to October Week 4 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 8 November 2011); Ovid EMBASE (2009 to 2011 Week 44); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 04 November 2011). We conducted a separate search to identify economic evaluations.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they allocated patients at random and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing or compared one type of NPWT with a different type of NPWT.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trials for their appropriateness for inclusion and for their quality. This was done by three review authors working independently, using pre-determined inclusion and quality criteria.

Main Results

We included five eligible trials with a total of 280 participants. Two trials involved skin grafts and three acute wounds. Only one of the five trials reported the proportion of wounds completely healed and in this study all wounds healed. All five studies reported adverse events. In the four trials that compared standard dressings with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) the adverse event rate was similar between groups (negative pressure 33/86; standard dressing 37/103); risk ratio (RR) 0.97 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.33 to 2.89). There was significant heterogeneity for this result, due to the high incidence of fracture blisters in the NPWT group in one trial. One trial (87 participants) compared a commercial negative pressure device VAC® system with a negative pressure system developed in the hospital (GSUC). The adverse event rate was lower in the GSUC group (VAC® 3/42; GSUC 0/45); the RR was 0.13 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.51). Results indicate uncertainty about the true effect of either method on adverse events. The mean cost to supply equipment for VAC® therapy was USD 96.51/day compared to USD 4.22/day for the GSUC therapy (P = 0.01). Labour costs for dressing changes were similar. Pain intensity score was also reported to be lower in the GSUC group when compared with the VAC® group (p = 0.02)

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on complete healing of wounds expected to heal by primary intention remains unclear. Rates of graft loss may be lower when NPWT is used; but evidence to date suggests that hospital-based products are as effective in this area as commercial applications. There are clear cost benefits when non-commercial systems are used to create the negative pressure required for wound therapy, with no reduction in clinical outcome. Pain levels are also rated lower when hospital systems are compared with their commercial counterparts. The high incidence of blisters occurring when NPWT is used following orthopaedic surgery suggests that the therapy should be limited until safety in this population is established. Given the cost and widespread use of NPWT, there is an urgent need for suitably powered, high-quality trials to evaluate the effects of the newer NPWT products that are designed for use on clean, closed surgical incisions. Such trials should focus initially on wounds that may be difficult to heal, such as sternal wounds or surgeries for obese patients.

### Vacuum-assisted closure versus on-demand relaparotomy in patients with secondary peritonitis-the VACOR trial: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^f6f5f00b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomisation

Patients are included by a surgical equipoise followed by patient information and consent after recovery. The on-call surgeon will contact the primary investigator from each site when a patient is scheduled for diagnostic laparoscopy or explorative laparotomy on suspicion of secondary peritonitis. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomised after consent has been obtained by the surgical equipoise (Fig. 1). This could occur before, during, or at the end of index laparotomy, disclosing a complete overview of all potential candidates. Most patients will be able to receive both treatments regardless of what arm they are allocated without changing the treatment regimen. However, there will be some exceptions where it is necessary to modify or change the surgical treatment, irrespective of the randomisation allocation. Centres that do not receive approval from their respective scientific ethics committee to include patients through a surgical equipoise must obtain informed and written consent before randomisation. Randomisation will be web-based via (REDCap ®) in blocks of 2, 4, and 6 stratified for centre and age above or below 65 years. The justifications for stratifying according to the centre are that there might be differences in the surgical treatment, preoperative optimisation, and postoperative treatment, both in the ward and intensive care unit (ICU), which might affect the outcome. The patients will be randomised to either abdominal closure with ROD or open abdomen with VAC according to transparent reporting of trials (CONSORT) (Fig. 2). The randomisation tool and eligibility criteria can be accessed through our website.

Flowchart of inclusion and obtaining consent by the surgical equipoise

Fig. 2
CONSORT flow diagram

In cases where the surgeon finds that the allocated treatment may be contraindicated or is judged to harm the patient, it will be left to the surgeon's discretion to choose the most appropriate treatment. In cases where the bowels are left stapled in discontinuity as a part of the damage control principle, the patient's fascia cannot be closed due to swelling or the presence of abdominal compartment VAC treatment may be applied irrespective of the randomisation. These patients remain in the trial for an intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. By excluding such patients, there might be a risk of selection bias. Any eligible patient not included will be registered in a screening log.

Preoperative patient assessment

The patients are preoperatively assessed according to Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) to determine the degree of organ dysfunction.

### Negative pressure wound therapy after partial diabetic foot amputation: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^f4ab7f48]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot wounds, particularly those secondary to amputation, are very complex and difficult to treat. We investigated whether negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) improves the proportion and rate of wound healing after partial foot amputation in patients with diabetes.

Methods

We enrolled 162 patients into a 16-week, 18-centre, randomised clinical trial in the USA. Inclusion criteria consisted of partial foot amputation wounds up to the transmetatarsal level and evidence of adequate perfusion. Patients who were randomly assigned to NPWT (n = 77) received treatment with dressing changes every 48 h. Control patients (n = 85) received standard moist wound care according to consensus guidelines. NPWT was delivered through the Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) Therapy System. Wounds were treated until healing or completion of the 112-day period of active treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study has been registered with, number NCT00224796.

Findings

More patients healed in the NPWT group than in the control group (43 [56%] vs 33 [39%], p = 0.040). The rate of wound healing, based on the time to complete closure, was faster in the NPWT group than in controls (p = 0.005). The rate of granulation tissue formation, based on the time to 76–100% formation in the wound bed, was faster in the NPWT group than in controls (p = 0.002). The frequency and severity of adverse events (of which the most common was wound infection) were similar in both treatment groups.

Interpretation

NPWT delivered by the VAC Therapy System seems to be a safe and effective treatment for complex diabetic foot wounds, and could lead to a higher proportion of healed wounds, faster healing rates, and potentially fewer re-amputations than standard care.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and international association for trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) society recommendations: paper 2: postoperative and intensive care recommendations [^b314c7b9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

There is low quality evidence to support optimal positioning and the removal of all drains and catheters at the earliest appropriate time guided by patient stability and clinical need. Drains are not indicated for the routine drainage of the peritoneal cavity or in the presence small or large‐bowel anastomosis.

In general, drains may be removed at less than 30 mL/day for pancreaticobiliary fistula.

17. Abdominal closure tray and glove change

The need to reduce superficial SSI may be affected by the technique of surgical closure, with the use of antibiotic impregnated sutures not showing promise in this regard. How the surgeons clean their hands has traditionally been the mainstay of SSI prevention along with surgical site preparation. Five minutes of chlorhexidine soap scrub is the preferred technique avoiding the use of scrubbing brushes. Evidence from elective surgery has demonstrated that in addition to changing gloves, the use of a clean set of drapes and/or new instruments during wound closure led to reductions in wound sepsis. Previous studies were inconclusive or used multifaceted "bundles" of care or were from the elective surgery environment. The recent ChEETAh study demonstrated in a large cohort of patients from lower‐ and middle‐income regions that change of gloves and instruments effectively reduced SSI by a statistically significant amount in both elective and emergency surgery.

There is high quality evidence to support using chlorhexidine hand‐scrub, changing of gloves, and using a new set of instruments for definitive sheath closure in abdominal surgery, whereas extrapolation to other surgical procedures can be cautiously advocated.

18. Type of temporary abdominal closure device and delayed closure

Leaving the abdomen open using a temporary abdominal closure device (TAC) may be indicated in major trauma and nontrauma surgical emergencies such as abdominal sepsis, vascular surgical emergencies, and severe acute pancreatitis. Indications include prevention and treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, and when a second laparotomy is planned or the abdominal wall cannot be closed. There is convincing evidence that any TAC should include some form of negative pressure wound therapy, whether homemade (such as the vac‐sandwich technique) or commercial devices are used. Focus should be on correction of physiology, infection control and nutrition, and closure of the abdominal wall as soon as possible. There is some new evidence suggesting that simple whipstitch closure as an alternative to TAC is acceptable in selected patients and increased the rates of definitive early closure in a resource challenged setting without TAC available.

### Closed incisional negative pressure therapy reduces perineal wound complications after abdominoperineal resection [^7b40f932]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). Medium credibility.

In our practice, we performed standard APR for most patients. Intersphincteric dissection was performed for benign disease. Three patients underwent pelvic exenteration and 2 had extralevator APR. All patients received preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and mechanical bowel preparation. The surgical site was prepared in a standard manner. A closed suction drain was placed through the abdomen. In all patients, perineal wounds were primarily closed in multiple layers after achieving complete hemostasis. The skin was approximated with interrupted vertical mattress nylon sutures.

The CiNPT system (Prevena) was applied in the operating room. We initially used a 13-cm peel and place dressing impregnated with 0.019% ionic silver and connected to a disposable therapy unit (Prevena Plus) that delivers a negative pressure of 125 mmHg and has a canister for the collection of fluids. In the operating room, patch strips provided in the kit help seal leaks around the dressing. At times, we had to use ostomy paste around the introitus in female patients to maintain suction. We have now transitioned to a customizable dressing that includes hydrocolloid sealing strips and an interface pad.

Patients were managed on a surgical floor by nurses trained in the management of CiNPT. Postoperatively, leaks in the seal were addressed by reinforcing the dressing with a VAC drape. In certain instances, adequate pressure was not maintained with the use of a disposable unit and required connection to the VAC Ulta. Any clogging of the tubing was addressed by replacing the interface pad. The dressing was inspected daily and any bogginess under the dressing or malfunction of the unit that could not be resolved prompted discontinuation of therapy. We did not replace the dressing in any of our patients. Most of the patients continued therapy for a minimum of 4 days until the day of discharge or to a maximum of 7 days. In 2 patients, the units malfunctioned early in the postoperative period and were discontinued after troubleshooting failed to resolve the problem. Overall, the therapy was well tolerated, and no patient required discontinuation due to pain.

### Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC ®) systems and microbiological isolation of infected wounds [^82632171]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC®) therapy is a system which promotes open wound healing through the application of negative pressure (negative pressure wound therapy, NPWT), especially in infected tissues. When applying negative pressure onto the bed of the wound, fluid material is removed, formation of granulation tissue is promoted, and wound edge approximation is helped. These mechanisms are effective in promoting the healing process which would be otherwise difficult to treat, leading not only to economic advantages, but especially to a noticeably improved patients' health.

It is assumed that VAC® dressings should be watertight and that all the secretions are gathered in a single container. Actually, a minimum leakage of air cannot be avoided completely. The air is vacuumed, filtrated, and discharged from the machine into the environment. Moreover, filters used in this process cannot be replaced by medical staff.

The object of this study is to verify whether the filtration process is microbiologically efficient. We compared the bacteria population present in the wound to the one present in the air discharged by the unit.

### The efficacy and safety of negative pressure wound therapy in paediatric burns: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^369b2288]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

In this systematic review, we adhered faithfully to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement for reporting our research protocol, outcomes, and other pertinent items. Additionally, the protocol for this meta-analysis has been officially registered with PROSPERO under the identifier CRD42024548748.

Data source and search strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search for pertinent articles across various databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, Web of Science, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, China National Knowledge Infrastructureris, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and the Wanfang database. The search strategy incorporated specific subject headings and keywords, such as 'Burns', 'Negative Pressure Wound Therapy', 'Topical Negative-Pressure Therapy', 'Negative-Pressure Dressings', 'Vacuum-Assisted Closure', 'vacuum sealing drainage', 'VSD', 'negative pressure', 'vacuum assisted closure', 'VAC', 'Pediatrics', 'pediatric', 'child', and 'Children', as well as their respective synonyms. References from the initially included studies and relevant review articles were also screened as additional potential sources of eligible clinical trials not identified during the primary database search. All located articles were imported, securely stored, and managed using EndNote 20. Each search outcome underwent an independent eligibility review by three authors, JQ L, XY Z and ZY X, with any emerging disagreement resolved by the corresponding author, SY C.

Eligibility criteria

Criteria for Inclusion: (1) Study Type: Prospective Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), including before-after randomized controlled trials, were considered; (2) Participants: Focus was on paediatric patients with burns; (3) Intervention: Comparisons made between NPWT application alone or alongside supplementary treatments, and treatments excluding NPWT; and (4) Outcomes: Details on healing duration, healing speed, frequency of dressing changes, detection rate of positive bacteria, incidence of adverse reactions, scar scale scores, and treatment expenses were required.

Criteria for Exclusion: (1) Studies that did not expressly state their inclusion criteria; (2) Studies that did not clearly mention their outcome parameters; (3) Studies that were uncontrolled or retrospectively randomized trials; and (4) Preclinical studies conducted using animal models.

In cases where multiple articles reported the same or overlapping data sets, primary attention was given to the article that documented a longer intervention duration or provided a larger sample size.

### Double vs single internal thoracic artery harvesting in diabetic patients: role in perioperative infection rate [^b5269215]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In perioperative period, the patients' blood glucose levels were monitored and insulin treatment was administered, if necessary, with the goal of keeping blood sugar levels at or below the safe limit of 200 mg/100 ml.

The major clinical end points analyzed in this study were infection rate, type of infection, duration of infection, infection relapse rate, rate of hospital readmission, duration of antibiotic use, and total hospital length of stay. The presence of sternal SSIs was determined using the Center of Disease Control (CDC) criteria. Management of organ/space sternal SSIs in all patients started with an initial empirical antimicrobial therapy. The subsequent therapy was dynamically guided by the antibiotic susceptibility tests. Antibiotic therapy was managed by an infectious disease physician, together with the cardiac team. The treatment of organ/space sternal SSIs was previously described. Superficial sternal SSIs was performed in the same fashion through reopening of the surgical suture, debridement of all infected and avascular tissue, curettage of the cutaneous/subcutaneous tissues and daily local debridement with antiseptic irrigation until the site sterility was reached. Vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC, KCl Inc. San Antonio, TX) therapy was applied in all sternal SSI. VAC therapy is a non-invasive active therapy, based on the application of negative pressure by controlled suction to the wound surface. It is known to enhance granulation and wound contraction. No hyperbaric oxygen therapy was used in this group. Antibiotics were discontinued when no clinical signs or symptoms of infection persisted and when 2 cultures obtained from the wound were found to be negative. Infection relapse was diagnosed by isolation of organisms from an aseptically obtained culture and clinical data according to the Center of Disease Control (CDC) criteria. The sternal wound was closed soon after sterilization.

Data collection was prospective and preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were obtained from our institutional database and reviewed using a standard data collection form. Patients were regularly followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months. This study had the approval of our institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from every patient by the senior investigator in accordance with institutional guidelines.

### Vacuum-assisted closure significantly reduces surgical postoperative complications compared with primary abdominal closure in patients with secondary peritonitis: a comparative retrospective study [^7d2ab693]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Our dataset also lacks detailed information on delayed anastomosis within the VAC group because our primary aim was to compare major outcomes rather than specific procedural details. Only a small percentage (13%) of cases involved damage control surgery, reflecting a mixed population rather than a focused study on damage control surgery or VAC. Furthermore, our dataset did not include information on the timing or circumstances of care withdrawal, which may influence mortality outcomes and the decision between PAC and VAC. This limitation should be considered when interpreting our findings.

The incomplete documentation of APACHE II scores is another limitation. Although such scores could provide valuable insights into disease severity, retrospectively reconstructing them from incomplete patient data were deemed unreliable and prone to bias. We chose to exclude these scores from our analysis to maintain the integrity of our findings.

Further research, particularly multi‐institutional trials with standardized protocols, is crucial for refining these management strategies and improving patient outcomes. Ongoing randomized controlled trials are expected to provide valuable data to support evidence‐based practices in this field.

### Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC ®) systems and microbiological isolation of infected wounds [^ce9f42a1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Negative pressure wound therapy is now largely used to treat infected wounds. The prevention and reduction of healthcare-associated infections is a high priority for any Department of Health and great efforts are spent to improve infection control systems. It is assumed that vacuum-assisted closure (VAC®) dressings should be watertight and that all the secretions are gathered in a single container but there is no consistent data on air leakage and possible dispersion of bacteria from the machine.

Methods

We have conducted a prospective experimental study on 10 patients with diagnosis of wound infection to verify whether the filtration process is microbiologically efficient. We compared the bacteria population present in the wound to the one present in the air discharged by the VAC® machine.

Results

This study shows that the contamination of the VAC® machine is considerably lower than the environment or wound contamination.

Conclusions

Negative pressure wound therapy system does not represent a risk factor for healthcare-associated infections.

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure versus alginate for the treatment of deep perivascular wound infections in the groin after vascular surgery [^4219d0f6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC) therapy may heal wounds faster than conventional dressings after surgical debridement of perivascular groin infections after vascular surgery.

Methods

Patients with deep infected wounds (Szilagyi grade III) were surgically revised and left open for secondary healing, then randomized to either VAC or alginate (Sorbalgon) therapy, between February 2007 and November 2011. To test the hypothesis, it was calculated that 42 patients needed to be included (90% power, 5% level of significance). It was decided to perform an interim analysis after inclusion of 20 patients.

Results

Among 66 patients undergoing groin revision, 20 patients were included in this study. Patients were randomized to VAC (n = 10) or alginate (n = 10). The two groups were comparable in patient and wound characteristics. Time to full skin epithelialization was significantly shorter in the VAC group (median, 57 days) compared with the alginate group (median, 104 days; P = 0.026). The number of positive wound cultures of bacteria and C-reactive protein values decreased equally in both groups between surgical revision and day 21. One femur amputation was performed in each group as a consequence of the groin infection, one patient died during the in-hospital stay in the alginate group, and none died in the VAC group.

Conclusions

VAC achieves faster healing than alginate therapy after wound debridement for deep perivascular wound infections in the groin after vascular surgery. This finding does not allow further inclusion of patients from an ethical point of view, and this study was, therefore, stopped prematurely.

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC therapy) for the management of patients with high-energy soft tissue injuries [^3886d04c]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the results of a vacuum-assisted closure device in patients presenting with open high-energy soft tissue injuries.

Design

Consecutive nonrandomized clinical study.

Setting/Participants

From August 1999 through October 2000, 21 patients, with 21 high-energy soft tissue wounds (6 tibial, 10 ankle, and 5 with wounds of the forearm, elbow, femur, pelvis, and a below-knee stump) were treated with a vacuum-assisted closure device at a Level 1 trauma center.

Intervention

A negative atmospheric pressure device used for the management of complex open injuries. Infected wounds had dressings changed every 48 hours, whereas all others had dressings changed every 72 to 96 hours.

Main Outcome Measurements

The duration of vacuum-assisted closure use, final wound closure outcome, costs versus standard dressing changes or free flaps, and a list of all complications were recorded. All patients were followed for 6 months postcoverage.

Results

Patients averaged 4.1 sponge changes, 77% performed at bedside, with the device used an average of 19.3 days. Twelve wounds (57%) required either no further treatment or a split-thickness skin graft, and 9 (43%) required a free tissue transfer.

Conclusions

The vacuum-assisted closure appears to be a viable adjunct for the treatment of open high-energy injuries. Application can be performed as a bedside procedure but additional soft tissue reconstruction may be needed for definitive coverage. This device does not replace the need for formal debridement of necrotic tissue, but it may avoid the need for a free tissue transfer in some patients with large traumatic wounds.

### A prospective randomized evaluation of negative-pressure wound dressings for diabetic foot wounds [^d786a247]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment for large diabetic foot wounds is ill defined. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of wound healing with the Vacuum Assisted Closure device trade mark (VAC) to conventional moist dressings in the treatment of large diabetic foot wounds. Diabetics with significant soft tissue defects of the foot were considered for enrollment. Patients were randomized to receive either moist gauze dressings or VAC treatments for 2 weeks, after which they were treated with the alternative dressing for an additional 2 weeks. Wounds were photographed weekly and wound dimensions calculated in a blinded fashion with spatial analysis software. Percent change in wound dimensions were calculated and compared for each weekly assessment and over 2 weeks of therapy with each dressing type. Ten patients were enrolled in the trial, but two were lost to follow-up and two were withdrawn. Complete data were available for analysis on seven wounds in six patients. Average length, width, and depth of the wounds at initiation of the trial was 7.7, 3.5, and 3.1 cm, respectively. Only the wound depth was significantly decreased over the weeks of the trial to 1.2 cm (p < 0.05). VAC dressings decreased the wound volume and depth significantly more than moist gauze dressings (59% vs. 0% and 49% vs. 8%, respectively). VAC dressings were associated with a decrease in all wound dimensions while wound length and width increased with moist dressings. In summary, over the first several weeks of therapy, VAC dressings decreased wound depth and volume more effectively than moist gauze dressings. Negative-pressure wound treatment may accelerate closure of large foot wounds in the diabetic patient.

### The role of venoactive compounds in the treatment of chronic venous disease [^c70d74ab]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcers and skin changes

Venous leg ulceration, being the advanced stage of CVD, requires complex and disease-oriented treatment. One of the main goals of the treatment is venous hypertension decrease, which can be lowered using medical compression and (if feasible) venous reflux ablation or deep vein obstruction treatment. Venous hypertension treatment in VLU patients should be combined with the proper local wound management and can be supported by the adjunctive medical therapy based on the compounds with documented evidence in this indication. According to the 2018 European Venous Forum Guidelines, three drugs with the highest level of evidence in VLU healing can be specified: pentoxifylline, MPFF, and sulodexide. The 2022 European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines suggest the use of MPFF, HRs, pentoxifylline, or sulodexide as an adjunct treatment in the patients with a VLU.

The level of scientific evidence positions some of the VACs in the armamentarium of the VLU medical therapies (Table VI). The biological proprieties of the VACs interfere with several pathological processes related to the venous hypertension and VLU development. The presence of inflammation, free radical generation, vessel hyperpermeability, impaired lymphatic drainage, metalloproteinase expression, and activation reported in the patients with a VLU, can be potentially modulated and downregulated by the medical therapy. However, despite the wide theoretical background of this approach, only some of the VACs confirmed their clinical efficacy in VLU treatment, supported in good-quality clinical trials.

### A case of deep infection after instrumentation in dorsal spinal surgery: the management with antibiotics and negative wound pressure without removal of fixation [^68a8fe1d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection after posterior spinal stabilisation is a serious complication. In some studies, the incidence of site infection after spinal surgery ranges from 0.7% to 12%. The removal of hardware is associated with certain complications such as pseudoarthrosis and poor prognosis. A new surgical procedure of stabilisation will be made no earlier than 4/6 months from infection, with risk of complications associated with prolonged immobility. To date, however, there are no clear predictors whether we can safely set a new stabilisation. In infected wounds, titanium and stainless steel tend to act as substrates for bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, thereby reducing antibiotic penetration. Compared with stainless steel, titanium is less prone to colonisation, therefore, today it is the material of choice for spinal stabilisation.

Negative pressure wound therapy (vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)) for the treatment of infected skin wounds was popularised by Argenta and Morykwas with good results in the USA. Today this technique is commonly used by plastic surgeons to treat chronic wounds or other problematic acute wounds. In spinal surgery, the use of the stabilisation devices may be difficult in patients with thin skin or cachexia and the exposure of prosthesis cause devastating complications in such patients. The possibility to use a non-invasive therapy allowing wound healing without prosthesis removal is a big advantage. The removal of spinal stabilisation can be carried out if the wound pressure therapy does not produce improvement in a reasonable lapse of time (1 or 2 months), or when the local infection worsens over time. The first therapeutic act is, however, namely the surgical cleaning of the infected wound and then application of VAC and targeted antibiotic therapy.

Task Force 4 — Inpatient management of patients with MCSDs: management of DMCS specific/related infection (Class I) provides new directives as follows. Once an infection is suspected, empiric antimicrobial therapy against Staphylococcus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be started promptly while microbiological data is pending (Level of Evidence B). Patients with DL infection limited to the superficial fascia without systemic signs of sepsis should be treated with a pathogen-specific antibiotic course for two weeks (Level of Evidence C). Patients with evidence of a deep DL infection or pocket/pump/cannula infection should be hospitalized for systemic antibiotics with consideration for surgical drainage (with or without vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)), and systemic pathogen-specific antibiotic therapy should be continued for 6–8 weeks followed by long-term antibiotic suppression; definitive cure consists of device explant with consideration for heart transplant, if appropriate (Level of Evidence C). Patients with recalcitrant infection should be considered for transplant listing (as applicable) or device exchange, and it is important to consider removal of all hardware (including defibrillators or pacemakers) at the time of device exchange or transplant (Level of Evidence C).

### Outcome after VAC® therapy for infected bypass grafts in the lower limb [^ea0cf7ac]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the outcome of vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC(®)) therapy for infected bypass grafts.

Methods

A retrospective 7-year review of patient records from 2004 to 2011 of all patients receiving VAC(®) therapy for infected bypass grafts.

Results

Thirty-seven patients with 42 wounds and 45 infected bypass (28 synthetic) grafts received VAC(®) treatment. Two serious bleeding episodes from the suture lines occurred. The median VAC(®) therapy time was 20 days. The proportion of patent bypass grafts was 91% (41/45) at a median time of 3.5 months from the start of VAC(®) therapy. Five patients with seven bypasses had persistent infection or re-infection, and the total graft preservation rate was 76% (34/45). The median follow-up time was 15 months. The presence of two infected bypass grafts in one groin wound was associated with an increased major amputation rate (hazard ratio (HR) 7.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0–27.5]), and synthetic graft infection (HR 5.0 [95% CI 1.5–17.4]) and non-healed wound (HR 3.6 [95% CI 1.5–8.7]) were associated with mortality.

Conclusion

VAC(®) therapy of infected bypass grafts was able to induce effective wound healing without compromising the early bypass function. Two infected synthetic bypasses in the wound were associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^b35bae3f]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and formation of haematoma or seroma, are common complications of surgical procedures 1, 2, particularly among patients with risk factors such as obesity and diabetes 3, 4, 5. Postoperative wound complications may lead to increased healthcare costs due to prolonged inpatient stay, repeat surgery and the need for increased follow‐up 6, 7. Wound complications may also delay recovery, increase discomfort and reduce quality of life 8, 9.

Negative‐pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is usually used for the treatment of open wounds. The wound is filled with a gauze or foam and sealed with an adhesive film dressing. The dressing is then connected to a vacuum device via a drain or port. The device ensures that negative pressure is transmitted to the wound bed and removes wound fluid 10. The mechanisms of action include a characteristic pattern of blood flow around the wound, reduction in tissue oedema and stimulation of granulation tissue formation 10, 11, 12. In recent years, the indication for NPWT has been extended to include treatment of closed surgical incisions (incisional NPWT, iNPWT). Some of the first studies were case series 13, 14 and observational studies 15, 16 using one of the existing NPWT devices (VAC®; KCI, San Antonio, Texas, USA) designed for open wounds 17, 18. Two simplified NPWT devices became commercially available in 2010 (Prevena™; KCI) and 2011 (PICO™; Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK). These NPWT devices consist of a single‐use battery‐powered negative‐pressure therapy device, an easy‐to‐place dressing, and either a very small and easily portable canister, or no canister at all. In the latter case, the liquid is removed by evaporation through a semipermeable dressing. The mechanisms of action of this closed incision management have been supported by biomechanical studies: increased blood flow 14, 19; decreased lateral and shear stress at the suture lines with decreased risk of wound dehiscence 20; and increased lymph clearance with reduced formation of haematoma/seroma 21 (Fig. 1).

### Negative pressure wound therapy for surgical wounds healing by primary closure [^5b0b8a7d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been used to treat wounds since the late 1990s (Fleischmann 1997; Morykwas 1997). Negative pressure wound therapy has been recommended for a diverse range of lesions including open abdominal wounds (Stevens 2009), open fractures (Stannard 2009), burn wounds (Kantak 2016), pressure ulcers (Mandal 2007), post‐traumatic wounds (Kanakaris 2007), diabetic foot ulcers (Eneroth 2008), split‐thickness skin grafts (Blume 2010), sternal wounds (Sjogren 2011), and after clean surgery in obese patients (Dragu 2011). Negative pressure wound therapy is increasingly being used prophylactically on closed incisional wounds to prevent surgical site complications (De Vries 2016; Webster 2014), as well as being used on wounds healing by secondary intention (left open to heal from the bottom up) such as chronic or infected wounds (Dumville 2015).

Negative pressure wound therapy consists of a closed, sealed system that applies negative pressure (suction) to the wound surface. The wound is covered or packed with an open‐cell foam or gauze dressing and sealed with an occlusive drape. Intermittent or continuous suction is maintained by connecting suction tubes from the wound dressing to a vacuum pump and liquid waste collector. Standard negative pressure rates range from −50 mmHg to −125 mmHg (Ubbink 2008; Vikatmaa 2008). The longest‐established device is the vacuum‐assisted closure (VAC) system (KCI, San Antonio, Texas) (Morykwas 1997). However, alternatives have been developed and are being used (Visser 2017). Portable versions of the device have been introduced for use in community settings (Hurd 2014; Ousey 2014). An emerging advance has been the addition of 'instillations' of sterile water, saline, antiseptics, or antibiotics to VAC therapy, as in new negative pressure wound therapy with instillation (NPWTi) systems such as V. A.C. VeraFlo Therapy (KCI, San Antonio, Texas) (Gabriel 2014; Gupta 2016).

### A retrospective comparison of the performance of two negative pressure wound therapy systems in the management of wounds of mixed etiology [^b7f8fb37]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 1,107 patients were analyzed, 808 of whom were treated with the RENASYS NPWT system (Smith & Nephew) and 299 of whom were treated with the V. A.C. system (KCI, Inc.). The two groups were well matched in terms of their demographics and baseline wound characteristics (Table 1). The majority of the wounds were postsurgical wounds that had developed complications. In particular, abdominal or colorectal wounds accounted for 23.3% versus 25.9% of wounds in the VAC versus RENASYS groups, respectively, followed by pilonidal sinus (8.7% vs. 11.1%) and tissue excision (6.8% vs. 7.2%). A range of other wound types included cardiothoracic, orthopedic, OBGYN, vascular, plastics (combined 14.1% vs. 14.7% respectively), and wounds originating from several other disciplines. There were no major differences in the origin of the wounds between the two groups.

Table 1.
Patient demographics and wound characteristics

Overall, 92.6% of patients treated with NPWT achieved their predetermined treatment goal (Table 2). No significant difference was seen between V. A.C. or RENASYS systems (90.0% and 93.6%, respectively). The time taken to achieve the predetermined treatment goal following the start of NPWT did not differ according to the NPWT device (median 8 weeks in both groups). The overall percentage reduction in wound area was also very similar between wounds treated with V. A.C. or RENASYS (64.2% and 65.3%, respectively, when NPWT was no longer required). This equated to a similar weekly rate of reduction in the wound area of 9.7% and 9.4% for V. A.C. and RENASYS, respectively, and there was no statistical evidence of a difference between treatments (p = 0.156). The reductions in the wound area over time are shown in Fig. 1 and illustrate a similar healing trajectory for wounds treated with either V. A.C. or RENASYS. No significant differences in wound area between NPWT devices were seen at any time point (p = 0.1364, p = 0.8524, and p = 0.6360 at 3, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively) (Fig. 1).

### Intraoral vacuum-assisted closure therapy – A pilot study in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^948ff638]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

For approximately 2 decades, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy has been widely used for the management of complex wounds and soft tissue defects on the external surface of the body. As yet, this technique has not been studied for intraoral wound management. Therefore, this study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intraoral VAC therapy in patients with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).

Patients and Methods

After successful construction of an intraoral device providing sufficient airtight sealing, individually manufactured appliances were used in a prospective clinical trial of 3 patients using the VAC therapy system.

Results

Intraoral VAC therapy showed some success and did not produce serious side effects. Different positive effects, such as formation of new granulation tissue, cessation of pain, and pus suppuration, were found.

Conclusion

This prospective proof-of-principle study showed that intraoral VAC therapy is feasible and safe. It could play a role in the management of MRONJ and other types of intraoral wounds (eg, osteoradionecrosis, postoperative wound dehiscence, etc).

### A case of deep infection after instrumentation in dorsal spinal surgery: the management with antibiotics and negative wound pressure without removal of fixation [^1b653a3c]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Postoperative spinal infection occurs in 1%–5% of patients undergoing spine surgery. The risk is highest in patients undergoing posterior approaches, such as lumbar surgery, spinal augmented procedures or long surgical times. Furthermore, infection of spinal hardware may be possible in the case of obesity, diabetes and alcohol abuse. In patients with spinal wound infection, it may be very difficult to choose the right medical or surgical treatment. Reopening the wound by means of a new surgical approach may be very troublesome when stabilisation has been implanted. Today titanium instrumentation grants an advantage: titanium alloy is less prone to colonisation than stainless steel. Titanium is handy and widely used in spinal stabilisation particularly in traumatic pathologies of the column. In vitro studies suggest that biofilm can blocks antibiotics, phagocytes and other humoral immune responders making infection relatively resistant to host-defensive mechanisms and antibiotics. As the removal of the spinal hardware in infected patients causes postoperative instability, it is useful to identify a non-surgical procedure that allows treating surgical infections without removing the hardware. At the same time, it is necessary to facilitate the closure of the surgical wound too. Until today multiple techniques have been used helping for delayed wound closure. Negative pressure wound therapy (VAC) has been widely used for many years to treat complicated wounds and in case of failure of a surgical procedure. In the present case VAC therapy, also in the presence of a wound infection, allowed the healing of the wound without removing the hardware. This is in line with the current trend to maintain hardware in infected patients too. Moreover, in recent years, direct spinal fixation following the debridement of the tuberculous spondylitis or pyogenic discitis has been conducted and fixation combined with aggressive antibiotic therapy resulted in healing of many spinal infections. The VAC therapy in infected wound may be very useful as a significant increase of antibiotic concentration in the infected tissue treated by VAC therapy is demonstrated. In patients with infected wounds, it is necessary to maintain antibiotics until the wound heals completely and negative wound culture is obtained. Posterior screws fixation with titanium in the case of infected wound is the material of choice. The first option in case of wound infection and exposure of the hardware is debridement of the wound, primary closure and antibiotic therapy. In the case of incomplete wound closure or failure of surgical therapy, the use of negative wound pressure (VAC) may allow the final closure of the wound even in spinal surgery with vertebral stabilisation. Only in the case of abscess or resistant infection, a new surgical procedure with removal of the spinal fixation may be necessary.

### Grafix, a cryopreserved placental membrane, for the treatment of chronic / stalled wounds [^c1b9a73d]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Stage IV sacral wound case

An 82-year-old male was transferred to the wound care clinic from a rehabilitation center where he had been admitted after sustaining a fall and developing pneumonia. The patient presented with a stage IV sacral wound of 3 months duration measuring 2.5×2.5×1.6 cm (Fig. 3A). Past medical history included Parkinson's disease and both urinary and bowel incontinence. A collagenase ointment was being applied at the time of admission to our clinic. Neither off-loading nor cushioning for the wound was previously prescribed.

Figure. 3.
(A) A 2.5×2.5×1.6 cm stage IV sacral wound persisting for 3 months in an 82-year-old male before treatment. (B) Wound was surgically debrided to a 2 cm depth. A negative pressure wound vacuum (VAC), off-loading cushion, and air alternating mattress were prescribed. (C) First Grafix applied after 12 weeks of VAC, which was discontinued at this time. (D) Three weeks after first Grafix application. (E) Complete wound closure was recorded after two Grafix applications over 5 weeks.

The patient was taken to the operating room where the wound was radically debrided to a depth of 2.0 cm (Fig. 3B). Cultures taken at this time were negative. Postoperatively, a negative pressure wound vacuum (VAC) (125 mm/Hg) was prescribed as well as an off-loading cushion and air alternating mattress.

After 12 weeks of VAC and proper off-loading, the wound showed a well granulating base that measured 0.8×0.8×0.3 cm (Fig. 3C). At this point, VAC was discontinued because the noise and its effect on patient mobility had a significant negative impact on the quality of life for the patient. Grafix was a convenient option for this patient, and we believed that Grafix would close this wound faster than VAC. The wound was primed to receive Grafix, and upon application, the patient was discharged to return home where proper off-loading and cushioning were continued.

### The efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy in the management of lower extremity trauma: review of clinical evidence [^16454908]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

A large number of aids have been conceived and introduced into clinical practice (nutritional supplements, local dressings, technical innovations) aimed at facilitating and optimising wound healing in both acute and chronic wound settings. Among these advances, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been introduced during the last 30 years, and has been analysed in over 400 manuscripts of the English, Russian and German literature. Until very recently, vacuum assisted closure (VAC) (KCI, TX, USA) has been the only readily available commercial device that provides localised negative pressure to the wound and is the predominant agent used to deliver NPWT featured in this review. We conducted a comprehensive review of the existing clinical evidence of the English literature on the applications of NPWT in the acute setting of trauma and burns of the lower extremity. Overall, 16 clinical studies have been evaluated and scrutinised as to the safety and the efficacy of this adjunct therapy in the specific environment of trauma. Effectiveness was comparable to the standard dressing and wound coverage methods. The existing clinical evidence justifies its application in lower limb injuries associated with soft tissue trauma.

### The role of open abdomen in non-trauma patient: WSES consensus paper [^12ad33f9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal technique for temporary abdominal closure

Negative pressure wound therapy with continuous fascial traction is suggested as the preferred technique for temporary abdominal closure (grade 1B).

Temporary abdominal closure without negative pressure wound therapy (e.g. mesh alone, Bogota bag) whenever possible should NOT be applied for the purpose of temporary abdominal closure, because of low delayed fascial closure rate and being accompanied by a significant intestinal fistula rate (grade 1B).

There is inadequate evidence to make a recommendation regarding use of negative pressure wound therapy in combination with fluid instillation in patients with temporary abdominal closure (NOT GRADED).

The perceived indications and subsequent treatment choices in managing OA differ among surgeons. The existing techniques result in different risk of entero-atmospheric fistula (EAF) and the different rate of delayed fascial closure. Overall, 74 relevant studies exist for a total of 4358 patients: 3461 (79%) with peritonitis. The described OA indications are considerably different. Thirty-eight out of 78 series described negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) TAC systems. NPWT with a dynamic component (mesh-mediated fascial traction or dynamic sutures) gives the best results in terms of delayed fascial closure, but dynamic sutures result more often in fistula. NPWT without a dynamic component (Barker's VAC or commercial products) for the use of temporary fascial closure has a moderate delayed fascial closure rate and a fistula rate similar to mesh closure without NPWT.

### Endoluminal vacuum therapy (E-vac): a treatment option in oesophagogastric surgery [^f5c71d77]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Leaks from the upper gastrointestinal tract often pose a management challenge, particularly when surgical treatment has failed or is impossible. Vacuum therapy has revolutionised the treatment of wounds, and its role in enabling and accelerating healing is now explored in oesophagogastric surgery.

Methods

A piece of open cell foam is sutured around the distal end of a nasogastric tube using a silk suture. Under general anaesthetic, the foam covered tip is placed endoscopically through the perforation and into any extra-luminal cavity. Continuous negative pressure (125 mmHg) is then applied. Re-evaluation with change of the negative pressure system is performed every 48–72 h depending on the clinical condition. Patients are fed enterally and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-fungal medication until healing, assessed endoscopically and/or radiologically, is complete.

Results

Since April 2011, twenty one patients have been treated. The cause of the leak was postoperative/iatrogenic complications (14 patients) and ischaemic/spontaneous perforation (seven patients). Twenty patients (95%) completed treatment successfully with healing of the defect and/or resolution of the cavity and were subsequently discharged from our care. One patient died from sepsis related to an oesophageal leak after withdrawing consent for further intervention following a single endoluminal vacuum (E-Vac) treatment. In addition, two patients who were successfully treated with E-Vac for their leak subsequently died within 90 days of E-Vac treatment from complications that were not associated with the E-Vac procedure. In two patients, E-Vac treatment was complicated by bleeding. The median number of E-Vac changes was 7 (range 3–12), and the median length of hospital stay was 35 days (range 23–152).

Conclusions

E-Vac therapy is a safe and effective treatment for upper gastrointestinal leaks and should be considered alongside more established therapies. Further research is now needed to understand the mechanism of action and to improve the ease with which E-Vac therapy can be delivered.

### Vacuum assisted closure in the management of wound healing disorders in the head and neck: a retrospective analysis of 23 cases [^1f75f812]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Since the middle of the 1990s vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) has been used in many areas of surgery to manage complex wounds and impaired wound healing. Until recently, little attention has been paid to this treatment modality in the field of head and neck surgery. The evaluation of its efficacy in wound healing disorders of the head and neck was the aim of this study.

Material and Methods

Patients with complex wounds and impaired healing treated with VAC therapy between 2008 and 2011 were included into the study. VAC dressings were changed every 3 days and improvements in wound healing were documented.

Results

23 patients were treated with VAC therapy, in 18 cases (78%) closure of the defect could be reached without any further surgical procedure. 5 patients needed subsequent regional flap reconstruction to close the remaining defect. All of these patients had undergone salvage surgery in a previously irradiated neck before.

Conclusion

Vacuum assisted closure is an effective treatment in the management of wound healing disorders and complex wounds in the head and neck. It offers a useful, non-invasive modality to close even large defects in the area. Previous irradiation seems to have a significant negative influence on the outcome of the therapy, but more data are required to assess these effects.

### The enhanced total body wrap – the new frontier in dressing care for burns [^57b763d2]. Burns (2013). Low credibility.

The management of extensive burns with their associated high fluid exudate following burn excision and skin grafting has always posed a challenge in burn wound care. The ideal dressing should protect the wound from physical damage and micro-organisms; be comfortable and durable; allow high humidity at the wound; and be able to allow maximal activity for wound healing without retarding or inhibiting any stage of the process. The dressing technique described in this paper fulfils all the criteria above and at the same time provides an efficient channel to effectively clear the excessive exudate produced while keeping the wounds moist. Advantages conferred include accurate charting of wound exudate; reduced frequency of dressing changes; lower infection rates through prevention of strike-through; and securing and improving the viability of skin grafts. An enhancement to a technique previously described by us through the use of long thin strips of VAC sponges to transmit negative pressure, the enhanced Total Body Wrap aims to provide ideal conditions to promote healing in burns. Using negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), this technique is simple and straightforward enough to be applied in majority of tertiary centres around the world.

### Titanium plate fixation versus conventional approach in the treatment of deep sternal wound infection [^cfa3b07b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Wound VAC system is an important supplementary approach for DSWI management. The negative pressure provided by wound VAC can reduce wound edema and improve wound granulation and healing. However, wound VAC alone did not decrease total hospital stay, possibly because the sternum was still unstable. Studies have shown that wound VAC application followed by titanium sternal plating was a good strategy to treat DSWI post cardiac surgery. To date, the ideal duration of wound VAC therapy prior to sternal plate application is not well defined. The reported mean wound VAC therapy time varied from 2 to 5 weeks. Despite prolonged wound VAC time, the recurrence rates of sternal infection were still high (9.8 to 18.2%). Gaudreau et al suggested that the criteria for switching wound VAC to sternal plate fixation included: granulation tissue appeared in the wound; repeated negative sternal wound cultures and low C-reactive protein levels. In our series, the decision making to switch wound VAC to sternal plate fixation was based on clinical assessment. Once the wound looked healthy with good granulation and there were no signs of systemic or local infection, sternal plate fixation was carried out. Although the mean duration of wound VAC before sternal plate fixation in our study was relatively short (9.35 ± 9.99 days), there was no recurrence of DSWI and the rate of recurrent superficial sternal infection (13.9%) was not higher than others. Shortened wound VAC duration might translate into shorter LOS and therefore reduces cost.

One concern of the titanium plate is recurrence of infection after implanting large pieces of foreign body into an already infected chest wall. In our series, 2 patients (5.6%) in the sternal plate group had plate removal due to recurrence of superficial infection. However, at the time of plate removal both patients had very stable and fused sternum and no evidence of recurrence of deep infection. Even though both patients required another surgery to take out the plates, the quality of life was much improved with lack of pain and breathing distress due to moving sternum.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, this is a single center, retrospective cohort study. Although most surgeons may agree that sternal plate fixation is an effective approach for the treatment of DSWI post cardiac surgery, a randomized control trial is warranted to better compare this new approach with conventional treatment. Secondly, our current study did not perform cost efficient analysis. The titanium plate system is expensive. However, it may have reduced the cost since patients required less aggressive procedures.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^38dbedbf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis has demonstrated that iNPWT reduces the rate of a number of wound complications compared with standard postoperative dressings. However, more RCTs should be performed. This is especially important for specific high‐risk surgical patients, such as those with diabetes or obesity. These trials should be suitably powered and follow international guidelines in methodology. The length of follow‐up should be 30 days when wound infection is the outcome of interest, expanded to 1 year if an implant is left in place. An economic evaluation should also be performed as part of the clinical trial.

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure management for posterior lumbar spine infections [^00c67921]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

A postoperative infection involving the tissues deep to the fascia is defined as a deep wound infection (DWI). Management of such infections after lumbar spinal surgery remains a challenge. One strategy is the use of vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC) which applies negative pressure to the wound to improve microcirculation and to promote the formation of granulation tissue. When combined with antibiotics, VAC has been shown to successfully treat DWIs and is now a common strategy for treating deep postoperative wound infections after spinal surgery. In this article, we review the technique of VAC, its mechanism of action, indications and contraindications, and clinical outcomes in the treatment of DWIs after lumbar spinal surgery.

### Vacuum-assisted closure versus on-demand relaparotomy in patients with secondary peritonitis-the VACOR trial: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^8bb0137a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Vacuum-assisted closure

The VAC® Abdominal Dressing System (KCI Vacuum Assisted Closure, San Antonio, TX, USA) will be used. A video illustrating the procedure is attached in the supplementary material (Additional File 1). Intestines, including lateral aspects, are covered by the visceral protective layer. The first layer of foam is placed in the laparostoma on top of the visceral protective layer and must extend below the fascia at a distance of 5 cm from the fascial opening. Above this, a minimum of one piece of foam is folded and placed in the laparostoma. Finally, the laparostoma will be covered by the occlusive drape. A circular opening of approximately 5 cm in diameter will be created in the drape where the connection tubes to the vacuum pump will be placed. Simultaneously, while applying the negative pressure of 125 mmHg, the wound edges are approximated manually towards the midline. The dressing will be changed at an interval of approximately 48 h as standard or whenever needed according to the clinical condition. Each dressing change must be performed with the patient under general anaesthesia and muscle relaxation in the operating theatre. Peritoneal fluid must be cultured at each dressing change and when the fascia is closed. The fascial closure can, in some instances, be difficult due to swelling or the physical inability to close the abdomen. It must commence as soon as possible, judging by intra-abdominal findings, gastrointestinal function, and renal function. The aim will be to close the abdomen within eight days after the index operation.

The fascia closure after VAC treatment can be according to Israelsson's principle, as described below, or at the surgeon's discretion. A staged closure may start distally, proximally, or in combination. To ensure the uniformity of intervention in the arm receiving the open management, we have produced a video where the application of the VAC system is demonstrated in a step-by-step manner, as well as providing training for centres not familiar with the technique.

Primary closure

The Israelsson principle includes a running suture of the fascia with a distance of 5 mm between the stitches of 5 mm and the distance to the fascial edge of 5–10 mm. Monofilament PDS 2–0 or equivalent is used. The suturing is started cranially and caudally, and the sutures are tied with self-locking knots. Approximately four times as much suture material as the length of the wound must be used or more. The peritoneal fluid must be cultured at closure.

### Practical things you should know about wound healing and vacuum-assisted closure management [^47b3e5b2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the basics of negative-pressure wound therapy and practical uses of various vacuum-assisted closure dressings. 2. Understand the mechanisms of action of negative-pressure therapies and other important adjuncts, such as perfusion imaging. 3. Discuss the evidence for hyperbaric oxygen therapy in wound care.

Summary

Wound healing requires creating an environment that supports the healing process while decreasing inflammation and infection. Negative-pressure wound therapy has changed the way physicians manage acute and chronic wounds for more than 20 years. It contracts wound edges, removes exudate, including inflammatory and infectious material, and promotes angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation. These effects have been consistently demonstrated in multiple animal and human randomized controlled trials. Recent innovations that include instillation therapy and closed incision have further increased our arsenal against difficult-to-treat wounds and incisions at high risk of complications. Instillation of topical wound solutions allows physicians to cleanse the wound without return to the operating room, resulting in fewer debridements, shorter hospital stays, and faster time to wound closure. Other concepts have yielded negative-pressure therapy on top of closed surgical incisions, which holds incision edges together, reduces edema, promotes angiogenesis, and creates a barrier to protect incisions during the critical healing period, thereby reducing surgical-site complications, especially infection. Other practical adjuncts to the modern-day treatment of acute and chronic wounds include indocyanine green angiography, which allows real-time assessment of perfusion, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which has been suggested to augment healing in acute, chronic, specifically diabetic foot ulcers and radiation-related wounds.

### Risk factors for mediastinitis after cardiac surgery-a retrospective analysis of 1700 patients [^d35d37c4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

As a severe complication of cardiac surgery, mediastinitis continues to be associated with tremendous morbidity and cost. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms underlying postoperative mediastinitis remain unknown; multiple factors might play a role. Some authors favor the intraoperative contamination, whereas other studies demonstrated that endogenous bacteria might be pathogenetically involved because preoperative intranasal antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the incidence of mediastinitis.

Several studies published during the last ten years reported an incidence of 0.4 to 5% and in-hospital mortalities between 14 and 23%, even when mediastinitis was correctly treated. Postoperative mediastinitis is also associated with high long-term mortality. Braxton et al. compared in a 4-year follow-up study the survival rates of patients with and without mediastinitis after cardiac operations. Eighty nine percent of patients survived in the non-mediastinitis group compared to 65% in the mediastinitis group after four years.

In 1963 Shumacker and Mandelbaum first described a method for the treatment of postoperative mediastinitis which still forms the basis for current therapeutic approaches in some centers. Their approach included early surgical debridement, insertion of a drainage system with continuous irrigation with antibiotic solution and primary wound closure.

Modern management of mediastinitis with early aggressive debridement followed by delayed wound closure has been reported to reduce early mortality to less than 20%.

The vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was introduced in 1997 and combines the advantages of both open and closed treatment. Besides an improved local perfusion and oxygenation, the quantitative bacterial flora is rapidly reduced and the formation of scar tissue is stimulated. Intermittent suction additionally may promote wound healing by local reactive hyperemia if suction stops. Several studies showed the benefits of a VAC therapy in terms of shorter hospitalizations, earlier secondary wound closure and a lower mortality compared to a conventional therapy. However, evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of postoperative mediastinitis have not been established and published yet.

### Negative-pressure wound therapy for prevention and treatment of surgical-site infections after vascular surgery [^68d44964]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Indications for negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in vascular surgical patients are expanding. The aim of this review was to outline the evidence for NPWT on open and closed wounds.

Methods

A PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library search from 2007 to June 2016 was performed combining the medical subject headings terms 'wound infection', 'abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)', 'fasciotomy', 'vascular surgery' and 'NPWT' or 'VAC'.

Results

NPWT of open infected groin wounds was associated with shorter duration of wound healing by 47 days, and was more cost-effective than alginate dressings in one RCT. In one RCT and six observational studies, NPWT-related major bleeding and graft preservation rates were 0–10 and 83–100 per cent respectively. One retrospective comparative study showed greater wound size reduction per day, fewer dressing changes, quicker wound closure and shorter hospital stay with NPWT compared with gauze dressings for lower leg fasciotomy. NPWT and mesh-mediated fascial traction after AAA repair and open abdomen was associated with high primary fascial closure rates (96–100 per cent) and low risk of graft infection (0–7 per cent). One retrospective comparative study showed a significant reduction in surgical-site infection, from 30 per cent with standard wound care to 6 per cent with closed incisional NPWT.

Conclusion

NPWT has a central role in open and infected wounds after vascular surgery; the results of prophylactic care of closed incisions are promising.

### VAC-instillation therapy in abdominal mesh exposure: a novel indication [^fe092b1b]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Defects of the abdominal wall pose a problem for general surgeons that negatively affects patient prognosis. In cases of abdominal wall wound dehiscence and exposed abdominal mesh, conservative treatment has not been proven effective to date. We aimed to study patient outcomes in cases of abdominal wall wound dehiscence with mesh exposure treated with vacuum-assisted closure system with intermittent instillation (VAC-instillation) as a temporary cover to achieve wound closure.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate and compare the outcomes of 45 patients with postoperative abdominal wall wound dehiscence and exposed mesh: 34 were treated with conventional dressings and 11 with the VAC-instillation device. Clinical records were reviewed, and patient demographics, indication for abdominal surgery, and existing risk factors were noted. Patient outcome was evaluated in terms of number of reoperations, length of hospital stay, and total time of treatment.

Results

Demographic features did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients treated with conventional dressings required a significantly higher number of surgeries to achieve wound closure. We did not find statistical differences between the two groups regarding length of hospital stay, but the VAC-instillation group showed a significantly shorter total time of treatment. The incidence of complications was lower in the VAC-instillation group, though hernia recurrence rate was slightly higher in these patients.

Conclusions

VAC-instillation is a valid option for the conservative treatment of critical patients with abdominal wall wound dehiscence and exposed infected mesh that allows recovery with fewer surgeries and complications and avoids the need of mesh removal.

### Vacuum-assisted closure in the treatment of gynecologic oncology wound failures [^22b7ee96]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Negative pressure wound vacuum therapy can expedite the healing of complex wound failures. Our aim was to evaluate the use of a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device to treat complex wound failures in gynecologic oncology patients.

Methods

We retrospectively identified 27 patients with gynecologic malignancies in whom the device was used to treat complex wound failures from January 2001 to May 2002 at our institution. We analyzed operative data and information regarding the diagnosis and management of these complex wound failures and the length of time the device was used.

Results

The procedures performed before wound VAC placement were total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy with or without tumor reductive surgery in 14 patients, vulvectomy with or without inguinal lymph node dissection in five patients, skin or myocutaneous grafting in three patients, parastomal herniorrhaphy in two patients, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in two patients, and incision and drainage of a gluteal abscess after radiation therapy in one patient. Four of the 27 patients had the VAC device placed at the time of a reoperation, while the remaining 23 patients had the VAC device placed postoperatively for wound failures. Wound breakdown occurred at a median of 9 days (range: 0–88 days) postoperatively. Overall, there was a 96% reduction (range: 0–100%) in the median size of wound defects from 330 to 14.0 cm(3) with use of the VAC device. The median number of days of VAC therapy was 32 days (range: 3–88 days). Twenty patients used this device as outpatients, and the charge per day was approximately US$150.00. One patient experienced bleeding, and 26 patients experienced no complications. The only complaint was pain during dressing changes (67% of patients). The mean follow-up was 52 days (range: 0–270 days). At the time of last contact, 26 (96%) of 27 patients had complete wound healing.

Conclusions

VAC therapy is a novel treatment using controlled negative pressure to evacuate wound fluid, stimulate granulation tissue, and to decrease bacterial colonization of the wound. Our experience indicates that this is a safe method to treat complex wound failures in gynecologic oncology patients.

### Secondary omental and pectoralis major double flap reconstruction following aggressive sternectomy for deep sternal wound infections after cardiac surgery [^452032cd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In Japan, there is no commercial VAC therapy system, so we developed one using commercial polyurethane foam sponge, sterilized in our hospital. After being fashioned to the specific wound geometry, the sponge is placed into the wound. A single, straight 22 French trocar catheter is inserted directly into the sponge, and the wound site and anterior chest are covered with an adhesive drape, thereby covering an open wound into a controlled closed wound. The trocar catheter was connected to wall suction via a long tube, and negative pressure between 100 and 120 mmHg was generated. Patients treated with VAC therapy can ambulate by clamping the trocar catheter and disconnecting the tube from wall suction.

Some reports emphasize that sternal preservation and rewiring can be done by using VAC therapy, resulting in good quality of life, and that transposed omentum or muscle flaps are unnecessary afterwards. The extent and degree of infection determines whether the sternum can be preserved. A high rate recurrence of infection when the sternum was preserved despite VAC therapy has been reported. To reduce the risk of recurrence of the infection, our strategy for complete treatment of wound infections consists of aggressive debridement of the infectious sternum (total sternectomy) and drainage with VAC therapy, followed by secondary definitive closure, with the transposition of omentum to fill the entire defect and bilateral pectoralis major flaps to reconstruct the anterior chest wall. Recurrence of infection is associated with high mortality, so we routinely transposed the omentum in addition to aggressive debridement following VAC therapy for several weeks. The omental flap is the best selection for preventing recurrence of an infection because of its abundant lymphoid tissues and ability to regenerate blood vessels. After sterility of the mediastinal space has been achieved by VAC therapy, harvesting the omentum would not induce the intraperitoneal spread of infection. The omental flap can fill the whole space, but we used bilateral pectoralis major flaps to build the anterior chest wall, rather than to fill the dead space. Thus, we did not have to resect the humeral insertion, avoiding limitation of shoulder motion, muscle weakness, pain, and paresthesia, and securing blood supply to this muscle flap, even though the internal thoracic artery, a source of blood supply to the pectoralis major muscle, had to be separated from the chest wall when an arterial graft was needed in coronary artery bypass surgery.

### Outcomes of vacuum-assisted and conventional wound management in pediatric abdominal surgery: a retrospective study from a resource-limited setting [^7d8bfdaa]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Complicated abdominal wounds following pediatric laparotomy, particularly in cases of enterocutaneous fistulae, trauma, or re-exploration, present significant management challenges, especially in resource-limited settings. Despite evidence supporting vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in adults, its use in pediatric populations remains limited.

Aim

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the outcomes of vacuum-assisted and conventional wound management techniques in pediatric abdominal surgery within a resource-constrained environment.

Methods

A retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric surgical centre in Northern India from January 2016 to December 2024. A total of 43 children (0–18 years) with complicated postoperative abdominal wounds were included. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 19) underwent traditional wound closure, while Group 2 (n = 24) received wound management using VAC therapy or simple wound manager systems. Primary outcomes were time to wound healing and incidence of wound-related complications. Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, re-exploration, and spontaneous fistula closure.

Results

The wound manager group showed a slightly longer median healing time (15 vs. 12 days) but had zero re-explorations compared to three cases in the traditional group (p = 0.0011). VAC therapy led to earlier granulation (median 6 vs. 10 days), greater complete epithelialization (80% vs. 40%, p = 0.04), and spontaneous closure in 20% of enterocutaneous fistulas. Four patients continued VAC therapy at home without complications.

Conclusion

VAC and simple wound manager systems are effective in managing complex pediatric abdominal wounds, reducing the need for reoperation and enhancing healing outcomes. Their adoption in low-resource settings could significantly improve pediatric surgical care.

### Vacuum drainage in the management of complicated abdominal wound dehiscence in children [^e923be39]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to report the outcomes of the vacuum dressing method (vacuum-assisted closure [VAC]) in the management of "complicated" abdominal wounds in a selected group of children including neonates.

Methods

All children with vacuum (VAC) dressing-assisted closure of a complex abdominal wound (defined as complete/partial wound dehiscence combined with at least one of stoma, anastomosis, tube enterostomy, or infected patch abdominoplasty) were included in a 2-year study that took place in a single tertiary referral hospital. Retrospective case note analysis was used to determine premorbid diagnosis, management, illness severity markers, morbidity, and outcome.

Results

Nine children (neonate to 16 years) required 11 continuous episodes of VAC therapy. Abdominal wall dehiscence was complete in 7 and partial in 4 episodes. These were complicated by stomas (8), anastomoses (3), enterocutaneous fistulae (3), tube enterostomy (1), and infected patch abdominoplasty (2). Illness severity was assessed by the following proxy physiologic markers: American Society of Anesthesiologists status 3 or more (10), intensive care unit (ICU) (7), inotropes (4), ventilation (7), septic (C-reactive protein > 100 and blood culture-positive) (3), liver impairment (aspartate transaminase > 58 and alanine transaminase > 36) (4), coagulopathy (international normalized ratio > 1.3) (4), proinflammatory state (platelet count > 450) (5), and nutritional impairment (albumin < 37) (9). The median VAC treatment time was 32 days (range, 9–101 days). Of the changes, 70% required a general anesthetic or sedation on ICU. Control of 10 of 11 complex abdominal wounds (including 3 established enterocutaneous fistulae) was achieved using VAC therapy. Complications included nonreduction of laparostomy (1), failure of anastomosis (1), and failure of tube enterostomy diversion (1). Four children died of unrelated causes, 2 of them more than 3 months after VAC therapy.

Conclusions

In our experience with a small series of patients, VAC therapy is both safe and effective in complex pediatric abdominal wounds in severely ill children. It appears to promote wound closure, controls local sepsis, and can be used to manage established fistulae. However, our results suggest that recent bowel anastomoses may be compromised using VAC, which in this circumstance, should be used with caution.

Intervention protocols

In the NPWT group, following sterile wound closure, a vacuum-assisted closure system was applied intraoperatively. Examples of such systems include Prevena™, Avelle ® (ConvaTec), Smith & Nephew PICO ®, 3 M™ ActiV. A.C ®, KCI VAC Therapy ®, and Genadyne VAC ®.

NPWT application: NPWT was applied to wounds in indicated patients after either open or closed incisions, with a planned duration of 5–7 days. Management was conducted under hospital supervision with outpatient follow-up as appropriate. Dressings were changed under sterile conditions in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Importantly, the NPWT application duration and related management data were not drawn from a national registry; these details were manually extracted from the treatment records and surgical follow-up notes of the study cohort. The documentation indicates that the data originated from a single center and were not directly recorded in a national registry. These items were collected retrospectively to assess protocol adherence and postoperative care, acknowledging potential variability in documentation.

Conventional wound care group: Daily dressings using sterile gauze and antiseptic solution (containing 10% povidone-iodine equivalent to 1% available iodine) were applied, with daily assessment and dressing changes maintained for 5–7 days postoperatively.

Infection control protocols and perioperative antibiotics: For elective surgeries, mechanical bowel preparation and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis were employed. All patients adhered to standard antiseptic(containing 10% povidone-iodine equivalent to 1% available iodine) preparation of the incision site, and perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis was administered within 60 min before incision. For clean-contaminated or dirty wounds, broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. piperacillin–tazobactam or a second-generation cephalosporin) were initiated and continued for 3–5 days according to institutional protocols. Intraoperative changes to antibiotic regimens were made only in response to contamination events.

### Prophylactic groin wound vacuum-assisted therapy in vascular surgery patients at enhanced risk for postoperative wound infection [^bc56cd02]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vascular groin wounds have higher than expected surgical site infection (SSI) rates and some patients are at enhanced risk. The Wiseman et al. paper suggests an objective scoring system that identifies patients at enhanced risk of postdischarge SSI. We hypothesize that prophylactic groin wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in enhanced risk patients will decrease SSI and readmission and the Wiseman model provides potential evidence that enhanced risk patients can be objectively identified.

Methods

A single institution, retrospective analysis was conducted from January 2013 to September 2016 utilizing procedure codes to identify patients with wound VACs placed in the operating room. Two distinct groups were identified. The first was a wound complication patient group with 15 limbs (13 patients) with a groin wound VAC placed within 45 days postoperatively for groin wound complications. Eleven of these limbs had the VAC placed at readmission. The second group was a prophylactic patient group that included 8 limbs (7 patients) who received a VAC prophylactically placed in the enhanced risk wounds. These wounds were determined to be enhanced risk based on clinical criteria judged by the operating surgeon such as a large overhanging panniculus and/or one of several ongoing medical issues. We calculated a Wiseman score for all patients, determined total cost of the readmissions, and determined 30-day postsurgical SSI incidence for the prophylactic VAC group.

Results

Per the Wiseman scores, 9 limbs with postoperative complications were high risk and 3 limbs were moderate/high risk. Eleven limbs had a VAC placed at readmission with an average readmission cost of $8876.77. For the prophylactic group, 8 limbs were high risk with no observed postdischarge SSI in the first 30 days from surgery. The Wiseman scores showed close correlation between the retrospective high and moderate/high risk groups versus the prophylactic VAC group (31.5 ± 7.3 vs. 32 ± 5.5, P = 0.87).

Conclusions

The Wiseman scores showed objective validation in the prognosis of anticipating groin wound breakdown. Our initial results suggest that prophylactic groin wound VAC placement for enhanced risk vascular surgery patients may proactively decrease wound morbidity, decrease readmission secondary to groin wound complications, and provide some cost benefit.

### The application of double-layer-vacuum-assisted closure therapy with flap repair of soft tissue defects near the eyes or earDL-VAC therapy [^56155317]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to introduce and evaluate the safety of double-layer-vacuum-assisted closure (DL-VAC) therapy with flap repair of the wound near the eyes or ears.

Methods

This study is case reports of 2 patients who underwent DL-VAC therapy for tissue defects near the eyes or ears. The detailed process of the DL-VAC therapy is carefully described in this study. The postoperative wound healing process was closely observed. The biggest concern was the treatment outcome of DL-VAC therapy on the eyes and ears.

Results

Two patients underwent DL-VAC therapy due to their soft tissue defects close to the eyes or ears. Both patients achieved primary wound healing and the flaps survived during the follow-up period, which ranged from 1 to 24 months. Patients did not receive any dressing change until the VAC device was removed on the 5th to 7th postoperative day. No severe complications appeared and the patients were satisfied with both appearance and function.

Conclusions

Double-layer-vacuum-assisted closure therapy is an effective and safe option for the treatment of wounds near the eyes and ears.

### Wound infection rate after skin closure of damage control laparotomy with wicks or incisional negative wound therapy: an EAST multi-center trial [^06a35187]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Damage control laparotomy (DCL) has a high risk of SSI and as an attempt to mitigate this, surgeons often leave the skin open to heal by secondary intention. A recent retrospective study showed that DCL wounds could be closed with the addition of wicks or incisional wound vacs with acceptable rates of wound infection. The aim of this prospective trial was to corroborate these results. This is a prospective multicenter observational trial performed by 7 institutions from July 2020 to April 2022. Adult patients who underwent DCL and fascia/skin closure with the addition of wicks or an incisional wound vac were included. Patients who died within seven days of DCL were excluded. Demographics, mechanism of initial presentation, wound classification, antibiotics given, surgical site infections, procedures performed, and mortality data was collected. Fisher's Exact test was used for categorical data and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for continuous data. Mean days to closure was assessed using Student's t-test for independent groups. P-values < 0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance. Over the 21-month period, a total of 119 patients analyzed. Most patients were male (n = 66, 63%), and the average age was 51 years. The average number of days the abdomen was kept open was 2.6. A majority of the DCLs were performed on acute care patients (n = 76, 63.8%) and 92 patients (77.3%) had a wound classification of contaminated or dirty. Most of the patients' skin was closed with wicks in place (68.9%). There was a 9.8% infection rate in patient's skin closed with wicks versus 16.2% closed with an incisional wound vac (p = 0.361). Although the wick group had a higher proportion of class III and IV wound types, patients primarily treated with wicks had a lower risk of wound infection compared to those treated with incisional wound VACs; however, this difference was not statistically significant.

Treatment

After 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy (piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium 500 mg /two times a day), a revision of the surgical wound was performed using a myocutaneous trapezius muscle flap (figure 5). The remainder skin discontinuity (figure 6) of 3 cm wide was treated with VAC and antibiotics (after 10 days of vancomycin 500 mg four times a day, therapy was continued with piperacillin sodium/tazobactam 500 mg two times a day for the whole hospitalisation period) for 2 months with complete recovery (figure 7). The wound was covered with one layer of non-adherent dressing, and the sponge was applied with plaster. To ensure the dressing sealing, a pressure bandage was applied to the wound along with manual compression in order to get rid of any air space. The pressure was lowered to 125 mm Hg. The sponge was replaced every 3–4 days. The patient was positioned in lateral position when recumbent in her bed.

### Vacuum-assisted closure in the management of degloving soft tissue injury: a case report [^9dd814da]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

We report the case of a patient with an extensive degloving injury to his right foot involving severe subcutaneous soft tissue disruption and contamination. The initial treatment consisted of debridement, which was kept to a minimum, copious irrigation, primary wound closure at a few sites, and coverage of the remaining skin defects with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressings. After a few weeks of VAC therapy for wound bed preparation, definitive coverage with a meshed skin graft was possible. Additional plastic surgical procedures were not required. At the last follow-up visit, the patient had no complaints and was able to participate in normal social life without limitations. Wounds that are grossly contaminated or associated with extensive soft tissue defects often require a multistage approach before delayed primary wound closure or plastic surgical procedures can be performed. Vacuum therapy can be used for temporary soft tissue coverage and has been shown to improve bacterial clearance, to increase local blood flow, and to promote granulation tissue formation. In contrast, plastic surgical procedures initially achieve safe and stable wound closure; however, the absence of sensitivity can lead to secondary problems. This is of particular relevance if the graft recipient site is subject to heavy stress and the restoration of function is of paramount importance, such as in the present case. Vacuum therapy is an effective and safe treatment of degloving injuries. We achieved a very good functional outcome, which was particularly important in view of the high stresses and strains to which a foot is exposed.

### Negative pressure wound therapy in the management of late deep infections after open reconstruction of achilles tendon rupture [^5e67c8d8]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Infection is a major complication after open reconstruction of Achilles tendon ruptures. We report on the use of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in the treatment of late deep infections after open Achilles tendon reconstruction. Six patients (5 males [83.33%], 1 female [16.67%]; mean age, 52.8 [range 37 to 66] years) were been treated using an identical protocol. Surgical management consisted of debridement, lavage, and necrectomy of infected tendon parts. The VAC therapy was used for local wound preconditioning and infection management. A continuous negative pressure of 125 mm Hg was applied on each wound. For final wound closure, a split-thickness skin graft was performed. The skin graft healing process was also supported by VAC therapy during the first 5 days. The VAC dressings were changed a mean average of 3 (range 1 to 4) times until split-thickness skin grafting could be performed. The mean total duration of the VAC therapy was 13.6 ± 5.9 days. The mean hospital stay was 31.2 ± 15.9 days. No complications with regard to bleeding, seroma, or hematoma formation beneath the skin graft were observed. At a mean follow-up duration of 29.9 (range 4 to 65) months, no re-infection or infection persistence was observed. The VAC device seems to be a valuable tool in the treatment of infected tendons. The generalization of these conclusions should await the results of future studies with larger patient series.

### Sternal reconstruction after post-sternotomy mediastinitis [^f640a90d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Negative pressure wound therapy

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) applies subatmospheric pressure to the surface of wound, removes excessive fluid, decreases wound edema, accelerates wound healing and granulation tissue formation, stabilises chest wall, increases sternal blood flow and has been shown to improve early and long term survival in patients with deep sternal wound infection. It has emerged as one of the most significant developments in the last two decades in the management of sternal wound infections. All deep sternal wound infections and all limited sternal wound dehiscences not resulting in frank sternal instability should be treated in the first instance with negative pressure wound therapy and antibiotics. A significant number will heal satisfactorily with secondary intention with no requirement for further reconstructive management. This therefore represents a triumph for this vacuum assisted negative pressure management of wounds and a departure from the previous norm of either immediate return to theatre or weeks and rarely months of debilitating wet wound dressings sometimes a number of times the same day. Looking at the role of NPWT in cardiac surgical wound complications, Moriasky et al. in a propensity score matching analysis, reported significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in 22 patients treated with NPWT compared to 22 who did not (5 vs 36%, P = 0.021). In DSWI infected with MRSA, in particular, NPWT significantly reduced in-hospital mortality caused by DSWI (0 vs 52%, P = 0.003). Equally importantly, NPWT as a bridge therapy to tissue flaps may play a major role in treating DSWI and improve prognosis for patients with MRSA-infected sternal wounds. Debreceni et al. reported on 62 consecutive patients who underwent vacuum assisted wound closure (VAC). 28 had immediate or delayed wound resuture and 34 had subsequent well- vascularised pectoral muscle and/or omental or pericardial fat pad flaps with 11.3% in-hospital mortality and only 3.6% recurrence rates. Fuchs et al. compared NPWT with drainage, conventional dressings and flap closure and reported reduced time to achieve negative cultures, reduced hospital stay and lower percentage of patients discharged with an open sternum. Raja et al. reported that NPWT reduced the time interval between sternal debridement and primary or flap closure of infected sternal wounds.

### Secondary omental and pectoralis major double flap reconstruction following aggressive sternectomy for deep sternal wound infections after cardiac surgery [^1db57f70]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The optimal timing of secondary closure following VAC therapy is not established. Ronny et al reported the effectiveness of the C-reactive protein level in VAC therapy. We took bacterial cultures from the mediastinal space at the time of sponge exchange and when two negative cultures were confirmed, secondary closure was done. Although this needs clarification, we have not observed recurrence of infection after treatment with our new strategy. In comparison with age-, sex-, primary surgical procedure-, and follow-up period-matched patients without DSWI, the QOL of patients treated with total sternectomy was satisfactory in all regards except for 'vitality'. Immer et al reported that patients treated with sternal excision and reconstruction with a musculocutaneous flap showed a significant limitation of QOL, as assessed by SF36 in 6 of 8 aspects, although this was probably related to their general health in addition to the sternal wound healing problem. Our study confirms that our recent strategy for DSWI, including aggressive sternal resection does not impair QOL. The reason for the lower 'vitality' of patients after total sternectomy was the muscle weakness of the lower extremities caused by long-term hospitalization, rather than to the wound causing pain and respiratory difficulties.

In conclusion, our strategy for DSWI, consisting of aggressive sternal debridement followed by VAC therapy and secondary closure with the transposition of omental and bilateral pectoralis major flaps, controls wound infection and reduces hospitalization. The long-term QOL achieved is comparable with that of patients without DSWI.

### Closed incisional negative pressure therapy reduces perineal wound complications after abdominoperineal resection [^2fa546a0]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). Medium credibility.

Perineal wounds in the control group were covered with a simple gauze dressing in the operating room held in place by paper tape and mesh underwear. The dressing was removed 48 hours after surgery and left open to air if there was no evidence of wound infection.

All patients were followed by the authors for at least 180 days after surgery. Any wound infection requiring intervention such as removal of sutures, packing of the wound, or standard negative pressure wound therapy was documented. Dimensions of the open wound were measured and documented.

Wound complications were classified as minor or major. Minor wound complications included wounds meeting 1 or more of the following criteria: wound separation of < 2 cm, wounds not requiring management with open wound VAC, wounds completely healed within 30 days of surgery, and wounds not requiring readmission or operative intervention. Criteria for major complications included separation > 2 cm, perineal abscess, wounds that required reoperation, any wound that required placement of open wound VAC, or prolonged wound care for more than 30 days.

### Treatment outcomes of postoperative mediastinitis in cardiac surgery; negative pressure wound therapy versus conventional treatment [^ce830883]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infection of the sternotomy wound is a potentially devastating and sometimes lethal complication following cardiac surgery. Although the incidence of post-cardiotomy mediastinitis rate has been variously reported as between 0.8 and 5.0%, the mortality rate varies between 19% and 29% in different series of adult cardiac surgical patients. Established treatment may involve a combination of debridement, packing, delayed closure, plastic reconstruction, re-wiring and irrigation together with antibiotherapy dependent on the severity of infection. However, such treatments can be complex, invasive and prolong the hospitalization particularly when the primary method fails. These conventional wound healing techniques may be a combination of different procedures, but there is still a lack of consensus for the optimal surgical management. Conventional treatment has disadvantages such as destabilization of the sternum, prolonged immobilization and concomitant infections, that may complicate this fatal treatment period. Application of negative pressure by controlled suction through a porous dressing has emerged as a simple and effective treatment for a wide spectrum of wounds. Several studies have been reported with promising results with the use of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in poststernotomy mediastinitis that are also called deep sternal wound infections (DSWI).

The aim of the present study is to compare the clinical outcomes and survival in our 90 patients underwent negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) or conventional treatment for mediastinitis after cardiac surgery.

### Outcomes of vacuum-assisted therapy in the treatment of head and neck wounds [^7cb1ae81]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck wounds can present a reconstructive challenge for the plastic surgeon. Whether from skin cancer, trauma, or burns, there are many different treatment modalities used to dress and manage complex head and neck wounds. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy has been used on wounds of nearly every aspect of the body but not routinely in the head and neck area. This study was conducted to demonstrate our results using the VAC in the treatment of complex head and neck wounds.

Methods

This is an IRB-approved, retrospective review of 69 patients with 73 head and neck wounds that were managed using the VAC between 1999 and 2008. The wound mechanism, location, and size, length of VAC therapy, patient comorbidities, use of radiation, complications, and ultimate outcome were assessed. In this patient population, the VAC was utilized because the standard reconstructive ladder was not a good option or had previously failed.

Results

Sixty-nine patients with complex head and neck wounds were treated with the wound VAC. The mean age of the patients was 66 years, with a range of 5–96 years. Males outnumbered females in this study nearly 2:1. Eighty-six percent of patients had wounds secondary to cancer, 8% secondary to trauma, 3% secondary to infection, and 3% secondary to burns. The VAC was used as a dressing over skin grafts in 50%, over Integra in 21%, and over open debrided wounds in 29%. Wounds healed without complication in 44% of the skin grafts, 67% of Integra-covered wounds, and 71% of debrided wounds. Minor complications included failure of complete graft take, failure of granulation tissue formation in open debrided wounds, infection, and hematoma formation under skin grafts. Major complications included positive cancer margins requiring reexcision and death secondary to pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and metastatic cancer. Most complications resolved with dressing changes, repeat grafting, or the administration of antibiotics.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that the wound VAC provides a reliable, effective, and durable dressing for a multitude of complex head and neck wounds. Additionally, it is a valuable tool when traditional surgical procedures are not a viable option.
