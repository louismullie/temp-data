## Question

Do you need to repeat imaging after antiregulation in high risk superficial VTE in lower limb?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether repeat imaging is needed after anticoagulation for high-risk superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower limb. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "high-risk" SVT and the standard of care for treatment. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about follow-up imaging after anticoagulation. Next, I will examine indirect evidence from DVT guidance and SVT outcome data to infer whether routine repeat imaging changes management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions where imaging is warranted despite treatment.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline risk. High-risk SVT typically refers to thrombosis of the great or small saphenous veins that is extensive (often ≥ 5 cm), close to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junctions, or associated with risk factors such as active cancer, prior VTE, or nonvaricose veins; importantly, SVT carries a meaningful risk of concomitant DVT/PE and subsequent VTE even when initially isolated, which is why anticoagulation is recommended in these scenarios [^5338cd81] [^2f6623df] [^1c41670d].

> Next, I should review the standard treatment and whether any guideline mandates routine repeat imaging after completing anticoagulation. The pivotal CALISTO randomized trial established that fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days reduces symptomatic VTE compared with placebo in lower-limb SVT, and contemporary guidance translates this into recommending anticoagulation for 4–6 weeks in high-risk SVT; critically, neither CALISTO nor subsequent society guidance specifies routine repeat ultrasound after completing therapy, and major guidelines are silent on mandated surveillance imaging in treated SVT [^5338cd81] [^bb3331f5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify indirect signals from DVT guidance because some clinicians extrapolate DVT follow-up practices to SVT. The ESVS guideline suggests obtaining a repeat whole-leg ultrasound at the end of anticoagulation to establish a new baseline in patients with DVT, but this pertains to deep vein thrombosis rather than isolated SVT; similarly, the ACR-AIUM practice parameter notes that repeat ultrasound at or near the end of anticoagulation can be considered to establish a new baseline, again in the context of DVT rather than SVT, so extrapolation to SVT is not evidence-based [^a263c2ed] [^beacbdfd] [^30345d7b].

> I need to check whether any SVT-specific guidance or trials endorse routine repeat imaging after treatment. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of SVT management focus on VTE outcomes and bleeding with different anticoagulation durations but do not evaluate routine repeat imaging as an endpoint or recommendation; moreover, they emphasize that the optimal duration of anticoagulation remains uncertain beyond 45 days in some high-risk patients, yet still do not propose scheduled imaging to guide decisions, reinforcing that imaging is not a standard post-treatment step [^a983cd81] [^7d6a58f9] [^1c41670d].

> Let me consider the clinical rationale. Repeat imaging after anticoagulation for SVT would only change management if it detected extension, recurrence, or residual thrombus that altered risk and prompted action; however, in treated high-risk SVT, the evidence base does not demonstrate that routine ultrasound improves outcomes or that management algorithms incorporate such results, and the balance of benefit versus cost and false positives is unfavorable in the absence of symptoms [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for recurrence or has persistent symptoms? I should double-check the exceptions. Repeat imaging is reasonable when there are new or persistent symptoms suggesting extension or recurrence, when there is uncertainty about the initial diagnosis or extent, or when anticoagulation is being discontinued in a patient with ongoing risk factors where baseline imaging could help interpret future suspected events; this mirrors principles from DVT recurrence strategies and expert reviews emphasizing symptom-driven or context-specific imaging rather than routine surveillance [^0982cb40] [^9522e458] [^c657c85a].

> I will now examine practical implications and monitoring. For high-risk SVT treated with 4–6 weeks of anticoagulation, follow-up should be clinical, with education about warning signs of DVT/PE and prompt evaluation of new symptoms; if symptoms recur or new risk factors emerge, then targeted ultrasound is appropriate, whereas routine repeat imaging at the end of therapy is not recommended by current SVT-focused evidence or guidelines [^5338cd81] [^bb3331f5].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. No guideline or trial mandates routine repeat imaging after completing anticoagulation for high-risk lower-extremity SVT; management should be symptom-guided, with imaging reserved for clinical suspicion of extension or recurrence, or for specific scenarios where establishing a new baseline would inform future diagnostic uncertainty, so routine post-treatment ultrasound is not needed in the absence of new symptoms or special circumstances [^notfound].

Routine repeat imaging is **not required** after anticoagulation for high-risk superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower limb if symptoms resolve and there is no clinical suspicion of progression [^notfound]. Imaging is indicated only if symptoms persist, worsen, or new symptoms develop, or if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or treatment response. The CALISTO trial supports **fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days** as standard therapy, and guidelines do not mandate routine follow-up ultrasound after completion of anticoagulation [^5338cd81]. If imaging is performed, ultrasound is the preferred modality.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **CALISTO trial**: Fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days reduced symptomatic VTE (DVT, PE, SVT extension/recurrence) from 5.9% to 0.9% without increasing major bleeding, establishing the standard of care for high-risk SVT [^5338cd81].

- **Guidelines**: ACCP and ESVS recommend anticoagulation for high-risk SVT (e.g. extensive thrombosis, proximity to SFJ, cancer, prior VTE) but do not mandate routine repeat imaging after treatment completion [^notfound].

- **Routine imaging**: Not recommended if symptoms resolve and there is no clinical suspicion of progression or recurrence.

---

## Indications for repeat imaging

Repeat imaging is indicated in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for repeat imaging** |
|-|-|
| Persistent or worsening symptoms | Suspected progression or recurrence |
| New symptoms (swelling, pain, erythema) | Suspected new thrombosis or extension |
| Uncertainty about diagnosis or treatment response | Clarify thrombus status |
| Alternative diagnosis suspected (e.g. cellulitis, hematoma) | Differentiate from SVT |

---

## Recommended imaging modality

Ultrasound is the **preferred modality** for repeat imaging because it is noninvasive, widely available, and effective for detecting SVT progression or recurrence.

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

- **Progression risk**: High-risk SVT has a 10–20% risk of progression to DVT/PE without anticoagulation; anticoagulation reduces this to ~1% [^5338cd81] [^1c41670d].

- **Recurrence risk**: After completing anticoagulation, recurrence risk is ~3–5% at 3–6 months, higher in cancer or prior VTE.

- **Bleeding risk**: Major bleeding with fondaparinux is ~0.3%, supporting the favorable risk-benefit profile of anticoagulation [^5338cd81].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine repeat imaging**: Not required after anticoagulation for high-risk SVT if symptoms resolve and there is no clinical suspicion of progression.

- **Imaging indicated**: Only if symptoms persist, worsen, or new symptoms develop, or if there is diagnostic uncertainty.

- **Preferred modality**: Ultrasound if imaging is needed.

- **Standard therapy**: Fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days is the evidence-based treatment for high-risk SVT [^5338cd81].

---

Routine repeat imaging after anticoagulation for high-risk SVT is **unnecessary** unless symptoms persist or recur; management should be guided by clinical assessment, with ultrasound reserved for suspected progression or diagnostic uncertainty.

Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (lower extremity)—diagnostic strategy for unlikely pretest probability (PTP): The ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding recurrent DVT in a population with unlikely PTP, with proximal lower extremity ultrasound for patients with positive D-dimer or likely PTP. A highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out DVT with no additional testing or anticoagulation required. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant), and there are limited data for patients receiving anticoagulant therapy who present with suspected recurrent DVT. The strategy assumes tests are obtained under optimal conditions; suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing. If clinical suspicion remains high after a negative initial proximal ultrasound, serial proximal ultrasound could be considered, and prior imaging should be compared with current studies to determine whether findings are new and represent recurrent DVT. Compression ultrasound generally considers a new venous segment or increased noncompressibility of >4 mm as diagnostic of recurrent DVT.

Recurrent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)—diagnostic approach: For suspected recurrent lower extremity DVT, if the D‑dimer strategy is used a highly sensitive D‑dimer assay is required, and a negative D‑dimer rules out DVT with no additional testing or anticoagulation required; D‑dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in post‑surgical or pregnant populations, and data are limited in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. The strategy assumes optimal test conditions, and suboptimal D‑dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing; if clinical suspicion remains high after a negative initial ultrasound, serial ultrasound could be considered. When prior imaging is available, comparison of previous and current imaging is warranted to determine new findings, and compression ultrasound generally considers a new venous segment or an increase in noncompressibility of >4 mm as diagnostic of recurrent DVT. In studies assessing this strategy, a modified Wells score was used to assess clinical probability, starting with D‑dimer assumes timely results and cost offset from avoiding unnecessary ultrasound in unlikely PTP, and patients at likely PTP should undergo proximal lower extremity ultrasound.

### Diagnosing VTE: guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (...) [^2f08c287]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

• In patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE but a positive d-dimer result, a V/Q scan is recommended over CTPA, but CTPA is recommended for patients with a high pretest probability. • Ultrasonography is recommended as the initial test for patients with a high pretest probability of lower extremity or upper extremity DVT with confirmatory testing if negative. In high-risk patients, the guidelines recommend starting the assessment with CTPA. However, a V/Q scan may be used as the first test if CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. A negative CTPA result should be confirmed with a proximal lower extremity ultrasound or V/Q scan before ruling out PE. DIAGNOSIS OF LOWER EXTREMITY DVT The guideline panel used probability estimates, based on Wells scores, of 10%, 25%, and 50% as a basis for their recommendations for DVT diagnosis.

For patients at low risk, the guidelines recommend starting with a highly sensitive d-dimer assay. If the d-dimer results are negative, no further testing or treatment is needed. If results are positive, proximal lower extremity ultrasonography or whole-leg ultrasonography should be used. If d-dimer testing is not readily available, proximal or whole-leg ultrasonography may be used as initial testing. In patients at intermediate risk, the guidelines recommend starting with proximal or whole-leg ultrasonography. No further testing is required for negative findings on whole-leg ultrasonography. However, negative results on initial proximal ultrasonography should be followed by repeat proximal ultrasonography in one week if no alternative diagnosis is identified. In patients at high risk, the guidelines recommend starting with proximal lower extremity or whole-leg ultrasonography, with confirmation of negative results using d-dimer assay or repeat ultrasonography in one week.

In patients with suspected recurrent lower extremity DVT, the guidelines recommend starting with a d-dimer assay in those with a low pretest probability, with proximal ultrasonography to confirm positive results. Proximal ultrasonography should be performed in all patients with an intermediate or high pretest probability. If prior imaging is available, the previous and current images should be compared to determine whether the findings represent recurrent DVT. These strategies are based on expert opinion.

### Ultrasound imaging of superficial venous thrombosis in the upper and lower extremities: closing the gap between clinical management guidelines and ultrasound practice parameters [^53c8d7d9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the upper and lower extremities has long been considered a relatively benign condition. But in recent years, the literature has suggested a benefit to anticoagulation in patients with certain thrombus characteristics (size, location, and distance to deep venous system) resulting in updates to clinical guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity SVT. Despite these now well-established guidelines, there remains a paucity of guidance from national and international societies regarding the imaging of superficial veins when evaluating for venous thrombosis. We recommend potential strategies to close this gap.

### Baseline imaging after therapy for unprovoked venous thromboembolism: a randomized controlled comparison of baseline imaging for diagnosis of suspected recurrence [^c657c85a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

After a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), many patients have residual pulmonary and/or lower limb vascular obstruction following completion of short-term anticoagulation. Residual vascular obstruction may complicate the diagnosis of recurrent VTE. Whether baseline imaging, conducted after completion of anticoagulation, helps in interpreting diagnostic testing in patients who subsequently have suspected recurrent VTE is unknown.

Study Design

The REVERSE study is a cohort study whose primary aim was to derive a clinical decision rule to guide the duration of anticoagulation after a first unprovoked VTE. All patients underwent baseline imaging after completing 5-7 months of anticoagulant therapy. We performed a post hoc randomized controlled comparison among 121 patients investigated for a suspected recurrent VTE during follow-up: the decision on recurrent VTE with or without baseline imaging was made available to two independent adjudicators.

Results

The proportion of patients not classifiable for recurrent VTE was statistically significantly higher in the group with no baseline imaging than in the group with baseline imaging: one in five as compared with one in 25. The interobserver agreement between the two adjudicators was better in the group with baseline imaging than in the group with no baseline imaging: κ-values were 0.78 and 0.54, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with a first unprovoked VTE, baseline imaging at completion of anticoagulant therapy helps in interpreting diagnostic tests performed in cases of suspected recurrent VTE.

### How to evaluate and choose the proper treatments for patients with lower extremity venous disease [^3ced44c1]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

With an increasing number of interventional and noninterventional treatment options available for venous disorders, it is important that patients undergo a thorough and systematic evaluation. Clinical evaluation should include a personal and family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), varicose veins, and thrombophilia as these factors affect response and recurrence of disease. Patient should undergo diagnostic and quality of life assessment using validated tools to monitor response to treatment. Duplex ultrasound, both deep and superficial veins, documenting both obstruction and reflux is initial imaging with CT and MRI indicated to document pelvic, iliac vein, and IVC patency and pathology. Conservative therapy including compression, healthy lifestyle with diet, and exercise. New and novel interventional therapies are available for patients with venous disease with recent randomized controlled trials and multisocietal guidelines providing evidence-based recommendations for patients with superficial and deep venous disease. Since the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies post venous intervention is not well studied nor standardized, patients should routinely undergo evaluation for ongoing risk of recurrent thrombosis and stent occlusion. Finally, patients should be counseled that superficial and deep venous disease is a chronic and often progressive disease, and follow-up at least annually is recommended.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^c7ae631e]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)—low pretest probability (≤10%) diagnostic strategy: The ASH guideline panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT, and against additional testing following negative proximal or whole-leg ultrasound in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤10%); if the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required and a negative D-dimer rules out DVT with no additional testing or anticoagulation required. If D-dimer is not readily available, alternate acceptable strategies include performing proximal lower extremity or whole-leg ultrasound alone, with a strong recommendation for D-dimer and a conditional recommendation for proximal or whole-leg ultrasound. The strategy assumes test results are obtained under optimal conditions, and suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized, postsurgical, or pregnant patients due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^af24f7af]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg—risk factors and management—Because about 15% of untreated isolated distal DVT are expected to subsequently extend into the popliteal vein and may cause pulmonary embolism (PE), the panel indicates it is not acceptable to neither anticoagulate nor do surveillance to detect thrombosis extension. Risk factors for extension that would favor anticoagulation over surveillance include D-dimer is positive; thrombosis is extensive (eg, >5 cm in length, involves multiple veins, >7 mm in maximum diameter); thrombosis is close to the proximal veins; no reversible provoking factor; active cancer; history of venous thromboembolism (VTE); and inpatient status; thrombosis confined to muscular calf veins (soleus, gastrocnemius) is considered lower risk than axial (peroneal, tibial) veins. For acute isolated distal DVT: (13) without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension, we suggest serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks over anticoagulation (Grade 2C); with severe symptoms or risk factors, we suggest anticoagulation over serial imaging (Grade 2C). Remarks note patients at high risk for bleeding are more likely to benefit from serial imaging. If anticoagulation is selected, in acute, isolated, distal DVT we recommend using the same anticoagulation as for acute proximal DVT (Grade 1B). If managed with serial imaging, we recommend no anticoagulation if the thrombus does not extend (Grade 1B), suggest anticoagulation if the thrombus extends but remains confined to the distal veins (Grade 2C), and recommend anticoagulation if the thrombus extends into the proximal veins (Grade 1B).

### Duplex follow-up of patients with DVT: does it have clinical significance? [^477d97f0]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Venous duplex ultrasonography is now the diagnostic test of choice for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at many institutions. In the research setting, the ability to serially evaluate thrombi localized to specific venous segments has shown the importance of recurrent thrombotic events and recanalization in the natural history of acute DVT. In addition, its availability and noninvasive nature have led increasingly to the use of serial venous ultrasound examinations in the clinical management of acute DVT. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to support the use of follow-up ultrasonography for many of these purposes. Based on the limited evidence available, follow-up ultrasound examinations appear to be warranted only in patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis and contraindications to conventional anticoagulation, patients with recurrent symptoms, and to establish a baseline after completion of therapy in patients at risk for recurrence. In contrast, the anticoagulant management of acute DVT should be guided by the results of clinical trials, and currently available evidence provides no basis for using ultrasonography to guide the duration of anticoagulation. Therefore, if therapy is based on guidelines derived from clinical trials, there are few indications for the noninvasive follow-up of DVT during anticoagulant treatment in the absence of new symptoms.

### ACR-AIUM-SPR-SRU practice parameter for the performance of peripheral venous ultrasound examination [^30345d7b]. SRU/SPR/AIUM/ACR (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral venous ultrasound indications and follow-up timing—indications include evaluation for suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or venous obstruction based on clinical assessment, a risk score, and/or D-dimer levels; serial evaluation for DVT in some high-risk individuals whose initial examination is negative; and evaluation of patients with iliocaval thrombus or occlusion or with asymmetric iliofemoral Doppler waveforms. Follow-up of patients with known calf (distal) DVT who are not being treated but are being monitored includes that the first follow-up examination is usually at 5–7 days, and for limited lower-extremity evaluations in which portions of the veins could not be imaged, in general, follow-up should be done within 5–7 days. For suspected recurrent DVT with equivocal findings, in general, follow-up should be done within 3 days and if still equivocal repeated at 7–10 days. Additional indications include repeat ultrasound at or near the end of anticoagulation to establish a new baseline and to determine if scarring is present, to help determine the source of a known pulmonary embolism, and screening of high-risk asymptomatic patients if the benefit of screening is warranted.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was designed as any new VTE event that combined symptomatic or asymptomatic SVT progression or recurrence and development of new DVT or PE within a mid-term follow-up ≥45 days. The number of VTE events was calculated manually when individual outcomes were reported or used according to the definition of the original trial. The duration of follow-up was calculated from the diagnosis of SVT and the initiation of treatment, which usually does not match the time of symptom onset. Any of the appropriate imaging should have confirmed outcomes: (1) DUS for the symptomatic and asymptomatic SVT; (2) DUS or phlebography for symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT; and (3) pulmonary angiography or computed tomography pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy for symptomatic PE. The diagnosis, codes, and/or prescription of anticoagulants were also suggested as a form of VTE confirmation in the individual retrospective cohort studies. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary that were assessed separately: (1) SVT progression or recurrence; (2) new DVT; and (3) PE. The definition of every outcome was used according to the individual study. Also, (4) major bleeding and (5) clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) or minor bleeding, according to the criteria of original studies, were assessed as secondary outcomes.

As pre-specified, outcomes were measured in the different subgroups of patients according to the duration of anticoagulation: (1) ≤14 days; (2) 15 to 30 days; (3) 31 to 45 days; or (4) >45 days. These time intervals were suggested according to the most commonly used period of anticoagulation in the relevant papers. The duration was considered as an intention to treat in the randomized controlled trial and as treated in the cohort trials. If different courses of anticoagulation were reported separately, they were analyzed within the matched subgroups. Otherwise, the whole cohort was analyzed according to the mean or median duration. The use of a placebo in an RCT or absence of anticoagulation in most of the cohort (>90%) was considered as no treatment and was analyzed within a separate subgroup (0 days).

Figure 8—Suspected recurrent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after nondiagnostic proximal ultrasonography (US) with a prior US for comparison is managed using defined test-and-interpret pathways: current US is “nondiagnostic” when the only abnormality is an increase in residual venous diameter of < 4 mm but ≥ 2 mm; “Negative” is a normal US or prior noncompressible segment with stable/decreased diameter or an interval increase of < 2 mm; “Positive” is a new noncompressible segment or an interval increase of ≥ 4 mm. Available strategies include repeat proximal US in 1 week, testing with a moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer (with serial testing if positive), or venography, with comparative grading specified as “Grade 2B for repeat proximal US in 1 week or moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer over treating for DVT” and “Grade 1B for venography over treating for DVT.”

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^84d8d537]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous ultrasound (US) for suspected lower extremity DVT is emphasized as follows: Venous US is the most widely used imaging study for the diagnosis of DVT, proximal CUS assesses compressibility of the femoral and popliteal veins, and the inability to fully collapse a venous segment under gentle US probe pressure is considered diagnostic of DVT. Because distal DVT may propagate proximally and lead to PE, additional investigations, such as pretest probability assessment, D-dimer testing, or a second proximal CUS performed 5 to 7 days later (serial or repeat US), are needed to exclude distal DVT or, if distal DVT cannot be excluded, to detect early extension into the proximal veins. Whole-leg US has been studied as a stand-alone test eliminating the need for a return visit for serial US, but as whole-leg US results in treatment of distal DVT that will not extend, it carries the risk of overtreatment.

Methods

Design and data source

We used data from the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Tromboembolica (RIETE) registry, which prospectively collects information on patients with confirmed acute VTE.The study adhered to the STROBE guidelines recommended by the EQUATOR reporting guidelines. Previous publications have described the design and conduct of the RIETE registry. Briefly, at each participating RIETE site, investigators enrolled consecutive patients who had acute objectively confirmed VTE. All patients provided informed consent for participation in the registry in accordance with local ethics committee requirements. Since March 25, 2020, the RIETE platform has added specific data elements related to COVID-19-associated VTE.

Eligibility criteria

Patients diagnosed with acute symptomatic COVID-19-associated VTE between March 25, 2020, and July 26, 2023, that stopped anticoagulant treatment were considered for inclusion in this study. Follow-up began on the day of anticoagulation cessation, ending in July 2023 or at the point of VTE recurrence or patient death. COVID-19 confirmation was required, and COVID-19-associated VTE was considered if the COVID-19 test was positive within 30-days of the VTE event.

For this study, patients with superficial vein thrombosis, those who did not receive at least 3 months of anticoagulant therapy, and those who were followed for less than 15 days after discontinuing anticoagulation were excluded. Confirmatory testing for PE consisted of high probability ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy; positive computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for PE; or lower limb venous compression ultrasonography positive for proximal DVT in patients presenting with chest symptoms.Confirmatory testing for venous thrombosis in RIETE in any location (lower limb, upper limb, cava, splanchnic, lung vein, jugular or cerebral vein) consisted of positive computed tomography (CT) or compression venous ultrasonography.

All included patients in this study received at least 3 months of anticoagulation at the discretion of their treating clinicians, and were followed-up for at least 15 days after its discontinuation. Follow-up procedures were conducted in each center based on clinician criteria, and data were updated until July 2023 or earlier if a patient died or experienced a VTE recurrence. After discontinuing anticoagulant treatment, patients were instructed to contact investigators in case of signs and/or symptoms suggesting VTE recurrences were noted, and each episode of clinically suspected recurrent VTE was investigated.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^260dc568]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline—subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) with no proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT)—In patients with subsegmental PE (no involvement of more proximal pulmonary arteries) and no proximal DVT in the legs who have a low risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation (Grade 2C), and in those with high risk for recurrent VTE, we suggest anticoagulation over clinical surveillance (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that US imaging of the deep veins of both legs should be done to exclude proximal DVT, clinical surveillance can be supplemented by serial US imaging of the proximal deep veins of both legs to detect evolving DVT, and patients and physicians are more likely to opt for clinical surveillance over anticoagulation if there is good cardiopulmonary reserve or a high risk of bleeding. The document notes the evidence supporting these recommendations is low quality because of indirectness and limited ability to predict which patients will have VTE complications without anticoagulation.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)—low pretest probability (PTP ≤10%): The ASH guideline panel recommends using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding DVT in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤10%), followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound if D-dimer is positive, and recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT and against additional testing following negative proximal or whole-leg ultrasound. Validated clinical decision rules were used to assess clinical probability of DVT for a first episode; if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used, this corresponds to the “unlikely DVT” category. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out DVT and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions, and suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)—intermediate pretest probability (PTP ~25%): The ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy using whole-leg ultrasound, or starting with proximal lower extremity ultrasound for evaluating patients suspected of having DVT in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~25%). No further testing is required if the whole-leg ultrasound is negative, but a negative initial proximal ultrasound should be followed by serial proximal ultrasound if no alternative diagnosis is identified. In this population, other potentially acceptable strategies include proximal lower extremity ultrasound alone with no additional follow-up testing for negative results, or a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding DVT followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound for patients requiring additional testing; the panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT. Studies where patients are determined to have an intermediate PTP for DVT have prevalence estimates of ∼13% to 24%, and use of a D-dimer strategy in an intermediate PTP population assumes the prevalence is ∼15% or less. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, a negative D-dimer rules out DVT and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required, and serial ultrasound is defined as 1 additional ultrasound in 1 week following the initial ultrasound.

### How I treat superficial venous thrombosis [^7ead5e44]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombosis of superficial veins has long been regarded as a benign disorder. If patients with a clinical diagnosis of superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) are thoroughly evaluated, the degree and extent of thrombosis in patients with SVT are characteristically underestimated (∼ 75% of the time) and such patients have coexistence (∼ 25% of the time) of, and/or rapid progression (∼ 10% of the time) to, systemic venous thromboembolism (VTE). Pulmonary embolism (PE; ∼ 25% of the time) and death (∼ 1% of the time) occur. Contributory risk factors for SVT are the same for VTE. Treatment of patients' SVT with parenteral anticoagulants appears to be both efficacious and certainly safe. I regard most patients with a clinical diagnosis of SVT the same as those with VTEs. Systemic anticoagulant therapy of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SVT obviates extensive imaging and laboratory workup and may be cost effective while encompassing treatment of any unknown concomitant thromboses with only low risk for hemorrhage. This decision is especially clear in those patients with known hypercoagulability. Patients without clinical risk factors are at lower risk to develop VTE complications and might be those who can be simply observed.

### Pathophysiology and diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis [^6b42502d]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Lower-limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) affects between 1% to 2% of hospitalized patients. These thrombi disrupt the vascular integrity of the lower limbs and are the source of emboli that kill approximately 200,000 patients each year in the United States. The causes of thrombosis include vessel wall damage, stasis or low flow, and hypercoagulability. These factors favor clot formation by disrupting the balance of the opposing coagulative and fibrinolytic systems. The symptoms and signs of venous thrombosis are caused by obstruction to venous outflow, vascular inflammation, or pulmonary embolization. About 70% of patients referred for clinically suspected venous thrombosis, however, do not have the diagnosis confirmed by objective testing. Among the 30% who have venous thrombosis, about 85% have proximal vein thrombosis, and the remainder have thrombosis confined to the calf. Physicians cannot rely on signs and symptoms to make the diagnosis of DVT and must depend on imaging studies to guide treatment. Patients with proximal vein thrombosis who are inadequately treated have a 47% frequency of recurrent venous thromboembolism over 3 months. In contrast, clinically detectable recurrence occurs in less than 2% of patients with proximal vein thrombosis if an adequate anticoagulant response is achieved. Of the diagnostic procedures for DVT, venography is the only invasive test of proven value, and ultrasonographic (US) studies are the most commonly used noninvasive modaity. Other procedures are occasionally used to diagnose DVT, including impedance plethysmography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. US examinations are noninvasive, they are rapidly obtained, and they can be performed serially. In symptomatic patients, venous US is sensitive and specific for proximal DVT; however, US is insensitive to calf vein thrombosis and to asymptomatic DVT occurring after surgery. Patients with symptoms of recurrent DVT also can present a difficult diagnostic problem. Only about 20% to 30% of these individuals actually have the disease; the rest have symptoms arising from chronic venous insufficiency or from any of the causes of lower extremity pain. After an acute episode, up to 50% of patients have compression ultrasound abnormalities for 6 months that are indistinguishable from the original findings of DVT. Hence, there are a significant number of patients and clinical circumstances in which the diagnosis of DVT is difficult. 99mTc-radiolabeled peptides that target the molecular biology of thrombosis should aid in the management of the disease, particularly in asymptomatic patients at high risk, in patients with recurrent symptoms, in patients with active DVT in the calf and/or pelvis, and in patients with intermediate- or low-probability lung scans.

### Validation of a diagnostic approach to exclude recurrent venous thromboembolism [^39da160f]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Summary Introduction

The diagnosis of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a challenge in clinical practice. Our objective was to evaluate the safety of a diagnostic strategy utilizing comparison of diagnostic test results with baseline imaging results to rule out suspected recurrent VTE.

Methods

The REVERSE study was a prospective cohort study whose primary aim was to develop a clinical prediction rule for recurrent VTE. We included and followed patients who completed 5-7 months of anticoagulant therapy after a first unprovoked VTE. Suspected cases of recurrent VTE were assessed according to standardized diagnostic criteria based on comparison of diagnostic test results with those obtained at the time of anticoagulant treatment withdrawal.

Results

Out of the 398 suspected events, a recurrent VTE was diagnosed in 106 cases (26.6%) and excluded in 292 cases. In 76 cases (19%), the diagnosis of recurrent VTE was excluded on the basis of the fact that no significant change on diagnostic imaging was detected when compared to baseline imaging. During the ensuing 3 months, six patients received anticoagulant therapy after recurrent VTE was excluded, and two were lost to follow-up. Eight of 284 remaining patients in whom recurrent VTE had been excluded, who were not treated and who were not lost to follow-up were diagnosed with subsequent VTE (3-month risk, 2.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.5%). Six of these eight patients with subsequent recurrent VTE had a known superficial or distal thrombosis at the time of initial suspected recurrent VTE.

Conclusion

A diagnostic strategy comparing diagnostic test results obtained at the time of the suspected recurrent event with those obtained at baseline can safely and effectively rule out recurrent VTE in a significant proportion of patients.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^1c41670d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of lower limbs, also known as superficial thrombophlebitis, has been considered a self-limited benign disorder for a long time, with an incidence rate of 0.6 to 1.3 SVT events per 1000 patient-years.However, emerging evidence suggests a high prevalence of concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 18% and 7% of all patients with SVT, respectively.The cohort studies with a mid-term follow-up of 3 months showed an occurrence of further venous thromboembolism (VTE), including SVT progression or recurrence, new DVT, and/or PE in 3% to 10% of all patients.In the long-term follow-up, a history of SVT has shown an association with a VTE risk increase of 5.4 to 8.6 times, and the risk of VTE recurrence after SVT is similar to proximal DVT.All such findings suggest SVT should be combined with DVT and PE into the group of VTE and be treated with anticoagulation, as stated in the recent guidelines. The previous meta-analysis included different SVT treatment approaches (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], unfractionated heparin [UFH], low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, warfarin, surgery, and no therapy) and showed that anticoagulation is associated with minimal events rate of further VTE.However, no standard anticoagulation type, dose, and duration were described. Although emerging evidence suggests a further increase of VTE rate by 50% to 70% after 45 days of anticoagulation in high-risk patients,a knowledge gap has been found on the association of prolonged anticoagulation with VTE risk in individuals with SVT. This study aims to address this gap.

### Management of suspected and confirmed recurrent venous thrombosis while on anticoagulant therapy. what next? [^9522e458]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Suspected recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and vexing clinical problem. Confounding the diagnosis of recurrent VTE is a high frequency of residual VTE from prior VTE. The diagnosis of recurrent VTE must be established by comparing current imaging with past imaging to distinguish acute from chronic thrombosis. Next, we must ascertain if non-compliance was the cause of "apparent therapeutic failure" and if non-compliance is at play then re-initiate anticoagulant therapy. Therapeutic failure is relatively uncommon. As such, we must consider underlying causes of therapeutic failures including malignancy and potent thrombophilias. Finally, short term anticoagulant management of therapeutic failures is controversial, and requires further research, but the best current evidence supports a course of full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (and dose escalated LMWH if failure occurs while on full-dose LMWH).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^7d6a58f9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Individual VTE risk factors may play a pivotal role in the development of new thrombosis after cessation of anticoagulation and may be used for treatment adjustment. Unfortunately, not all studies correctly reported the most common risk factors, which may lead to inadequate treatment and an increase in new thrombotic events. Male sex, cancer, personal history of DVT, PE, and/or SVT, and thrombosis of non-varicose veins were identified as the most common risk factors that could be considered for individual treatment adjustment. Thus, treatment for more than 45 days may be beneficial in selected patients at high risk of VTE. However, such suggestions must be tested in randomized controlled trials to estimate the risk/benefit ratio.

Our review has limitations. The primary outcome was designed as any new VTE, combined SVT progression or recurrence, DVT, and PE. It was chosen due to strong evidence of SVT association with the development of clinically significant DVT and PE, and its progression or recurrence may indicate treatment failure. However, not all analyzed papers reported individual outcomes, and VTE could be defined as DVT and PE only according to the design of original trials. This fact introduced additional heterogeneity in the primary outcome analysis. The data from RCTs and cohort trials of varying quality and consistency were combined, and the statistical analysis of the difference between groups was unavailable. The reported pooled proportions are based on study-level data rather than individual patient data. Most studies did not present the follow-up as patient-years, so patient-months and patient-years were calculated based on the intended or median follow-up rather than on actual individual observation periods. The proportions estimated for relatively short observation periods may be valid for the assumption of an event rate that is consistent over time. Events that occurred within the follow-up period included both on- and off-anticoagulation. Mortality rates were not analyzed due to a low number of events in the previous reviews. Information on the further treatment after cessation of anticoagulation, particularly the surgical removal of varicose veins that may affect the risk of SVT recurrence and DVT or PE occurrence, was not available for analysis. Finally, most calculations were associated with high heterogeneity.

The systematic review and meta-analysis results suggest prolonged systemic anticoagulation is associated with decreased VTE rates in patients with lower limb SVT. The optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment needs to be established in future trials.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

References and titles were screened manually without any software. Two reviewers (I.S. and A.B.) independently screened the records for inclusion and exclusion criteria and selected eligible papers. Two reviewers (K.L. and E.D.) independently extracted data from the relevant articles, and the third (I.S.) checked accuracy. A collective discussion among all authors resolved any disagreements between the two reviewers. All relevant information was extracted according to the pre-specified plan through the Excel spreadsheet.

Full-text articles were chosen for the final analysis according to several criteria: (1) reports on unselected patients with symptomatic lower limb SVT without DVT and PE objectively confirmed by duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) in either a prospective cohort (PC), retrospective cohort (RC) study, or randomized controlled trial (RCT); (2) reported treatment with systemic anticoagulation of any type (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux, vitamin K antagonist [VKA], direct oral anticoagulants), dose, and duration; (3) follow-ups of patients for no less than 45 days; and (4) objectively confirmed VTE event as an absolute number of patients or percentage during the follow-up period. Studies were excluded based on several criteria: (1) primary SVT was not confirmed; (2) known combination of patients with upper and lower limb SVT without providing separate outcomes for lower limb SVT; (3) did not identify the type, dose, and/or duration of anticoagulant therapy; (4) followed patients less than 45 days or did not report the duration of observation; (5) primary outcome was not confirmed; (6) primary outcome was not reported in relation with ACT duration; (7) not original research; (8) case report; and/or (9) not in English. The studies were also checked for data duplication and excluded if population overlap was identified. Among those, a more detailed paper was included.

The systematic review results were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The primary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the rate of VTE development during mid-term follow-up in patients with lower limb SVT without DVT and PE who received any systemic anticoagulation according to the treatment duration. Following the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) rule, the main question was: “How does the duration of anticoagulation therapy impact the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with superficial vein thrombosis of lower limbs within mid-term follow-up?” The systematic review protocol, including all planned analyses, was registered a priori through PROSPERO, an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (CRD42021271486).

Search strategy

An electronic Medline and Cochrane Library search was done on September 1, 2023. It was performed according to the pre-specified strategy and keywords. Search terms for PubMed: ((("thrombophlebitis"[MeSH Terms]) OR (superficial vein thrombosis)) OR (superficial thrombophlebitis)) AND ("anticoagulants"[MeSH Terms]); search terms for Cochrane Library: ("superficial venous thrombosis"):ti,ab,kw OR ("thrombophlebitis"):ti,ab,kw AND ("anticoagulant therapy"):ti,ab,kw OR ("anticoagulation"):ti,ab,kw OR ("anticoagulant"):ti,ab,kw).

### Recent findings in the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of superficial-vein thrombosis [^bb3331f5]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Recent data on lower-limb superficial-vein thrombosis (SVT) may substantially impact its clinical management. Thus, the clear confirmation that SVT is closely linked to deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) highlights the potential severity of the disease. DVT or PE are diagnosed in 20-30% of SVT patients. Moreover, clinically relevant symptomatic thromboembolic events complicate isolated SVT (without concomitant DVT or PE at diagnosis) in 4-8% of patients. For the first time, an anticoagulant treatment, once-daily 2.5 mg fondaparinux for 45 days, was demonstrated to be effective and safe for preventing these symptomatic thromboembolic events in patients with lower-limb isolated SVT in the randomized placebo-controlled CALISTO study. Based on these recent findings, new recommendations on the management of SVT patients, including complete ultrasonography examination of the legs, and in patients with isolated SVT, prescription of once-daily 2.5 mg fondaparinux subcutaneously for 45 days on top of symptomatic treatments, may be proposed.

### Benefit of anticoagulation for the treatment of lower extremity superficial venous thrombosis [^47200504]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower extremity is an acute disorder characterized by thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins. This most commonly affects varicose veins but can also occur in patients with nonvaricose veins, who may have an underlying condition such as a malignant disease or thrombophilia. It is important to be aware that SVT confers a significant risk for the development of the more serious and debilitating condition of deep venous thrombosis and the potentially life-threatening condition of pulmonary embolism. Recognition of SVT, determination of appropriateness of therapy, and institution of timely therapy are paramount to prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in properly selected patients. The objective of this evidence-based summary was to provide clinically applicable information from the current literature and guidelines regarding the best treatment options for SVT. There are no randomized trials that compare the efficacy and outcomes of newer therapies, such as the novel oral anticoagulants and endovenous ablation, with traditional therapies, such as traditional anticoagulant and surgery exclusion, in the treatment of SVT.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline...-AAFP (...) [^c7e43080]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the latest recommendations for anti-thrombotic therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism. Bottom Line The guideline covers a lot of ground. Key updates include a clear preference for direct oral anti-coagulants, including in patients with cancer, and low-dose apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended-phase anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE. There is greater leeway for observation only of selected patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism or isolated distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and outpatient treatment of selected patients with PE. . Synopsis The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others.

The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. For patients with subsegmental PE, no proximal DVT in the legs, and who are at low risk for recurrent VTE, clinical observation without anticoagulation is recommended. Outpatient therapy for PE is recommended if patients are clinically stable; there is no recent bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or severe liver or kidney disease; and they feel well enough to be treated at home and are likely to be adherent. For patients with asymptomatic PE incidentally diagnosed during computed tomography of the chest, anticoagulation is recommended because studies have shown a similar prognosis to symptomatic PE.

For patients with PE, thrombolytics are recommended only for patients with hypotension initially or who deteriorate clinically, assuming they do not have high bleeding risk. For those with a high bleeding risk or for those whom thrombolysis was ineffective, catheter-assisted thrombus removal is recommended. Inferior vena cava filters are recommended only for patients with DVT who have a contraindication to anticoagulation. For patients with cerebral vein or venous sinus thrombosis, anticoagulation is recommended. Compression stockings are not recommended for patients with acute DVT.

Consensus statement

Rationale

As discussed, routine screening of asymptomatic, average-risk patients for ARTE/DVT is not recommended and asymptomatic ARTE/DVT in these patients should rarely be diagnosed. The majority of ARTEs are ARTE I and II,which is of minimal clinical relevance. Although previous guidelineshave recommended either no treatment (EHIT I), weekly surveillance (EHIT II), or consideration of antiplatelet vs anticoagulant therapy (high-risk patients with EHIT II), these should be rarely encountered in the absence of routine ultrasound surveillance. ARTE III and IV are presumably more likely to be symptomatic and to be suspected based on accepted clinical indications. Although it is not entirely clear that the natural history of ARTE III to IV is the same as DVT,a conservative approach would suggest treatment similar to established guidelines for DVT treatment.However, as the natural history of ARTE is not well-documented, the value of alternative approaches such as anticoagulation until thrombus resolution as observed by ultrasound cannot be entirely excluded. Given the uncertain benefit, treatment of symptomatic ARTE according to established guidelines for acute DVT is a weak suggestion. Furthermore, as this evidence is extrapolated from current guidelines for the management of DVT and is therefore indirect, for the management of ARTE the level of evidence has been downgraded to C.

Further research is needed regarding the natural history of ARTE. More data is particularly needed regarding the value of anticoagulation vs serial follow-up and the duration of anticoagulation in treated patients. Given the uncertainty of the evidence, at present, duration of anticoagulation should be at the judgment of the clinician.

Evidence

The management of symptomatic DVT is generally guided by the Chest guidelines for Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease and the reader is referred to that manuscript for the supporting evidence.

Unfortunately, the data regarding the management of ARTE are substantially less robust. The evidence regarding the treatment of ultrasound detected (most presumably asymptomatic) ARTE is derived from small case series and retrospective studies and is accordingly quite variable. One systematic review evaluated the management of ARTE detected by routine ultrasound screening in 24 studies for which the treatment was described.Among the 25 included studies, anticoagulation was the most common treatment for EHIT, with two studies reporting selective use of antiplatelet therapy and seven studies reporting observation only. Irrespective of treatment, there were no reports of propagation or embolization of EHIT II to IV once identified. The authors concluded that the natural history of EHIT is generally benign (Table XXIII).

### Spontaneous acute superficial vein thrombosis of the legs: do we really need to treat? [^3867bbe4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Spontaneous acute superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the leg is now generally recognized as an integral component of venous thromboembolic disease with potentially severe consequences. However, the relatively low grades of some current international recommendations and uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of available therapies may prompt questioning of the real need to treat patients with SVT and explain the persisting heterogeneity of their management in practise. Yet several studies have consistently shown high rates of thromboembolic complications associated with SVT, whether at first presentation or during follow-up. The CALISTO trial established for the first time the clinical benefit of a well-defined anticoagulant regimen for the prevention of serious thromboembolic complications in SVT patients, and we believe that patients such as those included in this trial should receive this regimen as tested. However, several areas of uncertainty remain for categories of SVT patients not evaluated in CALISTO.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) ultrasound—follow-up and reporting guidance notes that minor visualization gaps such as inability to visualize a < 3-cm segment are unlikely to be significant, and that normal color flow and normal spectral waveform can help exclude DVT whereas abnormal Doppler should raise clinical suspicion; more compromised studies may require additional evaluation such as d-dimer or follow-up imaging. Follow-up after an initially negative study may be warranted, and persistent or worsening symptoms, high-risk groups, and those with concern for iliocaval DVT may require further evaluation. Follow-up after a positive study may be warranted, with calf vein DVT that is not treated followed weekly, generally up to two weeks, to exclude extension, while acute DVT on treatment does not need short-term follow-up unless change will affect management. Abnormalities in superficial veins and the findings of nonvascular abnormalities should be mentioned in the report, and if a specific diagnosis cannot be made, additional evaluation/imaging may be recommended.

### Incidental deep venous thrombosis diagnosed on lower extremity computed tomography is a rare but clinically impactful finding [^23353025]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The CHEST guidelines provide no recommendations for repeat imaging for patients who have incidentally found DVTs on CT imaging. Historically, contrast venography has been considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of DVT, with visualization of a constant intraluminal filling defect noted in more than one view considered diagnostic of DVT. However, there are risks associated with its invasive nature and the procedure can be a contraindication in patients with significant renal dysfunction, severe contrast allergies, or lower extremity wounds/injuries that limit distal vein cannulation. Finally, inadequate imaging can limit utility with up to 20% of venograms resulting in inadequate or incomplete visualization of the venous segments of interest.As a result, noninvasive modalities, including venous US imaging, have supplanted contrast venography in the diagnosis of DVT. Duplex US imaging provides excellent sensitivity (with the combined use of color Doppler to identify areas of flow deficit and continuous wave Doppler flow to identify up- and downstream flow restriction) and specificity (when compression B-mode is used to assess for areas of incompressibility) for the diagnosis of DVT, though accuracy is better for proximal DVTs as compared with isolated distal DVTs. Based on this evidence, the CHEST guidelines recommend D-dimer or US imaging for workup of DVT in patients with low or moderate clinical suspicion and US imaging for the diagnosis of DVT over contrast venography in patients with high clinical suspicion for DVT. CT or magnetic resonance venography is only recommended as an alternative in patients for whom US imaging is impractical.

In patients with moderate or high clinical suspicion but negative US imaging, high-sensitivity D-dimer or repeat US imaging in 1 week is recommended.However, in the cases where DVT is found on CT imaging of a patient in whom DVT was not suspected, there is no guideline-recommended next step for follow-up testing or repeat imaging. Therefore, clinicians are ultimately tasked with determining the next steps for their patients. As evidenced in this study, this results in an array of imaging pathways and varied outcomes.

For diagnosed DVTs, the CHEST guidelines recommend at least 3 months of anticoagulation for patients with proximal lower extremity DVT, regardless of symptomatology, with the choice of treatment dependent on social, economic, and clinical factors as well as the presence of cancer. The need for further extension depends on clinical factors such as the presence of a provoking event and the patient’s risk profile. In patients with a distal lower extremity DVT, the decision for repeat imaging vs treatment depends on the presence or absence of symptoms.

### Clinical relevance of distal deep vein thrombosis [^a320027a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss pros and cons of anticoagulant treatment in the presence of symptomatic distal deep vein thrombosis.

Recent Findings

Available data are responsible for a lack of consensus regarding treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis.

Summary

One standard diagnostic approach of suspected deep vein thrombosis consists of serial lower limb compression ultrasound of proximal veins. Studies evaluating compression ultrasound limited to the proximal veins performed on two occasions separated by 1 week showed good safety with a pooled estimate of the 3-month thromboembolic events rate of 0.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.9%) in untreated patients. However, performing two lower limbs compression ultrasound is cumbersome and expensive. Recently, studies using a single complete (proximal and distal) compression ultrasound showed a similar pooled estimate of the 3-month thromboembolic risk (0.3%, 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.6%) but distal deep vein thrombosis accounted for as many as 50% of all diagnosed deep vein thrombosis in those series. Comparing these studies may suggest that systematically searching for calf deep vein thrombosis potentially doubles the number of patients given anticoagulant treatment without reducing the 3-month thromboembolic risk. Despite these data, many physicians still search for and treat distal deep vein thrombosis in the fear of proximal extension and of pulmonary embolism. However, robust data in favour of anticoagulation for distal deep vein thrombosis are limited. Randomized trials assessing the usefulness of anticoagulation in distal deep vein thrombosis are therefore urgently needed.

Recurrent lower extremity DVT—initial testing and follow-up strategy: In patients suspected of having recurrent lower extremity DVT, we recommend initial evaluation with proximal CUS or a highly sensitive D-dimer over venography, CT venography, or MRI (all Grade 1B). If the highly sensitive D-dimer is positive, we recommend proximal CUS over venography, CT venography, or MRI (Grade 1B for all comparisons). In patients with suspected recurrent lower extremity DVT in whom initial proximal CUS is negative (normal or residual diameter increase of < 2 mm), we suggest at least one further proximal CUS (day 7 ± 1) or testing with a moderately or highly sensitive D-dimer (followed by repeat CUS [day 7 ± 1] if positive) rather than no further testing or venography (Grade 2B). Remarks note that in patients with an abnormal proximal CUS at presentation that does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of recurrence, an additional proximal CUS on day 2 ± 1 in addition to that on (day 7 ± 1) may be preferred. We recommend that patients with suspected recurrent lower extremity DVT and a negative highly sensitive D-dimer or negative proximal CUS and negative moderately or highly sensitive D-dimer or negative serial proximal CUS undergo no further testing for suspected recurrent DVT rather than venography (Grade 1B). If CUS of the proximal veins is positive, we recommend treating for DVT and performing no further testing over performing confirmatory venography (Grade 1B for the finding of a new noncompressible segment in the common femoral or popliteal vein, Grade 2B for a ≥ 4-mm increase in venous diameter during compression compared with that in the same venous segment on a previous result).

### Is it worth diagnosing and treating distal deep vein thrombosis? No [^6f48238e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The standard diagnostic approach to suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is serial lower limb compression ultrasound (CUS) of proximal veins. Although it only assesses the proximal veins, withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients with a negative CUS on day 1 and after 1 week has been proved safe. In particular, studies evaluating CUS limited to the proximal veins showed a good safety profile with a pooled estimate of the 3-month thromboembolic rate of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4-0.9%) in non-anticoagulated patients. However, performing two lower limbs CUS is cumbersome and expensive. Recently, studies using a unique complete (proximal and distal) CUS showed a similar pooled estimate of the 3-month thromboembolic rate (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6%) but distal DVTs accounted for as many as 50% of all diagnosed DVTs in those series. Comparing these studies may suggest that systematically searching for calf DVTs potentially doubles the number of patients given anticoagulant therapy and entails a risk of over-treatment. Admittedly, performing calf CUS is highly useful in diagnosing other conditions such as popliteal cyst, hematoma or muscle rupture. Performing a CUS limited to the popliteal site in the presence of calf pain may be not well accepted by the patient. However, the advantage of calf CUS in diagnosing venous thromboembolism appears to be at the least debatable. Data suggesting that anticoagulation is indicated for distal DVT are limited, and realizing systematic distal CUS entails a risk of over-treatment. There is an urgent need for randomized trials assessing the usefulness of anticoagulant treatment in distal DVT.

### Improving follow-up of incomplete lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound examinations performed for deep and superficial vein thromboses [^14c53e99]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

A lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound (LEVDUS) examination is the standard diagnostic test to evaluate patients for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, some studies will be incomplete for a variety of reasons, including patient-related factors such as pain, edema, a large leg circumference, or the presence of overlying bandages or orthopedic devices. We previously reported that the frequency of obtaining a follow-up examination after an incomplete and negative (I/N) LEVDUS examination was low but that the rates of DVT found on the follow-up studies of initially I/N LEVDUS studies were similar to the rates of DVT found with initially complete LEVDUS examinations. Therefore, we recommended process improvements to increase follow-up LEVDUS studies after an I/N LEVDUS examination. In the present study, we have described the results of appending a recommendation to obtain a follow-up LEVDUS study to preliminary and final reports of I/N LEVDUS.

Methods

Starting in January 2019 through December 2019, a recommendation to obtain a repeat LEVDUS examination after an I/N study was appended to the preliminary and final reports of all I/N LEVDUS examination of patients who did not, otherwise, have an indication for anticoagulation (group 2). The patients were identified on an ongoing basis through the study period and entered into an Excel database (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Wash). Group 2 was compared with a previously reported historic control cohort of patients identified from January 2017 to December 2017 (group 1). We compared groups 1 and 2 with respect to the frequency of the repeat studies performed within 4 weeks after an I/N LEVDUS examination and the DVT rates found from the follow-up LEVDUS examinations after an I/N LEVDUS study.

Results

Of the patients in groups 1 and 2, 187 and 229 had had I/N LEVDUS examinations, with 28% and 40.2% of group 1 and 2 studies having follow-up LEVDUS examinations (P < .01). Previously unidentified lower extremity thrombi were discovered in 21% of the group 2 follow-up examinations. Also, the rate of new thrombi detected was not different between groups 2 and 1 (historic controls; DVT, 14.3% vs 18.5% [P = .25]; SVT, 6.3% vs 3.3% [P = .15]). A definitive finding of either positive or negative for DVT and SVT with a complete examination in 50% of the group 2 patients with follow-up examinations.

Conclusions

A recommendation to obtain a follow-up examination appended to the preliminary and final I/N LEVDUS reports was associated with an increased rate of follow-up examinations, which revealed many previously undetected DVTs and SVTs or had allowed for definitive exclusion of DVT.

### Management of superficial vein thrombosis [^5338cd81]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is less well studied than deep vein thrombosis (DVT), because it has been considered to be a minor, self-limiting disease that is easily diagnosed on clinical grounds and that requires only symptomatic relief. The most frequently involved sites of the superficial vein system are the lower limbs, especially the saphenous veins, mostly in relation to varicosities. Lower-limb SVT shares the same risk factors as DVT; it can propagate into the deep veins, and have a complicated course with pulmonary embolism. Clinical diagnosis may not be accurate, and ultrasonography is currently indicated for both confirmation and evaluation of SVT extension. Treatment aims are symptom relief and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in relation to the thrombotic burden. SVT of the long saphenous vein within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is considered to be equivalent to a DVT, and thus deserving of therapeutic anticoagulation. Less severe forms of lower-limb SVT not involving the SFJ have been included in randomized clinical trials of surgery, compression hosiery, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, unfractionated heparin, and low molecular weight heparins, with inconclusive results. The largest randomized clinical trial available, on 3004 patients with lower-limb SVT not involving the SFJ, showed that fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily for 6 weeks is more effective than placebo in reducing the risk of the composite of death from any cause and symptomatic VTE (0.9% versus 5.9%). Further studies are needed to define the optimal management strategies for SVT of the lower limbs and other sites, such as the upper limbs.

### Recurrent venous thromboembolism-AAFP (...) [^b3566eec]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with a provoked VTE due to a transient risk factor have only a 3. 3% risk of recurrence in the first year after stopping anticoagulation, whereas patients with an unprovoked VTE have a
10. 3% risk of recurrence. The recurrence risk for patients with provoked VTE does not increase significantly after the first year, but the risk for patients with unprovoked VTE increases more than 30% after 10 years. The location of the VTE is important because a proximal DVT has up to 4. 8 times the risk of recurrence as a distal DVT. 4, 15–17 In one study, patients with VTE of an iliac vein had twice the risk of recurrence as those with VTE in femoral or distal locations. 15 In a meta-analysis of patients with an initial VTE, patients with a distal DVT had only a 1. 9% risk of recurrence in the first year after stopping anticoagulation. 4 The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in patients who have a central PE compared with a noncentral PE.
18.

Elevated d-dimer levels posttreatment in unprovoked VTE predict an increased recurrence risk. 16 A study evaluating patients with unprovoked VTE found that those with low d-dimer levels three weeks after completing anticoagulation therapy had a 3. 7% probability of recurrence in two years, whereas those with high levels had an
11. 5% probability of recurrence.
19. Evaluation for Thrombophilia Guidelines recommend against testing for thrombophilia in patients with provoked VTE and discourage routine testing in those with unprovoked VTE. 10, 26–28 The presence of one thrombophilic condition confers a 1. 4-fold increased risk of recurrent VTE, and the risk is higher with homozygous factor V Leiden mutations and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. 26–28 Routine testing for thrombophilia has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. 27, 28.

According to the 2016 CHEST guidelines, no further anticoagulation therapy after the initial three months of treatment is recommended for patients with VTE provoked by transient risk factors.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 venous thromboembolism (VTE) diagnosis guidelines—Ten recommendations are presented, by pretest probability (PTP) for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and for recurrent VTE and upper extremity DVT. Modern diagnostic strategies for VTE incorporate PTP assessment, and the ability of diagnostic tests to correctly identify or exclude VTE is influenced by PTP, prevalence and test accuracy characteristics. For patients at low (unlikely) VTE risk, using D-dimer as the initial test reduces the need for diagnostic imaging, whereas for patients at high (likely) VTE risk, imaging is warranted. For PE diagnosis, ventilation-perfusion scanning and computed tomography pulmonary angiography are the most validated tests, whereas lower or upper extremity DVT diagnosis uses ultrasonography.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^d6b15317]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The appropriate anticoagulation duration for patients with recurrent provoked VTE is less well defined. The ACCP guidelines make no specific distinction between a single episode of provoked VTE and several episodes of provoked VTE.Unprovoked patients are classified as isolated or recurrent and then stratified by bleeding risk, with those of high bleeding risk receiving 3 months of anticoagulation and those of low and moderate bleeding risk receiving extended anticoagulation.The ASH guidelines stratify patients by whether the patient's prior VTE was in the setting of a transient risk factor, recommending 3 to 6 months in duration of anticoagulation if the prior VTE was provoked by a transient risk factor and indefinite anticoagulation if the prior VTE was without a transient risk factor.In our study, 105 patients had recurrent VTE. The lack of specific guidance from the ACCP guidelines about recurrent provoked VTE could encourage providers to manage all patients with recurrent VTE by the unprovoked recurrent VTE guidelines. Alternatively, prolonged anticoagulation could reflect clinician‐perceived increased risk of thrombosis, despite the ACCP guidelines recommending the same duration of anticoagulation if the second VTE is provoked. Regardless, most of the patients in our study did not have recurrent VTE; however, most patients in our study received prolonged anticoagulation. It could also reflect gray areas such as a residual swollen leg, evidence of chronic DVT on ultrasound, and persistently positive D‐dimer after 3 months of anticoagulation. The guidelines are unclear about the optimal management of such challenging clinical scenarios. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to determine appropriate anticoagulation practices in these patient populations. Future research will also be needed to evaluate anticoagulation in patients with recurrent VTE, particularly given the differing metrics used to guide the ACCP and ASH recommendations.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^5d79265a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### Residual venous thrombosis as a predictive factor of recurrent venous thromboembolism [^8c515fdc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimum duration of anticoagulant therapy after an episode of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is controversial. Contributing to the controversy is uncertainty about whether residual venous thrombosis, as assessed by repeated ultrasonography over time, increases the risk for recurrent thromboembolism.

Objective

To determine the risk for recurrent thromboembolism in patients who have persistent residual thrombosis compared with patients who have early vein recanalization.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

A university hospital in Padua, Italy.

Patients

313 consecutive symptomatic outpatients with proximal DVT who received conventional short-term anticoagulation.

Measurements

Ultrasonographic assessment of the common femoral and popliteal veins was performed 3 months after acute DVT in all patients and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months in patients found to have residual venous thrombosis. Veins were considered recanalized if they were 2.0 mm or less in diameter on a single test or 3.0 mm or less in diameter on two consecutive tests. Recurrent thromboembolism was assessed during a 6-year period.

Results

The cumulative incidence of normal results on ultrasonography was 38.8% at 6 months, 58.1% at 12 months, 69.3% at 24 months, and 73.8% at 36 months. Of 58 recurrent episodes, 41 occurred while the patient had residual thrombosis. The hazard ratio for recurrent thromboembolism was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.3 to 4.4; P = 0.004) for patients with persistent residual thrombosis versus those with early vein recanalization.

Conclusions

Residual venous thrombosis is an important risk factor for recurrent thromboembolism. Ultrasonographic assessment of residual venous thrombosis may help clinicians modify the duration of anticoagulation in patients with DVT.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^a983cd81]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the association between the duration of systemic anticoagulation therapy (ACT) and the risk of further venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with superficial venous thrombosis (SVT).

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using searches of Medline and Cochrane Library databases in September 2023. Papers that provided VTE incidence within mid-term follow-up of ≥45 days in patients who received any ACT were included. Patients were categorized into subgroups according to the course of treatment: (1) no ACT (0 days); (2) ACT of ≤14 days; (3) ACT of 15 to 30 days; (4) ACT of 31 to 45 days; and (5) ACT of >45 days. Reported events were transformed to events per 100 patient-years, and a random-effects model was used to calculate pooled rates for proportions. The primary outcome (VTE) was a combination of SVT progression or recurrence with the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Secondary outcomes included major and clinically relevant non-major or minor bleeding.

Results

Twenty-four studies (10 randomized controlled trials and 14 cohort studies) combining outcomes in 12,341 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Minimum VTE and SVT recurrence or progression rates were observed with the ACT duration of 31 to 45 days of 16.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4-23.3) and 8.2 (95% CI, 3.1-15.8) events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Minimum DVT and PE rates observed with the treatment duration of 15 to 30 days were 5.5 (95% CI, 2.8-9.1) and 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5-1.3) events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Short-term treatment of ≤14 days was associated with the highest rates of VTE of 59.7 (95% CI, 37.7-86.4), DVT of 13.7 (95% CI, 9.6-18.4), and PE of 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4-5.6) events per 100 patient-years. Major bleeding rates were unrelated to the duration of ACT and did not exceed 0.5 events per 100 patient-years. The highest rate of clinically relevant non-major or minor bleeding was observed with ACT duration of 31 to 45 days of 14.2 (95% CI, 5.5-26.8) events per 100 patient-years. The most common risk factors for VTE included male sex, cancer, personal history of DVT, PE, or SVT, and thrombosis of non-varicose veins.

Conclusions

Prolonged systemic anticoagulation is associated with the tendency to decrease VTE rates in patients with lower limb SVT.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Varicose vein procedures—management of procedure-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ablation-related thrombus extension (ARTE) includes graded recommendations as follows. For acute isolated distal DVT without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension, we suggest serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks (Grade of recommendation: 2 [weak]; Quality of Evidence: B [moderate]). For isolated distal DVT with severe symptoms or risk factors for extension, we suggest anticoagulation (Grade 2 [weak]; Quality C [low to very low]). For acute proximal DVT after varicose vein procedure, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist) (Grade 1 [strong]; Quality B [moderate]). For symptomatic ARTE after endovenous ablation, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist) (Grade 1 [strong]; Quality C [low to very low]).

### Superficial venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism: a large, prospective epidemiologic study [^2f6623df]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) is perceived to have a benign prognosis.

Objective

To assess the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in patients with SVT and to determine the 3-month incidence of thromboembolic complications.

Design

National cross-sectional and prospective epidemiologic cohort study. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00818688)

Setting

French office- and hospital-based vascular medicine specialists.

Patients

844 consecutive patients with symptomatic SVT of the lower limbs that was at least 5 cm on compression ultrasonography.

Measurements

Incidence of venous thromboembolism and extension or recurrence of SVT in patients with isolated SVT at presentation.

Results

Among 844 patients with SVT at inclusion (median age, 65 years; 547 women), 210 (24.9%) also had deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Among 600 patients without DVT or pulmonary embolism at inclusion who were eligible for 3-month follow-up, 58 (10.2%) developed thromboembolic complications at 3 months (pulmonary embolism, 3 [0.5%]; DVT, 15 [2.8%]; extension of SVT, 18 [3.3%]; and recurrence of SVT, 10 [1.9%]), despite 540 patients (90.5%) having received anticoagulants. Risk factors for complications at 3 months were male sex, history of DVT or pulmonary embolism, previous cancer, and absence of varicose veins.

Limitation

The findings are from a specialist referral setting, and the study was terminated before the target patient population was reached because of slow recruitment.

Conclusion

A substantial number of patients with SVT exhibit venous thromboembolism at presentation, and some that do not can develop this complication in the subsequent 3 months.

### Effect of anticoagulant therapy for 6 weeks vs 3 months on recurrence and bleeding events in patients younger than 21 years of age with provoked venous thromboembolism: the kids-DOTT randomized clinical trial [^9bd17518]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among patients younger than 21 years of age, the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism is unknown.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that a 6-week duration of anticoagulant therapy for provoked venous thromboembolism is noninferior to a conventional 3-month therapy duration in patients younger than 21 years of age.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial involving 417 patients younger than 21 years of age with acute, provoked venous thromboembolism enrolled at 42 centers in 5 countries from 2008-2021. The main exclusions were severe anticoagulant deficiencies or prior venous thromboembolism. Patients without persistent antiphospholipid antibodies and whose thrombi were resolved or not completely occlusive upon repeat imaging at 6 weeks after diagnosis underwent randomization. The final visit for the primary end points occurred in January 2021.

Interventions

Total duration for anticoagulant therapy of 6 weeks (n=207) vs 3 months (n=210) for provoked venous thromboembolism.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy and safety end points were centrally adjudicated symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding events within 1 year blinded to treatment group. The primary analysis was noninferiority in the per-protocol population. The noninferiority boundary incorporated a bivariate trade-off that included an absolute increase of 0% in symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism with an absolute risk reduction of 4% in clinically relevant bleeding events (1 of 3 points on the bivariate noninferiority boundary curve).

Results

Among 417 randomized patients, 297 (median age, 8.3 [range, 0.04-20.9] years; 49% female) met criteria for the primary per-protocol population analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 1-year cumulative incidence of the primary efficacy outcome was 0.66% (95% CI, 0%-1.95%) in the 6-week anticoagulant therapy group and 0.70% (95% CI, 0%-2.07%) in the 3-month anticoagulant therapy group, and for the primary safety outcome, the incidence was 0.65% (95% CI, 0%-1.91%) and 0.70% (95% CI, 0%-2.06%). Based on absolute risk differences in recurrent venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding events between groups, noninferiority was demonstrated. Adverse events occurred in 26% of patients in the 6-week anticoagulant therapy group and in 32% of patients in the 3-month anticoagulant therapy group; the most common adverse event was fever (1.9% and 3.4%, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients younger than 21 years of age with provoked venous thromboembolism, anticoagulant therapy for 6 weeks compared with 3 months met noninferiority criteria based on the trade-off between recurrent venous thromboembolism risk and bleeding risk.

Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction—post‑stent follow‑up: After iliac vein stent placement, close clinical follow‑up should be performed to ensure compliance with antithrombotic therapy and fully therapeutic anticoagulation, to monitor for bleeding and symptom response, to enable timely intervention to restore patency in patients who develop recurrent symptoms, and to monitor for late stent complications (Level of Evidence C, Strength of Recommendation Strong). Device‑specific complications should be reported into central registries (eg, MAUDE database), standardized assessment scales may aid in gauging clinical change, patients with residual symptoms should continue conservative therapies (especially compression therapy) and, if appropriate, management of superficial venous valvular reflux, compliance with antithrombotic therapy should be reinforced at the procedure day and follow‑up visits, patients should be educated and encouraged to report symptoms that may prompt suspicion for bleeding, recurrent VTE (including stent occlusion), and device‑related complications, and the utility of routine surveillance imaging versus clinically driven imaging is unclear.

### Update on the lower extremity venous ultrasonography examination [^2300e3a3]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Lower extremity venous ultrasonography is an accurate method to diagnose acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Recurrent DVT is often difficult diagnosis. The decision to order ultrasonography can be based on pretest risk assessment. If the ultrasonography study is negative, the report may recommend follow-up for patients whose clinical condition changes or for patients with specific risks. Lower extremity venous ultrasonography is the gold standard for diagnosis of DVT. It is accurate and objective, and because the clinical assessment of patients is limited and its potential complication, pulmonary embolism, is significant, the impact of a positive and negative test is high.

### Prospective study of venous thromboembolism in patients with head and neck cancer after surgery [^aabb2f6b]. JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in surgery patients, but little data exist on the incidence of VTE in head and neck cancer surgical patients.

Objective

To determine the incidence of VTE in postoperative patients with head and neck cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients hospitalized at a tertiary care academic surgical center who underwent surgery to treat head and neck cancer. Routine chemoprophylaxis was not used. On postoperative day (POD) 2 or 3, participants received clinical examination and duplex ultrasonographic evaluation (US). Participants with negative findings on clinical examination and US were followed up clinically; participants with evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) were given therapeutic anticoagulation. Participants with superficial VTE underwent repeated US on POD 4, 5, or 6. Participants were monitored for 30 days after surgery.

Main Outcome and Measure

Total number of new cases of VTE (superficial and deep) identified within 30 days of surgery and confirmed on diagnostic imaging.

Results

Of the 111 participants enrolled, 11 withdrew before completing the study; thus, 100 participants were included. The overall incidence of VTE was 13%. Eight participants were identified with clinically significant VTE: 7 DVT and 1 PE. An additional 5 participants had asymptomatic lower extremity superficial VTE detected on US alone. Fourteen percent of patients received some form of postoperative anticoagulation therapy; the rate of bleeding complications in these patients (30.1%) was higher than that in patients without anticoagulation therapy (5.6%) (P = .01).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hospitalized patients with head and neck cancer not routinely receiving anticoagulation therapy after surgery have an increased risk of VTE. Bleeding complications are elevated in patients receiving postoperative anticoagulation.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Different approaches have been suggested to treat lower limb SVT. Topical agents, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, heparinoids, elastic compression, and surgical intervention aim to reduce the symptoms of inflammation and prevent further VTE due to SVT extension into deep veins and to prevent the occurrence of new DVT and PE. Systemic anticoagulation appeared to be the most protective for VTE in thrombosis length of >5 cm., In the case of smaller thrombus, local cold, topical agents, NSAIDs, and elastic compression are indicated without systemic anticoagulation.,,,VTE threat increases if thrombus length is more than 5 cm, predominantly if it is localized above the knee or near the connection with deep veins. Studies on systemic anticoagulation included primarily patients with extensive SVT not reaching the junction. However, those with thrombus located within a 3 to 5 cm near junction were generally excluded, so the best treatment approach for them is not established (Supplementary Table I, online only). The current guidelines empirically equate such SVT with proximal DVT and suggest full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation for 6 to 12 weeks. However, a recent analysis of the RIETE registry by Prandoni et al did not find any differences between full therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation that was administrated predominantly for 12 weeks in patients with SVT within 3 cm near a junction (the study was considered ineligible due to the absence of separate outcomes for different treatment durations).

Thereby, systemic anticoagulation, as evaluated in the current systematic review, corresponds to extensive SVT with a length of >5 cm, not reaching the junction by 3 to 5 cm (Supplementary Table I, online only). The previous meta-analyses focused on the type and doses of anticoagulation but not on duration. The authors did not find any significant differences between low (prophylactic) and high (intermediate or therapeutic) doses of LMWH while judging subcutaneous fondaparinux at 2.5 mg for 45 days as the best treatment associated with the lowest rate of VTE. This conclusion was based on the results of the largest randomized controlled trial CALISTO and insights from a few cohort trials., However, the comparison of fondaparinux with LMWH or other anticoagulants does not consider treatment duration. In most trials, LMWH was used for a short period of ≤14 or 15 to 30 days.

Results

Search results

The initial search identified 20,499 records, and two additional papers were found by screening the reference lists of related articles. Only 24 were eligible and combined for the analysis (Supplementary Fig 1, online only). The quantitative synthesis included 10 randomized controlled trials,,,,,,,,,,and 14 cohort studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,containing data on 13,194 patients who received different treatments. The study by Karathanos et al was duplicated: the earlier paper represented a separate analysis of different outcomes (SVT progression or recurrence, DVT, and PE) according to the duration of anticoagulation, whereas the latest extended version allowed extraction of only combined results on VTE. So, both versions were included in the analysis of different outcomes. The results of the INSIGHTS-SVT trial were also published in two papers, but the latest one with extended follow-up was included.

### Two weeks of low molecular weight heparin for isolated symptomatic distal vein thrombosis (TWISTER study) [^dc9fcd98]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of low-risk patients with isolated symptomatic distal deep vein thrombi (IDDVT) is uncertain.

Objective

assess whether two weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation is efficacious/safe for IDDVT.

Primary Outcome

symptomatic three-month venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence in the two-week anticoagulation group. Secondary outcomes included post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and bleeding.

Methods

Prospective multicentre cohort study. Consecutive low-risk IDDVT patients enrolled within 72 h of diagnosis and treated with therapeutic dose enoxaparin or rivaroxaban. At two weeks, patients had repeat complete whole leg compression ultrasound (CUS)/clinical review. If resolution of leg symptoms AND no radiological evidence of thrombus extension, anticoagulation was stopped. If ongoing symptoms and/or radiographic extension within distal veins, anticoagulation was continued for four more weeks. Patients with extension into the popliteal vein on two-week ultrasound were treated off-study. Patients were reviewed at three and six months.

Findings/Interpretation

241 eligible patients received ≥2 weeks anticoagulation. 167/241 (69%) were assigned to the 2-week anticoagulation group; 71/241 (30%) to the six-week anticoagulation group; 3/241 patients (1%) had extension into the popliteal vein on two-week CUS. Two patients in the two-week anticoagulation group had symptomatic IDDVT recurrence in ≤3 months; VTE recurrence 2/156; 1.3%(95% CI 0.05-4.85%). 69% of patients had complete resolution of symptoms within two weeks. Six-month PTS rates were 8/184, 4.4%(95% CI 2.1-8.5%). No major bleeding was reported. Our findings suggest it's safe/efficacious to stop therapeutic anticoagulation at two weeks in low-risk IDDVT patients with resolution of symptoms/no extension on ultrasound. This could replace 6-12 weeks of anticoagulation for ambulatory, low-risk IDDVT patients.

### Appropriateness of care in superficial venous disease [^5bb4db20]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic superficial venous disease, including superficial venous insufficiency, superficial venous thrombosis, and aneurysms, are prevalent conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. With chronic venous insufficiency specifically, the advent of office-based minimally invasive procedures in recent decades has significantly expanded access to outpatient treatment. However, as venous insufficiency is rarely life- or limb-threatening, the clinical diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment indications should be considered carefully when recommending elective intervention. Appropriateness of care guidelines intend to aid providers and patients in the decision-making process, based on the available evidence in the scientific literature, to select the best care for the patient when treating their superficial venous disease.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we chose an alternative approach and combined different types and doses of anticoagulation according to the duration of treatment. An apparent tendency toward VTE risk reduction with prolonged therapy was observed. Treatment for 15 to 30 and 31 to 45 days was associated with the lowest rates of VTE. However, this rate was relatively high, particularly in terms of SVT progression or recurrence and DVT. Our findings are similar to the results of the previous meta-analysis by Duffet et al, who found that prolonged use of LMWH may reduce the event rate of DVT and PE from 18.3 (95% CI, 8.3-31.1) events per 100 patient-years with the treatment duration less than 30 days to 10.0 (95% CI, 5.3-16.1) events per 100 patient-years with the course of 30 to 42 days.However, the results of the SURPRISE trial suggest that 45 days of anticoagulation may not be enough for patients at high risk of VTE.Within 45 days after treatment cessation, the incidence of VTE increased from 3% to 7% and 2% to 7% in groups of rivaroxaban and fondaparinux, respectively. Unfortunately, we could not find any strong evidence of prolonged treatment lasting more than 45 days to be used in quantitative synthesis. Karathanos et al reported the use of LMWH up to 200 days with a mean duration of 30 days.Actually, less than one-half of patients continued treatment after 30 days, and only 1.2% continued after 90 days. The authors did not find any difference in the outcomes between subgroups of patients treated for less and more than 30 days. However, this study of real clinical practice was biased, and prolonged treatment was prescribed for patients at a higher risk, particularly those with a history of DVT and thrombus location above the knee.

### Ultrasound for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis: multidisciplinary recommendations from the society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference [^83c8a3e6]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Venous ultrasound is the standard imaging test for patients suspected of having acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). There is variability and disagreement among authoritative groups regarding the necessary components of the test. Some protocols include scanning the entire lower extremity, whereas others recommend scans limited to the thigh and knee supplemented with serial testing. Some protocols use gray-scale ultrasound alone, whereas others include Doppler interrogation. Point-of-care ultrasound is recommended in some settings, and there is heterogeneity of these protocols as well. Heterogeneity of recommendations can lead to errors including incorrect application of guidelines, confusion among requesting physicians, and incorrect follow-up. In October 2016, the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to evaluate the current evidence to develop recommendations regarding ultrasound protocols for DVT and the terminology used to communicate results to clinicians. Recommendations were made after open discussion and by unanimous consensus.The panel recommends a comprehensive duplex ultrasound protocol from thigh to ankle with Doppler at selected sites rather than a limited or complete compression-only examination. This protocol is currently performed in many facilities and is achievable with standard ultrasound equipment and personnel. The use of these recommendations will increase the diagnosis of calf DVT and provide better data to explain the presenting symptoms. The panel recommends a single point-of-care protocol that minimizes underdiagnoses of proximal DVT.The panel recommends the term chronic postthrombotic change to describe the residual material that persists after the acute presentation of DVT to avoid potential overtreatment of prior thrombus.Adoption of a single standardized comprehensive duplex ultrasound and a single point-of-care examination will enhance patient safety and clinicians' confidence.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^daed83a8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) management for post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) prevention—risk markers and thrombolysis are described as follows: an randomized controlled trial showed that if D-dimer remains elevated after stopping anticoagulation, recurrence risk is significantly elevated (~2.5-fold) and continuation or reinstitution of anticoagulation is recommended, usually for life, whereas if D-dimer is normal, cessation is usually safe. Duplex ultrasonography evidence indicates residual venous abnormalities carry recurrence risks varying from 2.5- to 9.7-fold, and if a patient has an extensively irregular or occluded long venous segment, continued anticoagulation may be beneficial. For iliofemoral DVT, adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis in the CaVeNT trial yielded an absolute risk reduction at 24 months of 14.4% (2%-28%) in PTS reduction, but several occurrences of major bleeding occurred; in properly selected patients, the benefit of catheter-directed thrombolysis outweighs the risks.

4.2 Strengths and limitations

Our NMA synthesized data from 6857 participants in 13 randomized trials. This represents a large, methodologically robust data set across multiple settings used to simultaneously estimate of relative treatment effects.

Our analysis was inevitably limited by the primary data. The variety of settings and patient groups may be a strength, but generated evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across studies for many of the outcomes. Previous work has shown evidence of publication bias such that studies with nonsignificant or unfavorable results on this topic are perhaps less likely to be published, have a delay to publication, or involve selectively reporting outcomes. 39 These issues have the potential to exaggerate any benefit to the intervention seen at NMA.

The studies were judged mainly to have low risk of bias or some concerns only for most quality criteria. However, three trials were judged as having a high risk of bias on the basis of outcome ascertainment being potentially subject to bias in an open‐label trial. 27, 30, 31 This is particularly relevant to the issue of symptomatic VTE as an outcome. Several of these open‐label trials performed routine sonographic screening on removal of plaster cast, followed by clinical assessment. This methodology introduces a high risk of bias with symptomatic VTE outcomes; patients may have been influenced by the sonographer, or party to the ultrasound results before disclosing information on symptomatology. A sensitivity analysis excluding these studies generally had negligible impact on the estimates of treatment effect but, as expected, tended to increase uncertainty. This analysis does not take into account that several of the clinical events were likely not representative for events that would lead a patient to actively seek medical assistance (i.e. truly symptomatic events). This is reflected in the highly varying risks between studies found in Table 3. A further breakdown of symptomatic VTE outcomes is provided in Table S5 for transparency.

### Tibial vein thrombosis after foam sclerotherapy: a single-institution case series [^51991597]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

• Type of Research: Retrospective cohort study
• Key Findings: Of 54 patients, tibial thrombus management included antiplatelet therapy (55%), anticoagulation (26%), or observation (20%). At final follow-up (median 35 days), thrombus resolved in 53%, decreased in 20%, and remained stable in 27% of patients without enlargement or propagation. Symptom resolution was achieved in 87% of patients, with no significant differences between management strategies.
• Take Home Message: Tibial deep vein thromboses after foam sclerotherapy demonstrate a benign clinical course regardless of management strategy.

Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is a commonly used treatment modality for symptomatic superficial venous disease and is typically well tolerated with low complication rates.,,Contact of the sclerosant leads to endothelial damage, thereby initiating vasospasm and thrombosis. This is absorbed over time and leads to transformation of the treated vein into a fibrous cord.Common local adverse effects include hyperpigmentation, pain, or superficial thrombophlebitis, whereas known systemic adverse events include transient ischemic attack, visual disturbances, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVT is uncommon, with reported incidence ranging from <0.5% to 6%,,,in some series. Higher incidence is seen with distal varicosities, lower-leg veins, and when ≥10 cc of sclerosant is used.

Proximal DVTs are defined as those involving the popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins, and the standard treatment is anticoagulation.Conversely, treatment for acute distal DVTs after sclerotherapy is less clear. Clinical practice guidelines have proposed guidelines, but the recommendations are weak, with only moderate-quality evidence to support observation and serial imaging.Specifically for tibial DVTs that develop in the setting of endovenous ablation, incidence is low, and therefore, there has been limited research on the natural progression of these thrombi. As a result, the clinical implication of these provoked calf DVTs, including propagation or embolization risk, remains unclear. Consequently, current management strategies vary considerably, including patient surveillance with ultrasound, anticoagulation, or antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, it is unclear how to optimally manage patients who develop provoked tibial DVTs in the setting of foam sclerotherapy.

### Validating the HERDOO2 rule to guide treatment duration for women with unprovoked venous thrombosis: multinational prospective cohort management study [^4e1cc41a]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a prospective multinational cohort management study of patients with a first unprovoked VTE event who were included after 5-12 months of anticoagulant treatment. Women were classified as low risk if they had none or one of the four HERDOO2 criteria (fig 1). Women who met two or more criteria and all men were classified as high risk. Per protocol, low risk patients were to discontinue anticoagulants (intervention arm), whereas anticoagulant management in high risk patients was left to the discretion of the clinicians and patients (observation arm). Participants were then followed for one year for recurrent VTE and major bleeding. All patients provided written informed consent before participation.

Study participants and setting

Consecutive unselected patients at 44 secondary and tertiary care centres in seven countries (see supplementary appendix) were asked to participate if they had a first episode of major, symptomatic, objectively proved unprovoked VTE 5-12 months before enrolment (referred to as the index VTE). Index VTE was defined as unprovoked, in line with other studies,in the absence of the following major VTE provoking factors: leg fracture or lower extremity plaster cast, immobilisation for more than three days, major surgery in the three months before the index VTE event, and no diagnosis of a malignancy in the past five years (with the exception of localised skin malignancy). Patients with malignancy arising after diagnosis of index VTE but before enrolment were not eligible for inclusion. Patients with previous episodes of provoked VTE were eligible. Index VTE associated with minor or weak risk factors such as travel, exogenous oestrogen, minor immobilisation, or minor surgery was considered unprovoked as it is unclear if the risk of recurrence in “weakly provoked” VTE is low enough to discontinue anticoagulants.Objective confirmation of index major VTE comprised either deep vein thrombosis demonstrated with a non-compressible segment in the popliteal vein or more proximal leg veins on compression venous ultrasonography and/or pulmonary embolism demonstrated on a high probability perfusion scanor a segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery filling defect on computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography. Index VTE had to have been managed for 5-12 months with an appropriate anticoagulant treatment, including initial treatment with either unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, rivaroxaban, or apixaban, followed by 5-12 months of oral anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists (target international normalised ratio 2-3), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.

### Incidental deep venous thrombosis diagnosed on lower extremity computed tomography is a rare but clinically impactful finding [^84552a98]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

• Type of Research: Single-institution retrospective study
• Key Findings: Among 16,637 contrasted computed tomography (CT) studies of the lower extremity, 37 identified a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However, only 13 patients had truly incidental DVTs (10-year incidence of 0.08%). Of these 13 patients, 3 were initiated on anticoagulation based on CT findings; 2 of these patients had no complications, whereas 1 experienced major bleeding complications, requiring additional procedures.
• Take Home Message: Incidental diagnoses of DVT by contrasted lower extremity CT are rare but may negatively affect patient outcomes. Confirmatory studies may be beneficial after incidental DVT diagnosis, but additional investigation with larger multicenter studies is needed to provide evidence for guideline development.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), the condition comprising deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), remains a relatively common and life-threatening medical condition.The United States Centers for Disease Control estimates that 900,000 people per year are diagnosed with a PE and/or DVT with VTE causing 60 to 100,000 deaths annually. The diagnosis of either DVT or PE often warrants reflex workup for the other, as approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with DVT are then found to have PE and approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with PE are then found to have DVT.Although most of the mortality directly associated with VTE is due to PE, DVT is not a benign disease. Six percent of patients diagnosed with DVT die within the first month of diagnosis, signifying both the risk for progression to destabilizing PE and the tenuous health of many patients diagnosed with DVT.Patients with DVT can also have significant morbidity, with one-third of patients developing post-thrombotic syndrome.DVT diagnosis and treatment are also associated with significant health care costs ranging between $5 and $8 billion per year or approximately $20,000 per patient in the United States.Central (iliofemoral) DVT remains especially concerning due to its propensity for causing clinically significant PE and post-thrombotic syndrome. However, even in peripheral (calf) DVTs, there is an approximately 20% risk for proximal propagation and a 50% likelihood of concurrent PE diagnosis.Therefore, the initiation of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients diagnosed with DVT is paramount.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^fc843195]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The minimal VTE incidence was observed in prolonged anticoagulation of 31 to 45 days (16.2; 95% CI, 10.4-23.3 per 100 patient-years) followed by treatment of 15 to 30 days (25.4; 95% CI, 16.3-36.6 per 100 patient-years). The lowest rates of secondary outcomes were also observed in these groups with a minimum incidence of SVT progression and recurrence for the treatment of 31 to 45 days (8.2; 95% CI, 3.1-15.8 per 100 patient-years) and the lowest rate of DVT (5.5; 95% CI, 2.8-9.1 per 100 patient-years) and PE (0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.3 per 100 patient-years) for the treatment of 15 to 30 days. The rates of major bleeding were similar in both groups and did not differ from the pooled estimates of all studies, whereas the rate of CRNM or minor bleeding was the highest with anticoagulation of 31 to 45 days (14.2; 95% CI, 5.5-26.8 per 100 patient-years).

Only one study assessed treatment duration of more than 45 days with event rates of VTE, SVT, DVT, and PE of 141, 118, 24, and 0 per 100 patient-years, respectively, without any information on bleeding.These figures appeared to be much higher compared with others due to a limited number of patients and a short follow-up period.

The risk factors for VTE development within the follow-up period were also extracted from the relevant studies and presented in Table IV. One additional trial from the full-text analysis that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria (did not clarify the duration of anticoagulation) reported the risk factors, and the data from the STEFLUX trial were published separately. The most common (represented in ≥3 studies) factors that increased the VTE risk by 2 to 3 times were male sex, cancer, personal history of DVT, PE, and/or SVT, and thrombosis of non-varicose veins.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to duration of anticoagulation, provoked thrombosis, ESVS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider continuing anticoagulation beyond 3 months with periodic reassessments in selected patients with provoked proximal DVT and a minor transient risk factor, after evaluation of thrombotic and bleeding risks.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^555a274c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

In the current meta-analysis, the treatment duration of ≤14 days was associated with the highest rate of VTE, which was even higher than that with no anticoagulation. These findings may be biased by large cohort trials, where patients without estimated risk did not develop VTE despite the absence of systemic anticoagulation. It can be assumed that most of them had a limited SVT without additional VTE risk factors in contrast with other trials where individuals with higher VTE risk were treated with short-term anticoagulation. Like in DVT treatment, limited anticoagulation for SVT may be insufficient to control hypercoagulation and prevent VTE recurrence.

Combining the results of the previous analyses based on type or dose indicates that the actual efficacy of the treatment with LMWH may be underestimated. Notably, in cohort trials by Rabe et al and Blin et al, fondaparinux showed superiority over LMWH. However, the mean duration of therapy with fondaparinux was 35 ± 16 and 34 ± 8 days, respectively, compared with 26 ± 23 and 19 ± 27 days for LMWH, respectively.

Outcome measures

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pooled proportions of PTS, VTE recurrence, and bleeding complications in a population of patients with UEVT stratified by the type of anticoagulant treatment, presence of cancer, and presence of an upper limb CVC. Unprovoked UEVT was defined by the absence of a catheter, cancer, or recent surgery. The outcome measures were recurrent VTE objectively confirmed by imaging, PTS, and bleeding events.

PTS in the individual studies was defined by the investigators according to the clinical assessment and using the modified Villalta scale (score ≥4) when it was reported. PTS was evaluated at the completion of follow-up. VTE recurrence was defined as a new UEVT in a previously unaffected venous segment, a new pulmonary embolism, or new lower limb deep vein thrombosis proven by computed tomography and/or ultrasound. Major, minor, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events were analyzed when reported using the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

The following data were extracted using predesigned forms: number of patients, study characteristics, follow-up duration, UEVT etiology, cancer, presence of a CVC, type of treatment, recurrent VTE, PTS, and bleeding complications during anticoagulant therapy. All clinical outcomes were extracted for the overall study population and for patient subgroups.

Assessment of study quality

The risk of bias was assessed by two independent investigators (O.E. and A.R.). The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool, version 2, and an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used for the randomized control trials and observational studies, respectively, For observational cohort studies, the risk of bias was determined for three categories: selection, comparability, and outcome. For observational case-control studies, three similar categories—selection, comparability, and exposure—were assessed.

### Superficial vein thrombosis and recurrent venous thromboembolism: a pooled analysis of two observational studies [^ea80b130]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The management strategies for symptomatic isolated superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) (without concomitant deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]) have yet to achieve widespread consensus. Concerns have been raised regarding the usefulness of prescribing anticoagulant treatments to all patients with isolated SVT. Determining the isolated SVT subgroups who have the highest risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence (composite of DVT, PE, and new SVT) may facilitate the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from anticoagulant treatment.

Design and Methods

We performed a pooled analysis on individual data from two observational, multicenter, prospective studies, to determine predictors for VTE recurrence and their impact in an unselected population of symptomatic isolated SVT patients.

Results

One thousand and seventy-four cases of symptomatic isolated SVT were followed up at 3 months. VTE recurrence was observed in 3.9% of the patients; 16.2% of the patients did not receive anticoagulants, and 0.6% experienced a VTE recurrence. Cancer, personal history of VTE and saphenofemoral/popliteal involvement significantly increased the risk of subsequent VTE or DVT/PE in univariate analyses. Only male sex significantly increased the risk of VTE or DVT/PE recurrence in multivariate analyses. Twelve percent of the patients had cancer or saphenofemoral junction involvement, and were at higher risk of DVT/PE recurrence than patients without those characteristics (4.7% vs. 1.9%, P= 0.06).

Conclusions

In patients with symptomatic SVT, only male sex significantly and independently increased the risk of VTE recurrence. Cancer or saphenofemoral junction involvement defined a population at high risk for deep VTE recurrence. Some SVTs might be safely managed without anticoagulants.

### Clinical course of patients with symptomatic isolated superficial vein thrombosis: the ICARO follow-up study [^34d3d366]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials Late sequelae of isolated superficial vein thrombosis (iSVT) have rarely been investigated. We studied 411 consecutive outpatients with acute iSVT with a median follow-up of three years. Male sex and cancer are risk factors for future deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients without cancer appear to be at a negligible risk for death.

Summary

Background Studies of long-term thromboembolic complications and death following acute isolated superficial vein thrombosis (iSVT) of the lower extremities are scarce. Objectives To investigate the course of iSVT in the setting of an observational multicenter study. Methods We collected longitudinal data of 411 consecutive outpatients with acute, symptomatic, objectively diagnosed iSVT who were previously included in the cross-sectional ICARO study. Four patients followed for < 30 days and 79 with concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) were excluded from the present analysis. The primary outcome was symptomatic DVT or PE. The safety outcomes were major bleeding and all-cause death. Results The median follow-up time was 1026 days (interquartile range 610-1796). Symptomatic DVT/PE occurred in 52 (12.9%) patients, giving annualized rates of 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-3.9%) on anticoagulant treatment and 4.4% (95% CI 3.2-5.8%) off anticoagulant treatment. Male sex (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 [95% CI 1.16-3.54]) and active solid cancer (adjusted HR 3.14 [95% CI 1.11-8.93]) were associated with future DVT/PE, whereas prior DVT/PE failed to show significance, most likely because of bias resulting from prolonged anticoagulant treatment. Three major bleeding events occurred on treatment, giving an annualized rate of 1.4% (95 CI 0.3-4.0%). Death was recorded in 16 patients (annualized rate: 1.1% [95% CI 0.6-1.7%]), and was attributable to cancer (n = 8), PE (n = 1), cardiovascular events (n = 3), or other causes (n = 4). Conclusions The long-term risk of DVT/PE after anticoagulant discontinuation for acute iSVT is clinically relevant, especially in males and in the presence of active cancer. The risk of death appears to be negligible in patients without cancer.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a review [^e88c8354]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age <50 years, heart rate <100/min, an oxygen saturation level of>94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, >40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^e5f7f96f]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The panel identified the following additional considerations for future research:
1 Studies to determine the outcomes, with or without anticoagulation, in clinical subgroups of PVT
2 Use of clear definitions of clinical and radiologic outcomes for standardization between research studies
3 The association of radiologic outcomes with long-term clinical outcomes

For pediatric patients with SVT, should anticoagulation vs no anticoagulation be used?

Recommendation 12a

For pediatric patients with SVT secondary to IV cannulation in the upper limb, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests no anticoagulation rather than using anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Recommendation 12b

For pediatric patients with SVT in the upper limb, which is not cannula related, or in the lower limbs associated with cancer or varicose veins, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: There were no direct and only limited, indirect data upon which to base this recommendation. The panel members’ experience suggested that in most instances (eg, PIV- or CVAD-related events in the upper extremity), no anticoagulation may be required. However, anticoagulation could be considered in select patients with symptomatic SVT (eg, non–PIV-/PICC-related, cancer, varicose vein, or lower limb events) or select scenarios (eg, PIV/long-term PICC and/or symptom progression). The panel notes that when anticoagulation is prescribed, there is uncertainty about the optimal intensity (eg, prophylactic vs full dose) and duration of therapy.

### Executive summary: antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^ddc1cdad]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

Regarding specific circumstances for venous thromboembolism in children, more specifically with respect to patients with superficial vein thrombosis, ASH/ISTH 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating anticoagulation in pediatric patients with superficial vein thrombosis in the upper limb not related to cannulation, or in the lower limbs associated with cancer or varicose veins.

### Other vte management (...) [^7c7dac69]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

THROMBOLYSIS In the absence of threat to the limb or high risk of severe postthrombotic syndrome, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for DVT. Up to one-half of patients with proximal DVT develop postthrombotic syndrome, although only 10% will experience severe symptoms. Thrombolysis reduces postthrombotic syndrome but increases major bleeding, with similar mortality and subsequent VTE risks. Systemic, regional, and catheter-directed thrombolysis have similarly elevated bleeding risks. With extensive DVT, the benefits of catheter-directed thrombolysis to prevent PE are uncertain. Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention is deciding whether to continue antithrombotic therapy indefinitely after VTE. In secondary prevention, the presence of provoking factors for the initial VTE is most important for this decision.

Clinical prognostic scores have been proposed to determine the risk of recurrence, but patient-oriented evidence is lacking. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered. For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding. For VTE with a chronic provoking factor, benefits are similar for reducing risk of PE and DVT offset by the same slight risk of major bleeding. After VTE associated with a transient provoking factor, indefinite treatment is not recommended. After a second VTE, indefinite anticoagulation reduces future PE and future DVT with the same slight risk of major bleeding.

Evidence is lacking on whether indefinite anticoagulation is beneficial if both VTE events were associated with transient provoking factors.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) medical therapy cautions—For SVT of the main saphenous trunks, we recommend against using prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although both have been found to reduce SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). If NSAIDs are used for short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.
