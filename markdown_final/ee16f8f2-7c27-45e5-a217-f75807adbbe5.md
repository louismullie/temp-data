## Question

What is the treatment for achilles tendinopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options and management approach for Achilles tendinopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnosis and confirming it clinically. Then, I should verify the initial management pillars of education, load management, and exercise. Next, I will review adjunct conservative options and where they fit. After that, I need to assess when to escalate to injections and how to counsel about their limited evidence and risks. Finally, I should determine when surgery is appropriate and outline prognosis and monitoring to close the loop, making sure I continually check claims against high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria so I don't jump to treatment without certainty. The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is clinical and should be established when four features are present: localized pain, symptoms linked to activity, localized thickening, and pain on palpation; I should avoid overreliance on imaging because it rarely changes management and may lead to overtreatment, though I will keep a low threshold to image if I suspect rupture or an alternative diagnosis [^116nqoCZ] [^112Z1gDt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the condition being "just inflammation". I need to explain to the patient that tendinopathy is a failed healing response with structural changes rather than classic inflammation, which is why rest alone is not helpful and targeted loading is key. I should set expectations that recovery is often slow and can take months to a year, with a meaningful risk of persistent symptoms over the long term, which underscores the importance of adherence to exercise and load management [^114Nxov4] [^115uY2cw] [^112L8tAz].

> Next, I should review load management as a first principle. Let me think about this carefully: I will temporarily reduce or substitute provocative activities while maintaining some loading within pain tolerance, and I will use a pain-monitoring scale to titrate activity, because complete rest can be counterproductive. For insertional tendinopathy, I need to ensure early exercises are performed on a flat surface to avoid compressive irritation at the insertion [^115zv7uu] [^115uY2cw].

> I will now examine the exercise cornerstone, because I need to ensure I'm prescribing what is most likely to help. Tendon-loading exercise programs are first-line and should be prescribed at least three times per week with progressive load as tolerated; eccentric-only protocols, heavy-slow resistance, and combined programs are all acceptable, and there is no high-certainty evidence that one exercise style is clearly superior, so I should tailor to preference, facility access, and adherence; I should include gastrocnemius and soleus strengthening, and for those with limited dorsiflexion, incorporate plantar flexor stretching with the knee flexed and extended [^115B6XS4] [^113cdthZ] [^114Kudor].

> Wait, let me verify the expected time course so I don't set unrealistic goals. A minimum of 12 weeks of consistent education, load management, and exercise is recommended before declaring failure, and if after about 3 months there is insufficient improvement, I should reassess adherence, technique, and load progression before moving to adjuncts. Shared decision-making about next steps becomes critical at this juncture [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].

> Let me consider adjunct conservative options now, but I should be cautious not to overpromise. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be considered for short-term pain relief, particularly when combined with exercise, though evidence quality is limited; manual therapy may help if there are mobility deficits; taping or heel lifts can be used temporarily to modulate load; I should avoid routine orthoses because evidence is limited; I need to ensure I do not offer therapeutic ultrasound or low-level laser therapy as standalone treatments given insufficient benefit [^113tdMZ6] [^113Ne2nh] [^114nMMDW] [^112tPSjm] [^116oUmjc] [^1177WgoH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "injections are contraindicated", but I should correct that to "use with caution and only after careful counseling". Platelet-rich plasma has repeatedly failed to show clinically meaningful benefit over placebo in randomized trials and meta-analyses, so I should not recommend it routinely; high-volume injection may provide short-term improvement at 6–12 weeks but lacks long-term superiority to sham, so if considered, it should be in the context of ongoing exercise and with informed consent about transient benefits; corticosteroid injections carry a small but real risk of rupture and should be reserved for select refractory cases, ideally combined with exercise and ultrasound guidance, acknowledging that a recent RCT suggested benefit when added to exercise, though this conflicts with older safety concerns and should be individualized [^115BvdBZ] [^113VNNWQ] [^112yuWiW] [^114adwST] [^11423KVP] [^111McuXD].

> I should double-check my escalation threshold before discussing surgery. Surgery should be considered only after at least 6 months of well-executed active conservative care, including exercise and appropriate adjuncts, with shared decision-making about uncertain superiority over continued nonoperative care and the potential for complications. Techniques vary from open debridement to minimally invasive approaches, and there is no definitive evidence that surgery outperforms high-quality rehabilitation, so expectations must be carefully managed [^115hrB7c] [^115hsB1Q].

> Next, I should review prognosis and monitoring so I can guide follow-up. Many patients improve over 3–12 months, but a substantial minority have persistent symptoms up to 10 years, and recurrence is common if return-to-sport is rushed; I will track outcomes with VISA-A and other patient-reported measures, and incorporate functional tests like heel-rise endurance and hopping when appropriate; I need to counsel on a gradual, symptom-guided return to sport and consider maintenance calf strengthening after recovery to mitigate recurrence [^112L8tAz] [^112Hy5rS] [^116UmS6J] [^116AKdQ9].

> But wait, what if the patient has insertional disease rather than midportion? Do I need to modify the plan? Yes, I should confirm location because insertional tendinopathy is more compression-sensitive, so early loading should avoid end-range dorsiflexion and begin on a flat surface, and I should screen for Haglund's deformity or bursitis that may alter management. Otherwise, the same principles of education, load management, and progressive tendon loading apply, with individualized adjustments [^115zv7uu] [^113Jzxrx].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency and alignment with evidence. Start with clinical diagnosis and education, implement load management within pain tolerance, and prescribe progressive tendon-loading exercise for at least 12 weeks. If response is inadequate, reassess and consider adjuncts such as shockwave or taping while avoiding low-value modalities. Reserve injections for carefully selected refractory cases with explicit counseling about limited and conflicting evidence. And consider surgery only after 6 months of high-quality conservative care, all while using shared decision-making and validated outcomes to track progress and adjust the plan over time [^116nqoCZ] [^112Sbm9T] [^115B6XS4].

---

The cornerstone of Achilles tendinopathy management is **eccentric calf strengthening** [^112k3wT4] (Alfredson or heavy-slow resistance) for at least 12 weeks [^116nqoCZ], with load progressed to pain ≤ 5/10 [^notfound] and combined with load management and patient education [^115zv7uu]. If pain persists, **extracorporeal shockwave therapy** [^113tdMZ6] or **high-volume injection** [^115zv7uu] can be considered, but evidence is mixed and they should be individualized [^115HyTud]. Platelet-rich plasma is **not recommended** due to lack of benefit [^115BvdBZ] [^113VNNWQ]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases after ≥ 6 months of conservative care [^115hrB7c], with gastrocnemius recession for tightness [^117THkQw] and debridement for degenerative changes [^113Jzxrx]. Return to sport is **gradual**, guided by pain and function, with ongoing loading to prevent recurrence [^111xxTLw] [^116AKdQ9].

---

## Conservative management

### Exercise therapy

- **Eccentric strengthening**: Alfredson protocol (eccentric heel drops) or heavy-slow resistance training are first-line and improve pain and function [^115B6XS4] [^112k3wT4].

- **Duration**: Minimum 12 weeks [^116nqoCZ], progressing load as tolerated to pain ≤ 5/10.

- **Adjuncts**: Stretching [^114Kudor], isometrics, and progressive tendon loading can be added based on symptoms and function [^112Sbm9T].

---

### Load management and patient education

Key elements include **load modification** — temporarily reducing provocative activities and gradually increasing load based on pain [^115zv7uu] — and **patient education** explaining the condition, prognosis, and the importance of adherence to exercise and load management [^113YyYna].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)**: Consider for persistent pain [^113tdMZ6]; evidence is mixed but may help when combined with exercise [^115HyTud].

- **High-volume injection**: May provide short-term relief [^112yuWiW]; long-term benefit is uncertain and should be individualized [^114adwST].

- **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**: Not recommended due to lack of consistent benefit [^115BvdBZ] [^113VNNWQ].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated only after **≥ 6 months** of conservative care [^115hrB7c]. Options include **gastrocnemius recession** for gastrocnemius tightness [^117THkQw] and **debridement** for degenerative changes [^115hrB7c]. Complications include wound issues, nerve injury, and rupture; recovery takes 6–12 months.

---

## Rehabilitation and return-to-sport

- **Gradual progression**: Use pain and function thresholds to guide return [^111xxTLw].

- **Ongoing loading**: Continue calf strengthening to prevent recurrence [^116AKdQ9].

- **Monitoring**: Track pain, function, and strength to adjust the plan [^112Hy5rS].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

1. Eccentric strengthening + load management**: First-line, all patients
2. ESWT or high-volume injection**: Persistent pain after 12 weeks
3. Surgery (gastrocnemius recession or debridement)**: Refractory after ≥ 6 months

---

Eccentric strengthening with load management is **first-line**; ESWT or high-volume injection are second-line options, and surgery is last resort. PRP is **not recommended**, and return to sport should be gradual with ongoing loading to reduce recurrence.

We strongly encourage future studies to be conducted using validated instruments to assess pain and functional outcome. As often advocated, larger populations, prospective studies and long-term follow-up studies are needed to be conclusive on the best surgical treatment option of midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

In addition, no comparative study of surgical treatment and nonsurgical treatment or placebo intervention has been conducted. Therefore, no additional benefit of surgery over nonsurgical treatment, placebo intervention or wait-and-see policy has been established. Future research should therefore strive to compare surgical treatment with nonsurgical or placebo intervention.

Furthermore, as the exact pathophysiology of midportion tendinopathy is still poorly understood, current surgical techniques address a range of hypothetical abnormalities with varying results (Appendix 1 in Table 5). Future research should aim to determine whether the extent of the pathology influences the required surgical approach.

Submodule 4.4: surgical treatment options

Is surgery more effective than non-surgical treatment for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

In some patients with Achilles tendinopathy, non-surgical therapy is not successful and surgery is considered. The goal is to reduce symptoms, which can be done by excising fibrotic adhesions, excising degenerative noduli and/or making longitudinal incisions to induce a recovery response in the extracellular matrix. There is insufficient knowledge of how the results of surgical techniques compare with non-surgical treatment options. Understanding this is important in order to be able to make an informed decision to perform a surgical procedure. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider surgery only in patients who do not recover after at least six months of active treatment. See the recommendations of submodule 4.3 for the definition of active treatment. Discuss the expected effectiveness of surgical intervention compared with active non-surgical treatments and the potential surgical complications.

Submodule 4.5 factors that affect treatment effectiveness

Which factors influence treatment effects in Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

With the rise of so-called 'big data', personalisation of care is increasingly considered as the future for the treatment for many patients. This information can be obtained from, for example; electronic medical records, DNA profiles and eHealth apps. In the field of Achilles tendinopathy, there is insufficient knowledge about factors that influence the treatment effect or the natural course (prognosis). Knowledge of these factors could contribute to personalising treatment with possible improvements in clinical outcomes as a result. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Assess specific patient characteristics (such as activity level and the presence of comorbidities) to personalise treatment, but do not use this information to provide a prognosis. Together with the patient, the best treatment option can be decided.

### Injection therapies for achilles tendinopathy [^11423KVP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition, often with significant functional consequences. As a wide range of injection treatments are available, a review of randomised trials evaluating injection therapies to help inform treatment decisions is warranted.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injection therapies for people with Achilles tendinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 20 April 2015: the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. We also searched trial registers (29 May 2014) and reference lists of articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating injection therapies in adults with an investigator-reported diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. We accepted comparison arms of placebo (sham) or no injection control, or other active treatment (such as physiotherapy, pharmaceuticals or surgery). Our primary outcomes were function, using measures such as the VISA-A (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire), and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed treatment effects using mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous variables and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for dichotomous variables. For follow-up data, we defined short-term as up to six weeks, medium-term as up to three months and longer-term as data beyond three months. We performed meta-analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (732 participants). Seven trials exclusively studied athletic populations. The mean ages of the participants in the individual trials ranged from 20 years to 50 years. Fifteen trials compared an injection therapy with a placebo injection or no injection control, four trials compared an injection therapy with active treatment, and one compared two different concentrations of the same injection. Thus no trials compared different injection therapies. Two studies had three trial arms and we included them twice in two different categories. Within these categories, we further subdivided injection therapies by mode of action (injury-causing versus direct repair agents). The risk of bias was unclear (due to poor reporting) or high in six trials published between 1987 and 1994. Improved methodology and reporting for the subsequent trials published between 2004 and 2013 meant that these were at less risk of bias. Given the very low quality evidence available from each of four small trials comparing different combinations of injection therapy versus active treatment and the single trial comparing two doses of one injection therapy, only the results of the first comparison (injection therapy versus control) are presented. There is low quality evidence of a lack of significant or clinically important differences in VISA-A scores (0 to 100: best function) between injection therapy and control groups at six weeks (MD 0.79, 95% CI -4.56 to 6.14; 200 participants, five trials), three months (MD -0.94, 95% CI -6.34 to 4.46; 189 participants, five trials) or between six and 12 months (MD 0.14, 95% CI -6.54 to 6.82; 132 participants, three trials). Very low quality evidence from 13 trials showed little difference between the two groups in adverse events (14/243 versus 12/206; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.89), most of which were minor and short-lasting. The only major adverse event in the injection therapy group was an Achilles tendon rupture, which happened in a trial testing corticosteroid injections. There was very low quality evidence in favour of the injection therapy group in short-term (under three months) pain (219 participants, seven trials) and in the return to sports (335 participants, seven trials). There was very low quality evidence indicating little difference between groups in patient satisfaction with treatment (152 participants, four trials). There was insufficient evidence to conclude on subgroup differences based on mode of action given that only two trials tested injury-causing agents and the clear heterogeneity of the other 13 trials, which tested seven different therapies that act directly on the repair pathway.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions on the use, or to support the routine use, of injection therapies for treating Achilles tendinopathy. This review has highlighted a need for definitive research in the area of injection therapies for Achilles tendinopathy, including in older non-athletic populations. This review has shown that there is a consensus in the literature that placebo-controlled trials are considered the most appropriate trial design.

Module 6 preventing recurrence of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

How can recurrent symptoms be prevented in patients who have recovered from Achilles tendinopathy?

The scoping question includes the following subquestion

Which prevention strategies are effective in patients who have recovered from Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

After recovery from Achilles tendinopathy it is important to prevent recurrence. As a previous lower limb tendinopathy is the risk factor with the strongest evidence for developing Achilles tendinopathy, there is a likelihood of recurring symptoms. There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of prevention strategies aimed at recurrent Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 6.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Discuss that sufficient time should be spent on active treatment before starting with provocative (sports) loading.

As a rule, a return to full symptom-free (sports) loading is only possible after a few months of active treatment at a minimum. A return to sports within days is associated with a greater likelihood of recurrence. Discuss the speed of return to sports with the patient and take the above-mentioned data into account.

Ensure a gradual build-up of the (sports) loading after recovery from Achilles tendinopathy or after a longer period of relative inactivity.

Consider continuing exercise therapy of the calf muscles after symptomatic recovery from Achilles tendinopathy.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^114dWo9s]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the 2007 Dutch guideline, the patient group in this guideline included both active and sedentary people. This guideline also includes identification of patients with a systemic cause of tendinopathy, for example, an enthesitis because of a rheumatic disease or a tendon xanthoma as a result of familial hypercholesterolaemia. However, the major clinical questions in the guideline will not be covered specifically for these uncommon patient groups. This guideline is not intended for patients younger than 18. Achilles tendon symptoms in patients under the age of 18 are usually caused by extra-articular osteochondrosis (Morbus Sever or Sever's disease). Complete Achilles tendon ruptures are also excluded from this guideline.

The current challenges in practice and key outcome measures have been identified in collaboration with patients who have been diagnosed with Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently no specific patient association for Achilles tendinopathy. We initially formed a patient panel (n = 9), collecting information on which challenges in practice they had experienced. In this analysis, six challenges in practice were prioritised, which were developed into the guideline modules:

There is insufficient knowledge about the causes of Achilles tendinopathy and what can be done to prevent it.
The criteria for determining the diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy are not sufficiently known.
The role of imaging in Achilles tendinopathy is unclear.
There is insufficient knowledge about the natural course and which treatments should be used for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
There is a lack of knowledge about the long-term prognosis in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
There is a lack of knowledge about preventing recurrent symptoms after recovery from Achilles tendinopathy.

A national survey was then launched in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation. Ninety-seven patients with Achilles tendinopathy responded to this digital questionnaire. A total of 85 (88%) of these patients described their treatment aims. The most common aims were: participation in sports without mentioning pain status (36%), pain-free sports participation (27%), pain-free functioning in activities of daily living (ADL) (22%), pain reduction without further specification and restoration of function in ADL without specific mentioning pain status.

### A proposed return-to-sport program for patients with midportion achilles tendinopathy: rationale and implementation [^111xxTLw]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury in athletes involved in running and jumping activities and sports. The intervention with the highest level of evidence is exercise therapy, and it is recommended that all patients initially be treated with exercise for at least 3 months prior to considering other treatment options. Recovery from Achilles tendinopathy can take up to a year, and there is a high propensity for recurrence, especially during the return-to-sport phase. The extent of the tendon injury, the age and sex of the athlete, the magnitude of pain/symptoms, the extent of impairments, and the demands of the sport all need to be considered when planning for return to sport. This clinical commentary describes an approach to return to sport for patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The aim of the return-to-sport program is to facilitate the decision-making process in returning an athlete with midportion Achilles tendinopathy back to full sport participation and to minimize the chances for recurrence of the injury.

Submodule 4.6: lifestyle advice, work and sports loading

What advice (self-management and patient education) should be given to patients with Achilles tendinopathy regarding lifestyle, work and sports loading?

Introduction

Problem

Patients with Achilles tendinopathy often report pain and not being able to exercise without pain. Patients, regularly ask about the nature and expected course of the condition and how they themselves can contribute positively or negatively to the recovery. The differing views of healthcare providers frequently causes confusion and uncertainty in patients. It is therefore important that healthcare providers have sufficient knowledge to give the correct instructions on lifestyle, work and sports loading to patients with Achilles tendinopathy. This can potentially contribute to improving self-efficacy and coping strategies which may have a positive contribution to treatment and recovery. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

The recommendations in submodule 4.3 are also aimed at lifestyle adjustments and loading during work and sports.

Discuss the initial active treatment options. Advise patients with work-related Achilles tendinopathy according to the same principles of patient education, load management advice and exercise therapy as a first step. Identify and temporarily adjust provocative factors related to the work.

Submodule 4.3: non-surgical treatment options

Which non-surgical treatment is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Non-surgical treatment is usually the first choice for Achilles tendinopathy. Non-surgical treatments can be divided into several categories. The effectiveness of non-surgical treatments can be evaluated using different control groups. For this reason, the following non-surgical intervention categories were defined: a wait-and-see policy, placebo treatment, exercise therapy, orthoses, shockwave therapy, medication, acupuncture, injection therapy and multimodal treatments. From our national patient survey, we found that the majority of patients receive multiple treatments from these categories. This results in significant healthcare consumption. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the comparative effectiveness of the different treatment options. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations, and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

One to two corticosteroid injections are a good and safe supplement to controlled exercises in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
Mid-substance tendinopathy and enthesopathy can be treated with the same treatment protocol with equal effect.
Ultrasound scanning cannot predict long-term outcome in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^114adwST]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Achilles tendon loading exercise is recommended as a first-line treatment for Achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice guidelines and expert narratives. However, up to 44% of people may not respond to exercise treatments for AT. Up to 60% of people with AT have continued pain and disability after 5 years despite exercise interventions, and 48% will seek additional treatment including injections and surgery.

There are currently no injection treatments with demonstrated long-term efficacy. Corticosteroid injections demonstrate short-term efficacy in improving tendinopathy pain and function, but there is well-documented symptom recurrence in the longer term. Other injections in clinical use for AT, including polidocanol, aprotinin and platelet-rich plasma injections, have been shown to be no more effective than placebo or sham, although a network meta-analysis found benefits compared with wait-and-see. An injection option that demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo or sham is likely to reduce the substantial and long-standing pain and disability, as well as costs associated with managing AT.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^111iHbNE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

We identified 5,154 potentially relevant publications, of which 170 articles were screened in the full-text analysis. Twenty-nine trials (n = 1,640 patients) met our eligibility criteria and were included (figure 1). Online supplementary web appendix 3 lists the 14 unpublished trials and the 3 trials awaiting classification.

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process. IPD, individual patient data; LPLV, last patient last visit; PRISMA, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Characteristics of the included trials

Forty-two treatments were investigated in 29 trials. Sixty-five treatment arms were included in the trials, and 40 of these included exercise therapies. There were 180 treatment comparisons in the NMAs. The majority of trials (86%) investigated midportion Achilles tendinopathy, one investigated insertional Achilles tendinopathy and three trials did not specify the location of Achilles tendinopathy. Twenty-five trials evaluated clinical outcome using the VISA-A score and six trials reported return to sports activities. Sample sizes ranged from 12 to 117 per treatment arm (median 20 patients, IQR 16–27). Follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 52 weeks (median 27 weeks, IQR 12–52).

The baseline characteristics of patients and all trial characteristics are shown in online supplementary web appendices 4 and 5. Study populations reflect clinical practice with equal sex distribution, participants in their 40s and slightly overweight. Three-quarters of the included participants were active individuals. Participants typically had symptoms for nearly 2 years prior to treatment; approximately 20% had bilateral symptoms. The severity of symptoms measured with the VISA-A score was usually between 40 and 60 points.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nta4u]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition associated with degenerative changes and characterised by a combination of pain impaired movement and reduced function that typically requires extended periods for recovery. Tendinopathy can affect any muscle-tendon unit in the body, however, it is most frequently reported in the Achilles, patellar, lateral elbow, rotator cuff and hip tendons. Surveys of prevalence of lower extremity tendinopathy in the general population have reported rates of 11.8 and 10.5 per 1000 person-years, while prevalence for upper limb tendinopathies have been estimated between 1.3% and 21.0%. Costs to the individual, the health service and economy (due to absenteeism and loss of productivity) are substantial such that identifying effective interventions is a priority.

Exercise therapy is the mainstay of conservative management of tendinopathy and has focused largely on resistance training, and in many instances eccentric strengthening techniques. The rationale of exercise therapy is to improve load tolerance and possibly structural adaptation of the musculotendinous unit to restore function. In the early phase of rehabilitation, flexibility exercises are often initiated and incorporated into strengthening regimes to facilitate improvements in mobility. Effective exercise therapy may also require targeting a range of contributing factors, which not only include muscle weakness and decreased flexibility, but also corticospinal and neuromuscular adaptations resulting from persistent pain. As such, proprioceptive exercise interventions have been used to retrain normal patterns of muscle recruitment in the rehabilitation of shoulder-related tendinopathies including impingement. The time course of tendinopathy recovery is usually slow, the degree of recovery may be incomplete and there may be differences between tendinopathies and across outcome domains. For example, quality of life may improve less quickly for people with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared with those with Achilles tendinopathy, whereas recovery may be faster for pain and the relative magnitudes of these improvements may not be equivalent. Quantifying any tendinopathy or domain-specific differences in expected improvements would help guide efforts to develop consensus concerning optimal management by enabling better intervention comparisons.

### UK defence rehabilitation review of achilles and patellar tendinopathy conservative management: a systematic review [^112Dz7Gm]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tendinopathy is a common condition affecting physically active populations, such as the military. Diagnosis is clinical, with no gold-standard tests. The role of imaging and functional assessment in subdiagnosis is an active area of research with the hope of delivering more nuanced and clinically effective management. A vast array of injectable and adjunctive therapies have been proposed with varying, and at times, conflicting evidence. Multiple methods for exercise therapy exist, but increasingly tendinopathy is recognised as a heterogeneous condition not suited to a one-size-fits-all approach. The aim was to complete a systematic review, to appraise the recent evidence for conservative management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team from across defence rehabilitation searched PubMed for literature dating from May 2017 to July 2023. Four key areas were searched: diagnosis and outcome measures, medical, exercise and adjuncts.

Results

A total of 840 articles were identified. Articles were screened using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Following screening and abstract review, a total of 143 were included for full review. Due to the breadth of literature and large heterogeneity of studies, meta-analysis of results was not feasible. Articles were assessed against the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine criteria.

Conclusions

The literature review found the strongest evidence for exercise-based rehabilitation as first-line treatment, with limited evidence for medical interventions and adjuncts. The primacy of stand-alone loading modalities is challenged by developing literature supporting a progressive tendon loading exercise protocol (PTLE). PTLE represents a framework where various exercise modalities are prescribed based on the individual's capacity and function. Novel interventions should be practised with caution and not conducted as monotherapy.

### Management of chronic achilles tendinopathy [^116z4W8Z]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Tendons transmit force between muscles and bones and, when stretched, store elastic energy that contributes to movement.(1) The tendinous portion of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles merge to form the Achilles tendon, which is the largest and strongest in the body, but one of the most frequently injured.(2,3) Conservative management options for chronic Achilles tendinopathy include eccentric (lengthening) exercises, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), topical nitroglycerin, low level laser therapy, orthoses, splints or injections (e.g. corticosteroids, hyperosmolar dextrose, polidocanol, platelet-rich plasma), while a minority of patients require surgery (using open, percutaneous or endoscopic methods).(4–8) Here we assess the management options for patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (lasting over 6 weeks).

### Exercise, orthoses and splinting for treating achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^112k3wT4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of exercise, orthoses and splinting on function, pain and quality of life (QoL) for the management of mid-portion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy, and to compare different types, applications and modes of delivery within each intervention category.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, CINAHL, Embase, AMED, WHO ICTRP, Web of Science, PEDro and Cochrane Library from inception to October 2017. Citation tracking of published studies and conference proceedings and contacting experts in the field.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Controlled clinical trials evaluating either exercise, orthoses or splinting for the management of Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

Independent reviewers undertook searches, screening and risk of bias appraisal. Primary outcomes of interest were function, pain and QoL.

Results

Twenty-two studies were included (1137 participants). Moderate level evidence favoured eccentric exercise over control for improving pain and function in mid-portion tendinopathy. Moderate level evidence favoured eccentric exercise over concentric exercise for reducing pain. There was moderate level evidence of no significant difference in pain or function between eccentric exercise and heavy slow resistance exercise. There was low level evidence that eccentric exercise was not superior to stretching for pain or QoL. There was moderate level evidence that a combined exercise protocol was not superior to a lower dosage protocol for improving functional performance. There was moderate to low level evidence of a significant difference in pain (mean difference (MD) 6.3mm, 95%CI -4.45 to 17.04, moderate) or function (MD 1.83 Victoria Institute of Sport Assessment points, 95%CI -7.47 to 11.12, low) between high-dose and low-dose eccentric training. There was high to moderate level evidence of no difference in pain (moderate) or function (high) between orthoses and control. There was low level evidence of no significant benefit in adding a night splint to an eccentric exercise programme for function, and moderate level evidence for no reduction in pain (MD -3.50, 95%CI -10.49 to 3.48). Eccentric exercise was not superior to splinting for pain (moderate evidence) or function (low level evidence).

Summary

We conditionally recommend exercise for improving pain and function in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. The balance of evidence did not support recommendation of one type of exercise programme over another. We conditionally recommend against the addition of a splint to an eccentric exercise protocol and we do not recommend the use of orthoses to improve pain and function in Achilles tendinopathy.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^111HsdZG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and statistical methods

We constructed network plots using Stata V.15 to visualise all head-to-head comparisons. Eccentric exercises were labelled as high-dose (daily) or low-dose (less than once a day). We planned a time course analysis for the VISA-A score; however, insufficient data precluded the analysis. Instead, we modelled networks for the primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, where possible. Four reviewers (ACV, MW, AW and R-JV) labelled the treatments and assigned them to categories (classes) (see table 1). We assessed the assumption of exchangeability required for NMA before commencing the analyses. We appraised clinical homogeneity by tabulating study and population characteristics and inspecting them for differences in effect modifiers.

Treatment-level and class-level models were fitted in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in WinBUGS (V.1.4; Medical Research Council, UK, and Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Cambridge, UK). Continuous outcomes are presented as mean difference, with their 95% credible intervals. We reported the mean, median and 95% credible intervals for the ranking of each treatment or class to estimate the likelihood of individual treatments being superior to other treatments, and interpreted the primary outcome results in light of the MID.

For both treatment-level and class-level models, we fitted fixed and random effects models, and compared model fit using the deviance information criterion and posterior mean residual deviance. Lower deviances depict a better model fit. For the class-level models we attempted to fit a hierarchical model where treatment effects were assumed to be similar within class, but due to insufficient data we were only able to fit a fixed class effect model where all treatments were assumed to have the same effect within class.

We assessed statistical heterogeneity by inspecting the between-trial SD and comparing the fit of the fixed and random effects models. We planned to explore sources of statistical heterogeneity if there were 10 or more trials available per comparison. In the presence of evidence from direct and indirect comparisons, it is important to assess whether the direct and indirect evidence is consistent. We assessed the consistency assumption for each network by comparing model fit between the NMA model and an unrelated mean effects model that relaxes the consistency assumption. We planned to assess small study bias using comparison-adjusted funnel plots if 10 or more trials were available for one comparison.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^115sgMuJ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Certainty of evidence

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for NMAs to appraise the certainty of evidence. Evidence from each comparison was appraised for direct and indirect comparisons, and for the combined evidence, where applicable. Evidence could be of 'high certainty', 'moderate certainty', 'low certainty' or 'very low certainty'. All ratings started at the level of 'high certainty'. Two authors (ACV and MW) independently rated the evidence down on the basis of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Inconsistency in GRADE involves heterogeneity across trials and is not related to inconsistency in the network. We rated the overall body of evidence in the network to indicate the strength of the NMA recommendations.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^115WQztV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide a consistently updated overview of the comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Living systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Multiple databases including grey literature sources were searched up to February 2019.

Study eligibility criteria

Randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of any treatment in patients with both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We excluded trials with 10 or fewer participants per treatment arm or trials investigating tendon ruptures.

Data extraction and synthesis

Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the certainty of evidence.

Primary outcome measure

The validated patient-reported Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire.

Results

29 trials investigating 42 different treatments were included. 22 trials (76%) were at high risk of bias and 7 (24%) had some concerns. Most trials included patients with midportion tendinopathy (86%). Any treatment class seemed superior to wait-and-see for midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 3 months (very low to low certainty of evidence). At 12 months, exercise therapy, exercise+injection therapy and exercise+night splint therapy were all comparable with injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy (very low to low certainty). No network meta-analysis could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy.

Summary/conclusion

In our living network meta-analysis no trials were at low risk of bias and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments seemed superior at 3-month follow-up. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at either 3-month or 12-month follow-up. As exercise therapy is easy to prescribe, can be of low cost and has few harms, clinicians could consider starting treatment with a calf-muscle exercise programme.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^111SkuJc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of the risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis for Achilles tendinopathy. To make clinical recommendations for healthcare practitioners and patients.

Design

Comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process funded by the Quality Foundation of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. This process included a development, commentary and authorisation phase. Patients participated in every phase.

Data Sources

Multiple databases and existing guidelines were searched up to May 2019. Information from patients, healthcare providers and other stakeholders were obtained using a digital questionnaire, focus group interview and invitational conference.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies on both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy were eligible. Specific eligibility criteria were described per module.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

To appraise the certainty of evidence, reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method, where applicable. Important considerations were: patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation. Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations.

Primary Outcome Measure

The primary and secondary outcome measures were defined per module and defined based on the input of patients obtained in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation and healthcare providers from different professions.

Results

Six specific modules were completed: risk factors and primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment prognosis and secondary prevention for Achilles tendinopathy.

Summary/Conclusion

Our Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on Achilles tendinopathy provides six modules developed according to the standards of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. Evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice are given for risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis. This guideline can assist healthcare providers and patients in clinical practice.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Yxfjp]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Search strategy

The search strategy used for this study was part of a larger search conducted to scope the entire tendinopathy and exercise therapy research base. The search comprised three steps. First, a limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL using initial keywords was conducted to develop a full search strategy. Second, the full search strategy was adapted to each database and applied systematically to: MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, EMBase, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane library (Controlled trials, Systematic reviews), JBI Evidence Synthesis, PEDRo and Epistemonikos (search terms for each database are presented in online supplemental file 5. In addition, six trial registries, five grey literature data bases and Google Scholar were searched (online supplemental file 5). Finally, the third step involved conducting a search of cited and citing articles using Scopus and handsearching a total of 130 systematic reviews that were identified to include information relevant to exercise therapy and tendinopathy. No limit was placed on language, with research studies reported in languages other than English translated via Google Translate or via international collaborations of the review team members. Searches were initiated from 1998 as (1) the heavy load eccentric calf-training protocol for Achilles tendinosis by Alfredson et al was published in 1998 and may be considered seminal work in the field of tendinopathyand (2) there has been a proliferation of research on exercise interventions for tendinopathies post 1998. The final date of the search was 18 January 2021.

Study selection

Proquest Refworks was used to manage references and remove duplicates before importing to Covidence (Melbourne, Australia) to facilitate screening and initiate a second deduplication process. Titles/abstracts were reviewed, independently, by two members of the research team. Full-text copies of all studies included at title/abstract screening stage were retrieved and also reviewed, independently, by two members of the research team. Conflicts were resolved by discussion or by input from a third reviewer.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^11262Ch3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

Our living systematic review with NMA was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) and published in an open repository. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline, and the PRISMA-NMA extension for reporting NMA.

Administration and update of the living systematic review

This systematic review with NMA is part of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for Achilles tendinopathy. As we (1) plan to update the search and review process every 5 years as part of the guideline revision process, and (2) perform annual screening to identify new data that may alter the conclusions and recommendations, we defined this as a 'living' systematic review with NMA. A living systematic review's main advantage is that it assumes that new knowledge will appear and allow improvements in clinical decision-making. As we already have a structured protocol and database for this systematic review, we will be able to answer future research questions quickly and promote faster translation of new scientific evidence into clinical practice.

Patient involvement

To determine clinically relevant outcomes, we performed a pilot round of focus interviews with consecutive patients suffering from chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy (n = 9) who were participating in a randomised clinical trial (NCT02996409), and administered a survey to patients identified through the Dutch national patient federation (n = 97). The results are presented in online supplementary web appendix 1. We also considered recently defined core domains for tendinopathies from an international consensus involving patients and healthcare providers. Based on these data, we decided to evaluate clinical outcome with the validated and disease-specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score as the primary outcome.

Outcome measures

The VISA-A score quantifies pain and activity level and can range from 0 to 100; a score of 100 indicates no pain with full activity level, while a score of 0 indicates severely limited activity levels and severe levels of pain. The minimal important difference (MID) for the VISA-A score is 15 points. Return to sports activities was the secondary outcome. We assessed outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months.

### Is platelet-rich plasma injection effective for chronic achilles tendinopathy? A meta-analysis [^113VNNWQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Achilles tendinopathy is common in the general population, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is seeing increased use to treat this problem. However, studies disagree as to whether PRP confers a beneficial effect for chronic Achilles tendinopathy, and no one to our knowledge has pooled the available randomized trials in a formal meta-analysis to try to reconcile those differences.

Questions/Purposes

In the setting of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we asked: Does PRP plus eccentric strength training result in (1) greater improvements in Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) scores; (2) differences in tendon thickness; or (3) differences in color Doppler activity compared with placebo (saline) injections plus eccentric strength training in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy?

Methods

A search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted to identify all RCTs using PRP injection with eccentric training for chronic Achilles tendinopathy in the electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science (SCI-E/SSCI/A&HCI), and EMBASE from January 1981 to August 2017. Results were limited to human RCTs and published in all languages. Two reviewers assessed study quality using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. All the included studies had low risk of bias. The primary endpoint was improvement in the VISA-A score, which ranges from 0 to 100 points, with higher scores representing increased activity and less pain; we considered the minimum clinically important difference on the VISA-A to be 12 points. Secondary outcomes were tendon thickness change (with a thicker tendon representing more severe disease), color Doppler activity (with more activity representing a poorer result), and other functional measures (such as pain and return to sports activity). Four RCTs involving 170 participants were eligible and included 85 participants treated with PRP injection and eccentric training and 85 treated with saline injection and eccentric training. The patients in both PRP and placebo (saline) groups seemed comparable at baseline. We assessed for publication bias using a funnel plot and saw no evidence of publication bias. Based on previous studies, we had 80% power to detect a 12-point difference on the VISA-A score with the available sample size in each group.

Results

With the numbers available, there was no difference between the PRP and saline groups regarding the primary outcome (VISA-A score: mean difference [MD], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.7 to 11.3; p = 0.085). Likewise, we found no difference between the PRP and saline groups in terms of our secondary outcomes of tendon thickness change (MD, 0.2 mm; 95% CI, 0.6–1.0 mm; p = 0.663) and color Doppler activity (MD, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.4; p = 0.695).

Conclusions

PRP injection with eccentric training did not improve VISA-A scores, reduce tendon thickness, or reduce color Doppler activity in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy compared with saline injection. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm these results, but until or unless a clear benefit has been demonstrated in favor of the new treatment, we cannot recommend it for general use.

Level Of Evidence

Level I, therapeutic study.

### Injection treatment for chronic midportion achilles tendinopathy: do we need that many alternatives? [^112tPYSN]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

A minimally invasive technique such as high-volume injection has been successfully performed to produce local mechanical effects in order to release the adhesions formed between peritendineum and tendon proper, thereby obliterating neovascularisation and accompanying neonerves. Brisement, first described in 1997, was initially meant to interrupt the degenerative cycle of the tendon proper by initiating a healing cascade, but in essence seems equivalent to current high-volume injections. Now, could not a combination of these two theories, old and new, be the result of all injections? Meaning that no matter what we introduce, an inflammatory response will be generated? This can be illustrated by a randomized study by De Vos et al. where injection of PRP was compared with saline, producing an equivalent outcome. Corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis did not provide any long-term benefit compared with placebo. Brown et al. performed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with Achilles tendinopathy, where aprotinin was compared with placebo, showing no statistically significant benefit.

Until now, an evidence based algorithm for the (conservative) management of midportion Achilles tendinopathy is unknown. Research on Achilles tendon-related problems is ongoing. Further research should focus on the cause of pain in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Recognising the cause of pain will help to further define therapeutic strategies.

### Management of insertional achilles tendinopathy [^113Jzxrx]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition that can lead to chronic, debilitating heel pain in athletes and nonathletes alike. Conservative treatment options include activity and shoe wear modification, physical therapy, injections, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy. When nonsurgical treatment fails, surgical treatment is recommended. Although there are options aimed at preserving the tendon and débriding the retrocalcaneal bursa and excess bone formation, others are aimed at detaching the Achilles tendon to perform a thorough débridement and subsequent reattachment. Additional or alternate procedures may include a calcaneal closing wedge osteotomy, gastrocnemius lengthening, and flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer. Recent advances in suture anchor techniques further add to the complexity of available options. This review discusses the relevant anatomy, biomechanics, and pathophysiology as well as the recent available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical management of this condition to guide surgeons in selecting the most appropriate treatment for their patients.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^112fHRf4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We excluded many trials because they did not use commonly accepted and validated outcomes in the field of Achilles tendinopathy. It is unclear whether our NMA results apply to all patients with Achilles tendinopathy because we only included one trial with patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy. We planned a time course analysis for the VISA-A score, as outcomes within the first year are of equal importance. Due to a lack of data, we were not able to perform this analysis and, in accordance with our protocol, we modelled outcomes for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months instead.

We planned threshold analysis as a quantitative means to assess the robustness of NMA recommendations to potential limitations in the evidence. We were unable to use this approach because of substantial overlap in credible intervals from the NMA. Due to overlap in the intervals, no recommendations could be made, which is a fundamental prerequisite to performing a valid threshold analysis. To comply with our protocol, we report threshold results in online supplementary web appendix 11, but chose to use GRADE to interpret the evidence. We were not able to evaluate small study bias due to too low number of trials. We found three completed trials in trial registers; two are under review, and the publication status of one trial is unknown. Therefore, it seems unlikely that, in an era of prospective trial registrations, significant publication bias is present in the field of Achilles tendinopathy.

### Exercise parameters to consider for achilles tendinopathy: a modified Delphi study with international experts [^113CLEcA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT), defined as a 'persistent Achilles tendon pain and loss of function related to mechanical loading', is a relatively common pathology among athletes, but can also occur in a more sedentary population. About 6% of the general population will experience AT at least once in their lifetime, while the incidence rate rises to 24% among elite athletes and to 52% among middle- and long-distance runners. Despite the evolution of treatments, AT remains difficult to manage, with recurrence rates of 23%–43% following rehabilitationand persistent symptoms in up to 60% of patients after 5 years. The natural history of AT is still not fully understood, its pathophysiology is complex and the risk factors are numerous, which makes it difficult to implement a one-size-fits-all strategy. Primary AT management typically involves education, advice and exercises that gradually increase tendon load. These exercises are the cornerstone of rehabilitationand aim to stimulate tendon remodelling, to reduce pain and to improve calf muscle endurance and strength, as well as lower leg function. Thereby, several progressive loading protocols focusing mainly on exercises involving heel raises have been developed, evolving from Stanish and Curwin programmeto Alfredson's eccentric exercises, Silbernagel's combined approachand Heavy-Slow Resistance protocol. Although most of these exercise-based programmes have shown efficacy in improving patients' symptoms, a recent systematic review failed to show clear improvement in muscle structure or function after completing exercise rehabilitation. Even though the impact of exercises is not limited to the modification of muscular properties, this highlights the necessity to refine tendon loading protocols to optimise their effectiveness.

### What is the best evidence to guide management of acute achilles tendon ruptures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113emCKZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Simultaneous comparison of the multiple treatment options using traditional study designs is problematic; multiarm clinical trials often are logistically constrained to small sample sizes, and traditional meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of only two treatments that have been compared in head-to-head trials. Network meta-analyses allow for simultaneous comparison of all existing treatments utilizing both direct (head-to-head comparison) and indirect (not previously compared head-to-head) evidence.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer the following questions: Considering open repair, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) repair, functional rehabilitation, or primary immobilization for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, (1) which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of rerupture? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications resulting in surgery?

Methods

This study was conducted with methods guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is reported in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for incorporating network meta-analysis. Five databases and grey literature sources (such as major orthopaedic meeting presentation lists) were searched from inception to September 30, 2019. Included studies were RCTs comparing treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures using two or more of the following interventions: primary immobilization, functional rehabilitation, open surgical repair, or MIS repair. We excluded studies enrolling patients with chronic ruptures, reruptures, and preexisting Achilles tendinopathy as well as studies with more than 20% loss to follow-up or less than 6 months of follow-up. Nineteen RCTs (1316 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean number of patients per study treatment arm was 35 ± 16, mean age was 41 ± 5 years, mean sex composition was 80% ± 10% males, and mean follow-up was 22 ± 12 months. The four treatment groups were compared for the main outcomes of rerupture and complications resulting in operation. The analysis was conducted using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors. Evidence quality was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We found risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias to be low across treatments, and we found the risk of performance and detection bias to be high. Overall risk of bias between treatments appeared similar.

Results

We found that treatment with primary immobilization had a greater risk of rerupture than open surgery (odds ratio 4.06 [95% credible interval {CrI} 1.47 to 11.88]; p < 0.05). There were no other differences between treatments for risk of rerupture. Minimally invasive surgery was ranked first for fewest complications resulting in surgery and was associated with a lower risk of complications resulting in surgery than functional rehabilitation (OR 0.16 [95% CrI 0.02 to 0.90]; p < 0.05), open surgery (OR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.04 to 0.93]; p < 0.05), and primary immobilization (OR < 0.01 [95% CrI < 0.01 to 0.01]; p < 0.05). Risk of complications resulting in surgery was no different between primary immobilization and open surgery (OR 1.46 [95% CrI 0.35 to 5.36]). Data for patient-reported outcome scores and return to activity were inappropriate for pooling secondary to considerable clinical heterogeneity and imprecision associated with small sample sizes.

Conclusion

Faced with acute Achilles tendon rupture, patients should be counseled that, based on the best-available evidence, the risk of rerupture likely is no different across contemporary treatments. Considering the possibly lower risk of complications resulting in surgery associated with MIS repair, patients and surgeons must balance any benefit with the potential risks of MIS techniques. As treatments continue to evolve, consistent reporting of validated patient-reported outcome measures is critically important to facilitate analysis with existing RCT evidence. Infrequent but serious complications such as rerupture and deep infection should be further explored to determine whether meaningful differences exist in specific patient populations.

### Surgical treatment for midportion achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^1167ZdqN]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy is a painful condition of the Achilles tendon located 2–7 cm proximal to the insertion on the calcaneus. Symptoms include pain, swelling and impaired performance. It is an over-use injury, often seen in athletes. The incidence varies from 0.2% in the general population up to 9% in recreational runners.

Initially, treatment of midportion tendinopathy is nonsurgical. Various noninvasive treatment options have been described, including eccentric exercise, the use of orthoses and rest. Additionally, invasive nonsurgical techniques like extracorporeal shockwave therapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection are commonly used. In approximately 25% of the patients nonsurgical treatment fails to alleviate symptoms and surgical treatment is indicated.

Historically, surgical treatment was performed using an open procedure. With new insights into the aetiology of tendinopathy, new surgical procedures were developed, resulting in a large variety of surgical techniques. Because of the high complication rates in open procedures, less invasive techniques gained popularity.

Due to the variety of surgical techniques and the confusing terminology used to describe pathologies of the Achilles tendon, no study to date has provided a clear overview of the literature regarding the best surgical treatment for midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the available literature on surgical treatment for midportion Achilles tendinopathy and to provide an overview of the different surgical techniques in terms of patient satisfaction and complication rate.

### Achilles tendinopathy: some aspects of basic science and clinical management [^114RpHDC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy is prevalent and potentially incapacitating in athletes involved in running sports. It is a degenerative, not an inflammatory, condition. Most patients respond to conservative measures if the condition is recognised early. Surgery usually involves removal of adhesions and degenerated areas and decompression of the tendon by tenotomy or measures that influence the local circulation.

### Mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: why painful? An evidence-based philosophy [^115DsCRP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is generally difficult to treat as the background to the pain mechanisms has not yet been clarified. A wide range of conservative and surgical treatment options are available. Most address intratendinous degenerative changes when present, as it is believed that these changes are responsible for the symptoms. Since up to 34% of asymptomatic tendons show histopathological changes, we believe that the tendon proper is not the cause of pain in the majority of patients. Chronic painful tendons show the ingrowth of sensory and sympathetic nerves from the paratenon with release of nociceptive substances. Denervating the Achilles tendon by release of the paratenon is sufficient to cause pain relief in the majority of patients. This type of treatment has the additional advantage that it is associated with a shorter recovery time when compared with treatment options that address the tendon itself. An evidence-based philosophy on the cause of pain in chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is presented. Level of evidence V.

Eligibility criteria

Trials were eligible if they investigated the effectiveness of any treatment in adults (≥ 18 years) with Achilles tendinopathy, using the outcome measures VISA-A questionnaire and/or return to sports activities. Populations with midportion tendinopathy, insertional tendinopathy or a combination of both were included. Achilles tendinopathy must have been diagnosed based on clinical findings (eg, local pain reproduced on clinical examination). Imaging to confirm the diagnosis was not an inclusion criterion. Trials including athletes and/or inactive patients were eligible. There were no language restrictions.

Any treatment, control treatment, placebo, wait-and-see or no treatment group studied in a trial was eligible for inclusion. We predefined a number of treatment classes, based on the assumption that some treatments have a similar effect due to a comparable working mechanism. Table 1 shows the treatments that are subdivided into treatment classes.

Table 1
Assignment of treatments to classes

We excluded trials with (1) 10 or fewer participants per study arm, (2) an inadequate control group (eg, the use of the contralateral Achilles tendon), (3) a population with full-thickness ruptures of the Achilles tendon, and (4) animal or in vitro studies.

Literature search strategy and information source

We developed a sensitive search strategy for multiple databases with the assistance of a medical librarian (online supplementary web appendix 2). The following databases were searched for published and unpublished trials up to 21 February 2019: Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL EBSCOhost, SPORTDiscus EBSCOhost, AMED EBSCOhost, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, WorldCat.org, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. We used the validated Cochrane search filter 'Embase search strategy for finding randomised clinical trials in Embase', and modified this for all conventional databases. We screened the reference lists of all included publications for potentially eligible trials.

Study selection and data extraction

Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers (ACV and RJ-V) after duplicate removal. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria to the full text reports. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (AW). In case of unpublished records, authors were contacted for data availability. We uploaded all trials to Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia).

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (ACV plus one of AW, CA or RJ-V) using standardised extraction forms adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, or a fifth reviewer (MW) in case of persistent disagreement. We extracted publication and trial details, population characteristics, eligibility criteria, treatment details, relevant outcome information, details of analysis, and study authors' key conclusions. If there were multiple time points available within a study, and these were equally close to the time point being synthesised across trials, we extracted the outcome of the latest follow-up for analysis.

Risk of bias assessment

We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each trial outcome. We assessed risk of bias on the basis of 'assignment to intervention' for all five domains: (1) randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) outcome measurement and (5) selection of the reported result. An overall risk of bias judgement was made for each outcome and each time point as either 'low risk', 'some concerns' or 'high risk' of bias.

The assessment was performed independently by two reviewers (ACV plus one of MW, CLA, AW or RJ-V). The reviewers did not perform risk of bias assessment or data extraction for publications in which they were involved as author. Disagreements were resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer (MW or AW) if necessary.

### Eccentric exercises; why do they work, what are the problems and how can we improve them? [^1158KW7n]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Eccentric exercises (EE) have proved successful in the management of chronic tendinopathy, particularly of the Achilles and patellar tendons, where they have been shown to be effective in controlled trials. However, numerous questions regarding EE remain. The standard protocols are time-consuming and require very motivated patients. EE are effective in some tendinopathies but not others. Furthermore, the location of the lesion can have a profound effect on efficacy; for example, standard EE in insertional lesions of the Achilles are ineffective. Until recently little was known of the effect of EE on tendinopathic tendons, although a greater understanding of this process is emerging. Additionally, recent in vivo evidence directly comparing eccentric and concentric exercises provides a possible explanation for the therapeutic benefit of EE. The challenge now is to make EE more effective. Suggestions on areas of future research are made.

Introduction

Chronic disorders of the Achilles tendon (tendinopathy) are a common overuse injury seen in general practice, with an incidence rate of 2–3 per 1000 registered adult patients. Most (74%) of these patients have midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Runners are most at risk of developing symptoms, with a lifetime risk of 52%. The initial treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is exercise combined with load management. Despite initiation of treatments, two thirds of patients continue to have symptoms at one year follow-up. At 10 years follow-up, about a quarter of patients still have symptoms. About one third of these non-responders eventually require surgery. Therefore, effective conservative treatment options are necessary to improve the outcome of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy who fail to respond to initial exercise treatment.

The formation of blood vessels (neovascularisation) around and within the tendon is one of the features of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Neovascularisation can be identified in 50–100% of patients with tendon symptoms using Doppler ultrasonography, compared with 0–30% in asymptomatic patients. The infiltration of nerve structures alongside this neovascularisation has been suggested to play a role in the chronicity of pain from Achilles tendinopathy. A large study showed an association between the degree of ultrasonographic Doppler flow and patient reported severity of symptoms.

Consequently, treatments have been developed to target neovascularisation. A novel technique is high volume injection, in which a large amount of fluid is injected into the area surrounding the tendon with the aim of obliterating peritendinous and intratendinous neovascularisation from high mechanical pressure. Current debate is on the addition of corticosteroids to the injection mixture. Recent evidence shows that a high volume injection with corticosteroids is associated with superior short term improvement at 6–12 weeks compared with a high volume injection without corticosteroids, but intermediate term effects are similar. Several cohort studies and one small randomised controlled trial found that a high volume injection (both with and without corticosteroids) resulted in decreased pain and improved function in the short term (6–12 weeks). As a consequence, this treatment is increasingly being used in the clinical setting although its effectiveness has not been tested in a large well designed study. In this study, we compared the effect of a high volume injection without corticosteroids with a placebo injection (both combined with an exercise programme) on pain and functional outcome at 24 weeks in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Module 5 long-term prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

What is the prognosis of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy in the long term?

This scoping question includes the following three subquestions

What percentage of patients with Achilles tendinopathy have persistent symptoms for more than 1 year?
What percentage of patients with Achilles tendinopathy return to their original level of sport over a period of more than 1 year?
What factors affect the long-term prognosis (longer than 1 year) in patients with Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is not always successful. Recovery can be slow and take months to years. There is insufficient knowledge about the exact prognosis. This applies both to the degree of symptoms and the possibility to return to a desired level of sports, without pain. Knowledge about the prognosis is important to provide realistic expectations for patients. Identifying prognostic factors can help to inform a more accurate prognosis for individual patients. In addition, this provides possible openings for optimising treatment. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations, and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 5.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Inform patients with Achilles tendinopathy about the following long-term consequences:

The majority of patients recover, but there is a chance that symptoms may persist in the long term (at least up to 10 years with 23–37% having persistent symptoms), despite treatment.

The majority of athletes with Achilles tendinopathy return to sports (85%). It is unknown whether this is at original (performance) level and whether this can be done completely asymptomatically.

Inform patients about the inability to provide a long-term prognosis, as prognostic factors for the long term have not been identified.

Tendinopathy has significant consequences for both the athletic population and, more importantly, those who exercise for health or engage in physical activity as part of their occupation. That we are now able to perform high-quality evidence syntheses based on robust primary evidence for a wide range of conditions and therapeutic approaches is a credit to the pioneers who have driven the evidence explosion, and an inspiration for those striving to emulate and build on their achievements. How do we take that evidence and apply it in the clinical setting to individual patients? How do we adjust our decision-making schema in response to the presented information and challenges?

Conclusion

The goal of treatment of patients with chronic complaints of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is to relieve pain. Many surgical procedures focus on the debridement of alterations in the tendon proper. Since up to 34% of asymptomatic tendons show histopathological changes, it is now believed that the tendon proper is not the cause of pain in the majority of patients with symptomatic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Chronic painful tendons show ingrowth of sensory and sympathetic nerves from the paratenon with the release of nociceptive substances. Denervating the Achilles tendon by release of the paratenon is sufficient to cause pain relief in the majority of patients. This type of treatment has the additional advantage that it is associated with a shorter recovery time when compared with treatment options that address the tendon itself.

### Achilles tendinopathy [^1168LK7v]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Achilles tendon pathologies are prevalent, impacting ~6% of the general population and up to 50% of elite endurance runners over their lifetimes. These conditions substantially affect quality of life and work productivity, leading to substantial societal costs. Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a condition marked by localized pain and functional impairment related to mechanical loading. AT can considerably impair participation and potentially also performance in sports and daily activities. The aetiology of AT is multifactorial and repetitive overloading of the tendon is often observed as the inciting factor by health professionals. However, AT can also be associated with adverse effects of certain medication, ageing and various comorbidities. Characteristic tendon changes include proteoglycan accumulation, fluid accumulation with swelling and hypervascularization. Tissue disorganization advances as pathological changes in matrix structure are driven by altered cellular function and makeup, often accompanied by persistent inflammation. Treatment strategies include various interventions, although these can be protracted and challenging for both patients and health-care providers, often with high failure rates. Current research focuses on understanding the pathological processes at the cellular and molecular levels to distinguish between disease categories and to investigate the role of inflammation, metabolic maladaptation and mechanical stress. Emerging therapeutic approaches need to be developed to address these underlying mechanisms. These approaches focus on optimizing rehabilitation protocols and advancing the development of adjunct therapies, such as advanced therapy medicinal products, alongside the integration of precision medicine to improve treatment outcomes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using the following for the assessment of treatment outcomes:

- dynamometry to measure isometric or dynamic maximal strength

### A treatment algorithm for managing achilles tendinopathy: new treatment options [^114Nxov4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy affects athletes, recreational exercisers and even inactive people. The pathology is not inflammatory; it is a failed healing response. The source of pain in tendinopathy could be related to the neurovascular ingrowth seen in the tendon's response to injury. The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative with an array of effective treatment options now available to the primary care practitioner. If conservative treatment is not successful, then surgery relieves pain in the majority of cases. Directing a patient through the algorithm presented here will maximise positive treatment outcomes.

### Injection treatment for chronic midportion achilles tendinopathy: do we need that many alternatives? [^1146ZAni]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is possibly the current most controversial in the line-up of minimally invasive treatment options. PRP is defined as 'any elevated level of platelets'. A PubMed search with 'platelet-rich plasma' generates 5,565 results. A search term such as 'autologous blood' or typographic changes would add many more references. Medical companies legitimately take business advantage of this hype. It is currently used in tendon, muscle and ligament repair, osteoarthritis, surgical wounds and chronic ulcers. However, application has been confusing as each method leads to a different product with different biological characteristics and possible applications. There are at least four different products: pure PRP, leucocyte- and PRP, pure platelet-rich fibrin, and leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin. Some of these products can be activated or non-activated. Many types of platelet collectors have been developed, and platelet concentration varies from 1.6–4.4 fold between suppliers compared to whole blood. One of the goals seems to be to develop a technique that collects the highest concentration of platelets. Autologous whole blood and PRP have been used in midportion Achilles tendinopathy with the aim of providing growth factors to promote healing in areas of degeneration. However if effective, the questions arise: what concentration would suffice, how long do platelets stay where injected and what is their half-life? Supporting the hypothesis that tendinopathy develops due to a failed chemical healing response would then inducing a new chemical reaction suffice? Or are we trying to induce a chemical response in a neurogenic area? Moreover, in case of chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy, the exact location of injection is not always clearly described. Is it possible to inject a substance inside the opaque but degenerative tendon proper? And if so, is this degenerative area really the cause of complaints? Several studies have reported intratendinous changes in up to 34% of cadaver specimens, ultrasound and MRI images of patients without complaints. A long-term follow-up study published by Alfredson and co-workers revealed persistent structural abnormalities and thickening of the tendon 13 years after intratendinous surgery for Achilles tendinopathy, whereas all patients were satisfied with the results and went back to Achilles tendon loading activities without restrictions. If the pain does not come from the tendon proper, where does it originate? Recently various studies have shown ingrowth of sensory- and sympathetic nerves accompanying neovessels from the paratenon with release of nociceptive substances. Denervating the Achilles tendon by release of the peritendineum would hereby hypothetically suffice to relieve pain. Since pain is the predominant symptom in these patients, and it has never been demonstrated that patients with tendinopathy are more prone to rupture, this approach should be sufficient for obtaining a good clinical outcome.

Unlabelled

In Achilles tendinopathy, differentiation should be made between paratendinopathy, insertional- and midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Midportion Achilles tendinopathy is clinically characterized by a combination of pain and swelling at the affected site, with impaired performance as an important consequence. The treatment of midportion Achilles tendinopathy contains both non-surgical and surgical options. Eccentric exercise has shown to be an effective treatment modality. Promising results are demonstrated for extracorporeal shockwave therapy. In terms of the surgical treatment of midportion Achilles tendinopathy, no definite recommendations can be made.

### Diagnostic imaging for achilles tendinopathy: unnecessary scans? Valuable insights? Multidisciplinary clinician-scientists present a nuanced view [^112Z1gDt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Clinical practice guidelines for Achilles tendinopathy do not recommend imaging to inform diagnosis. However, there is considerable variation in how imaging is used, particularly in research and sports. Early imaging risks that people who see the images presume that what they "see" as pathology is the primary cause of pain; patients might end up receiving invasive treatments on the basis of the image when rehabilitation may suffice. On the other hand, imaging can help rule out Achilles tendinopathy and identify differential diagnoses. As more rehabilitation clinicians are direct access practitioners and take on expanded roles as primary health practitioners, ultrasound imaging might serve as a valuable point-of-care tool for diagnosis, identifying conditions that warrant referral and managing conditions like Achilles tendinopathy. We argue that the value of ultrasound imaging to diagnose tendinopathy outweighs the potential limitations. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(1):1–4.

Network meta-analyses

Figure 2A, B shows direct treatment class comparisons in the field of midportion Achilles tendinopathy for VISA-A score. Model fit statistics are reported in online supplementary web appendix 8. Ten classes were included in the network analyses. None of the networks included evidence from both direct and indirect comparisons, so the consistency assumption for NMA could not be checked. Figure 3 shows the comparative treatment class effects on the VISA-A score at 3 months (figure 3A) and 12 months (figure 3B). Figures 4 and 5 show the treatment class rankings for 3 and 12 months. No class analyses could be performed for the VISA-A score at 6 months and return to sports activities at 6 months (only time point in NMA) due to insufficient evidence (online supplementary web appendix 8). Treatment effect NMAs for VISA-A and return to sports activities are presented in online supplementary web appendix 9. No NMA could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Studies that could not be included in the NMA are presented in online supplementary web appendix 10.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^117CXLqU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Twenty-two trials (76%) were at high risk of bias (online supplementary web appendix 6). We had some concerns about bias in seven trials (24%). No trials were at low risk of bias. In studies that used both the VISA-A score and return to sport as outcome measures, there was no difference in risk of bias between the outcomes. In 48% of the trials, outcome measurement was a source of bias. All other sources of bias were also commonly judged as high risk: the randomisation procedure (21%), deviations from the intended intervention (28%), missing outcome data (28%) and selection of reported results (24%).

Certainty of evidence for all comparisons was low to very low, except for autologous blood+eccentric exercise therapy versus placebo injection+eccentric exercise therapy, for which there was moderate certainty of evidence (online supplementary web appendix 7). The main reasons to rate down the certainty of evidence were study limitations (n = 180, 100%) and imprecision (n = 158, 88%). We did not rate down for inconsistency, indirectness or publication bias. Only two treatment comparisons were studied in multiple (ie, 2) trials (ie, platelet-rich plasma injection+eccentric exercise therapy vs placebo injection+eccentric exercise therapy, and laser+eccentric exercise therapy vs placebo laser+eccentric exercise therapy). Where this was the case, estimates and credible intervals had substantial overlap. Populations, treatments and outcome measures followed those used in clinical practice; hence, there was no indication of indirectness in the evidence. We did not assess publication bias because there were fewer than 10 trials available for each of the comparisons.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^111hPN8V]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide a consistently updated overview of the comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Living systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Multiple databases including grey literature sources were searched up to February 2019.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of any treatment in patients with both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We excluded trials with 10 or fewer participants per treatment arm or trials investigating tendon ruptures.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the certainty of evidence.

Primary Outcome Measure

The validated patient-reported Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire.

Results

29 trials investigating 42 different treatments were included. 22 trials (76%) were at high risk of bias and 7 (24%) had some concerns. Most trials included patients with midportion tendinopathy (86%). Any treatment class seemed superior to wait-and-see for midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 3 months (very low to low certainty of evidence). At 12 months, exercise therapy, exercise+injection therapy and exercise+night splint therapy were all comparable with injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy (very low to low certainty). No network meta-analysis could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy.

Summary/Conclusion

In our living network meta-analysis no trials were at low risk of bias and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments seemed superior at 3-month follow-up. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at either 3-month or 12-month follow-up. As exercise therapy is easy to prescribe, can be of low cost and has few harms, clinicians could consider starting treatment with a calf-muscle exercise programme.

### Injection treatment for chronic midportion achilles tendinopathy: do we need that many alternatives? [^113VSc5Q]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

An abundant amount of different treatment modalities has been developed for treatment of chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Amongst them are injection treatments with as corticosteroids, Polidocanol, autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, high-volume injections, hyperosmolar dextrose, brisement, aprotinin and low-dose heparin. The rationale behind these treatments is not always clear. The goal of treatment in general is to relieve symptoms. The main symptom is pain. Up to date, the cause of pain in chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy has not been elucidated however. So what is the rationale behind these treatments?

Corticosteroid injection has become obsolete in the treatment of midportion Achilles tendinopathy, as tendon rupture has been reported in various cases. The role of chemical inflammation in this pathology is also a matter of debate, and therefore there is no rationale for anti-inflammatory treatment. Ultrasound-guided treatment with Polidocanol (Ethoxysclerol) was first described in 2002 as an effective and promising method to obliterate neovessels in and around the tendon, which were hypothesized to be a possible cause of pain. Studies on patellar tendinopathy, lateral epicondylitis, supraspinatus tendinitis, and the effectiveness of larger doses in Achilles tendons followed. However, not all authors have been able to reproduce a good outcome. The blood vessels are unlikely to be the cause of pain. So what is the rationale behind this treatment?

### Optimizing recovery after achilles tendon pain: guidelines help deliver quality care [^116jDv8c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy can temporarily stop many active people, and particularly those who participate in sports. Pain in the Achilles tendon often occurs in the middle of this fibrous tissue that connects the muscles at the back of the lower leg to the heel bone. Physical therapists can help ensure that patients with Achilles tendinopathy receive the best quality care to optimize their recovery. Guidelines published in the May 2018 issue of JOSPT recommend best practices from the published literature for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating Achilles tendon pain. These guidelines also suggest how physical therapists can determine when their patients are ready to return to activities after this injury. For patients, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on scientific research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(5):427. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0506.

Key Points

Question

Compared with placebo injections, do ultrasonography-guided corticosteroid injections improve outcomes in adults with Achilles tendinopathy managed with exercise therapy?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 100 patients, statistically and clinically relevant improvement was found in the group receiving exercise therapy combined with corticosteroid injections.

Meaning

In this study, a combination of exercise therapy and corticosteroid injection was more effective than exercise therapy and a placebo injection in the treatment of patients with long-standing Achilles tendinopathy.

Conclusion

Achilles tendinopathy is a common sporting injury that can result in reduced quality of life and is notorious for its long-lasting symptoms. The Dutch Association for Sports Medicine initiated this new multidisciplinary clinical guideline on Achilles tendinopathy. We followed the standard national comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process. Using patient focus group interviews and a national online survey, we identified current barriers for patients with Achilles tendinopathy. The following domains were deemed important: primary prevention strategies, diagnosis, the role of imaging, effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical treatment options, the prognosis and prevention of a recurrence. Standardised scientific approaches were used, including a systematic search, selection of publication, data extraction, assessing risk of bias and appraising the certainty of evidence. This information was combined with other important considerations, including patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation.

Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations. All the national associations involved approved the guideline in October 2020.

This guideline provides recommendations on primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prevention of recurrence. It is essential for all involved (para)medical professionals who provide care for this patient group to be aware of knowledge in these different domains. By translating and sharing the guideline, our ultimate aim is to improve healthcare for patients with Achilles tendinopathy across the world.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition that impacts on sports participation and quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, resulting in high healthcare consumption.
There is inconclusive evidence on risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis for Achilles tendinopathy.

What are the new findings

Each module contains recommendations for clinical practice — the most important are:
Diagnosis: establish the diagnosis 'Achilles tendinopathy' when the following four clinical diagnostic criteria are all present: localised symptoms, symptoms related to (sports) activity, localised thickening and presence of pain on palpation.
Treatment: consider including the following three aspects in basic management for at least 12 weeks: patient education, load management and calf muscle exercise therapy.
Treatment: consider additional therapies in cases of non-response to adequately performed basic management. Be cautious with using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or local corticosteroid injections. Consider surgery only if more than six months of basic management and additional therapies do not improve symptoms.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^116h2epe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging is frequently used in patients with Achilles tendon complaints. X-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans have prominent roles in imaging. In clinical practice, prognostic value is often attributed to the findings on imaging. On the other hand, imaging can have negative effects through radiation risks, misinterpretation by healthcare providers (leading to unnecessary additional imaging and interventions) and patients (leading to confusion, catastrophising, fear and avoidance of movement, and low expectations of recovery). It is important that the additional value and potential negative consequences of using imaging for healthcare providers and patients is clear.

Treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is initially non-surgical. If non-surgical treatment fails, surgical interventions may be considered. In current clinical practice, the use of treatment options is often variable and suboptimal. There are also no clear guidelines on load management during sports.

Achilles tendinopathy seems to have an unfavourable long-term prognosis. In clinical practice, it is desirable to be able to predict which patients recover and who will continue to experience chronic symptoms. Knowledge of prognostic factors is important to be able to do this. Finally, preventiing recurrent symptoms is important. A practical, step-by-step treatment strategy for Achilles tendinopathy is necessary based on existing guidelines and evidence. The complete guideline process is described in online supplemental file 'Guideline process'.

Aim of the guideline

The aim was to develop a multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline on the risk factors, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, prognosis and prevention of Achilles tendinopathy. The guideline provides guidance on how to manage the challenges for patients with Achilles tendinopathy in the primary and secondary healthcare settings.

A multidisciplinary working group was set up to develop this guideline. The working group consisted of representatives of relevant specialties involved in the care of Achilles tendinopathy. The online supplemental file 'Guideline process' shows the composition of the working group.

The conclusions in this guideline indicate the level of evidence. The recommendations are aimed at optimal care and are based on the results of both scientific research and the considerations of the working group, in which the patient perspective has an important role. Ultimately, this should lead to the overall aim, which is to reduce pain and improve the function and activity level in patients with Achilles tendinopathy by optimising care.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^114tG53A]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

We compared treatments in an NMA despite some of these treatments having never been compared head-to-head in trials. Our living NMA will be updated at least every 5 years, which allows for a contemporary evidence synthesis for clinical practice. The protocol was registered prospectively and patients were involved in selecting outcomes most relevant to them in the design phase.

The small sample sizes and bias in the included trials limit our conclusions. Many of the investigated treatments were not connected to the network, which hampered assessing the comparative effectiveness of all available treatments. Sources of heterogeneity could not be investigated as there were less than the required 10 trials per comparison. None of the comparisons in the networks had both direct and indirect evidence and so we could not check the consistency.

Treatment outcomes may be different on the basis of some patient characteristics and previous Achilles tendinopathy treatment. For example, a sedentary population may respond to exercise treatment differently compared with an athletic population. Other effect modifiers may be unilateral/bilateral symptoms, duration of symptoms and type/number of previous treatments. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is presently no evidence supporting any of these factors as treatment effect modifiers. The limited amount of study-level data precluded investigating effect modification. This may be possible in the future using pooled individual patient data.

### Gastrocnemius release is an effective management option for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^117THkQw]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This systematic review aims to summarise the outcomes of gastrocnemius release in the management of Achilles Tendinopathy.

Methods

A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A computer-based search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Scopus and ISI Web of Science. Two independent reviewers performed both title/abstract and full-text screening according to a-priori selection criteria. English-language original research studies reporting outcomes for gastrocnemius recession in patients with Achilles tendinopathy were included. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the MINORS criteria.

Results

Of the 229 articles identified following database searching, nine studies describing 145 cases of gastrocnemius recession were included in the review. Clinically important differences were reported across a range of validated patient reported outcome scores including VISA-A, FFI, FAAM and VAS pain score. Outcomes appear to be superior in patients with noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy, however further research is required to confirm this. Studies also reported an increase in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and a good rate of return to sport/work. The overall complication rate was 10/123 (8.1%), with sural nerve injury being the most common complication, occurring in 5/123 (4.1%) of cases.

Conclusion

The results of this review suggest gastrocnemius release to be an effective treatment option in the management of patients with Achilles tendinopathy, who have gastrocnemius contracture and have previously failed to respond adequately to non-operative treatment.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^113cdthZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our living NMA of 29 RCTs on Achilles tendinopathy included 42 different treatments. No trials were at low risk of bias, most had only short follow-up, and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, active treatments seem superior to wait-and-see at 3-month follow-up. There was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at 3-month and 12-month follow-up. Calf-muscle exercise therapy is easy to prescribe in practice, is widely available, and is regarded as safe and cheap. Consequently, clinicians should consider starting this as initial treatment.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition where one in four patients still has symptoms after 10 years.
Achilles tendinopathy can be disabling and impacts on quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, which represents high healthcare consumption.
The comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy is currently unknown.

What are the new findings

In our living network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of patients with Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments were found to be superior to it.
Given the large uncertainty in comparative estimates and risk of bias in the studies, no specific treatment can be recommended over another.

### Achilles tendinopathy: a review of the current concepts of treatment [^116C4MMQ]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The two main categories of Achilles tendon disorder are broadly classified by anatomical location to include non-insertional and insertional conditions. Non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy is often managed conservatively, and many rehabilitation protocols have been adapted and modified, with excellent clinical results. Emerging and popular alternative therapies, including a variety of injections and extracorporeal shockwave therapy, are often combined with rehabilitation protocols. Surgical approaches have developed, with minimally invasive procedures proving popular. The management of insertional Achilles tendinopathy is improved by recognising coexisting pathologies around the insertion. Conservative rehabilitation protocols as used in non-insertional disorders are thought to prove less successful, but such methods are being modified, with improving results. Treatment such as shockwave therapy is also proving successful. Surgical approaches specific to the diagnosis are constantly evolving, and good results have been achieved.

### Mid-portion achilles tendinopathy – current options for treatment [^115rFd3Y]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report on the present option for management of tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon.

Background

Tendinopathy of the main body of tendo Achillis affects athletic and sedentary patients. Mechanical loading is thought to be a major causative factor. However, the exact mechanical loading conditions which cause tendinopathy are poorly defined. Repetitive mechanical loading induces a non-inflammatory pathology, and repetitive microtrauma ultimately exceeds the healing response. The management of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative. Although many non-operative options are available, few have been tested under controlled conditions. This review article specifically focuses on eccentric training, and on shock wave therapy. Surgical intervention can be successful in refractory cases. However, surgery does not usually completely eliminate symptoms and complications are not rare.

Conclusions

Further studies are needed to discern the optimal non-operative and surgical management of midsubstance Achilles tendinopathy.

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^116aPGLg]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and disabling musculoskeletal condition. First-line management involving Achilles tendon loading exercise with, or without, other modalities may not resolve the problem in up to 44% of cases. Many people receive injections. Yet there are no injection treatments with demonstrated long-term efficacy. The aim of the trial is to examine the 12-month efficacy of high-volume injection (HVI) with corticosteroid and HVI without corticosteroid versus sham injection among individuals with AT.

Methods and Analysis

The trial is a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind, superiority randomised controlled trial that will assess the efficacy of HVI with and without corticosteroid versus sham up to 12months. We will block-randomise 192 participants to one of the three groups with a 1:1:1 ratio, and both participants and outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation. All participants will receive an identical evidence-based education and exercise intervention. The primary outcome measure will be the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A) at 12 months post-randomisation, a validated, reliable and disease-specific measure of pain and function. Choice of secondary outcomes was informed by core outcome domains for tendinopathy. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.

Ethics and Dissemination

Ethics approval was obtained via the Monash University Human Ethics Committee (no: 13138). The study is expected to be completed in 2024 and disseminated via peer review publication and conference presentations.

Trial Registration Number

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^116knrNr]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

AT is common and disabling. As many as up to 44% of people with AT fail to recover with conservative first-line treatmentand are offered other treatments including injections. Despite the common use of injections, there are currently no injection treatments for AT with demonstrated efficacy. Although corticosteroid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy, there may be recurrence of symptoms for some people in the longer term. The lack of an efficacious injection for AT may prolong disability for many people who are affected and significantly increase healthcare use and costs. HVI may be an effective treatment for AT but has not been adequately tested. The proposed trial will address this knowledge gap by evaluating the efficacy of the HVI with and without corticosteroid versus sham for AT over 12 months. This research has the potential to enhance recovery of patients thereby improving clinical outcomes and reduce societal costs by reducing failed injection treatments and ongoing disability.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

The uncertainty around the effectiveness for specific treatments has previously been described in Achilles tendinopathy. Most recent meta-analyses on treatment effectiveness for Achilles tendinopathy did not find superiority of a single treatment. All other systematic reviews included randomised clinical trials or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials and made strong to weak recommendations in favour of exercise therapy, platelet-rich plasmaor against platelet-rich plasmaor splintingsingle therapies. Our NMA results conflict with a recent systematic review with head-to-head meta-analysis where prolotherapy and sclerotherapy were superior to other treatments. Differences in study selection criteria (case series were also included vs only randomised clinical trials in our NMA) and outcome measure selection (eg, general Visual Analogue Scale vs a validated patient-reported outcome measure in our NMA) may explain the discrepancy.

Unanswered questions and future research

As uncertainty around treatment effectiveness remains, future trials should be adequately powered and designed. Universally agreed diagnostic criteria for both insertional and midportion Achilles tendinopathy are needed to prevent heterogeneity in included participants. More trials investigating treatment effects for insertional Achilles tendinopathy are warranted. New trials should include exercise therapy as a stand-alone comparator with long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up. This would facilitate assessment of the comparative effectiveness of new treatments in the network. Based on our findings it is not ethical to perform new studies using wait-and-see as a treatment arm. The role of patient education has never been explored, but should be further assessed. Trialists must include measures from the core outcome set for tendinopathy (patient overall rating, participation, pain on activity/loading, disability, function, physical function capacity, quality of life, psychology and pain over a specified timeframe). We identified eight ongoing trials on the effectiveness of multiple treatments for Achilles tendinopathy. We aim to perform horizon scanning annually to screen for recently published trials. In case of relevant trials, we will update the analyses and publish the results when there are important changes that affect clinical care. We plan to update this 'living' systematic review and NMA at least every 5 years as part of the Dutch national guideline revision process.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^111PxWkS]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy — prognosis and management indicates that the long-term prognosis for acute-to-subchronic cases is favorable with nonoperative treatment, with significant decreases in pain and improved function after 6 to 12 weeks of intervention, and long-term follow-up ranging between 2 and 8 years suggesting that between 71% to 100% of patients can return to prior activity levels with minimal or no complaints. Conservative therapy is initially recommended, and when conservative treatment fails, surgery is recommended to remove fibrotic adhesions and degenerative nodules to restore vascularity. In an 8-year follow-up study, 29% of those with acute to subacute Achilles tendinopathy required surgical intervention, and retrospective studies report surgical rates for those failing conservative treatment ranging from 24% to 49%. Those who responded to nonoperative therapy tended to be younger (average age, 33 years) than those requiring surgery (average age, 48 years), and Four to 6 months of conservative intervention is recommended for those with Achilles tendinopathy.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^115HyTud]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this living systematic review and NMA, none of the trials were at low risk of bias, and all evaluated treatments had large uncertainty in the estimates. From a myriad of treatments for midportion Achilles tendinopathy, active treatment classes seem to have clinically meaningful benefits (mean difference exceeded VISA-A MID of 15 points) at 3 months compared with wait-and-see. For two classes (acupuncture therapy, and shockwave therapy combined with exercise therapy), the credible intervals exceeded the MID of 15 points. However, these results were based on two small trials (64 and 68 included patients, respectively) at high risk of bias. There were no estimates for effectiveness of wait-and-see at 12 months. The effectiveness of most active treatments in the long term is uncertain. At 12 months, there was no difference between exercise therapy, injection therapies and combined therapies.

Clinical implications

Based on the findings in this study, we advise against recommending wait-and-see therapy as a treatment strategy. Active treatments had overlapping comparative effects, leaving uncertainty about which treatment is best for Achilles tendinopathy. Shared decision-making plays an important role in managing Achilles tendinopathy. Safety profile, treatment availability and costs should be considered in this clinical decision-making process. Calf-muscle exercise therapy is easy to prescribe because it is easy to instruct, can be cheap, is available everywhere and has a low risk of harm.

The preinjury activity level could play an important role in the response to treatments such as exercise therapy as this will possibly influence the load that can be applied to the tendon. There is currently no tool available to distinguish sedentary from athletic patients, and people define this differently. When a patient is considered to be sedentary, the VISA-A score could be less sensitive to changes as 40% of the score can be obtained from sporting activities. Therefore, a novel modified version of the existing VISA-A questionnaire is currently being developed to evaluate treatment response in sedentary individuals. In two trials, lower baseline VISA-A score was associated with a greater increase in VISA-A score. This is most likely explained by regression to the mean (outliers will tend to move towards the mean score). Furthermore, physical activity level was not a prognostic factor for change in VISA-A score in the trials that attempted to measure physical activity. More research is needed to determine whether athletic and sedentary patients should be considered separate patient groups.

Module 4 treatment of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

What is the effectiveness of current treatments for Achilles tendinopathy?

This scoping question includes the following six submodules

Which measurement instruments are best suited for monitoring a treatment effect?
What is the effect of a wait-and-see policy in Achilles tendinopathy?
Which non-surgical treatment is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?
Is surgery more effective than non-surgical treatment for Achilles tendinopathy?
Which factors influence treatment effects in Achilles tendinopathy?
What advice (self-management and patient education) should be given to patients with Achilles tendinopathy regarding lifestyle, work and sports loading?

Submodule 4.1 measurement instruments

Which measurement instruments are best suited for monitoring a treatment effect?

Introduction

Problem

There are many potential outcome measures for evaluating Achilles tendinopathy. This makes comparing different treatment modalities very difficult. Consensus on the outcome measures to be used is therefore important. The outcome measures should be considered relevant by both patients and healthcare providers and it is important to include both perspectives when advising a 'core outcome set' for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider using the VISA-A questionnaire to evaluate the course of Achilles tendinopathy.

Do not request imaging to monitor treatment response and/or predict the course of symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy.

Submodule 4.2: wait-and-see policy

What is the effect of a wait-and-see policy in Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The initial advice for Achilles tendinopathy often consists of temporarily adjusting or stopping the (sports) load that probably caused the injury and wait and see. There is currently insufficient insight into the natural course of Achilles tendinopathy in the absence of active treatment. The search question is therefore whether active treatment should be used or whether a wait-and-see policy is also sufficient. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Inform patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy that no, or only limited improvements, are expected in the short term as a result of a wait-and-see policy.

### Is platelet-rich plasma effective in treating achilles tendinopathy? A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115BvdBZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Several meta-analyses have evaluated the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy. Although they generally did not find PRP to be effective, an updated meta-analysis containing all the available, high-quality randomized trial evidence that addresses the methodological shortcomings identified in earlier meta-analyses needs to be performed.

Question/Purposes

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PRP in improving (1) pain and function as assessed using the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment and (2) VAS pain scores 3 months after treatment in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from their inception until June 2024, focusing on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing PRP with placebo or other treatments for Achilles tendinopathy. Our search identified 1289 studies, of which 1262 were excluded after removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, leaving 27 studies for detailed review. Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 422 patients, with a predominance of participants who were men. Publication bias was suggested by funnel plot asymmetry, which suggested that, if anything, the results may have overstated the apparent benefit of PRP treatment. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials, revealing an overall low or unclear risk of bias. The primary outcomes were pain relief and functional improvement, assessed using the VAS, scored 0 to 10, with higher scores representing more severe pain, and VISA-A score, scored 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better pain and function. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I 2 statistics, and a random-effects model was applied due to substantial heterogeneity. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.4 and RStudio, version 764.

Results

We found no benefit in terms of VISA-A scores favoring PRP over placebo at 3 months (mean difference 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.8 to 5.2]; p = 0.34), 6 months (mean difference 0.5 [95% CI [-8.5 to 9.3]; p = 0.92), or 1 year (mean difference -7.9 [95% CI -27.3 to 11.6]; p = 0.43). PRP did not improve VAS pain scores at 3 months (mean difference -0.22 [95% CI -0.56 to 0.12]; p = 0.21). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. PRP showed no difference compared with stromal vascular fraction and was less effective in the short term compared with high-volume injection.

Conclusion

Until future high-quality RCTs show a clear clinical benefit, PRP should not be used to treat Achilles tendinopathy. Our analysis found that PRP does not improve pain or function compared with placebo, and potential publication bias suggests that the apparent benefits may be inflated. Surgeons should be cautious when considering PRP for this condition, and future research should focus on larger trials with standardized protocols to provide more definitive guidance.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Advise active treatment.

Treatment should be provided by a healthcare provider who is sufficiently qualified (medical or paramedical healthcare provider).

Discuss the initial active treatment options together with the patient. Start treatment of midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy with:

Patient education: Explanation about the condition. Explanation about the prognosis. Pain education and addressing psychological factors.
Loading advice: Temporary cessation of pain provoking (sports) activities. Temporary replacement of provocative (sports) activities with non-provocative (sports) activities. Gradual increase of the load of (sports) activities. Use a pain scale to monitor the level of complaints related to (sports) activities and adjust these activities based on the pain scale.

Progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises for at least 12 weeks (figure 3). The form of exercise therapy should be suitable for the individual patient. Consider the role of: motivation, time constraints, pain monitoring and availability of facilities and resources. For insertional Achilles tendinopathy, consider initially performing exercises on a flat surface.

After 3 months of patient education, structural exercise therapy and following loading advice, if there is still no improvement discuss additional treatment options. Discuss the uncertainty surrounding of the additional effect and the advantages and disadvantages of any additional treatment. The best treatment option can then be decided together with the patient.

The following additional treatment options can be considered in case of insufficient effectiveness of patient education and loading advice in combination with continued exercise therapy:

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
Other passive modalities (the use of a night splint, inlays, use of collagen supplements, application of ultrasound and friction massages, laser therapy and light therapy).

Figure 3
Proposed flow chart for designing the progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles) and plyometric exercises. The degree of pain (measured by a Visual Analogue Scale or Numeric Rating Scale) during and after the exercises and the muscle fatigue are leading for the speed of the progression. Note that for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, exercises are initially advised on a flat surface.
