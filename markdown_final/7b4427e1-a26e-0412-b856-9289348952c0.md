## Question

Do statins have a role in reducing Lp(a) levels in addition to their LDL-lowering effects?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statins reduce lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol, and if not, what the clinical implications are for residual risk and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence on statins and Lp(a). Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility for why statins might or might not affect Lp(a). Next, I will quantify the magnitude of any statin effect on Lp(a) and compare it with alternatives like PCSK9 inhibitors. After that, I need to assess how Lp(a) behaves as an independent risk factor on statin therapy. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical guidance, including when to escalate therapy and how to monitor patients with elevated Lp(a) on statins.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality evidence. Large, individual-patient meta-analyses of randomized statin trials show that statins do not meaningfully lower Lp(a); in fact, they may leave Lp(a) unchanged or slightly increase it, and potent LDL-C lowering with statins does not offset Lp(a)-mediated risk, indicating independent pathways of risk [^9dfb8722] [^8acd69a1] [^de10433e].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of any statin effect on Lp(a). The JUPITER analysis found a median change in Lp(a) of zero with rosuvastatin, with only a small upward shift in the distribution, and the NLA focused update estimates an average increase of about 1.1 mg/dL (approximately 0.1% relative increase), which is clinically negligible and should not deter statin use [^cfd2f8a4] [^ae1e158a]. I should double-check older or smaller studies suggesting statins lower Lp(a); indeed, some trials in familial hypercholesterolemia reported modest Lp(a) reductions with atorvastatin or simvastatin, but these findings conflict with the weight of evidence and are not generalizable to typical populations, so I should not over-interpret them [^305ed4cb] [^f02520c3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the biology. Lp(a) is assembled extracellularly from apo(a) and LDL-like particles, and its plasma concentration is primarily determined by hepatic apo(a) synthesis rather than LDL receptor–mediated clearance; statins upregulate LDL receptors and lower LDL-C, but this does not translate into consistent Lp(a) lowering, which explains the discordant clinical effects seen in trials and reviews [^200e4c97] [^ea29d639]. I should confirm that PCSK9 inhibitors behave differently; yes, PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) by about 20–30% via mechanisms that likely include both increased clearance and reduced production, which is why they can address Lp(a)-related residual risk in selected patients [^decd3875] [^ff116cdc].

> Next, I should review how Lp(a) behaves as a risk factor on statin therapy. Elevated Lp(a) remains independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events even when LDL-C is aggressively lowered on statins, and the risk is approximately log-linear without a clear threshold, reinforcing that Lp(a) represents a distinct, additive risk pathway that statins do not mitigate [^9dfb8722] [^8acd69a1] [^de10433e]. Let me consider whether correcting LDL-C for Lp(a)-cholesterol changes this; even after such corrections, Lp(a)-mediated risk persists, supporting the concept of true residual risk from Lp(a) on statins [^8db8e94f].

> I need to ensure the clinical translation is precise. Guidelines advise that elevated Lp(a) be used as a risk enhancer to favor statin initiation or intensification, but they also recommend more aggressive LDL-C lowering when Lp(a) is high because statins do not lower Lp(a) and therefore cannot offset its risk; in very high-risk patients who remain above LDL-C thresholds, adding ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable to address both LDL-C and Lp(a)-related residual risk [^e9ef7f2e] [^84939dff] [^decd3875]. But wait, what if the patient has FH and very high Lp(a)? In that scenario, lipoprotein apheresis is an FDA-approved option for select refractory cases, underscoring that statins alone are insufficient for Lp(a)-driven risk in extreme phenotypes [^8286b283].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and follow-up. Because Lp(a) is genetically determined and relatively stable over time, repeating Lp(a) is not routinely necessary after the initial measurement; the clinical priority remains aggressive management of modifiable risk, especially LDL-C, while recognizing that Lp(a) confers persistent residual risk that may justify escalation to PCSK9 inhibitors in appropriate patients [^c307be2a] [^decd3875]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary statements; yes, the NLA and ACC/AHA-aligned guidance emphasize measuring Lp(a) once in adulthood and using it to guide intensity of LDL-C lowering rather than serial Lp(a) tracking [^c307be2a] [^e9ef7f2e].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line is consistent with the totality of evidence: statins do not meaningfully reduce Lp(a) levels and may modestly increase them on average, so Lp(a)-mediated cardiovascular risk remains largely unaddressed by statins; therefore, clinicians should intensify LDL-C lowering and consider PCSK9 inhibitors in high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a), while awaiting definitive outcome data from Lp(a)-specific therapies [^9dfb8722] [^ae1e158a] [^decd3875] [^de768117].

---

Statins do not lower Lp(a) and may modestly increase it by ~1–2 mg/dL on average, so they do not address Lp(a)-mediated cardiovascular risk [^ae1e158a] [^9dfb8722]. Elevated Lp(a) remains an **independent risk factor** even with aggressive LDL-C lowering, so management should prioritize **LDL-C targets** and consider PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis for high-risk patients with persistently elevated Lp(a) [^8acd69a1] [^decd3875] [^8286b283]. Routine Lp(a) measurement is recommended at least once in adulthood to guide risk stratification and therapy intensity [^c307be2a] [^e9ef7f2e].

## Effect of statins on Lp(a) levels

- **Neutral or slight increase**: Statins generally do not lower Lp(a) and may modestly increase levels by ~1–2 mg/dL (~0.1% relative increase) [^ae1e158a] [^9dfb8722].
- **JUPITER trial**: Rosuvastatin did not significantly change median Lp(a), but there was a small upward shift in the distribution (P < 0.0001) [^cfd2f8a4].
- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple analyses show no clinically meaningful Lp(a) reduction with statins; some report a slight increase [^9dfb8722] [^13942afc].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated Lp(a) on statin therapy

- **Independent risk**: Elevated Lp(a) remains an independent risk factor for ASCVD even with aggressive LDL-C lowering, including on statins [^8acd69a1] [^de10433e].
- **Residual risk**: Patients with high Lp(a) have persistent residual risk despite achieving LDL-C goals, underscoring the need for additional strategies [^8acd69a1] [^de10433e].
- **Guideline stance**: Elevated Lp(a) is a risk enhancer that supports more intensive LDL-C lowering and consideration of additional therapies [^e9ef7f2e] [^84939dff].

## Alternative therapies for Lp(a) lowering

| **Therapy** | **Effect on lp(a)** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab) | 20–30% reduction | - FOURIER and ODYSSEY show greater event reduction in patients with higher baseline Lp(a) [^decd3875] [^b68e596e] |
| Lipoprotein apheresis | 60–80% reduction | Indicated for high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 60 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite maximal therapy [^8286b283] |
| Antisense oligonucleotides (pelacarsen) | > 70% reduction | Phase 3 trials underway to assess cardiovascular outcomes [^notfound] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Measure Lp(a)**: At least once in adulthood for risk stratification [^c307be2a] [^e9ef7f2e].
- **Risk categories**: < 75 nmol/L low; 75–125 nmol/L intermediate; ≥ 125 nmol/L high risk [^c307be2a] [^d03224b7].
- **Intensive LDL-C lowering**: Recommended when Lp(a) is elevated to mitigate residual risk [^e9ef7f2e] [^84939dff].
- **Add-on therapy**: Consider PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis in high-risk patients with persistently elevated Lp(a) [^decd3875] [^8286b283].

---

## Conclusion and clinical takeaways

Statins do not lower Lp(a) and may modestly increase it, so **Lp(a)-mediated risk persists** despite LDL-C control. Management should focus on **aggressive LDL-C lowering** and consider PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis for high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a). Routine Lp(a) measurement helps identify patients who warrant intensified therapy and cascade screening of relatives [^c307be2a] [^d03224b7].

### New therapeutic principles in dyslipidaemia: focus on LDL and Lp (a) lowering drugs [^370e2db3]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Dyslipidaemias play a key role in determining cardiovascular risk; the discovery of statins has contributed a very effective approach. However, many patients do not achieve, at the maximal tolerated dose, the recommended goals for low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Available agents combined with statins can provide additional LDL-C reduction, and agents in development will increase therapeutic options impacting also other atherogenic lipoprotein classes. In fact, genetic insights into mechanisms underlying regulation of LDL-C levels has expanded potential targets of drug therapy and led to the development of novel agents. Among them are modulators of apoB containing lipoproteins production and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors. Alternative targets such as lipoprotein(a) also require attention; however, until we have a better understanding of these issues, further LDL-C lowering in high and very high-risk patients will represent the most sound clinical approach.

Investigations and measurement.

There is no consensus regarding screening individuals for Lp(a) levels. Some guideline committees, such as the European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology and Canadian Cardiovascular Society, suggest measuring Lp(a) once as an adult for risk stratification. Other societies, such as the National Lipid Association, suggest screening only in high-risk situations, such as in individuals with a personal or family history of premature ASCVD, or those with known FH. At high concentrations, Lp(a) can interfere with LDL determination as a substantial portion of measured LDL-C may be contained within Lp(a) particles; therefore, measurement of Lp(a) may also be warranted in anyone who presents with LDL-C levels > 5.0 mmol/L (> 194 mg/dL) or reduced responsiveness to statins.

Because circulating Lp(a) is thought to remain relatively stable throughout life, once a baseline level is obtained, further monitoring is not required. Mass measurements of Lp(a) are less useful for predicting ASCVD risk; therefore, assays that measure molar concentrations are preferred. A high level of Lp(a) is considered to be ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL).

Management.

Pharmacologic treatments targeting Lp(a) are currently in development, with an antisense oligonucleotide against Lp(a) demonstrating up to an 80% lowering. Ongoing outcome studies will establish if there is a role for this agent to treat elevated Lp(a) in ASCVD prevention. Until this is clarified, management of other ASCVD risk factors should be the mainstay of treatment for individuals with elevated Lp(a). More aggressive LDL-C lowering than would otherwise be recommended based on cardiovascular risk assessment may be warranted in those with elevated Lp(a).

Of currently approved lipid agents, statins can elevate Lp(a) levels, but are nonetheless considered first-line treatment in patients with high Lp(a) because of their general benefit with respect to elevated ASCVD risk. Ezetimibe has a neutral effect on Lp(a), whereas niacin lowers Lp(a). In a meta-analysis that included 6566 individuals, PCSK9 inhibitors lowered Lp(a) by 26%, although Lp(a) lowering is not currently an approved use for these agents.

TABLE 3
Lipid‐lowering therapies and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]‐associated risk.

In addition to global risk factor control and a healthy lifestyle, there is evidence for the role of statin therapy in reducing risk among individuals with elevated Lp(a). Introduced in the 2018 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines, elevated Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L is defined as a risk‐enhancer that favours initiation of statin therapy. Post hoc analyses from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) provide the strongest evidence to support these recommendations. Among nearly 8000 JUPITER participants, on‐statin Lp(a) was independently associated with a 25% higher risk of the composite outcome in JUPITER, defined as incident myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina, arterial revascularisation or cardiovascular death. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the risk for the primary composite outcome in JUPITER for individuals with Lp(a) < median (53% relative risk reduction) versus ≥ median (38% relative risk reduction) with no significant interaction according to Lp(a). Such analyses were performed among White participants in JUPITER who had a median Lp(a) of 23 nmol/L. While Lp(a) values may modestly rise with statin therapy, post hoc analyses from JUPITER demonstrate that statin therapy is associated with a lower risk of incident ASCVD across the spectrum of Lp(a) values. However, individuals on statin therapy with elevated Lp(a) experience residual risk across the spectrum of achieved low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol, and LDL‐C lowering does not fully offset Lp(a)‐mediated risk.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^ae1e158a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Statins — across guidelines, statins remain first-line therapy for mitigating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–driven atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; although statins do not lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it, they reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by "approximately 22% for each 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C." Median Lp(a) was not affected by rosuvastatin in JUPITER, and on-treatment Lp(a) increases with statins are minimal on average ("approximate 1.1-mg/dL increase or 0.1% relative increase"). Concerns about Lp(a) elevation "should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue statins."

In this meta-analysis of statin trials, Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were independent and additive cardiovascular risk factors, and potent LDL-C level reduction did not offset Lp(a)-mediated risk. Our findings emphasize the need for testing and incorporation of Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment. Future trials will elucidate the role of targeted Lp(a) therapeutics for cardiovascular risk reduction in the context of LDL-C levels.

### Lipoprotein (a): the perpetual supporting actor [^099f1400]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Lp(a): what do guidelines tell us?

The 2010 consensus document on Lp(a) from the European Society of Cardiology proposed a linear association between Lp(a) levels and CVD events, which might be too simplistic given the level of interaction and modification that LDL-C levels appear to have on cardiovascular risk. Measurement of Lp(a) is recommended in clinical practice in the following settings: (i) premature CVD, (ii) FH, (iii) a family history of CVD or elevated Lp(a), and (iv) recurrent CVD despite optimal statin therapy and ≥ 5% 10 year risk of fatal CVD according to Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE). The treatment goal for CVD patients is first to lower LDL-C levels and reach desirable Lp(a) levels < 50 mg/dL. However, to date, there is no evidence that lowering Lp(a) really does improve clinical outcomes or that this molecule is a critical target to decrease residual risk. Statin treatment is not associated with a reduction of Lp(a), as opposed to PCSK9 inhibitors, which have been demonstrated to significantly reduce Lp(a) by 20–30%. In the case of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, Lp(a) reduction is systematically correlated with LDL-C reduction, and it is most probably the increased levels of LDL-receptor expression typically induced by PCSK9 inhibitors that lead to subsequent lowering of circulating Lp(a) levels. The beneficial effect of PCSK9 inhibition on clinical events therefore seems to be mediated by reductions in LDL-C levels, while it remains unclear what benefit the concomitant decrease of Lp(a) might have. Recently, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeting Apo(a) in persons with elevated Lp(a) has shown very impressive results in lowering Lp(a) levels (≥ 70–80% decrease). A clinical study of cardiovascular outcomes is now required to evaluate the impact of specifically reducing Lp(a). A phase 2B trial will start to recruit patients with elevated Lp(a), defined as Lp(a) ≥ 60 mg/dL, and established CVD to test the efficacy and safety of ISIS 681257 administered subcutaneously with a target sample size of 270 participants (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03070782).

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^e0645101]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment

Studies using niacin alone or in combination with, for example, statins have shown cardiovascular benefit; – niacin reduces Lp(a) levels by up to 30–40% in a dose-dependent manner and in addition exerts other potential beneficial effects by reducing LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and remnant cholesterol and by raising HDL cholesterol. In a meta-analysis including 11 randomized controlled trials with 2682 patients in the active group and 3934 in the control group, niacin 1–3 g/day reduced major coronary events by 25% (95% CI: 13–35%), stroke by 26% (8–41%), and any cardiovascular event by 27% (15–37%).

However, there have been no randomized, controlled intervention trials with selective reduction in plasma lipoprotein(a) levels aimed to reduce CVD: we urgently need trials demonstrating that selective reduction of Lp(a) in those with Lp(a) above the 80th percentile will benefit clinically with reduced CVD. Until such trials are published, reduction in Lp(a) should mainly be achieved using niacin, as the use of niacin for CVD risk reduction as described above is evidence-based. However, in addition to lowering Lp(a), niacin lowers LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and remnant cholesterol and concomitantly increases HDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, the favourable effects of niacin on CVD cannot be ascribed solely to Lp(a) reduction. Nevertheless, these studies clearly demonstrate that the use of niacin for reduction in Lp(a) to the suggested desirable levels (Table 2) is safe and in all likelihood beneficial.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^93a15ec2]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Statin use is associated with reduced ASCVD risk, but statins do not lower Lp(a) levels and may increase them, and therefore may not modify an important contributor to risk. – Conversely, the benefit of PCSK9i, which lower both LDL-C and Lp(a) levels, appears to be augmented in those with elevated Lp(a) level. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists empiric formularelates absolute reduction in LDL-C level to relative reduction in cardiovascular risk under statin treatment, but it was derived without consideration of Lp(a) levels. Based on these considerations, it is possible that the canonical Cholesterol Treatment Trialists relationship actually reflects an aggregate of a family of relationships that differ according to the prevailing level of Lp(a).

With the advent of targeted therapies for Lp(a), it is important to understand the interaction between LDL-C and Lp(a) for ASCVD risk and the corresponding therapeutic implications. A participant-level meta-analysis of 6 placebo-controlled statin trials was performed to determine the continuous association between baseline Lp(a) level and ASCVD risk in placebo- or statin-treated patients and the association of risk for ASCVD events with elevated Lp(a) level across statin-achieved LDL-C levels.

### Statins and Lp (a): the plot thickens [^24acde21]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

The current study findings also add to the discussion whether Lp(a) levels should be measured before and after initiation of statin therapy and illustrate the need to evaluate variability in Lp(a)-increasing potential of various statin treatments as well as taking apo(a) properties into account. In this regard, identification of carriers of small apo(a) sizes (≤ 22K4 repeats) among statin users may help alleviate the residual risk through re-evaluation of treatment strategies and/or alternative approaches.

The role of statin-induced Lp(a) increase in residual CVD risk among statin-treated patients remains unclear and carefully designed future studies are required to address these uncertainties. The role of Lp(a) cholesterol levels versus LDL-C also deserves attention. While statins reduce LDL-C, an increase in Lp(a) levels would suggest an increase in Lp(a) cholesterol as well, resulting in a change in the ratio of LDL-C/Lp(a)-cholesterol among statin-treated patients, as pointed out by Scanu and Hinman. Such changes may complicate the interpretation of what is commonly perceived as LDL-C (i.e. a combination of LDL-C and Lp(a) cholesterol) by both patients and practitioners monitoring statin therapy. Importantly, there is still a significant need for additional lipid-lowering therapy as recently noted in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline of the presence of ~56 million adult Americans (40–75 years) eligible to receive statins and a better understanding of the impact of statins on Lp(a) level is therefore of significant interest. Such studies might also open new opportunities to better understand Lp(a) metabolic properties.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^de10433e]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large participant-level meta-analysis of statin trials, it was observed that baseline Lp(a) level was associated with cardiovascular risk continuously and independently of baseline LDL-C, elevated Lp(a) level was associated with increased risk even when LDL-C was treated to low levels with statin therapy (both by achieved levels and absolute change), and the greatest risk occurred when both Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were elevated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Lp(a) and LDL-C are independent and additive for cardiovascular risk, even on statin treatment, and LDL-C reduction does not completely offset Lp(a)-mediated risk.

Our study has important clinical implications for the management of patients with elevated Lp(a) level. First, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence that reducing LDL-C can fully offset the risk associated with Lp(a), both when assessed by achieved levels and absolute change, emphasizing that both are important targets for risk reduction requiring tailored management approaches, especially with the advent of targeted therapies. Paradigms for lowering LDL-C level to offset Lp(a)-mediated risk have been proposed previously, including in the Lp(a) consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society, which provides estimates for the degree of LDL-C lowering needed to offset risk at a given Lp(a) level based on age of initiation, up to age 80 years. Our study has a shorter time of LDL-C lowering, with a median follow-up of 2.8 years. However, even in those achieving the lowest LDL-C concentrations (quartile 1: < 77.34 mg/dL), there was still a 38% increased relative risk in those with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL compared with those with ≤ 50 mg/dL, suggesting that Lp(a)-mediated risk cannot be fully offset by lowering LDL-C level, and that these are independent pathways for atherothrombosis. In addition, with the greatest degree of absolute change in LDL-C level (decrease of 52 to 193 mg/dL), there was still greater overall risk in those with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL compared with those with Lp(a) ≤ 50 mg/dL. Consistent with these data, it was demonstrated in the UK Biobank that apolipoprotein B100 also does not explain the ASCVD risk mediated by Lp(a), but that it does explain the risk mediated by LDL-C. This further implies that other components of Lp(a), such as its content of oxidized phospholipids, antifibrinolytic effects, or potential pro-platelet effects, may be more important in mediating clinical manifestations.

### Statins and Lp (a): the plot thickens [^a9d624f4]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

In combination with a healthy lifestyle adoption promoted through an increasing awareness of its importance in healthy living, statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have contributed to the improved national trend seen in the prevalence of elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In contrast to their well-established reducing effect on LDL-C levels, there has been a great deal of uncertainty to what extent statins impact lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels. At first glance this might seem contradictory in view of the structural similarity of the Lp(a) lipid core to LDL [cholesterol-rich lipid core firmly attached to apolipoprotein (apo) B-100]. However, the LDL receptor binding site in apoB is located close to the disulfide bond linking apoB and apo(a) in Lp(a). Given the large molecular size of apo(a) as well as its high carbohydrate content, the possibility of a steric configuration that impact access of Lp(a)-apoB for the LDL receptor seems possible. The paper by Yahya et al. in this issue of Atherosclerosis provides novel perspectives on this long-term puzzle.

Since their initial marketing in the 1980s, statins have become the most widely used therapy for hypercholesterolemia. In one of the first Lp(a) studies in this field, Kostner et al. reported that lovastatin dose dependently increased Lp(a) levels by ~33%. The findings provided an initial indication that Lp(a), regardless of its structural similarity to LDL, maybe cleared from plasma via a different pathway, and further, that statins may impact Lp(a) metabolism independent of its effect on LDL receptor. Subsequent studies, however, produced mixed results ranging from no effect to significant increases in Lp(a) levels with statins, raising concerns about the robustness of findings. Further, a relatively large study in subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia reported a reduction in Lp(a) levels using either atorvastatin or simvastatin. Some factors contributing to difficulties to firmly establish the impact of statins on Lp(a) include variability of assays used and the extensive apo(a) size heterogeneity impacting levels, and in some cases, making smaller size studies challenging to interpret.

### Statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention… [^2d5f9b4b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although elevated low-density lipoprotein is associated with higher rates of CVD, 2 there is uncertainty regarding the net benefit to risk ratio of using statins to reduce LDL among persons without CVD. This contrasts with the established role of LDL reduction for persons with established CVD. First, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or higher based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations and at least 1 risk factor — dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and/or smoking — are likely to derive moderate benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin.

The null result was robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded trials that stopped early, trials that included patients receiving secondary prevention, good-quality trials, trials with at least 3 years of follow-up, and trials with participants with a median baseline LDL lower than 160 mg/dL. 6 The lack of benefit on CVD mortality found in the 2022 evidence review6 and the lack of benefit on all-cause mortality in the purely high-risk primary prevention meta-analysis8 call into question the reliability of the all-cause mortality benefit reported in the systematic review that accompanies the 2022 USPSTF recommendations. In contrast with its 2016 recommendations, 3 the USPSTF no longer recommends use of low-intensity statins in certain situations. This change is driven by the fact that 17 of the 22 trials had fixed-dose statin groups, including 12 which used moderate-intensity statins.

6 We are unaware of any RCTs that directly compare either different statin intensities in terms of clinical CVD outcomes or fixed-dose vs titrate-to-LDL goal approaches. At present, there are further reasons to curb our enthusiasm about the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD. There is a difference between statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit. The purported benefits of statins in terms of relative risk reduction are fairly constant across baseline lipid levels and cardiovascular risk score categories for primary prevention. 6 Therefore, the absolute benefit for those in lower-risk categories is likely small given that their baseline absolute risk is low, while the chance of adverse effects is constant across risk categories.

Clinical Perspective

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) are independently associated with greater risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). – Management of elevated LDL-C levels, particularly in the context of elevated ASCVD risk, has been well established in clinical practice guidelines, with statins as first-line therapy, followed by ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) in those who do not achieve prespecified goals. However, the understanding of the optimal management of patients with elevated Lp(a) levels, particularly in the context of LDL-C, is uncertain.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend use of elevated Lp(a) level as a risk enhancer for overall risk assessment, which primarily guides the use of statin and other lipid-lowering therapies. However, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and recent National Lipid Association guidelines recommend measuring Lp(a) level once in all adults, and these guidelines and the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement recommend addressing LDL-C levels more aggressively when the Lp(a) level is elevated to attempt to offset Lp(a)-mediated risk. – However, previous studies have suggested that ASCVD risk is elevated in association with elevated Lp(a) level, even when the LDL-C level is relatively low, or despite a background of moderate to high-intensity statin therapy. –

### Moving targets: recent advances in lipid-lowering therapies [^8f0c2b96]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy has delivered tremendous value to society by improving the burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally. Technological advances such as in the field of genomics have revolutionized drug discovery and development and have revealed novel therapeutic targets to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as other detrimental lipids and lipoproteins. Therapeutic LDL-C lowering prevents atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with an effect size proportional to absolute LDL-C reductions and time of exposure. This understanding supports the notion that reducing cumulative LDL-C exposure should be a key therapeutic target. PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibiting monoclonal antibodies provides the possibility of reducing LDL-C to very low levels. Novel therapeutic platforms such as RNA inhibition present opportunities to combine robust lipid lowering with infrequent dosing regimens, introducing therapies with vaccine-like properties. The position of lipid-lowering therapies with targets other than LDL-C, such as Lp(a) [lipoprotein(a)], TRL (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins), and remnant cholesterol, will likely be determined by the results of ongoing clinical trials. Current evidence suggests that reducing Lp(a) or TRLs could attenuate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in specific categories of patients. This review provides an overview of the latest therapeutic developments, focusing on their mechanisms, efficacy, and safety.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^84939dff]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a)-directed treatment actions — In adults aged 40–75 y with a 10-y ASCVD risk of 7.5%–19.9%, the finding of an Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL is reasonable to be used as a risk-enhancing factor to favor initiation of a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, it is reasonable to consider more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to achieve greater ASCVD risk reduction. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients taking a maximally tolerated statin with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, the addition of ezetimibe is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), and the addition of a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL). Lipoprotein apheresis is reasonable for high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, and niacin or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, which lower Lp(a), is not recommended to reduce ASCVD risk.

### Existing and emerging strategies to lower lipoprotein (a) [^58a5c1c2]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abundant evidence links elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) to higher cardiovascular risk, leaving clinicians with the challenge of what measures to take to mitigate Lp(a)-associated risk. Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and in some cases may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.

### Use and monitoring of "Statin" lipid-lowering drugs compared with guidelines… [^edd51e20]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Appropriateness of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor use in primary and secondary prevention for 1575 patients taking statins. Overview of patients eligible for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor therapy. CAD indicates coronary artery disease. More recently, controlled trials4-8 have demonstrated a conclusive reduction in overall mortality and mortality from CHD among patients whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values were lowered with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor drug therapy. Initial trials4 demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with established CHD and significantly elevated serum cholesterol values; these results were later extended to patients with CHD whose LDL cholesterol levels were only modestly elevated5 and even to patients with CHD who had LDL cholesterol values in the average range. 6 In patients without established CHD., the benefit of lowering LDL cholesterol levels with statin therapy has been shown in clinical trials to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and mortality from coronary events, supporting their use in primary prevention. 7 These findings were also extended to show a reduction in coronary events among patients with modest LDL cholesterol elevations, using aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering.
8. Secondary aims included evaluating the impact that monitoring had on clinical outcomes, estimating the safety of statins in this cohort, and estimating the financial burden of monitoring. We sought to quantify the occurrence of less obvious adverse effects, in addition to hepatotoxicity. We also assessed the potential costs and savings associated with inappropriate and appropriate statin use and liver function monitoring. Guidelines for using pharmacological therapy to treat hypercholesterolemia are based on LDL cholesterol values.

3 Thus, we retrieved the most recent LDL cholesterol value before the initiation of statin therapy. This value, combined with the indication and number of risk factors, was compared with guidelines for initiating statin therapy. Patients were considered appropriate if their risk factor status and LDL cholesterol value before statin initiation were in accordance with guidelines. We considered patients with CHD to be inappropriately taking statin therapy if their LDL cholesterol value before drug therapy was below 2. 59 mmol/L. To estimate underuse of statins, we reexplored our database for patients who met our criteria for CHD and who were not taking statins.

Take‑home points for Lp(a) risk and measurement — The relationship between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular disease risk is continuous and log-linear, and rather than a single dichotomous cutoff, Lp(a) levels represent a continuum of risk; individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) may be considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) may be considered high risk, and those in the "gray zone" 75 to 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk and may warrant repeat measurement; Lp(a) risk categories apply across races and ethnicities, Lp(a) should be measured at least once in every adult for cardiovascular risk assessment, should be reported in nmol/L with no conversion between mg/dL and nmol/L using a fixed factor, the previously proposed correction factor for Lp(a)-C used to adjust LDL-C calculation should not be used, concerns about Lp(a) elevation should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue a statin, and in high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a) who need additional LDL-C lowering after maximally tolerated statin therapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor may address residual risk from both LDL-C and Lp(a).

### Assessing the accuracy of estimated lipoprotein (a) cholesterol and lipoprotein (a)-free low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^e759a300]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Advancements in risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment response to current and future therapies have increased the impetus for accurate measurement of the atherogenic burden of Lp(a). Currently, the reporting of Lp(a) levels varies substantially. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommends Lp(a) particle number (Lp[a]‐P), an assessment of molar concentration, as the clinical standard for assessing Lp(a). However, in contemporary clinical cohorts, Lp(a) levels have often been expressed in mass concentration (mg/dL) of the entire lipoprotein particles (eg, cholesterol, esters, phospholipids, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins) to allow familiarity in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

A proposed method for estimation of Lp(a) cholesterol (Lp[a]‐C) has emerged by dividing Lp(a)‐P (in nmol/L) by a conversion factor of 2.4 to reflect mass in mg/dL and then multiplying by 30% to reflect the cholesterol content of Lp(a)., This method is of clinical interest since the calculated LDL‐C value on a standard lipid panel contains Lp(a)‐C. As such, the ability to express Lp(a)‐C as a measure of cholesterol content within Lp(a) particles may be appealing to clinicians. Comparing Lp(a)‐C with LDL‐C would provide clinicians with a qualitative understanding of the degree to which Lp(a) is contributing to the underlying atherosclerotic disease process. Moreover, assessing Lp(a)‐C might help to explain situations wherein LDL‐C reduction is less than anticipated with LDL‐targeted therapies such as statins. There is evidence that statins, by far the most used lipid‐lowering therapy, do not lower Lp(a) and in some cases may modestly increase Lp(a) levels. Since Lp(a)‐C is a component of LDL‐C, individuals with high Lp(a)‐C levels therefore may have a less‐than‐expected response to statin therapy. There has also been interest in using Lp(a)‐C to isolate the Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C component, allowing clinicians to arrive at a closer estimation of what is the "real" amount of circulating LDL‐C. Because society guidelines employ clinical rather than real LDL‐C to guide lipid therapy, we do not advocate for the use of LDL‐C correction for Lp(a)‐C. However, if inappropriately applied in this way to guide treatment decisions based on established LDL‐C targets, the perils of estimated Lp(a)‐C inaccuracies may be further amplified.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^e9ef7f2e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Professional society guidance on lipoprotein(a) for risk assessment — the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline identifies elevated Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L as a risk-enhancing factor that would favor statin initiation or intensification for primary prevention in borderline or intermediate risk individuals. The 2022 European Atherosclerosis Society recommends measuring Lp(a) at least once in all adults, uses levels ≥ 125 nmol/L to rule-in ASCVD risk, and states that individuals at low or moderate 10-year CVD risk by SCORE would be recommended for more intensive treatment of LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, and lifestyle risk factors when Lp(a) is elevated. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends measuring Lp(a) once in a patient's lifetime with initial lipid screening and considers Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 100 nmol/L) a risk modifier warranting statin therapy in intermediate-risk patients and earlier, more intensive lifestyle management in low-risk patients.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^d03224b7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) in adult cardiovascular risk assessment — Lp(a) level should be measured at least once in all adults to identify individuals with high Lp(a) levels for implementation of early and intensive risk factor management. For CVD risk assessment, Lp(a) levels should be used to stratify patients as low risk (< 75 nmol/L) or high risk (≥ 125 nmol/L), and individuals with Lp(a) levels in between should be considered as intermediate risk and also may be considered for repeat measurement. As a risk-enhancing factor, Lp(a) level can also help reclassify individuals with overall borderline, intermediate, or high risk, and this information may impact the choice of lifestyle modification and intensification of lipid-lowering therapy with statin and other drugs, including PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, identification of individuals with high levels of Lp(a) also identifies a family at risk, and cascade screening for elevated Lp(a) should be performed in first-degree family members. Lipoprotein apheresis is indicated for patients with clinically diagnosed FH and either documented coronary artery disease or documented peripheral artery disease whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.

### Statins and Lp (a): the plot thickens [^111cf126]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

In this context, it is interesting to draw parallels to findings regarding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and Lp(a) (Figure 1). While both PCSK9 and statins reduce LDL cholesterol levels through upregulation of LDL receptors, their effect on Lp(a) is vastly different. One could postulate that while Lp(a) may perhaps have lower affinity for the LDL receptor than LDL, a reduced level of competition between Lp(a) and LDL as LDL-C levels decrease might increase the potential for receptor-mediated clearance of Lp(a). However, this does not seem to fit with a statin-mediated increase in Lp(a). Given the well-documented and strong regulatory impact of apo(a) production on Lp(a) levels, a focus on apo(a) synthesis would seem appropriate. In their recent meta-analysis, Tsimikas et al. included such a focus and reported that cell culture experiments using HepG2 cells resulted in a higher LPA mRNA level in response to several statins. Notably, a reduction in Lp(a)-associated apo(a) production was found during treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors, in keeping with the apparent divergent effect of these two LDL-C reducing agents on Lp(a).

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^fb30a894]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Mixed dyslipidemia is characterized by high serum concentrations of total and LDL-C as well as of triglycerides. Statins and fibrates are among the first-line pharmacotherapies for mixed dyslipidemia. Findings of clinical trials have shown that the combination of statins and fibrates results in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C and triglyceride levels and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with monotherapy with either drug. In addition, both statins and fibrates have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Moreover, these classes of drug affect different aspects of lipoprotein metabolism. Fibrates decrease serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increase HDL-C levels in hyperlipidemic patients, thereby reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The main mechanisms of action of fibrates are induction of lipoprotein lipolysis, induction of hepatic fatty acid uptake and reduction of hepatic triglyceride production, enhancement of hepatic removal of LDL particles, reduction of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and elevation of HDL production.

Statins mainly act through enhancement of plasma clearance of LDL and reduction of hepatic very low-density lipoprotein production. Statins reduce hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, causing depletion of intracellular cholesterol content and resulting in an increase in the expression and density of hepatic LDL receptors.

Owing to the importance of Lp(a) as an emerging coronary risk factor, and the wide use of statins and fibrates in the management dyslipidemias, the present study aimed to compare the effects of these two classes of drugs on plasma Lp(a) concentrations through a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials. A secondary aim was to assess if combination therapy with statins and fibrates is associated with a greater effect on plasma Lp(a) levels compared with monotherapy with either of the agents.

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^da19bac1]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aside from low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an important contributor to atherogenesis. Lp(a) is a lipoprotein particle comprised of an LDL domain and a covalently bound apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)). Lp(a) is characterized by a protein content of 26–31%, a long half-life, and an atherothrombotic effect likely due to its selective accumulation within atherosclerotic plaque and its inhibition of the fibrinolytic pathway. Plasma concentrations of Lp(a) are an independent risk factor for early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Lp(a) is a low-density lipoprotein-like substance with a core of cholesteryl esters and a surface layer of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol that contains a single molecule of apolipoprotein B-100 bound to a molecule of apo(a) by a disulfide linkage. Values of plasma Lp(a) levels of more than 30 mg/dL are considered elevated, and are associated with increased risk of atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease, especially when exceeding 50 mg/dL. A single molecule of apo(a) is secreted by the liver and has a structure similar to plasminogen but without protease activity. In addition to the atherogenic properties afforded by the presence of apoB-100, the apo(a) component of Lp(a) confers thrombogenic effects to the particle. A growing body of evidence for an atherogenic and pro-thrombotic effect of Lp(a) has been reported, as well as its likely causal association with risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Thus, therapeutic strategies to reduce plasma Lp(a) concentrations in patients with hyper-Lp(a) are particularly important to reduce cardiovascular mortality. In this regard, various therapeutic interventions for lowering Lp(a) levels have been reported, including apheresis techniques, nicotinic acid, statins, fibrates, and aspirin, among others. It has been reported that plasma Lp(a) levels are decreased by monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 inhibitors act by increasing the density of LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, which subsequently causes a marked reduction of plasma LDL and LDL-apoB. Since the availability of LDL-apoB plays a key role in the formation of Lp(a) particles, LDL-lowering activity of PCSK9 inhibitors is accompanied by a significant fall in plasma Lp(a) levels, as suggested by pooled analyses and meta-analyses. Several lines of clinical evidence have also shown that statins and fibrates, as the most widely used lipid-lowering drug classes, can lower plasma Lp(a) concentrations. However, evidence from comparative trials has not been conclusive.

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^f00787c1]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Raised plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration is an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Several types of pharmacological approaches are under evaluation for their potential to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels. There is suggestive evidence that statins and fibrates, two frequently employed lipid-lowering drugs, can lower plasma Lp(a). The present study aims to compare the efficacy of fibrates and statins in reducing plasma concentrations of Lp(a) using a meta-analysis of randomized head-to-head trials.

Methods

Medline and Scopus databases were searched to identify randomized head-to-head comparative trials investigating the efficacy of fibrates versus statins in reducing plasma Lp(a) levels. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with inverse variance weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as summary statistics. The impact of putative confounders on the estimated effect size was explored using random effects meta-regression.

Results

Sixteen head-to-head comparative trials with a total of 1388 subjects met the eligibility criteria and were selected for this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly greater effect of fibrates versus statins in reducing plasma Lp(a) concentrations (WMD, -2.70 mg/dL; 95% CI, -4.56 to -0.84; P = 0.004). Combination therapy with fibrates and statins had a significantly greater effect compared with statin monotherapy (WMD, -1.60 mg/dL; 95% CI, -2.93 to -0.26; P = 0.019) but not fibrate monotherapy (WMD, -1.76 mg/dL; 95% CI, -5.44 to +1.92; P = 0.349) in reducing plasma Lp(a) concentrations. The impact of fibrates versus statins in reducing plasma Lp(a) concentrations was not found to be significantly associated with treatment duration (P = 0.788).

Conclusions

Fibrates have a significantly greater effect in reducing plasma Lp(a) concentrations than statins. Addition of fibrates to statins can enhance the Lp(a)-lowering effect of statins.

### Lipoprotein (a)-we know so much yet still have much to learn… [^a2ff128a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to the discussion about the role of Lp(a) as an important biomarker of CVD, we are faced with the very great challenge of treating patients with high Lp(a) levels. Currently, the appropriate management of high Lp(a) is not known and there are limited therapeutic options to lower Lp(a) directly. 2, 6 Niacin reduces Lp(a) levels by up to 30% to 40% in a dose‐dependent manner and in addition exerts other potential beneficial effects by reducing LDL‐C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and remnant cholesterol and by raising high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C); however, the available trials did not show any cardiovascular benefit with niacin administration as an agent to reduce residual risk of increasing high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, niacin is not commonly available in many European countries. 2, 6, 11 New agents, such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, are also very effective; however, they are not still available. In the case of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, the studies with torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, and evacetrapib were terminated prematurely and we await the results of the Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP INhibition with AnacEtrapib (DEFINE) trial with anacetrapib, which seems to be the most potent agent, both increasing high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol by even 140%, and significantly reducing LDL‐C and Lp(a). 12, 13 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, but due to the lack of reimbursement in most countries as well as the high cost of the therapy they are also still not commonly available. 5, 14 Therefore, according to the current recommendations and expert opinions, statins should be considered as a first‐line therapy in case of high level of Lp(a), despite their limited efficacy, because such therapy is aimed to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. 2, 5, 6 There are also other drugs as well as nutraceuticals/functional foods that may be effective in Lp(a) lowering. Within the Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta‐analysis Collaboration Group, Kotani et al 15 investigated the effects of tibolone treatment on circulating Lp(a) levels in postmenopausal women through systematic review and meta‐analysis of available randomized controlled trials. Meta‐analysis of 12 trials suggested a significant reduction of Lp(a) levels following tibolone treatment (weighted mean difference: −25.28%, 95% CI: −36.50, −14.06; P < 0.001), and the effect remained significant both for the doses < 2.5 (−17.00%) and ≥ 2.5 mg/day (−29.18%), as well as in the subsets of trials with follow‐up either < 24 (−26.79%) or ≥ 24 months (−23.10%). 15 The same group has recently evaluated the effect of‐carnitine supplementation on Lp(a) concentrations. 16 The meta‐analysis showed a significant reduction of Lp(a) levels following‐carnitine supplementation (weighted mean difference: −8.82 mg/dL, 95% CI: −10.09, −7.55, P < 0.001), especially when‐carnitine was administrated orally (−9.00 mg/dL) but not intravenously (−2.91 mg/dL). 16 In another meta‐analysis from the Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta‐analysis Collaboration Group, Serban et al investigated the effect of garlic on Lp(a) concentrations; however, they did not show any effect of garlic supplementation on the reduction of Lp(a) levels. 17

### Management of residual risk after statin therapy [^c2070c3b]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Observational data indicate that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are strongly positively associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) whilst the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is strongly inversely associated, with additional associations being observed for other lipid parameters such as triglycerides, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). This has led to an interest in the development of a range of lipid intervention therapies. The most widely used of these interventions are statins, but even with intensive statin therapy some groups of patients remain at significant residual cardiovascular (CV) risk. In addition, some people are intolerant of statin therapy. In these circumstances, additional therapeutic agents may be needed. This review considers the evidence behind and the pros and cons of such additional agents.

### Lipoprotein (a) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the impact of available lipid-lowering medications on lipoprotein (a): an update on new therapies [^9c1f8d8c]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review evidence of existing and new pharmacological therapies for lowering lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) concentrations and their impact on clinically relevant outcomes.

Methods

We searched for literature pertaining to Lp(a) and pharmacological treatments in PubMed. We reviewed articles published between 1963 and 2020.

Results

We found that statins significantly increased Lp(a) concentrations. Therapies that demonstrated varying degrees of Lp(a) reduction included ezetimibe, niacin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, lipoprotein apheresis, fibrates, aspirin, hormone replacement therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and small interfering RNA therapy. There was limited data from large observational studies and post hoc analyses showing the potential benefits of these therapies in improving cardiovascular outcomes.

Conclusion

There are multiple lipid-lowering agents currently being used to treat hyperlipidemia that also have a Lp(a)-lowering effect. Two RNA therapies specifically targeted to lower Lp(a) are being investigated in phase 3 clinical trials and, thus far, have shown promising results. However, evidence is lacking to determine the clinical relevance of reducing Lp(a). At present, there is a need for large-scale, randomized, controlled trials to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes associated with lowering Lp(a).

### The year in cardiovascular medicine 2021: dyslipidaemia [^2ad49722]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The past year was an exciting time for clinical lipidology when we learnt more about existing therapies as well as therapies targeting novel pathways discovered through genetic studies. LDL cholesterol remained the main target and a variety of drugs to lower LDL cholesterol through different mechanisms were explored. Emerging evidence on the atherogenity of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins led to renewed interest in lowering them with new treatments. Lp(a) was back in focus with evidence on causality and new targeted therapeutics which dramatically lower Lp(a) levels. We will be able to personalise lipid lowering therapy further with this enriched armamentarium once we have the results of the cardiovascular outcome studies with some of these new agents.

### Evaluation of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with elevated lipoprotein (a) levels [^8537c263]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a recognized independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiovascular-related disorders. To mitigate the increased risk associated with elevated Lp(a), intensified treatment is recommended for modifiable ASCVD risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. However, limited evidence has assessed how clinicians are modifying lipid-lowering therapy in response to elevated Lp(a) levels.

Objective

To evaluate changes to lipid-lowering therapy and assess which patient characteristics are associated with intensifying lipid-lowering medications.

Methods

This retrospective, observational case-control study evaluated changes to lipid-lowering therapy in patients with elevated Lp(a) values from January 1, 2020, through May 31, 2024.

Results

Of 1042 patients with an Lp(a) value of 30 mg/dL (75 nmol/L) or higher during our study period, 539 met full inclusion eligibility. Of the 539 patients, 120 (22.3%) had their lipid-lowering therapy modified within 30 days of the elevated Lp(a) result. The most common interventions were adding ezetimibe (33.3%) and intensifying statin therapy (32.5%). Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was the most significant predictor of whether patients' lipid medications were modified, concordant with current recommendations for mitigating increased ASCVD risk associated with elevated Lp(a).

Conclusion

Intensification of lipid-lowering medication within 30 days occurred in less than one-quarter of patients with elevated Lp(a). Future studies are needed to determine if aggressive LDL-C lowering is superior to Lp(a)-lowering to prevent ASCVD events in patients with elevated Lp(a).

### Role of statins in management of atherosclerosis… [^687caf3b]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, the management of cardiovascular disease has changed with the addition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, more commonly known as statins. These agents have been used for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Vaughan and associates reviewed the various effects of statins and current recommendations for using these medications. The basic mechanism of action of statins is the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Statins also cause minor reductions of triglyceride levels and minor increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Dyspepsia, abdominal pain and flatulence, the most common side effects, are usually mild, transient and reversible. The most important adverse effects of statins are elevations of the serum transaminase levels and development of myositis.

These adverse effects are more common when statins are used in combination with other medications that inhibit the cytochrome P450 system, such as azole antifungal agents, cimetadine and methotrexate. The risk for statin-related myositis increases in patients taking gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid or macrolides. Statins have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality rates related to coronary artery disease. This reduction can occur through primary prevention and by treating hypercholesterolemia before the development of coronary artery disease. Secondary prevention, treating after the development of coronary artery disease, has also been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. The authors conclude that statin therapy has been shown to have a significant benefit in patients with artherosclerosis and in patients with coronary artery disease. The positive impact of statin therapy has been shown to occur in as little as one month after initiating therapy.

editor's note: Statins have evolved over the past few years into an integral component of primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Recent studies have suggested that they serve to lower LDL cholesterol levels and have other properties that reduce the morbidity and mortality related to this disease. Unfortunately, some recent studies suggest that physicians are not meeting the NCEP goals for LDL levels in their patients. In accordance with recent information, physicians should target LDL levels in their patients in a similar manner in which they target blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes and blood pressure levels in patients with hypertension. — k. e. m.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^9fcef595]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have sought to address the relationship between Lp(a) and LDL-C levels for cardiovascular risk. In a similar meta-analysis of 7 statin trials, the association between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular risk appeared to increase linearly and independently of LDL-C level when evaluated at specific Lp(a) cut points. This study also demonstrated that the independent risk associated with Lp(a) level persisted in statin-treated individuals. Our study adds to this previous work by demonstrating that Lp(a) and LDL-C levels are independent and additive predictors of cardiovascular risk. Whereas the previous study evaluated Lp(a)-mediated risk specifically, we evaluated the implications of LDL-C lowering on global cardiovascular risk in the context of elevated Lp(a) level, demonstrating that even with the lowest achieved LDL-C levels (both absolutely and relatively), overall risk remains increased in those with elevated Lp(a) level, and potent LDL-C lowering does not appear to completely offset the risk associated with elevated Lp(a) level.

In an observational study from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), participants were categorized similarly by Lp(a) level above or below 50 mg/dL and LDL-C level above or below 100 mg/dL. Over a mean follow-up of 13.4 years, there was increased risk when Lp(a) level alone was elevated (HR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.02–3.27]) compared with when Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were both lower. MESA used baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C results, excluded individuals on lipid-lowering therapy, and had only a small number of individuals with isolated elevated Lp(a) level (n = 130 among the total population of 4585). In addition, the risk of Lp(a) level and very elevated LDL-C level appears to be additive, with higher risk when elevated Lp(a) level and familial hypercholesterolemia are both present.

Lifestyle modifications

In addition to pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions should be emphasized. These include:

- Heart-healthy diet: Adopting a diet low in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates, while rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, is essential.
- Physical activity: Encouraging regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, can help improve lipid profiles and overall cardiovascular health.

Although the patient's CAC score of 0 AU suggests a low short-term risk of cardiovascular events, the elevated Lp(a) level and family history of premature CAD indicate an elevated long-term ASCVD risk. Initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy, along with lifestyle modifications, is recommended to reduce LDL-C and mitigate the patient's lifetime ASCVD risk. Regular monitoring of lipid levels and continued cardiovascular risk assessment are critical to ensure appropriate management and adherence to therapy. A fasting lipid panel should be repeated 4 to 12 weeks after initiating statin therapy to assess the patient's response. The goal is to achieve at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C from baseline or an LDL-C level below 100 mg/dL. Further follow-up visits should assess adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes, as well as monitor for any adverse effects of the medication. This approach of using Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor is consistent with AHA/ACC guidance. Furthermore, de-risking patients with a CAC of 0 is consistent with the ACC ECDP although no specific note is made of Lp(a) and CAC of 0. Similarly, the ESC and CCS guidelines discuss Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing feature but do not discuss a role for CAC testing in this setting. No guideline provides specific treatment recommendations based on elevated Lp(a).

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^07576af0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, many physicians aim to achieve an "LDL‐C" < 70 mg/dL for high‐risk patients, which is further supported by guidelines. 1 Thus, many patients with "LDL‐C" ≥ 70 mg/dL and elevated lipoprotein(a) while on statin therapy, in fact, already have true LDL‐C significantly lower than 70 mg/dL. The recommendation to further increase LDL‐C–lowering therapy in such patients may not accurately reflect whether true LDL‐C versus lipoprotein(a) reflects additional residual risk. Because statins tend to increase lipoprotein(a), 33 further increase in statin dosage in a patient with already true low LDL‐C may be counterproductive. Similarly, in patients being treated with PCSK9 inhibitors that achieve exceedingly low LDL‐C (ie, < 20 mg/dL), true LDL‐C levels may be at or near zero if lipoprotein(a) is elevated, as we suggested recently. 3

Fourth, should lipoprotein(a) mass and/or cholesterol content be part of the FH diagnosis? Using a more accurate measurement of LDL‐C would result in many subjects not meeting the criterion of "LDL‐C" ≥ 190 mg/dL used in many scores unless the Lp(a)‐C was included in the measurement. 34 The concept to formally include lipoprotein(a) in the diagnosis of FH is consistent with studies showing a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if patients with FH have concomitantly elevated lipoprotein(a) levels. 35

Fifth, the meta‐analysis included a wide range of patients receiving different statins and further reflecting their use in a wide range of CVD prevention cohorts. Accurately quantitating true LDL‐C without its content of Lp(a)‐C will be important in defining the magnitude of benefit from "LDL‐C" lowering agents, particularly in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), which may represent up to a third of patients in the population and in recent clinical trials 36, 37 who are more likely to have a true LDL‐C that is lower than their LDL‐C laboratory measurement.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^c5167ba3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) screening and risk across populations: We recommend measuring Lp(a) in every adult at least once for cardiovascular risk assessment (see Table 1; COR I, LOE B-NR). The risk for ASCVD events that is associated with Lp(a) is independent of LDL-C and is attributed to the atherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties of Lp(a), and Lp(a) is associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD even in the absence of a family history of heart disease. Systematic universal Lp(a) screening can improve health outcomes by increasing awareness of, and enabling precision in, ASCVD prevention strategies and individualization of therapy selection. Elevated Lp(a) remains a risk factor for ASCVD even with aggressive LDL-C lowering by statins and nonstatins (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and ezetimibe), and early, and more-intensive management of modifiable risk factors, including LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, is warranted in at-risk patients who have elevated Lp(a). This update also notes that elevated Lp(a) is not a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that in the pediatric population (children < 18 years of age) elevation of Lp(a) has been linked to the occurrence of arterial ischemic stroke.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^b68e596e]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, our findings suggest that both LDL-C and Lp(a) levels are important and independent targets for reducing cardiovascular risk. In analyses of PCSK9i trials, the greatest benefit was observed when Lp(a) levels were elevated. Given the modest Lp(a)-lowering achieved with PCSK9 inhibitors, and our study demonstrating that LDL-C lowering alone cannot eliminate Lp(a)-mediated risk, these findings suggest that both LDL-C and Lp(a) are important for cardiovascular risk. In an analysis of FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk), which compared the PCSK9i evolocumab with placebo on a background of moderate to high-intensity statin, the lowest event rate was observed when achieved Lp(a) was ≤ 50 mg/dL and LDL-C was ≤ 70 mg/dL (5.88%). Increased risk was observed when LDL-C was elevated > 70 mg/dL (7.37%) or when Lp(a) was elevated > 50 mg/dL (7.46%), with the greatest risk observed when both were elevated (8.86%). In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab), which compared the PCSK9i alirocumab with placebo on a background of high-intensity or maximum-tolerated statin, baseline Lp(a) quartile strongly predicted risk of cardiovascular events in the placebo group and predicted cardiovascular event reduction with alirocumab. The latter observation was extended in a post hoc subgroup analysis of trial participants with baseline LDL-C levels near 70 mg/dL, in whom a concurrent baseline Lp(a) level above the median (13.7 mg/dL) was associated with treatment benefit of alirocumab. This suggests that in patients with nominally controlled LDL-C, the greatest benefit to PCSK9i occurs with higher Lp(a) levels, likely due to a combination of additional LDL-C lowering or modest Lp(a) lowering.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^8acd69a1]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels are independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the relationship between Lp(a) level, LDL-C level, and ASCVD risk at different thresholds is not well defined.

Methods

A participant-level meta-analysis of 27 658 participants enrolled in 6 placebo-controlled statin trials was performed to assess the association of LDL-C and Lp(a) levels with risk of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease events, stroke, or any coronary or carotid revascularization (ASCVD). The multivariable-adjusted association between baseline Lp(a) level and ASCVD risk was modeled continuously using generalized additive models, and the association between baseline LDL-C level and ASCVD risk by baseline Lp(a) level by Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The joint association between Lp(a) level and statin-achieved LDL-C level with ASCVD risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Compared with an Lp(a) level of 5 mg/dL, increasing levels of Lp(a) were log-linearly associated with ASCVD risk in statin- and placebo-treated patients. Among statin-treated individuals, those with Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL (≈125 nmol/L) had increased risk across all quartiles of achieved LDL-C level and absolute change in LDL-C level. Even among those with the lowest quartile of achieved LDL-C level (3.1–77.0 mg/dL), those with Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL had greater ASCVD risk (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.79]) than those with Lp(a) level ≤ 50 mg/dL. The greatest risk was observed with both Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL and LDL-C level in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.46–2.48]).

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate the independent and additive nature of Lp(a) and LDL-C levels for ASCVD risk, and that LDL-C lowering does not fully offset Lp(a)-mediated risk.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^c1e14540]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

Methods and Results

The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) < 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials demonstrates reduced CVD by niacin treatment. In extreme cases, LDL-apheresis is efficacious in removing Lp(a).

Conclusion

We recommend screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk, a desirable level < 50 mg/dL as a function of global cardiovascular risk, and use of niacin for Lp(a) and CVD/CHD risk reduction.

### Effect of alirocumab on lipoprotein (a) over ≥ 1.5 Years (from the phase 3 ODYSSEY program) [^8ee01a4c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. However, treatment options for elevated Lp(a) are limited. Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by up to 62% from baseline in phase 3 studies, with adverse event rates similar between alirocumab and controls. We evaluated the effect of alirocumab on serum Lp(a) using pooled data from the phase 3 ODYSSEY program: 4,915 patients with hypercholesterolemia from 10 phase 3 studies were included. Eight studies evaluated alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), with possible increase to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 depending on LDL-C at week 8 (75/150 mg Q2W); the other 2 studies evaluated alirocumab 150-mg Q2W from the outset. Comparators were placebo or ezetimibe. Eight studies were conducted on a background of statins, and 2 studies were carried out with no statins. Alirocumab was associated with significant reductions in Lp(a), regardless of starting dose and use of concomitant statins. At week 24, reductions from baseline were 23% to 27% with alirocumab 75/150-mg Q2W and 29% with alirocumab 150-mg Q2W (all comparisons p < 0.0001 vs controls). Reductions were sustained over 78 to 104 weeks. Lp(a) reductions with alirocumab were independent of race, gender, presence of familial hypercholesterolemia, baseline Lp(a), and LDL-C concentrations, or use of statins. In conclusion, in addition to marked reduction in LDL-C, alirocumab leads to a significant and sustained lowering of Lp(a).

Baseline Lp(a), Achieved LDL-C, and ASCVD Risk on Statin Therapy

Statin-treated individuals were categorized by baseline Lp(a) (dichotomized at 50 mg/dL) and achieved LDL-C quartile on statin therapy. Study-specific median baseline LDL-C ranged from 108.2 to 187.5 mg/dL. Median achieved LDL-C ranged from 54.1 to 119.9 mg/dL. Median absolute LDL-C change in response to statin therapy ranged from −39.1 to −67.7 mg/dL, and median percentage LDL-C change ranged from −30.4% to −48.5% (Table 2). Achieved LDL-C quartiles were as follows: quartile 1, < 77.34; quartile 2, 77.34 to 109.44; quartile 3, 109.82 to 140.37; and quartile 4, > 140.76 mg/dL.

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^774ba995]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Fibrate monotherapy versus statin monotherapy

In a single-arm analysis of randomized controlled study arms (without control group), statin therapy was found to increase plasma Lp(a) concentrations (WMD, 4.14 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.15 to 8.12; P = 0.042), while the same effect was not observed with fibrates (WMD, 0.64 mg/dL; 95% CI, –1.59 to 2.87; P = 0.574). The lp(a)-raising effect of statins in single-arm analysis was diminished after exclusion of the trial with rosuvastatin (WMD, 4.56 mg/dL; 95% CI, –1.09 to 10.22; P = 0.113). Combination therapy with statins and fibrates did not exert a significant alteration in plasma Lp(a) concentrations (WMD, 4.52 mg/dL; 95% CI, –7.74 to 16.79; P = 0.470) (Fig. 2). Meta-analysis of data from 15 comparative trials showed a significantly greater effect of fibrates versus statins in reducing plasma Lp(a) concentrations (WMD, –2.70 mg/dL; 95% CI, –4.56 to –0.84; P = 0.004) (Fig. 3). This effect size was robust in sensitivity analysis and the overall estimated effect size was not significantly changed by the omission of a single study (Fig. 3). In the subgroup analysis, a greater effect of fibrates versus statins in reducing plasma Lp(a) levels was observed in the subset of trials with elevated baseline Lp(a) concentrations (≥ 30 mg/dL) (WMD, –10.84 mg/dL; 95% CI, –16.66 to –5.03; P < 0.001) compared with trials having baseline Lp(a) levels < 30 mg/dL (WMD, –2.08 mg/dL; 95% CI, –3.94 to –0.23; P = 0.027; P = 0.005 for between-subgroup comparison) (Fig. 4). With respect to treatment duration, the greater effect of fibrates versus statins in reducing plasma Lp(a) levels was observed in the subset of trials with ≥ 12 weeks length (WMD, –3.16 mg/dL; 95% CI, –5.52 to –0.79; P = 0.009); yet there was no significant difference between statins and fibrates in the subset of trials with a duration of < 12 weeks (WMD, +0.09 mg/dL; 95% CI, –0.26 to +0.44; P = 0.609; P = 0.008 for between-subgroup comparison) (Fig. 5).

### Lipoprotein (a): an enigmatic sheep in the lipoprotein herd [^0a8221e9]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia is the principal risk factor that drives initiation and development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Many individuals with hypercholesterolemia do not achieve adequate low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction with standard lipid-lowering therapies (e.g. statins) or are unable tolerate them. In 2003, the discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a low abundance plasma protein with a disproportionately large effect on cholesterol metabolism and plasma LDL-C concentration, ushered in a new era of physiological understanding and therapeutic potential. The development of therapeutic anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (e.g. PCSK9 inhibitors) transformed our ability to manage patients with ASCVD and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially approved the use of PCSK9 inhibitors based on their LDL-C lowering efficacy and safety while respective large cardiovascular outcomes trials were ongoing. Both therapeutic antibodies target the same region of PCSK9 and have similar LDL-C lowering efficacy (∼60% reduction in LDL-C) at maximum doses. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have been similarly impressive for both evolocumab and alirocumab; thus, the PCSK9 inhibitor class is now endorsed by many international guidelines for use in select patient populations.

One of the interesting and unanticipated facets of PCSK9 inhibition is its consistent association with the lowering of plasma lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels. Lp(a) is an enigmatic atherogenic lipoprotein that consists of an LDL-like particle with a protein constituent [apolipoprotein(a)] covalently bound to its apolipoprotein B moiety. A recent meta-analysis of 27 randomized controlled clinical trials that enrolled 11,864 subjects demonstrated significant and comparable reductions in Lp(a) with either PCSK9 inhibitor treatment (on average: −21.9%). The mechanism(s) that underlie PCSK9 inhibitor associated reductions in plasma Lp(a) concentration remain unclear, although several hypotheses have been put forward, including: 1) enhanced Lp(a) clearance through the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway; 2) enhanced Lp(a) clearance via other receptors (LDLR-related protein 1[LRP1], cluster of differentiation 36 receptor [CD36], toll-like receptor 2 [TLR2], scavenger receptor-B1 [SR-B1], and plasminogen receptors); and 3) reduction in apolipoprotein (a) production, secretion, and/or assembly to form Lp(a) particles.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^1604ee85]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Key considerations

- Role of CAC score and Lp(a) in risk assessment: The absence of CAC in this patient reduces his short-term risk of ASCVD events, as individuals with a CAC score of 0 generally have a low risk of cardiovascular events over the next 5 to 10 years. However, elevated Lp(a) is associated with the development of noncalcified, vulnerable plaques, which may pose a risk that CAC scoring alone cannot capture. Lp(a) is an independent predictor of ASCVD, even in the absence of calcified plaque. Therefore, it warrants careful consideration in long-term risk stratification.
- Additional risk factors to consider: Given the borderline 10-year ASCVD risk (6.6%) and the presence of 2 risk-enhancing factors — elevated Lp(a) and a family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) — additional markers could be considered to further refine risk: 1) High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): Elevated levels of hs-CRP can indicate systemic inflammation, which may provide insights into the patient's atherosclerotic risk. 2) ApoB: Measuring ApoB could give a more accurate assessment of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, complementing traditional LDL-C measurements. 3) Ankle-Brachial Index: A simple, noninvasive test that may identify subclinical peripheral arterial disease. 4) Metabolic syndrome: Assessing for components of metabolic syndrome, such as increased waist circumference or elevated fasting glucose, could help guide management.
- Management strategy: Despite the low CAC score, the patient's elevated Lp(a) and family history suggest an elevated lifetime risk of ASCVD, justifying consideration of pharmacotherapy. The primary goals are to reduce LDL-C levels and overall cardiovascular risk.

Pharmacologic therapy

- Statin therapy: Initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy is reasonable, with the aim of lowering LDL-C by at least 30% or achieving LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dL. Statins are the first-line treatment in this case, given their proven efficacy in reducing ASCVD risk, even in patients with normal or low CAC scores.
- Lp(a) monitoring: While elevated Lp(a) is a risk-enhancing factor, it does not necessitate serial monitoring after the initial measurement. The primary focus of treatment is the management of modifiable risk factors, particularly LDL-C, as current therapies do not specifically target Lp(a).

Young adults and early risk assessment — Adults aged < 40 years with LDL-C values ≥ 160 mg/dL and/or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease may benefit from statin consideration; in patients with a family history of premature ASCVD, measurement of Lp(a) may help identify those who may benefit from early statin initiation; for patients aged ≥ 32 years, CAC scoring has been shown to help identify those with a traditional risk factor burden or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.

### Baseline and on-statin treatment lipoprotein (a) levels for prediction of cardiovascular events: individual patient-data meta-analysis of statin outcome trials [^9dfb8722]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general population studies. However, its contribution to risk for cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease or on statin therapy is uncertain.

Methods

Patient-level data from seven randomised, placebo-controlled, statin outcomes trials were collated and harmonised to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events, defined as fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, or revascularisation procedures. HRs for cardiovascular events were estimated within each trial across predefined lipoprotein(a) groups (15 to < 30 mg/dL, 30 to < 50 mg/dL, and ≥ 50 mg/dL, vs < 15 mg/dL), before pooling estimates using multivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Findings

Analyses included data for 29069 patients with repeat lipoprotein(a) measurements (mean age 62 years [SD 8]; 8064 [28%] women; 5751 events during 95576 person-years at risk). Initiation of statin therapy reduced LDL cholesterol (mean change -39% [95% CI -43 to -35]) without a significant change in lipoprotein(a). Associations of baseline and on-statin treatment lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular disease risk were approximately linear, with increased risk at lipoprotein(a) values of 30 mg/dL or greater for baseline lipoprotein(a) and 50 mg/dL or greater for on-statin lipoprotein(a). For baseline lipoprotein(a), HRs adjusted for age and sex (vs < 15 mg/dL) were 1·04 (95% CI 0·91–1·18) for 15 mg/dL to less than 30 mg/dL, 1·11 (1·00–1·22) for 30 mg/dL to less than 50 mg/dL, and 1·31 (1·08–1·58) for 50 mg/dL or higher; respective HRs for on-statin lipoprotein(a) were 0·94 (0·81–1·10), 1·06 (0·94–1·21), and 1·43 (1·15–1·76). HRs were almost identical after further adjustment for previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. The association of on-statin lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular disease risk was stronger than for on-placebo lipoprotein(a) (interaction p = 0·010) and was more pronounced at younger ages (interaction p = 0·008) without effect-modification by any other patient-level or study-level characteristics.

Interpretation

In this individual-patient data meta-analysis of statin-treated patients, elevated baseline and on-statin lipoprotein(a) showed an independent approximately linear relation with cardiovascular disease risk. This study provides a rationale for testing the lipoprotein(a) lowering hypothesis in cardiovascular disease outcomes trials.

### All we need to know about lipoprotein (a) [^93ba83b8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a genetically determined macromolecular complex, is independently and causally associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic stenosis via proposed proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and proatherogenic mechanisms. While Lp(a) measurement standardization issues are being resolved, several guidelines now support testing Lp(a) at least once in each adult's lifetime for ASCVD risk prediction which can foster implementation of more aggressive primary or secondary prevention therapies. Currently, there are several emerging targeted Lp(a) lowering therapies in active clinical investigation for safety and cardiovascular benefit among both primary and secondary prevention populations. First degree relatives of patients with high Lp(a) should be encouraged to undergo cascade screening. Primary prevention patients with high Lp(a) should consider obtaining a coronary calcium score for further risk estimation and to guide further ASCVD risk factor management including consideration of low dose aspirin therapy. Secondary prevention patients with high Lp(a) levels should consider adding PCSK9 inhibition to statin therapy.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^8934b199]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Baseline LDL-C and Lp(a) Levels and ASCVD Risk

Baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were both independently associated with ASCVD risk overall (Lp(a) per SD: HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04–1.10], P < 0.001; LDL-C per SD: HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02–1.10], P = 0.001). No meaningful difference in these HRs was noted when a range of corrected LDL-C values was used. Among patients assigned to placebo, both were significantly associated with ASCVD risk (Lp(a) per SD: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01–1.10], P = 0.013; LDL-C per SD: HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.03–1.14], P = 0.002). Among patients assigned to statin, Lp(a) remained significantly associated with ASCVD risk (HR, per SD: 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04–1.11], P < 0.001), whereas baseline LDL-C was not significantly associated (HR, per SD: 1.04 [95% CI, 0.98–1.10], P = 0.170). The multiplicative interaction between Lp(a) and LDL-C in these models in the overall cohort was not significant (P = 0.170). There was also no significant interaction specifically among women (P = 0.600) or men (P = 0.150). There was also no significant interaction between Lp(a) and sex for ASCVD risk (P = 0.310), with similar risk associated with Lp(a) for women (HR, per SD: 1.07 [95% CI, 1.02–1.11], P = 0.004) and men (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04–1.12], P < 0.001). There was no significant interaction between Lp(a) and LDL-C among those younger than or equal to the median age of 63 years (P = 0.710). There was a significant interaction among those greater than the median age (P = 0.009), but this must be interpreted with caution, given age differences between trials.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^c8f97f00]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to lowering LDL‐C, anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to reduce plasma lipoprotein(a) by up to ≈25%. In the FOURIER trial, evolocumab significantly reduced lipoprotein(a) levels by a median of 26.9% (interquartile range, 6.2%–46.7%), and in patients with higher baseline lipoprotein(a) levels, it reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 23% versus placebo (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67–0.88]), which was greater than the reduction in events among individuals with lower levels of lipoprotein(a). Lipoprotein(a) lowering by alirocumab in the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial independently predicted a lower risk of cardiovascular events, suggesting that lipoprotein(a) may represent an independent treatment target in ASCVD. Importantly, these clinical trials were not enriched for patients with elevated lipoprotein(a); therefore, the absolute reductions observed in lipoprotein(a) levels were fairly modest.

Both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines recommend the addition of evolocumab or alirocumab to statins and ezetimibe in patients at very high risk of ASCVD events who remain above LDL‐C thresholds (≥ 70 and ≥ 55 mg/dL, respectively), as well as in primary prevention patients with FH who remain above an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 100 mg/dL.

### Lipoprotein (a)-we know so much yet still have much to learn… [^0b679476]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Aside from its role as a recognized independent CVD biomarker, the physiological function of Lp(a) still is not completely understood. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 Because of its structural similarity to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, it competes with plasminogen for its binding site, leading to reduced fibrinolysis, and as a result of the stimulation of secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis. 1, 2, 3 Lp(a) also carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids, which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. In consequence, Lp(a) strongly contributes to the process of atherogenesis. 1, 2, 3, 4

Despite the recognition of the role of Lp(a) as an independent risk factor of CVD events, irrespective of other coexisting risk factors, physician knowledge regarding Lp(a) is limited. Consequently, Lp(a) is measured infrequently. One of the reasons for this is associated with the lack of clear recommendation associated with the Lp(a) cut‐off values, another relates to the cost and difficulties associated with diagnostic methods, and a third reason is the lack of recommendations on management and therapy of patients with high levels of this biomarker. 2, 6 The first guideline relating to the management of high levels of Lp(a) was the Consensus Paper of European Society of Atherosclerosis (EAS; 2010). 2 The authors recommended the measurement of Lp(a) once in all subjects at intermediate or high risk of CVD/CHD who present with premature CVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10‐year risk of fatal CVD, and ≥ 10% 10‐year risk of fatal and/or nonfatal CHD. 2 They suggested repeat measurement only if treatment for high Lp(a) levels is initiated, in order to evaluate the therapeutic response. For reduction of plasma Lp(a) as a secondary priority after reduction in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), the experts recommended a desirable level below 50 mg/dL. 2 Almost at the same time (2011) the experts from the National Lipid Association presented a comprehensive study on the utility of the selected biomarkers in CVD risk stratification. 6 The authors suggested that initial Lp(a) measurement before the therapy might be considered in selected patients with intermediate risk (5–20% 10‐year CHD event risk) or CHD or a CHD equivalent. They also suggested measurement would be reasonable for many patients with a family history of premature CHD or in patients with established CHD with a history of recurrent events despite appropriate therapy. 6 Having access to the Lp(a) measurements of patients already on treatment may be useful when considering on‐treatment management decisions in selected patients with CHD (or a CHD risk equivalent), premature family history, or a history of recurrent coronary events. 6 Both of these recommendations started the discussion on Lp(a), which has become even louder within the context of trials of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, which are very effective at lowering Lp(a) concentrations. 5 This discussion is increasingly important as we see more and more patents with complex dyslipidemias, including elevated Lp(a), as well as individuals with isolated Lp(a) elevations, who are at high and very high cardiovascular risk, and we need to consider suitable management for these patients. 2, 6

3.2 Identifying high‐risk groups for Lp(a) testing

While universal testing may be ideal, targeted testing remains a pragmatic approach in most clinical settings. The following groups should be prioritised for Lp(a) measurement (Table 1):
Individuals with premature ASCVD. Premature ASCVD, defined as cardiovascular events occurring before age 55 years in men and 65 years in women, points to possible underlying genetic contributors, including elevated Lp(a). In these individuals, Lp(a) measurement may uncover a risk factor that may not be addressed by standard lipid‐lowering therapies alone.
Family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a). Given the strong heritability of Lp(a) levels, first‐degree relatives of individuals with premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a) should undergo testing. Cascade screening in such families can identify at‐risk individuals before the onset of clinical disease, allowing for early intervention.
Recurrent ASCVD despite optimal LDL‐lowering therapy. Patients with less than expected response to statins or who continue to experience cardiovascular events despite achieving low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) targets may have residual risk driven by elevated Lp(a). In such cases, Lp(a) measurement can inform the need for more aggressive secondary preventive strategies.
Patients with suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Lp(a) elevation is common among individuals with FH and may contribute to the observed variability in cardiovascular risk within this group. Identifying elevated Lp(a) in these patients can help stratify risk and tailor management strategies.
Individuals of African and South Asian ancestry. Evidence consistently demonstrates that individuals of African descent have the highest median Lp(a) levels, followed by South Asians. Despite this, awareness and testing rates remain disproportionately low in these groups. Given the increased cardiovascular risk conferred by elevated Lp(a), routine screening should be considered, particularly among those with other risk factors or a family history of ASCVD.
Patients with CAVD. Lp(a) has emerged as a causal factor in the development of CAVD, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In patients presenting with CAVD, especially at a young age or without significant atherosclerotic burden, Lp(a) testing can provide insights into disease aetiology and may inform the intensity of surveillance and management strategies.
Patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis or enriched in ASCVD risk factors. Prior observational studies demonstrate individuals with coronary artery calcium ≥ 300 experience a risk similar to that of individuals with prior myocardial infarction or stroke; therefore, identification of individuals with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis with elevated Lp(a) may facilitate earlier prevention efforts. Additionally, there is evidence that Lp(a) may interact with several traditional risk factors, including diabetesand hypertension, to enhance ASCVD risk; however, this is an active area of ongoing research.
High‐risk individuals < 18 years old. Selective Lp(a) testing is recommended for children with clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia, ischaemic stroke of undetermined aetiology, first‐degree relatives with a history of premature ASCVD or first‐degree relatives with elevated Lp(a). However, clinicians should acknowledge that Lp(a) levels may not fully stabilise until late teenage years and there is considerable variability in Lp(a) levels among youth, as intraindividual variation may be as high as 70%. Thus, repeat Lp(a) testing may be considered among high‐risk individuals < 18 years old, especially if initially measured during early childhood.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered," although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence." Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted," and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients."

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^8db8e94f]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. The studies included are heterogeneous, with different populations, baseline LDL-C levels, and strength of statin therapy used. There was also significant variability in the length of follow-up of the studies. The 4D study is an outlier among placebo-controlled studies of statins on cardiovascular outcomes, because no benefit of statin treatment was observed. In addition, the methods for measurement of Lp(a) varied between studies, and most studies used mass assays (in mg/dL) rather than molar concentration assays (nmol/L); those measured in nmol/L were converted to mg/dL, which may lead to an imprecise measurement of actual Lp(a) levels. However, the associations between Lp(a) and LDL-C levels with ASCVD risk appeared similar across studies when evaluated individually. In addition, a recent study suggested that, at a trial level, units of measurement do not make a meaningful difference for event prediction. It is also possible that different results would be obtained with more potent LDL-C lowering, such as with combination therapy or with PCSK9i. However, we did not observe that LDL-C lowering offset risk in those with elevated Lp(a) level even in the lowest quartile of achieved LDL-C levels. The included trials were not designed to evaluate Lp(a) level specifically and were not enriched with individuals with higher Lp(a) levels. The LDL-C measure used in the current analysis was the laboratory-reported LDL-C level, which also contains the Lp(a)-C content. Correcting LDL-C for a range of factors to estimate Lp(a) cholesterol level did not meaningfully change the association between LDL-C level and risk, but ultimately, methods to measure and report the value of LDL-C level without its Lp(a) content may be needed to further evaluate their respective risk and to optimally manage individuals with elevated LDL-C and Lp(a) levels, particularly with the anticipated availability of targeted medical therapy for elevated Lp(a) level. The lack of a significant interaction between Lp(a) and LDL-C levels may also be due to limited power or model misspecification. There was also insufficient racial and ethnic representation to conduct analyses stratified by race or ethnicity or using race-specific percentiles for Lp(a) level, as the majority of participants were White. Additional potential confounders, such as diet, physical activity, and genetic factors, were not available and thus could not be adjusted for. However, Lp(a) level is primarily genetically determined and is only modestly affected by lifestyle factors, and accounting for genetic factors does not appear to improve risk prediction in addition to Lp(a) levels.

### Familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated lipoprotein (a): double heritable risk and new therapeutic opportunities [^e3fb71c0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is compelling evidence that the elevated plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population. Like low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, Lp(a) particles contain cholesterol and promote atherosclerosis. In addition, Lp(a) particles contain strongly proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids and a unique apoprotein, apo(a), which promotes the growth of an arterial thrombus. At least one in 250 individuals worldwide suffer from the heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a condition in which LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is significantly elevated since birth. FH-causing mutations in the LDL receptor gene demonstrate a clear gene-dosage effect on Lp(a) plasma concentrations and elevated Lp(a) levels are present in 30–50% of patients with HeFH. The cumulative burden of two genetically determined pro-atherogenic lipoproteins, LDL and Lp(a), is a potent driver of ASCVD in HeFH patients. Statins are the cornerstone of treatment of HeFH, but they do not lower the plasma concentrations of Lp(a). Emerging therapies effectively lower Lp(a) by as much as 90% using RNA-based approaches that target the transcriptional product of the LPA gene. We are now approaching the dawn of an era, in which permanent and significant lowering of the high cholesterol burden of HeFH patients can be achieved. If outcome trials of novel Lp(a)-lowering therapies prove to be safe and cost-effective, they will provide additional risk reduction needed to effectively treat HeFH and potentially lower the CVD risk in these high-risk patients even more than currently achieved with LDL-C lowering alone.

### Antiatherothrombotic properties of statins… [^705fd6d5]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Editor, JAMA. Clinical trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statin therapy have demonstrated that baseline or treated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are only weakly associated with net coronary. either by reducing the availability of free cholesterol toward the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase by trapping it in phospholipid-containing pools, or by inhibiting LDL endocytosis related to reduced synthesis of mevalonate or mevalonate by-products required for cholesterol esterification. 87 Kempen et al88 reported. a dose-dependent inhibition of cholesterol accumulation in macrophages that was greater with lovastatin and simvastatin than with pravastatin. Lowering blood LDL cholesterol levels may facilitate plaque stability either through a reduction in size89, 90 or by an alteration of the physiochemical properties of lipid cores. 91, 92.

In contrast, Mayer et al127 found a significant 10% reduction in fibrinogen levels in 20 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with lovastatin after 16 weeks of therapy, with further reductions throughout the 12-month interval of the study. This study was limited by fibrinogen measurements. binding to plasminogen receptors, fibrinogen, and fibrin. 154 The net effect is impaired plasminogen activation and plasmin generation at the thrombus surface. 155 The Lp levels can increase by as much as 34% with statin therapy156-160 and potentially impair clot lysis.

Since the importance of Lp on cardiovascular. risk diminishes with LDL cholesterol–lowering therapy, 155 the importance of this modest evaluation in Lp levels on overall cardiovascular risk is unclear. The opposing effects of statins on the different mediators of fibrinolysis may offset each other. Statins influence critical pathways that regulate plaque stability and.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^45e79243]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the 2019 National Lipid Association (NLA) Scientific Statement on Use of Lipoprotein(a) in Clinical Practice was issued, accumulating epidemiological data have clarified the relationship between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] level and cardiovascular disease risk and risk reduction. Therefore, the NLA developed this focused update to guide clinicians in applying this emerging evidence in clinical practice. We now have sufficient evidence to support the recommendation to measure Lp(a) levels at least once in every adult for risk stratification. Individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) are considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) are considered high risk, and individuals with Lp(a) levels between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives of patients with elevated Lp(a) can identify additional individuals at risk who require intervention. Patients with elevated Lp(a) should receive early, more-intensive risk factor management, including lifestyle modification and lipid-lowering drug therapy in high-risk individuals, primarily to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an indication for lipoprotein apheresis (which reduces both Lp(a) and LDL-C) in high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and documented coronary or peripheral artery disease whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL [∼150 nmol/L)] and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. Although Lp(a) is an established independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and despite the high prevalence of Lp(a) elevation (∼1 of 5 individuals), measurement rates are low, warranting improved screening strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.

The Role of Other Atherogenic Lipids

Beyond LDL‐C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. Current AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk‐enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10‐year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL‐C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid‐related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk‐enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

Table 2.
LDL-C Response in Statin Arms of Clinical Trials

Compared with Lp(a) ≤ 50 mg/dL and achieved LDL-C in the first quartile, increased risk was observed when achieved LDL-C was in the fourth quartile with Lp(a) ≤ 50 mg/dL (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.17–1.70]), when Lp(a) was > 50 mg/dL with LDL-C in the first quartile (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.79]), and particularly when Lp(a) was > 50 mg/dL and LDL-C was in the fourth quartile (HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.46–2.48]). A similar trend of increasing observed event rates with higher LDL-C and Lp(a) levels was observed (Figure 3). Similar results were observed when follow-up Lp(a) was used instead of baseline Lp(a) with higher HRs overall when Lp(a) was elevated (for Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL and achieved LDL-C in the fourth quartile, HR was 2.13 [95% CI, 1.65–2.75]). Similar results were also observed when categorizing achieved LDL-C using study-specific quartiles (data not shown), when using the study-specific median, or with an LDL-C threshold of 100 mg/dL. Results were also consistent when comparing those with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL and achieved LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL compared with those with Lp(a) ≤ 50 mg/dL and achieved LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.86–2.24]), although power was limited by the small number of participants (n = 184).

### Lipoprotein (a): an enigmatic sheep in the lipoprotein herd [^ea29d639]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Of the previously described, the most widely held view linking PCSK9 inhibition and Lp(a) reduction relates to enhanced LDLR-mediated clearance. However, the notion that Lp(a) clearance is mediated by LDLR poses several challenges: 1) Lp(a) has poor affinity for LDLR, far less than that of LDL; 2) the catabolic rate of Lp(a) is similar in subjects with FH and without FH; 3) Lp(a) levels are largely unaffected by other therapies that upregulate the LDLR (e.g. statins, ezetimibe); 4) PCSK9 inhibition in patients with homozygous FH and null LDLR mutations lowers Lp(a) more than does LDL-C levels; 5) similar levels of Lp(a) were observed in carriers versus noncarriers of loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9; and 6) there is no consistent correlation between plasma PCSK9 and Lp(a) concentrations across epidemiological studies.

Regardless of mechanism, the epidemiological and genetic associations of Lp(a) with ASCVD and calcific aortic stenosis drive continued interest in understanding how PCSK9 inhibition may play a role in reducing the burden of Lp(a) associated disease. Moreover, recent focused subanalyses from the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trials lend credence to the notion that PCSK9 inhibitor−induced Lp(a) reduction may effectively reduce residual ASCVD risk. The findings from these subanalyses, with respect to PCSK9 inhibitor−associated Lp(a) lowering, are noteworthy and beg the question as to the potential future role of PCSK9 inhibition in thwarting residual cardiovascular risk in subjects with established ASCVD and elevated Lp(a), regardless of LDL-C.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^52b8fef6]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Compared with LDL, Lp(a) is relatively refractory to both lifestyle and drug intervention. The data on the effects of statins and fibrates on Lp(a) are limited and highly variable. Overall, statins have, however, been shown to consistently and modestly decrease elevated Lp(a) in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Other agents reported to decrease Lp(a) to a minor degree (< 10%) include aspirin,-carnitine, ascorbic acid combined with-lysine, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, androgens, oestrogen, and its replacements (e.g. tibolone), anti-estrogens (e.g. tamoxifen), and thyroxine replacement in hypothyroid subjects.

Larger studies of longer duration of Lp(a) lowering against background statin therapy in high-risk individuals including diabetics are needed. In the FATS angiographic trial, aggressive lowering of LDL and apolipoprotein B abrogated the risk due to Lp(a) in patients with established coronary disease. The ongoing AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE trials will further evaluate this notion, although the niacin employed in these trials is not selective for Lp(a) lowering as noted above.

It is clear that more detailed studies of the metabolism of Lp(a) are required to aid in the design and development of selective and potent therapies for lowering Lp(a). Given the critical role of Lp(a) synthesis in determining the plasma concentration of Lp(a), targeting either the synthesis of apolipoprotein(a) and/or the formation of Lp(a) would appear worthwhile. Antisense oligonucleotide and thyroid hormone analogue therapies directed at apolipoprotein(a) synthesis may hold particular promise for the future.

Finally, in young or middle-aged patients with evidence of progressive coronary disease and markedly elevated plasma Lp(a), serious consideration should be given to instituting LDL apheresis which removes Lp(a) efficaciously; however, this form of treatment is prohibitively expensive and impractical for most patients and most clinical centres.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^d001222e]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

The effect of statins on Lp(a) levels is controversial; furthermore, the potential action of statins on apo(a) fragmentation is indeterminate. We therefore determined the circulating levels of Lp(a) and of apo(a) fragments in hypercholesterolemic patients before and after treatment (6 weeks) with Atorvastatin 10 mg/day (A10) or Simvastatin 20 mg/day (S20). In a double blind study, hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 391) at high cardiovascular risk (LDL-C ≥ 4.13 mmol/l; TG < 2.24 mmol/l; 34% with documented CHD; 45% hypertensive; and 29% current smokers) were assigned to treatment with A10 (n = 199) or S20 (n = 192). Plasma Lp(a) and apo(a) fragment levels (n = 206) were measured prior to and after treatment. At baseline, A10 and S20 groups did not differ in plasma levels of lipids, Lp(a) (A10: 0.45 ± 0.48 mg/ml, S20: 0.46 ± 0.5), and apo(a) fragments (A10: 3.88 ± 5.22 microg/ml; S20: 3.25 ± 3), and equally in apo(a) isoform size (A10: 26 ± 5 kr, S20: 25.5 ± 5.3). After treatment, both statins significantly reduced Lp(a) levels (A10: 0.42 ± 0.47 mg/ml, 6% variation, P < 0.001; S20: 0.45 ± 0.53 mg/ml, 0.02% variation, P = 0.046). A10 and S20 did not significantly differ in their efficacy to lower Lp(a) levels. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the reduction of Lp(a) levels was independently associated with Lp(a) baseline concentration, but not to other variables, including LDL-C reduction. Plasma levels of apo(a) fragments were not modified by either statin. In conclusion, both A10 and S20 significantly lowered Lp(a), although this effect was of greater magnitude in atorvastatin-treated patients.

Lipid testing

Beyond conventional recommendations for lipid testing, selective evaluation of additional lipoproteins should be considered. First, Lp(a) screening should be given strong consideration, considering a high prevalence of ∼20% in the general population. Lp(a) is a widely recognized independent risk factor for ASCVD and has been listed as a risk-enhancing factor in U.S.-based guidelines. However, many major societies recommend universal Lp(a) testing, and the time has come for ACC/AHA guidelines to follow suit. However, while trends are shifting toward universal screening, it is worth nothing that there are no specific Lp(a)-lowering treatments currently available. While there is guidance regarding contemporary treatment, specific outcome trials of Lp(a)-lowering drugs are ongoing. While it is noted as a risk-enhancing factor in AHA/ACC Cholesterol Guidelines, there is a need for clearer guidance on apolipoprotein B (ApoB) testing, given its critical role in the pathophysiology of ASCVD and as a risk factor, especially in patients with metabolic syndrome and high levels of triglycerides. European and Canadian guidelines already recommend ApoB measurement, and the National Lipid Association's recent guidance in this area is encouraging. As with Lp(a), it warrants mention that LLT outcome trials have not used ApoB as a target of treatment, and therefore, recommendations in this regard are based on secondary analyses.

### Lipoprotein (a) interactions with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors in premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [^52e4eee1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Future trials targeting individuals with high Lp(a) using statins (to lower LDL‐C), niacin, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, 34, 35 or specific Lp(a)‐lowering antisense therapies 36 are clearly warranted to confirm the benefits of lipid‐lowering in individuals with high Lp(a), and should pay special attention to the subgroup with concomitant elevations of LDL‐C, who may be at highest cardiovascular risk. It is noteworthy that PCSK9 inhibitors have shown promising results with respect to significantly lowering both Lp(a) and LDL‐C and may serve as the future preferred treatment strategy for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia with combined elevations of Lp(a) and LDL‐C. 34, 35, 37 Anacetrapib, the only cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor currently under investigation, has also been suggested to effectively reduce both LDL‐C and Lp(a) levels. 38 In contrast, Lp(a)‐lowering agents such as tibolone, 39 as well as recent antisense therapies could potentially be used as the primary approach to treat individuals with isolated high Lp(a) levels. 36 A randomized trial with Lp(a)‐lowering antisense agents could also provide the final confirmatory test of causality for the role of Lp(a) in coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease. 40

### Achieving greater reductions in cardiovascular risk: lessons from statin therapy on risk measures and risk reduction [^ca5eec91]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statins have been shown to significantly reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the primary- and secondary-prevention settings. Benefit has been observed even in high-risk patients whose baseline LDL cholesterol levels were below the drug initiation levels recommended by current treatment guidelines. Levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total apolipoprotein B more accurately reflect circulating levels of atherogenic particles than does LDL cholesterol concentration, and may provide a surrogate marker that correlates better to CHD event reduction after statin therapy than LDL cholesterol level. More effective lipid-lowering therapy than that currently practiced may be needed in many patients to achieve optimal CHD risk reduction.

### Estimation of the required lipoprotein (a)-lowering therapeutic effect size for reduction in coronary heart disease outcomes: a mendelian randomization analysis [^2315f306]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Genetic and epidemiologic data suggest that lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is one of the strongest genetically determined risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Specific therapies to lower Lp(a) are on the horizon, but the required reduction of Lp(a) to translate into clinically relevant lowering of CHD outcomes is a matter of debate.

Objective

To estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size that may be associated with a reduction of CHD outcomes compared with the effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Genetic epidemiologic study using a mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size for a clinically meaningful effect on outcomes. We used the effect estimates for Lp(a) from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis on Lp(a) published in 2017 of 5 different primarily population-based studies of European ancestry. All Lp(a) measurements were performed in 1 laboratory. Genetic estimates for 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on Lp(a) concentrations were used. Odds ratios for these 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CHD risk were retrieved from a subsample of the CHD Exome+ consortium.

Exposures

Genetic LPA score, plasma Lp(a) concentrations, and observations of statin therapies on CHD outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coronary heart disease.

Results

The study included 13 781 individuals from the Lp(a)-GWAS-Consortium from 5 primarily population-based studies and 20 793 CHD cases and 27 540 controls from a subsample of the CHD Exome+ consortium. Four of the studies were similar in age distribution (means between 51 and 59 years), and 1 cohort was younger; mean age, 32 years. The frequency of women was similar between 51% and 55%. We estimated that the required reduction in Lp(a) effect size would be 65.7 mg/dL (95% CI, 46.3–88.3) to reach the same potential effect on clinical outcomes that can be reached by lowering LDL-C by 38.67 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259).

Conclusions and Relevance

This mendelian randomization analysis estimated a required Lp(a)-lowering effect size of 65.7 mg/dL to reach the same effect as a 38.67-mg/dL lowering of LDL-C. However, this estimate is determined by the observed effect estimates of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on Lp(a) concentrations and is therefore influenced by the standardization of the Lp(a) assay used. As a consequence, calculations of the required Lp(a)-lowering potential of a drug to be clinically effective might have been overestimated in the past.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^e0310635]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] — measurement is supported in defined risk settings. Lp(a) is elevated in approximately 20% of the population and is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Recommendations include using assays calibrated against established reference material and measuring to refine risk when premature ASCVD has occurred in adults (< 55 y of age in men; < 65 y of age in women) in the individual or family. Additionally, persons with primary severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 190 mg/dL), suspected familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), or those at very high risk of ASCVD should have Lp(a) measured to better define potential benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy; the 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society Cholesterol Guideline has also identified Lp(a) as a risk enhancer test in patients at intermediate risk.

### Pharmacological strategies for lowering LDL cholesterol: statins and beyond [^91ef2942]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

A continuous, graded relationship exists between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This finding has been confirmed at progressively lower levels of LDL-C by results from clinical trials of therapies, particularly high-potency statins, which provide increasingly greater reductions in LDL-C levels. On the basis of this clinical trial evidence, progressively lower LDL-C goals for increasing numbers of patients, stratified by absolute CVD risk, have been recommended in guidelines for cholesterol management and CVD prevention. Some notable exceptions have been made, however, such as patients with end-stage renal disease or heart failure. To achieve low LDL-C goals, statins are first-line pharmacological therapy and can be combined with other agents to provide additional reductions in LDL-C levels as well as improvements in other lipoprotein fractions. Investigational agents that reduce LDL-C levels by other mechanisms are under development and could provide additional therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal LDL-C levels. These agents could be particularly appropriate for patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels, such as those with genetic dyslipidemia, for whom maximal drug therapy is insufficient to reduce LDL-C concentrations to recommended levels.

### Lipoprotein (a) and its significance in cardiovascular disease: a review [^de768117]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-like particle bound to apolipoprotein(a). This novel marker of cardiovascular disease acts through induction of vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, calcification, and thrombosis. While an absolute risk threshold remains to be universally accepted, an estimated 20% to 25% of the global population have Lp(a) levels of 50 mg/dL or higher, a level noted by the European Atherosclerosis Society to confer increased cardiovascular risk.

Observations

Compelling evidence from pathophysiological, observational, and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between high Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Additional evidence has demonstrated that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with a residual cardiovascular risk despite traditional risk factor optimization, including LDL cholesterol reduction. These findings have led to the formulation of the Lp(a) hypothesis, namely that Lp(a) lowering leads to cardiovascular risk reduction, intensifying the search for Lp(a)-reducing therapies. The ineffectiveness of lifestyle modification, statins, and ezetimibe to lower Lp(a); the modest Lp(a) reduction with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors; the adverse effect profile and unclear cardiovascular benefit of pharmacotherapies such as niacin and mipomersen; and the impracticality of regular lipoprotein apheresis represent major challenges to currently available therapies. Nevertheless, emerging nucleic acid-based therapies, such as the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and the small interfering RNA olpasiran, are generating interest because of their potent Lp(a)-lowering effects. Assessment of new-onset diabetes in patients achieving very low Lp(a) levels will be important in future trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Epidemiologic and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between elevated Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aortic valve stenosis. Emerging nucleic acid-based therapies have potent Lp(a)-lowering effects and appear safe; phase 3 trials will establish whether they improve cardiovascular outcomes.

Lipoprotein(a): Hope on the Horizon

Lipoprotein(a) Lowering

Mendelian randomization studies have estimated that a reduction in lipoprotein(a) levels of > 50 to 100 mg/dL is required for a clinically meaningful reduction in the short‐term risk of ASCVD events (within 5 years). The lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of currently available therapies are summarized in Table 3., At present, there are no drugs specifically approved for lipoprotein(a) lowering; however, lipoprotein apheresis can be effective in reducing lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with high lipoprotein(a) (> 120 nmol/L) and progressive ASCVD. While apheresis is associated with meaningful lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects, it can take up to 3 hours for each treatment to be administered, which may be inconvenient for many patients.

Table 3
Lipoprotein(a)‐Lowering Effects of Currently Available Therapies,

The lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of established lipid‐lowering therapies have been studied in clinical trials. However, these studies were not conducted in populations enriched for patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) and were not powered to evaluate the lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of these agents. Anti‐proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated modest reductions in lipoprotein(a) levels of up to 27%, while data for statins are conflicting, with some evidence suggesting that statins may slightly increase lipoprotein(a) levels. However, a 2022 meta‐analysis concluded that, compared with a placebo, statins do not lead to clinically important reductions in lipoprotein(a) levels in patients at risk for CVD.

### Lipoprotein (a) concentrations, rosuvastatin therapy, and residual vascular risk: an analysis from the JUPITER trial (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) [^cfd2f8a4]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a low-density lipoprotein-like particle largely independent of known risk factors and predictive of cardiovascular disease. Statins may offset the risk associated with elevated Lp(a), but it is unknown whether Lp(a) is a determinant of residual risk in the setting of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after potent statin therapy.

Methods and Results

Baseline and on-treatment Lp(a) concentrations were assessed in 9612 multiethnic participants in the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) before and after random allocation to rosuvastatin 20 mg/d or placebo, with outcomes reported for whites (n = 7746). Lp(a) concentrations (median [25th-75th percentile], in nmol/L) were highest in blacks (60 [34–100]), then Asians (38 [18–60]), Hispanics (24 [11–46]), and whites (23 [10–50]; P < 0.001). Although the median change in Lp(a) with rosuvastatin and placebo was zero, rosuvastatin nonetheless resulted in a small but statistically significant positive shift in the overall Lp(a) distribution (P < 0.0001). Baseline Lp(a) concentrations were associated with incident cardiovascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio per 1-SD increment in Ln[Lp(a)], 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.34; P = 0.02). Similarly, on-statin Lp(a) concentrations were associated with residual risk of cardiovascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.59; P = 0.04), which was independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other factors. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced incident cardiovascular disease among participants with baseline Lp(a) greater than or equal to the median (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.90) and Lp(a) less than the median (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.72), with no evidence of interaction. Similar results were obtained when analyses included nonwhites.

Conclusion

Among white JUPITER participants treated with potent statin therapy, Lp(a) was a significant determinant of residual risk. The magnitude of relative risk reduction with rosuvastatin was similar among participants with high or low Lp(a).

### Relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) lowering in response to PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab [^c2cc1d3d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite its low plasma abundance, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) acts as a master regulator of LDL (low‐density lipoprotein) metabolism by binding to the LDLR (low‐density lipoprotein receptor) and targeting it for lysosomal degradation. 1 In 2015, 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting PCSK9 were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or familial hypercholesterolemia requiring additional LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) lowering. In 2017, the first large randomized controlled outcome trial with a PCSK9 inhibitor, evolocumab, demonstrated statistically significant reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke rates over 2.2 years in patients with preexisting vascular disease above optimized statin therapy. 2 Similarly, positive results from the other antibody (alirocumab) large randomized controlled outcome trial were recently published. 3

PCSK9 inhibitors are highly efficacious lipid‐lowering drugs, with LDL‐C reductions generally ranging from 50% to 60% in 12‐week interventional studies. 4, 5, 6 Both antibodies targeting PCSK9 have also consistently demonstrated significant (25–30%) reductions in Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]). 7, 8 Although the potent reduction in LDL‐C achieved by PCSK9 inhibition is mediated through its profound effect on LDLR preservation, the mechanism of Lp(a) lowering is unknown. Although some suggest that Lp(a) reduction achieved with PCSK9 inhibition is also secondary to the increase in LDLR expression, 9 alternative pathways beyond LDLR‐mediated clearance may be involved in Lp(a) reduction. 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 If PCSK9 antagonism lowers Lp(a) solely through LDLR‐mediated clearance, then Lp(a) and LDL‐C lowering should be proportional, with all individuals achieving the 2:1 ratio.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^ff116cdc]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

An elevated level of Lp(a) is an independent highly prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this analysis of 47 RCTs comparing PCSK9i monoclonal antibody therapy vs placebo or ezetimibe, PCSK9is reduced Lp(a) levels by 27% on average. Mean change from the baseline in LDL-C and ApoB positively correlates with Lp(a) reduction. Given the modest but significant reduction in Lp(a) level, further research is needed to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibody based PCSK9i on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated Lp(a).

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: PCSK9is reduced lipoprotein(a) levels regardless of comparator, treatment duration, type of PCSK9i used, or the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The impact of PCSK9is on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) needs to be evaluated.

### The evolving landscape of targets for lipid lowering: from molecular mechanisms to translational implications [^f1153648]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains a major global health challenge, with dyslipidaemia being a key modifiable risk factor. While low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary target for lipid-lowering therapies, recent evidence highlights the importance of triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] for residual cardiovascular risk. Current lipid-lowering therapies target key enzymes and proteins involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and increasing LDL receptor (LDLR) expression in the liver. Bempedoic acid inhibits ATP citrate lyase, the enzyme upstream of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway, offering an alternative to statins by selectively acting in the liver, minimizing muscle-related side effects. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors [evolocumab, alirocumab, inclisiran, lerodalcibep, and enlicitide decanoate (MK0616)] prevent LDLR degradation, while ezetimibe limits intestinal cholesterol absorption. Emerging lipid-lowering targets include angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3) and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III). Inhibiting ANGPTL3 reduces both triglycerides and LDL-C independently of LDL receptor. Inhibition of apoC-III unleashes lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, promoting triglyceride-rich particle catabolism, even in complete LPL deficiency. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition also increases the catabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Ongoing research into strategies to reduce Lp(a), primarily but not exclusively through antisense therapies, aims to demonstrate the cardiovascular benefits of targeting this lipoprotein. In summary, the field of targets for lipid and lipoprotein lowering is constantly evolving and offers new strategies for patients resistant to current therapies or with specific lipid profile abnormalities.

### Lipoprotein (a) reductions from PCSK9 inhibition and major adverse cardiovascular events: pooled analysis of alirocumab phase 3 trials [^a6373cba]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels are considered a causal factor for cardiovascular disease. In phase 3 ODYSSEY trials, alirocumab reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and Lp(a), with concomitant reductions in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We assessed whether lower on-study and greater percentage reductions in Lp(a) are associated with a lower risk of MACE.

Methods

Post-hoc analysis of data pooled from 10 phase 3 ODYSSEY trials comparing alirocumab with control (placebo or ezetimibe) in patients (n = 4983) with cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors, and hypercholesterolemia despite statin/other lipid-lowering therapies.

Results

Median (Q1, Q3) baseline Lp(a) levels were 23.5 (8.0, 67.0) mg/dL. Median Lp(a) changes from baseline with alirocumab were -25.6% vs. -2.5% with placebo (absolute reductions 6.8 vs. 0.5 mg/dL) in placebo-controlled trials, and -21.4% vs. 0.0% with ezetimibe (4.5 vs. 0.0 mg/dL) in ezetimibe-controlled trials. During follow-up (6699 patient-years), 104 patients experienced MACE. A 12% relative risk reduction in MACE per 25% reduction in Lp(a) (p = 0.0254) was no longer significant after adjustment for LDL-C changes: hazard ratio per 25% reduction: 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.79–1.01; p = 0.0780). In subgroup analysis, the association between Lp(a) reduction and MACE remained significant in a fully adjusted model among participants with baseline Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (p-interaction vs. Lp(a) < 50 mg/dL: 0.0549).

Conclusions

In this population, Lp(a) reductions were not significantly associated with MACE independently of LDL-C reductions. Reducing the risk of MACE by targeting Lp(a) may require greater reductions in Lp(a) with more potent therapies and/or higher initial Lp(a) levels.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^e918528e]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis evaluating the effect of PCSK9is on Lp(a) levels, we observed that PCSK9i therapy significantly reduced Lp(a) levels, regardless of the comparator (placebo or ezetimibe), treatment duration, type of PCSK9i used, or the presence of FH. This may be attributed to the proposed mechanisms by which PCSK9i lower Lp(a) levels, namely through the reduction of its production and the enhancement of its clearance, as previously suggested in the literature. Other studies suggest that PCSK9i such as evolocumab may further promote Lp(a) catabolism by significantly upregulating LDL receptor expression, thereby enhancing the clearance of Lp(a) holoparticles, in the presence of statins. Additionally, PCSK9i treatment also significantly reduced LDL-C and ApoB levels.

Among the subgroup analyses, only the difference in duration of treatment had significant bearing on the treatment effect. Although our study demonstrated that PCSK9i leads to a modest Lp(a) lowering, the treatment effect appears to be higher in the first 12 weeks vs beyond 12 weeks of treatment. Some potential mechanisms underlying this observation have been proposed. Prolonged use of PCSK9i may induce its own resistance, which is thought to be from: 1) increased endogenous PCSK9 triggered by PCSK9i use; and 2) delayed PCSK9 clearance due to accumulation of monoclonal antibody-PCSK9 complexes. However, more data is needed to determine the possible reason of this treatment difference.

Many prospective studies have reported the role of PCSK9i in reducing Lp(a) levels, and prior pooled analyses have supported the efficacy of these agents. The results of our meta-analysis showed that the use of PCSK9i resulted in statistically significant reductions in plasma Lp(a) levels vs comparators (placebo and ezetimibe), further increasing our understanding of the effect of PCSK9i on Lp(a) level based on data from multiple clinical trials. Furthermore, this analysis enriches available evidence by providing detailed information on subgroups of interest, based on duration of treatment, comparator, type of PCSK9i, and presence of FH. The 27% reduction in Lp(a) level with PCSK9i compared to comparators (placebo and ezetimibe) in this analysis is consistent with the reports in previous meta-analyses citing on average 26% reduction. Beyond confirming this PCSK9i's effect on Lp(a), we also performed robust subgroup analyses with emphasis on duration of treatment and FH status.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^958232a8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) measurement — Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) is described as an independent risk factor for ASCVD, yet clinical assays used in patient care are not well standardized; the National Lipid Association recommends an immunochemical assay calibrated against WHO/IFCCLM secondary reference material, with the preferred reporting unit in nmol/L. Reported performance indicates Lp(a) assay variability can be as high as 26% CV and the precision of most Lp(a) assays ranges between 10% to 12%. The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society guideline classified Lp(a) measurement as a risk enhancer that could help guide care for persons at intermediate ASCVD risk, and measuring Lp(a) may also be valuable in patients with a strong family history of ASCVD, those who do not fully respond to statin therapy, or those with ASCVD events despite evidence-based lipid-lowering therapy.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a): a pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^86d23f17]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Lp(a) is a covalent conjugate of an LDL‐like lipoprotein particle and apolipoprotein(a). Prospective longitudinal cohort and Mendelian randomization studies confirm that elevated levels of Lp(a) are causally associated with risk for ASCVD‐related events. 1, 5, 6, 21, 22 Neither statins nor ezetimibe impact serum levels of Lp(a). Nicotinic acid was long heralded as a therapy that reduced Lp(a). 23 In a post hoc analysis of the AIM HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial, there was no demonstrable impact of the limited extent of Lp(a) lowering with nicotinic acid on risk for cardiovascular events. 24 In a recent kinetic analysis by Watts et al, it was shown that evolocumab therapy decreases hepatic production of Lp(a) when used as monotherapy and increases the clearance of Lp(a) when used in combination with a statin, 25 likely via a LDL receptor–dependent pathway. 26, 27 In the FOURIER trial, evolocumab reduced Lp(a) by a median of 26.9%, consistent with our findings herein. 28 This analysis of FOURIER also demonstrated that higher baseline Lp(a) concentration helped to identify individuals with greater clinical efficacy with evolocumab, raising the possibility that in addition to LDL lowering, concurrent reduction in Lp(a) by evolocumab may have provided incremental risk reduction.

### Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular events have higher circulating Lp (a) levels [^669dc658]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is its major risk factor. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL-C since birth and subsequent premature CVD. There is a heterogeneity in the CVD onset in patients with FH. This is potentially due to the presence of other independent risk factors. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an LDL-like particle and represents a strong risk factor for CVD.

Objective

Our objective was to understand the contribution of Lp(a) in the susceptibility to CVD in individuals with genetic diagnosis of FH.

Methods

We measured Lp(a) levels in 2 independent and well-characterized genetic-FH cohorts: the FH-Gothenburg cohort (n = 190) and the FH-CEGP Milan cohort (n = 160). The genetic diagnosis was performed by targeted next-generation sequencing (FH-Gothenburg and part of the FH-CEGP Milan cohort), or by Sanger sequencing.

Results

We show that among individuals with genetic diagnosis of FH, those with previous CVD had higher Lp(a) levels. In addition, analyzing the response to the lipid-lowering therapies, we have also shown that statins had the same LDL-C-lowering effect irrespective of the type of FH-causative mutation. However, when we examined the lipid-lowering effect of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition by antibodies, we observed a trend in a better reduction of the LDL-C level in carriers of nonsense mutations.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our results suggest that Lp(a) contributes to CVD onset in individuals with genetic diagnosis of FH. Our finding supports the importance to identify an efficacious therapy to lower Lp(a) in patients with FH to prevent CVD onset or recurrence.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^fb26484f]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the continuous association between baseline Lp(a) and ASCVD risk, we modeled the relative risk increase (expressed as a hazard ratio) for ASCVD depending on an individual's baseline Lp(a) level, compared with a reference level of 5 mg/dL, separately for patients on placebo or statin using generalized additive Cox models. A key advantage of generalized additive models is their flexibility in effect modeling of continuous covariates without imposing a specific parametric form, whereas smoothing is enforced (and overfitting avoided) because of penalization. The models were adjusted for the covariates listed previously, included the interaction between baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C, and were stratified by trial and treatment assignment.

To investigate whether baseline Lp(a) affects the association between baseline LDL-C and ASCVD risk, we used Cox proportional hazards models with an interaction term for baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C, adjusted for the covariates listed previously, stratified by trial and treatment assignment, and included a study-specific random-effect term for Lp(a). This analysis was performed in the overall cohort and separately for those assigned placebo or statin. As a sensitivity analysis, the association between baseline LDL-C level and ASCVD risk was evaluated using LDL-C corrected for the component of Lp(a) cholesterol. A range of correction factors from 20% to 45% was used by subtracting 20% to 45% of Lp(a) mass from LDL-C.

We evaluated the association between categories of baseline Lp(a) and statin-achieved LDL-C with ASCVD risk in statin-treated individuals. In this analysis, participants were categorized by baseline Lp(a) dichotomized at 50 mg/dL (≈125 nmol/L) and by achieved LDL-C quartiles. A threshold of 50 mg/dL for Lp(a) was chosen, as current guidelines define levels above this threshold as elevated or high risk. Again, models were adjusted for the covariates listed previously and stratified by trial. We also categorized individuals by baseline Lp(a) level and (study-specific and overall) quartile of absolute change in LDL-C level with statin therapy. We performed multiple sensitivity analyses. We categorized participants based on a study-specific median achieved LDL-C level, by an achieved LDL-C threshold of 100 or 55 mg/dL, or by statin-achieved Lp(a) and LDL-C levels. Observed event rates per 100 person-years were calculated.

### Beyond the laboratory: clinical implications for statin pleiotropy [^fc343bc1]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Results from large-scale clinical trials of lipid lowering with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have led to a revolution in the management of atherosclerosis. In addition to their potent effect on serum lipid levels, statins influence several other cellular pathways, including those involving inflammatory, oxidative, and thrombotic processes. These effects clearly have the potential to beneficially modify the atherogenic process, and it has been suggested that they contribute to the impressive results seen in the clinical trials. We review the clinical evidence for benefits of statin therapy that are distinct from their effect on lipid biology. In particular, we address three key issues: the role of statins in diseases not traditionally associated with elevated cholesterol levels; whether clinical benefits are seen with statin therapy before an effect on lipid levels; and whether the magnitude of clinical benefit observed with statin therapy is unrelated to the degree of cholesterol reduction. At present, low-density-lipoprotein lowering seems to be the primary mechanism underlying the clinical benefits of statin therapy and should remain the focus of risk-reduction strategies in clinical practice.

Lifestyle modification — adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the foundation of prevention, and despite minor and variable impacts of diet and physical activity on Lp(a) concentrations, a healthy lifestyle is clearly associated with reduced vascular risk and "should be recommended for all adults and children," including those with elevated Lp(a).

### CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibition with anacetrapib decreases production of lipoprotein (a) in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects [^200e4c97]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Statins and ezetimibe are cardioprotective because of their ability to reduce plasma levels of the major atherogenic apoB lipoproteins. They do not, however, reduce levels of Lp(a), a factor that contributes to residual cardiovascular risk. In contrast, the recently approved PCSK9 inhibitors do lower plasma Lp(a) levels, as does anacetrapib, one of the remaining CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitors in development.

Anacetrapib, a small-molecule inhibitor of CETP, is associated with a dose-dependent decrease in plasma Lp(a) when given as a monotherapy. In the DEFINE trial (Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP Inhibition With Anacetrapib), a study of ≈ 1600 subjects, 100 mg/d of anacetrapib given with a statin was associated with a 23.8% reduction in Lp(a) after 24 weeks and 17.1% after 76 weeks. Early kinetic studies suggested that baseline levels of Lp(a) are primarily determined by production rather than fractional clearance. However, we recently reported that the PCSK9 inhibitor, alirocumab, reduced Lp(a) concentrations by increasing the clearance of apo(a) without affecting its production. To understand the mechanism by which anacetrapib lowers Lp(a), we examined apo(a) metabolism using stable isotopes and novel liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods.

### Long term statin treatment reduces lipoprotein (a) concentrations in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia [^305ed4cb]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Raised plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It is unknown whether increased Lp(a) is an additional risk factor for coronary artery disease in familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) or whether statin treatment can reduce Lp(a) concentrations in the long term.

Objective

To investigate Lp(a) concentrations in relation to statin treatment and the progression of atherosclerosis in a large cohort of FH patients.

Design

A two year, randomised, double blind trial (the ASAP trial).

Patients

325 heterozygous FH patients.

Intervention

Treatment with 80 mg atorvastatin or 40 mg simvastatin.

Main Outcome Measure

Change in Lp(a) concentrations and intima-media thickness of carotid artery segments at one year and two years.

Results

At baseline, median Lp(a) concentrations were 327 mg/l and 531 mg/l in the atorvastatin and simvastatin arms, respectively (p = 0.03). In the atorvastatin arm, Lp(a) concentrations decreased to 243 mg/l after one year (p < 0.001) and to 263 mg/l after two years (p < 0.001). In the simvastatin arm, Lp(a) concentrations decreased to 437 mg/l after one year (p < 0.001) and to 417 mg/l after two years (p < 0.001). The difference in Lp(a) reduction between the two treatment arms was significant after one year (p = 0.004), but not after two years (p = 0.086). Lp(a) concentrations at baseline were not related to cardiovascular events at baseline. There was no correlation between baseline Lp(a) concentrations and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations or intima-media thickness at baseline. Change in Lp(a) concentrations was not correlated with change in intima-media thickness after one or two years.

Conclusions

Long term statin treatment significantly lowers Lp(a) in FH patients. However, this reduction was unrelated to changes in intima-media thickness and casts doubt on the importance of Lp(a) in the progression of atherosclerotic disease in these patients.

### Lipoprotein (a) and the risk for recurrent Ischemic stroke events [^134eedec]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Determination of whether lowering Lp(a) reduces stroke risk awaits completion of the HORIZON (Randomized Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Trial Assessing the Impact of Lipoprotein (a) Lowering With Pelacarsen [TQJ230] on Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease;). This trial enrolled very high-risk patients with either ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. In contrast, the OCEAN(a) Outcomes Trial (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events and Lipoprotein(a) Reduction;), another trial of an Lp(a)-lowering therapy, is enrolling patients with coronary heart disease.

Until completion of clinical trials with Lp(a)-lowering therapies, we support screening for Lp(a) molar concentrations in adults with a stroke after resolution of the acute phase response as recommended by the American Heart Association. Interventions to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke events in these patients should include lifestyle modifications, control of cardiovascular risk factors, and lowering LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with a high-intensity statin. For stroke patients with an LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL despite taking maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an Lp(a) level > 125 nmol/L, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies could be considered based on subgroup analyses of FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes that reported this therapy reduces the risk for major cardiovascular events and this risk reduction was larger in patients with high vs low levels of Lp(a) (Figure 1). In patients with LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL, Lp(a) > 125 nmol/L, and LDL-C < 25% above the target, ezetimibe is an option.

Figure 1
Translating SPARCL-Lp(a) into Clinical Practice

Among SPARCL patients taking atorvastatin 80 mg daily, high vs low Lp(a) levels was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease events but not stroke events. Until completion of randomized clinical trials with selective Lp(a) lowering therapies, we advocate a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor to lower LDL-C < 55 mg/dL in patients with high Lp(a) levels, particularly when the LDL-C level is > 25% above targeted levels. LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) lowering in response to PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab [^82bc2e1d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have demonstrated that therapy with PCSK9 inhibitors not only potently reduces LDL‐C by 50% to 60% but also lowers plasma concentrations of Lp(a) by 25% to 30%. 7, 8, 14 Lp(a) is an atherogenic particle consisting of a molecule of apo(a) (apolipoprotein[a]), a nonfunctional mimic of plasminogen, covalently bound to apoB on the LDL particle. 10 Epidemiologic and genetic data have suggested that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 11, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25 The atherogenicity of Lp(a) is likely multifactorial and related to both its LDL and apo(a) moieties and to its enrichment in oxidized phospholipids. 23 Furthermore, given its similarity with a portion of plasminogen, Lp(a) may interfere with the fibrinolytic system, thereby facilitating atherothrombosis. 26 However, no effective therapies that target Lp(a) exist currently, leaving this potential major need unmet. 27 The mechanisms underpinning the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on Lp(a) levels are unknown and remain an area of interest for further research. It has been suggested that the Lp(a) reduction achieved with PCSK9 inhibition is secondary to the profound increase in LDLR expression, although a decrease in Lp(a) is not observed in patients taking statins, which also upregulate LDLR. 9 Although LDLR may mediate plasma Lp(a) removal, additional candidate clearance receptors for Lp(a) may exist, including LRP1 (LDL receptor–related protein 1), CD36 (CD36 molecule), TLR2 (toll‐like receptor 2), SR‐B1 (Scavenger receptor‐B1), and plasminogen receptors. 28 It is also conceivable that PCSK9 inhibition reduces Lp(a), at least to some extent, by disrupting its synthesis, secretion, or assembly. The FLOREY (Effects on Lipoprotein Metabolism From PCSK9 Inhibition Utilizing a Monoclonal Antibody) study suggests that evolocumab reduces Lp(a) by inhibition of apo(a) production and upregulation of the LDLR activity on Lp(a) clearance. 29 Although therapeutic antibodies do not enter the hepatocyte, they can still have an effect on Lp(a) production because the assembly of this particle is likely pericellular and relies on availability of preformed LDL, which is drastically reduced by PCSK9 inhibition. 30 Experimental data demonstrate that PCSK9 augments the secretion of apo(a) from hepatocytes, an effect dampened with a PCSK9 antibody inhibitor. 31 Others have suggested that when plasma LDL‐C levels are very low, Lp(a) can compete more favorably for the LDLR, 9 perhaps via apoE‐mediated processes. 32 Indeed, we observed greater Lp(a) reduction in patients who achieved lower on‐treatment LDL‐C levels, regardless of baseline LDL‐C (Figure 2 A and 2 B). Nevertheless, our finding of discordance between LDL‐C and Lp(a) reduction with evolocumab, for which the cutoffs for response to therapy were LDL‐C reduction > 35% and Lp(a) reduction > 10%, suggests that additional mechanisms might be at play. If PCSK9 inhibition does in fact lower Lp(a) simply and exclusively through LDLR‐mediated clearance, then the Lp(a) response would likely be proportional to the LDL‐C response. However, we observed differential patterns of LDL‐C and Lp(a) reductions as a function of baseline Lp(a) plasma levels.

### Lipoprotein (a) and benefit of PCSK9 inhibition in patients with nominally controlled LDL cholesterol [^644e70be]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Guidelines recommend nonstatin lipid-lowering agents in patients at very high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) if low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximum tolerated statin treatment. It is uncertain if this approach benefits patients with LDL-C near 70 mg/dL. Lipoprotein(a) levels may influence residual risk.

OBJECTIVES

In a post hoc analysis of the ODYSSEY Outcomes (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial, the authors evaluated the benefit of adding the proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor alirocumab to optimized statin treatment in patients with LDL-C levels near 70 mg/dL. Effects were evaluated according to concurrent lipoprotein(a) levels.

METHODS

ODYSSEY Outcomes compared alirocumab with placebo in 18,924 patients with recent acute coronary syndromes receiving optimized statin treatment. In 4,351 patients (23.0%), screening or randomization LDL-C was < 70 mg/dL (median 69.4 mg/dL; interquartile range: 64.3–74.0 mg/dL); in 14,573 patients (77.0%), both determinations were ≥ 70 mg/dL (median 94.0 mg/dL; interquartile range: 83.2–111.0 mg/dL).

RESULTS

In the lower LDL-C subgroup, MACE rates were 4.2 and 3.1 per 100 patient-years among placebo-treated patients with baseline lipoprotein(a) greater than or less than or equal to the median (13.7 mg/dL). Corresponding adjusted treatment hazard ratios were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.52–0.90) and 1.11 (95% Cl: 0.83–1.49), with treatment-lipoprotein(a) interaction on MACE (P interaction = 0.017). In the higher LDL-C subgroup, MACE rates were 4.7 and 3.8 per 100 patient-years among placebo-treated patients with lipoprotein(a) > 13.7 mg/dL or ≤ 13.7 mg/dL; corresponding adjusted treatment hazard ratios were 0.82 (95% Cl: 0.72–0.92) and 0.89 (95% Cl: 0.75–1.06), with P interaction = 0.43.

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with recent acute coronary syndromes and LDL-C near 70 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy, proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition provides incremental clinical benefit only when lipoprotein(a) concentration is at least mildly elevated.

### Depicting new pharmacological strategies for familial hypercholesterolaemia involving lipoprotein (a) [^48555ba4]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 35 million people worldwide suffer from heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH), a condition characterized by genetically determined life-long elevation of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). One in three of these patients also inherit an elevated plasma concentration of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], a lipoprotein particle with atherogenic, inflammatory and prothrombotic properties. Accordingly, the combination of high plasma LDL-C and Lp(a) can markedly accelerate premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Neither statin nor ezetimibe lowers Lp(a), so that FH patients with high Lp(a) remain at high residual risk of ASCVD. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are indicated for HeFH patients not at guideline-recommended LDL-C target, but only lower Lp(a) concentration by 15–30%. Recent trials employing apo(a) antisense therapy show more potent (up to 90%) reductions in plasma Lp(a). The combination of PCSK9 inhibitor and apo(a) antisense therapy appears the optimal strategy for mitigating residual risk of ASCVD in HeFH patients with high Lp(a).

### Lipoprotein (a): the perpetual supporting actor [^a3fe3afe]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The results reported in Verbeek et al. 's study are valid for the primary prevention setting. Evidence is more controversial in secondary prevention and for patients on statins. In the Rosuvastatin Versus Atorvastatin (SATURN) trial, baseline and follow-up Lp(a) levels were not associated with changes in per cent atheroma volume as measured with ultrasound.LDL-C decreased from 114 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL, while Lp(a) remained unchanged (17.4 mg/dL and 16.5 mg/dL, respectively) with statin therapy. The cut-off of 50 mg/dL for Lp(a) was neither protective nor a risk factor for disease progression. These data suggest that Lp(a) is not a good marker for the estimation of residual CV risk after initiation of statin therapy. A second subanalysis of the dal-Outcomes trial, including 4139 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with statins, did not show any association between Lp(a) concentrations and major adverse outcomes: for a doubling of the dose of Lp(a), the level of risk for CVD was stagnant (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96–1.06, P = 0.66). Similar results were also reported in three different pooled studies with 6708 subjects known for coronary artery disease: odds ratios (ORs) were 1.03 (95% CI 0.96–1.11) for each increase in log-transformed SD of Lp(a) or by quintile (highest vs. lowest OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83–1.34).

### Efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease [^8d52b059]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that PCSK9 inhibitors effectively reduce LDL-C and Lp(a) levels without increasing the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Therefore, integrating PCSK9 inhibitors into lipid-lowering regimens, either in combination with statins or with/without ezetimibe, represents a proactive and rational approach to lipid management, offering potential benefits for patients with CKD.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^acb25de8]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk associated with baseline Lp(a) levels in all participants was modeled continuously in multivariable adjusted models, centered at a reference Lp(a) of 5 mg/dL. Above this level, the risk associated with Lp(a) increased in a log-linear fashion in both the placebo and statin treatment groups (Figure 2). The multiplicative interaction between Lp(a) and LDL-C in these models was not significant (P = 0.125).

Figure 2.
Association between baseline lipoprotein(a) level and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in placebo and statin treatment arms. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk increases log-linearly with increasing lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels in both the placebo and statin treatment arms. Hazard ratios were calculated using a reference Lp(a) level of 5 mg/dL. Adjusted for age, sex, history of vascular disease, diabetes, smoking, systolic blood pressure, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and stratified by trial and treatment assignment.

Next, the association between baseline LDL-C and ASCVD risk was evaluated by baseline Lp(a) level continuously. The association between LDL-C and ASCVD risk appeared flat, without variation by baseline Lp(a) level in the overall study population. As expected, absolute risk was higher in the placebo group compared with the statin-treated group.

There was no significant interaction between baseline Lp(a) and presence of diabetes for ASCVD risk (P = 0.910) overall or in the placebo (P = 0.330) or statin (P = 0.480) groups. There was a borderline statistically significant interaction for LDL-C and diabetes (P = 0.056) overall with a stronger association between LDL-C and ASCVD risk among those with diabetes, with similar results among the statin group, but no significant interaction in the placebo group. When stratified by previous history of cardiovascular disease, there was no significant interaction between Lp(a) or LDL-C and diabetes among those with history of CVD. We also observed a consistent positive association between Lp(a) and LDL-C, evaluated continuously, and ASCVD risk when evaluated by individual study.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) levels with incidence of major adverse limb events [^815019d7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic disease of the lower-limb arteries affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Moreover, PAD remains underdiagnosed and untreated due to the asymptomatic onset of the disease. Patients with PAD can develop limb symptoms, ranging from claudication to critical limb-threatening ischemia, leading to a major adverse limb event, such as peripheral artery revascularization and lower-limb amputation. In addition to the usual cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, arterial hypertension, and smoking, one of the most important indicators of major adverse limb event is a previous peripheral revascularization itself, highlighting the importance of preventing the occurrence of major adverse limb events.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle synthesized in the liver and is composed of an apolipoprotein B100 covalently bound to the apolipoprotein(a), a glycoprotein not found in native LDL. High Lp(a) levels are well described in the literature as being involved in the development of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated and have a converging association with the development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. More than 90% of Lp(a) plasmatic levels are genetically determined, with low influence from the environment or nutrition, and statins have a neutral or modest Lp(a)-increasing outcome. New treatments are currently being developed to specifically reduce this target. Thus far, Lp(a) levels are assessed to better stratify patients at intermediate cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of PAD, but studies investigating the role of Lp(a) in lower-limb amputation or revascularization in a large population are lacking. To better understand the potential value of Lp(a)-lowering therapy in PAD, we assessed the association between Lp(a) levels and the incidence of major adverse limb events in unselected hospitalized patients.

### Lp (a)-an overlooked risk factor [^17e23fd2]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an increasingly discussed and studied risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis. Many genetic and epidemiological studies support the important causal role that Lp(a) plays in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Although dependent upon the threshold and unit of measurement of Lp(a), most estimates suggest between 20 and 30% of the world's population have elevated serum levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are predominantly mediated by genetics and are not significantly modified by lifestyle interventions. Efforts are ongoing to develop effective pharmacotherapies to lower Lp(a) and to determine if lowering Lp(a) with these medications ultimately decreases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. In this review, the genetics and pathophysiological properties of Lp(a) will be discussed as well as the epidemiological data demonstrating its impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for screening and how to currently approach patients with elevated Lp(a) are also noted. Finally, the spectrum of pharmacotherapies under development for Lp(a) lowering is detailed.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^786fa424]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review of lipid‐lowering therapies added to medium‐ to high‐intensity statin therapy and subsequent network meta‐analysis confirms the substantial LDL‐C reductions of PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe in individual trials. Among the PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab appeared to have a greater reduction than alirocumab (75 mg Q2W, ≈20%; 150 mg Q2W, ≈10%; 300 mg QM, ≈20%). These treatment differences were directionally consistent in the various analyses we conducted (ie, exclusion of studies leading to heterogeneity, variation of dosing amount and interval, broader background therapy spectrum). There was also some evidence of proportional treatment differences between evolocumab and other therapies in HDL‐C, non‐HDL‐C, ApoB, and Lp(a). The incidence of AEs was similar between individual therapies and placebo except for significantly higher treatment‐related AEs for evolocumab and alirocumab QM versus placebo.

Our work provides information on PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe added to statin therapy in those requiring further LDL‐C reduction. The trials generally evaluated patients either with CVD or at high risk of a CVD event, which is the expected target population for PCSK9 inhibitors both now and after cardiovascular outcomes trials for these medications are completed. 50, 51 We also characterized the reductions observed for PCSK9 inhibitors in other parameters including non‐HDL‐C and Lp(a). Non‐HDL‐C is emerging as a meaningful measure of CVD event risk, 52 and Lp(a) is associated with CVD event risk but is not reduced by statins. 53, 54

Finally, we analyzed dose‐specific LDL‐C reductions between PCSK9 inhibitors, which have not been a focus of published meta‐analyses. 16, 17, 18 The classwide reduction of LDL‐C with PCSK9 inhibitors observed in these meta‐analyses 16, 17, 18 is consistent with what we observed in the comparison of individual PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^decd3875]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

PCSK9-directed therapies — PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab; siRNA inclisiran) can lower Lp(a) by "approximately 20–30%," though "they are not approved for this indication." In FOURIER, evolocumab reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by "25%" in those with baseline Lp(a) above the median "(120 nmol/L; HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.64–0.88])" versus "11%" when at or below the median "(HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.79–1.01]; p-interaction = 0.096)." In ODYSSEY Outcomes, "each 1-mg/dL reduction in Lp(a) on alirocumab was associated with HR of MACE of 0.994 (95% CI 0.990–0.999; p = 0.0081)." For high-risk patients needing additional LDL-C lowering with elevated Lp(a), "a PCSK9 inhibitor may be a good choice to address residual risk from both LDL-C and Lp(a)."

### Reduction in lipoprotein (a) with PCSK9 monoclonal antibody evolocumab (AMG 145): a pooled analysis of more than 1, 300 patients in 4 phase II trials [^19a99e6f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was assess the effect of evolocumab (AMG 145) on lipoprotein (Lp)(a) from a pooled analysis of 4 phase II trials.

Background

Lp(a), a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle linked to the plasminogen-like glycoprotein apolipoprotein(a), shows a consistent and independent positive association with cardiovascular disease risk in epidemiological studies. Current therapeutic options to reduce Lp(a) are limited.

Methods

A pooled analysis of data from 1,359 patients in 4 phase II trials assessed the effects of evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, on Lp(a), the relationship between Lp(a) and lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B, and the influence of background statin therapy. Lp(a) was measured using a standardized isoform-independent method.

Results

Evolocumab treatment for 12 weeks resulted in significant (p < 0.001) mean (95% confidence interval) dose-related reductions in Lp(a) compared to control: 29.5% (23.3% to 35.7%) and 24.5% (20.4% to 28.7%) with 140 mg and 420 mg, dosed every 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, with no plateau of effect. Lp(a) reductions were significantly correlated with percentages of reductions in LDL-C (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.5134; p < 0.001) and apolipoprotein B (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.5203; p < 0. 001). Mean percentage reductions did not differ based on age or sex but the trend was greater in those patients taking statins.

Conclusions

Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab resulted in significant dose-related reductions in Lp(a). While the mean percentage of reduction was significantly greater in those patients with baseline Lp(a) of ≤ 125 nmol/l, the absolute reduction was substantially larger in those with levels > 125 nmol/l.

### Statins and the prevention of heart disease… [^9639108d]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Statin medications are a class of lipid-lowering medications that inhibit a step used by the liver to synthesize cholesterol. Statins reduce the health risks related to atherosclerosis by lowering cholesterol. Atherosclerosis is a cardiovascular disease where fatty cholesterol-laden plaques deposit within the arterial walls of the vascular system affecting the blood flow to vital organs. Statins have proven to be the most effective class of medication for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Can Statins Prevent Heart Disease. As one of the best-studied medications in randomized clinical trials, statins are proven to extend life and reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes, even among individuals with normal cholesterol levels. Statins are recommended for individuals with known ASCVD. In addition, statins are also recommended for men and women without known heart disease or prior strokes who are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.

A heart-healthy diet and exercise are recommended for everyone. Yet, even for individuals who have a healthy lifestyle or who make lifestyle improvements, statins can improve cardiovascular health and prevent heart disease for those at higher risk. What Are the Potential Adverse Effects and Risks. Statins are generally safe and well tolerated. The most common reported symptom is of muscle aches or cramps that may occur in 5% of people. Patients can frequently be switched to a different statin or a lower dose that is better tolerated. A small number of individuals may develop diabetes while on statins. The benefits from lowering the risk of death, heart attack, and stroke are likely to outweigh the development of diabetes in those individuals. Serious adverse effects with statins are rare. Women who are pregnant should not take statins because they may be toxic to a developing fetus.

The calculator will integrate your risk factors, age, sex, ethnicity, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels to determine the future risk of a cardiovascular event. If you have a 7. 5% risk over the next 10 years, a statin is recommended. If your calculated risk is 5. 0% to
7. 4% over the next 10 years, statin therapy should be considered. Prior to starting statin therapy, you should have a discussion with your physician regarding expected benefits, potential risks, management of other risk factors, monitoring plans, and your preferences.
