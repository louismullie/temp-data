## Question

Can magnesium supplements interact with medications commonly used to treat myasthenia gravis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether magnesium supplements interact with medications commonly used to treat myasthenia gravis, and if so, how and why that matters clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology of myasthenia gravis and its standard therapies. Then, I should verify the neuromuscular effects of magnesium and whether route of administration matters. Next, I will check authoritative sources for direct drug–drug interactions between magnesium and MG medications. After that, I need to examine indirect or physiologic interactions that could worsen MG. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified guidance and a bottom-line answer with caveats for oral versus IV magnesium and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and standard treatments so I don't jump to conclusions. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission with antibody-mediated blockade of acetylcholine receptors; symptomatic therapy is typically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, and immunosuppression with corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents is used when needed, with azathioprine commonly first-line among nonsteroidal immunosuppressants [^115tWNob] [^116DCiuU] [^112Fht4Q].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacology of magnesium at the neuromuscular junction because that will drive any interaction risk. Magnesium competitively inhibits presynaptic calcium-dependent acetylcholine release and reduces postsynaptic depolarization, producing dose-dependent skeletal muscle weakness and potentiating neuromuscular blockade, particularly in the presence of nondepolarizing agents or underlying neuromuscular disease; clinically, this can precipitate or worsen MG symptoms and even provoke myasthenic crisis [^111na4xT] [^113TTPaj].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the route of magnesium administration changes the risk profile. The FDA labeling for magnesium sulfate in dextrose injection explicitly contraindicates use in patients with known myasthenia gravis due to risk of precipitating myasthenic crisis; case reports document acute respiratory failure after IV magnesium in MG, and large trials of magnesium sulfate for eclampsia excluded MG patients, underscoring recognized risk even outside anesthesia contexts [^113TTPaj] [^1129d6To] [^117QrnnP].

> Wait, let me verify whether oral magnesium behaves the same way. I initially thought oral magnesium might be contraindicated too, but I should double-check that assumption. The FDA contraindication pertains to parenteral magnesium sulfate, not oral supplements; mechanistically, oral magnesium is absorbed more slowly and generally achieves lower systemic concentrations than IV dosing, so the acute neuromuscular blockade risk is substantially lower with oral forms, though caution remains prudent in MG, especially at higher oral doses or in renal impairment where accumulation can occur [^113TTPaj] [^113MUhRW].

> Next, I should review direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions between magnesium and MG medications. I need to ensure I'm not missing a labeled interaction. Scanning DrugBank and the FDA labels for pyridostigmine, neostigmine, prednisone, azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and IVIG, I do not find documented direct interactions between magnesium and these MG therapies; the main concern is physiologic antagonism at the neuromuscular junction rather than a formal pharmacokinetic interaction [^111na4xT].

> But wait, what if there are indirect interactions that could still matter clinically. Let me consider a couple of plausible scenarios. Prednisone can decrease magnesium excretion, which could theoretically raise serum magnesium and enhance neuromuscular blockade, particularly if renal function is reduced; conversely, long-term PPI therapy, which is common in MG patients for GI protection with steroids, can cause hypomagnesemia, prompting magnesium replacement that, if excessive or given intravenously, could worsen MG; additionally, magnesium potentiates nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, so perioperative or ICU patients with MG who receive both magnesium and NMBAs are at heightened risk of prolonged paralysis and respiratory compromise [^112QGE3X] [^116doeqR] [^111MKvRR] [^111MKvRR].

> I should confirm the clinical evidence base for harm signals. Multiple case reports describe MG exacerbation or myasthenic crisis temporally linked to IV magnesium, and anesthesia literature demonstrates that magnesium reduces rocuronium requirements and can re-establish clinically relevant paralysis after apparent recovery, reinforcing the mechanistic concern even at modest serum levels in susceptible patients [^1129d6To] [^111GXNkX] [^111MKvRR] [^116GpJeU].

> Let me synthesize the interaction profile carefully. There is no strong evidence for direct pharmacokinetic interactions between magnesium and standard MG medications, but there is a clinically important pharmacodynamic antagonism whereby magnesium impairs neuromuscular transmission and can precipitate weakness, dysphagia, respiratory failure, or crisis in MG. This risk is greatest with IV magnesium and is sufficient to warrant a contraindication in MG on parenteral formulations, whereas oral magnesium is not absolutely contraindicated but should be used cautiously with attention to dose, renal function, and symptom monitoring [^113TTPaj] [^111na4xT].

> I need to ensure the practical guidance is clear and actionable. For patients with MG, avoid IV magnesium sulfate whenever possible; if magnesium must be given parenterally for compelling indications, use the lowest effective dose with continuous monitoring for respiratory compromise and be prepared to manage crisis. For oral magnesium, keep doses modest, avoid in those with eGFR below 30 mL/min or use reduced dosing with monitoring, and coordinate with the neuromuscular clinician if MG symptoms fluctuate; in perioperative or ICU settings, anticipate potentiation of nondepolarizing NMBAs and adjust dosing with quantitative neuromuscular monitoring to mitigate prolonged blockade and airway risk [^113MUhRW] [^1129nQW6] [^1124eMLn] [^111MKvRR].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the conclusion aligns with the evidence. Yes, magnesium can interact with MG treatment, but the interaction is primarily pharmacodynamic and route-dependent: IV magnesium is contraindicated in MG due to risk of myasthenic crisis, whereas oral magnesium lacks a formal contraindication yet still carries potential to worsen weakness, especially at higher doses or with renal impairment. There are no well-documented direct drug–drug interactions with pyridostigmine, prednisone, azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or IVIG, but indirect effects and perioperative potentiation of NMBAs merit vigilance [^113TTPaj] [^1124eMLn].

Magnesium supplements can **worsen MG symptoms** by impairing neuromuscular transmission and may trigger myasthenic crisis, especially at high doses or with renal impairment [^113TTPaj] [^113MUhRW]. Magnesium **reduces the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors** (pyridostigmine, neostigmine) and can cause dangerous respiratory compromise. Oral magnesium is not absolutely contraindicated, but should be used with extreme caution and close monitoring; **IV magnesium is contraindicated in MG** [^113TTPaj]. Avoid magnesium-containing antacids/laxatives and coordinate all supplements with the treating neurologist.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of interaction

Magnesium **impairs neuromuscular transmission** via several mechanisms:

- **Presynaptic inhibition**: Magnesium inhibits calcium-dependent acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, reducing available acetylcholine [^111na4xT].

- **Postsynaptic effects**: Magnesium decreases the sensitivity of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors to acetylcholine, further impairing transmission [^111MKvRR].

- **Additive effects with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors**: Magnesium's neuromuscular blockade can counteract the therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine and neostigmine, reducing their efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of interactions

Several clinical reports and studies document **significant interactions** between magnesium and MG medications:

- **Case reports**: Intravenous magnesium sulfate has precipitated myasthenic crisis, including acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, in patients with MG [^1129d6To] [^111GXNkX].

- **FDA warnings**: Magnesium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with MG due to the risk of exacerbating muscle weakness and precipitating myasthenic crisis [^113TTPaj].

- **Clinical guidelines**: Magnesium sulfate is specifically contraindicated in MG patients, particularly in pregnant women with MG, due to the risk of severe neuromuscular complications [^11251wFB] [^113WEytN].

---

## Specific myasthenia gravis medications affected

Magnesium supplements **interact primarily with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors**, the cornerstone of symptomatic MG therapy:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of interaction** | **Clinical consequence** |
|-|-|-|
| Pyridostigmine | Magnesium impairs neuromuscular transmission, counteracting acetylcholinesterase inhibition | Reduced efficacy, worsening MG symptoms, potential myasthenic crisis |
| Neostigmine | Similar mechanism as pyridostigmine | Reduced efficacy, worsening MG symptoms, potential myasthenic crisis |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given these interactions, **clinicians should**:

- **Avoid magnesium-containing medications**: Magnesium sulfate is contraindicated in MG patients, particularly intravenous formulations [^113TTPaj].

- **Monitor closely**: If magnesium supplementation is necessary (e.g. for hypomagnesemia), monitor neuromuscular function closely and adjust acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy as needed.

- **Educate patients**: Patients with MG should be informed about the risks associated with magnesium supplements and advised to avoid over-the-counter magnesium-containing antacids and laxatives.

---

## Summary of evidence

Magnesium supplements can **significantly impair neuromuscular transmission** in MG patients, reducing the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and potentially precipitating myasthenic crisis. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is contraindicated, and oral magnesium supplements should be used with extreme caution and close monitoring.

### Total drug treatment and comorbidity in myasthenia gravis: a population-based cohort study [^116BMvZw]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and purpose

Comorbidity in myasthenia gravis (MG) is important for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Disease complexity was assessed by examining total drug treatment, immune therapy and comorbidity in a complete national MG cohort.

Methods

All recipients of the MG-specific drug pyridostigmine 2004–2010 registered in the compulsory Norwegian Prescription Database who met the inclusion criteria were included. The pyridostigmine group was compared with the general Norwegian population.

Results

Myasthenia gravis patients received co-medication more often than the controls for nearly all groups of medication, including insulins (95% confidence interval 2.0–3.7), thyroid therapy (1.7–2.5), antidepressants (1.3–1.7), anti-infectives (1.2–1.4), lipid-modifying agents (1.1–1.4) and immunomodulating agents (6.8–8.8).

Conclusions

Myasthenia gravis patients are more often treated with non-MG prescription drugs than controls, reflecting frequent co-medication and comorbidity.

### Intravenous magnesium re-establishes neuromuscular block after spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose of rocuronium: a randomised controlled trial [^116GpJeU]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Intravenous magnesium deepens non-depolarising neuromuscular block.

Objective

To assess whether intravenous magnesium has the potential to re-establish paralysis in patients who have just recovered from a non-depolarising neuromuscular block.

Design

Prospective randomised double-blind controlled study.

Patients

Twenty non-obese patients ranging in age from 18 to 80 years were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were a history of liver, kidney or neuromuscular disease and intake of medications interacting with neuromuscular blocking agents.

Intervention

After spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose of rocuronium had been achieved (train-of-four ratio ≥ 0.9), patients were given either a bolus dose of magnesium 50 mg kg(-1) intravenously or an equivalent volume of isotonic saline over 5 min.

Main Outcome Measures

The train-of-four ratio was measured every minute until the end of surgery. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in train-of-four ratio following administration of magnesium or saline.

Results

Following infusion of the study solution, the train-of-four ratio decreased in all patients in the magnesium group in contrast to none in the saline group (P < 0.001). On average, magnesium-induced train-of-four ratio depression reached a nadir of 0.49 after 10 min and lasted for 45 min.

Conclusion

A bolus dose of intravenous magnesium 50 mg kg(-1) re-establishes a clinically relevant degree of muscle paralysis in patients who have just recovered from a non-depolarising neuromuscular block.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

Most women with MG of childbearing age require immunosuppressive drugs. There is an increased risk of MG worsening during pregnancy. Thymectomy should be performed before pregnancy as it reduces the risk of neonatal MG. An important question is whether MG drugs have teratogenic effects on the unborn child and during lactation. Recommendations are based mainly on registry studies, long‐term observation studies, and experience from treating other and more common diseases.

Pyridostigmine is safe during conception and pregnancy. Emesis and changes in absorption during pregnancy may necessitate dose adjustment. Corticosteroids in low doses and azathioprine are regarded as safe and can be continued during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Daily doses should be as low as possible, and prednisone/prednisolone below 20 mg is recommended. Rituximab should, if possible, be discontinued 3 months before pregnancy, or alternatively from conception. Mycophenolate, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide should not be used in women of childbearing age. Tacrolimus and cyclosporin are regarded as having very low or no increased risk but should be used in the lowest effective dose. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are recommended as rescue therapy during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Complement inhibitors and FcRn blockers have limited data to support safety in pregnancy and are not recommended. The FcRn blockers inhibit IgG transport from mother to child and may become a treatment alternative during the first two trimesters to avoid fetal AChR inactivation syndrome and arthrogryposis in the child.

Women with MG should give birth in hospitals with a neonatal intensive care unit. Vaginal delivery is recommended, and caesarean section should be advised for obstetric indications only. Epidural analgesia is preferred. The use of magnesium should be avoided as treatment for pre‐eclampsia and eclampsia.

Immunosuppressive drugs should be restarted postpartum if stopped before pregnancy because of increased MG exacerbation risk in this period. Breastfeeding is recommended, but not for mycophenolate, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide users. Monoclonal antibody transfer is low in breast milk and peaks within 48 h. Rituximab is recommended from 2 weeks after birth, with breastfeeding from 6 h after infusion.

COVID and vaccination

The risk of severe COVID‐19 infection is increased in MG. This risk increases with age and decreases with vaccination. COVID‐19 and influenza vaccinations are recommended in MG, and patients with a reduced immune response due to high‐dose immunosuppressive treatment should have repeated vaccinations. They obtain a humoral immune response, but this is somewhat delayed. MG patients are good candidates for antiviral treatments to protect from MG exacerbations.

The number and severity of side effects of GCS increase with the duration and cumulative dosage. Especially patients with other comorbidities, e.g. diabetes mellitus, are at special risk. In case of an estimated therapy duration of longer than 3 months using a dosage of > 7.5 mg prednisolone equivalent, patients should be treated with calcium (1000–1500 mg/d) and vitamin D (400–800 IE/d) to prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D levels should be determined prior to initiation of such therapy and controlled throughout. In post-menopausal women bisphosphonates can be used to prevent GCS-induced osteoporosis. The evidence for the prophylactic effect of bisphosphonates against GCS-induced osteoporosis and bone fractures in men is currently not sufficient for a general recommendation. Moreover, stomach protection using proton-pump inhibitors or other drugs may be warranted.

To reduce side-effects some centers switch from every to alternate day oral GCS treatment during long-term application in the low dose range, the usefulness of which needs to be validated in individual patients as long as systematic data are lacking.

Azathioprine

Azathioprine (AZA) is the most frequently used immunosuppressive agent for treatment of MG. Azathioprine is a purine analogue that is metabolized rapidly to the cytotoxic and immunosuppressant derivatives 6-mercaptopurine and thioinosinic acid. The latter inhibits purine synthesis, and thus impairs activation and proliferation and causes apoptosis of T cells and B cells due to their lack of metabolic pathways for nucleotide salvage ('recycling'). Treatment is initiated using 2–3 mg/day/kg bodyweight and maybe reduced during the treatment course in case of a clinically stable remission to about 2.5 mg/day/kg bodyweight and further to 1 mg/day/kg bodyweight. Treatment effects cannot be expected before several months. However, a steroid-sparing effect of AZA during long-term treatment has been proven. The combination of AZA and prednisolone is more effective, as longer states of remission and less side effects are encountered as compared to respective monotherapies. In 10–20% of patients the combination of AZA and GCS does not lead to sufficient clinical stabilization or remission requiring GCS at dosages of more than 7.5 mg/day prednisolone equivalent and in the long term requiring other immunosuppressive treatment strategies (therapy resistance). The abrupt cessation of AZA may trigger re-occurence of myasthenic symptoms up to a myasthenic crisis even in patients in complete and stable clinical remission.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^116aCw3M]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication interactions — Proton pump inhibitors used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease have the potential to interfere with vitamin B-12 absorption from food and certain diuretics, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors affect magnesium status, while cholestyramine can increase the likelihood of drug–nutrient interactions. Micronutrient supplements can influence medication dosage and bioactivity; for example, high doses of vitamin E supplements (likely in doses > 400 IU) can inhibit platelet aggregation and interfere with anticoagulant blood thinning medications such as coumadin, and vitamin K supplementation can also interact with blood-thinning medications such that supplementation should be avoided or used with caution and under the care of a health care provider because a consistent intake of the vitamin is critical.

### Magnesium sulfate reduces the rocuronium dose needed for satisfactory double lumen tube placement conditions in patients with myasthenia gravis [^113sPrHX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anaesthesia was induced with 4 μg.kg − 1 fentanyl and propofol with target controlled infusion (TCI) using Marsh model (Fresenius Kabi AG, Germany). Propofol TCI was commenced at an effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2 μg.ml − 1 and titrated to achieve unconsciousness with BIS at 40–60. The patient was ventilated with face mask to maintain the end tidal carbon dioxide between 30 and 45 mmHg. After the depth of anaesthesia was stable with BIS kept between 40 and 60 for 10 min and a stable Ce of propofol, the electrical stimulation of neuromuscular monitor was applied at the ulnar nerve for the contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle using TOF at amplitude 50 mA with time interval at 20 s (ISx Power Link™ by Philips Medical Systems). After the baseline TOF ratio was obtained, the study drug (magnesium sulfate or normal saline) was given over 5 min. Another TOF ratio was obtained after study drug infusion was completed. If the TOF ratio was above 10%, a repeated dose of 0.05 mg.kg − 1 rocuronium was given every 3 min until the TOF ratio was less than 10%. The patient was intubated with DLT using video laryngoscopy when TOF ratio was less than 10%. The intubation was performed by an experienced anaesthetist. If the tracheal intubation was not accomplished within 20 s, it was recorded as a failed attempt. Mean blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded 1 minute before intubation (Pre-intubation), and 3 minutes after intubation (Post-intubation).

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to initiate corticosteroids at low dose, 10–25 mg on alternate days increasing the dose gradually (10 mg per dose) to 60–80 mg on alternate days. Initiate corticosteroids on a high dose every day if the patient is critically ill, and administer additional short-time treatments to overcome the temporary worsening.

### Ephedrine for myasthenia gravis, neonatal myasthenia and the congenital myasthenic syndromes [^116VhVjH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia is a condition in which neuromuscular transmission is affected by antibodies against neuromuscular junction components (autoimmune myasthenia gravis, MG; and neonatal myasthenia gravis, NMG) or by defects in genes for neuromuscular junction proteins (congenital myasthenic syndromes, CMSs). Clinically, some individuals seem to benefit from treatment with ephedrine, but its effects and adverse effects have not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the effects and adverse effects of ephedrine in people with autoimmune MG, transient neonatal MG, and the congenital myasthenic syndromes.

Search Methods

On 17 November 2014, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We also searched reference lists of articles, conference proceedings of relevant conferences, and prospective trial registers. In addition, we contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing ephedrine as a single or add-on treatment with any other active treatment, placebo, or no treatment in adults or children with autoimmune MG, NMG, or CMSs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study design and quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from included articles, and contacted authors.

Main Results

We found no RCTs or quasi-RCTs, and therefore could not establish the effect of ephedrine on MG, NMG and CMSs. We describe the results of 53 non-randomised studies narratively in the Discussion section, including observations of endurance, muscle strength and quality of life. Effects may differ depending on the type of myasthenia. Thirty-seven studies were in participants with CMS, five in participants with MG, and in 11 the precise form of myasthenia was unknown. We found no studies for NMG. Reported adverse effects included tachycardia, sleep disturbances, nervousness, and withdrawal symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence available from RCTs or quasi-RCTs, but some observations from non-randomised studies are available. There is a need for more evidence from suitable forms of prospective RCTs, such as series of n-of-one RCTs, that use appropriate and validated outcome measures.

### Telithromycin (Ketek) [^111JG6r3]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Patients should also be advised:

Ketek is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis.

(See CONTRAINDICATIONS)
of the possibility of liver injury, associated with KETEK, which in rare cases may be severe. Patients developing signs or symptoms of liver injury should be instructed to discontinue KETEK and seek medical attention immediately. Symptoms of liver injury may include nausea, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, pruritus, or tender abdomen. Ketek must not be taken by patients with a previous history of hepatitis/jaundice associated with the use of KETEK or macrolide antibiotics.

(See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS)
antibacterial drugs including KETEK should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When KETEK is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by KETEK or other antibacterial drugs in the future.
KETEK has the potential to produce changes in the electrocardiogram (QTc interval prolongation) and that they should report any fainting occurring during drug treatment.
KETEK should be avoided in patients receiving Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., dofetilide) antiarrhythmic agents.
to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QTc prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia, or clinically significant bradycardia.
diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.
simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin should be avoided in patients receiving KETEK. If KETEK is prescribed, therapy with simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin should be stopped during the course of treatment. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions)
colchicine should be avoided in patients receiving KETEK. If KETEK is prescribed in patients with normal kidney and liver function, the dose is colchicine should be reduced. Concomitant treatment with KETEK and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with kidney or liver impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS, Drug interactions .)
KETEK tablets can be taken with or without food.
to inform their physician of any other medications taken concurrently with KETEK, including over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements.

### Magnesium sulfate reduces the rocuronium dose needed for satisfactory double lumen tube placement conditions in patients with myasthenia gravis [^111MKvRR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients with myasthenia gravis are extremely sensitive to nondepolarizing NMBs. A very small dose of NMB and residual neuromuscular blockade effect may result in respiratory distress or loss of airway protection during emergence from anaesthesia. As a result, some anaesthetists prefer to avoid NMB, whereas intubation without NMBs was reported to increase the risk of difficult tracheal intubation and intubation-related complications.

Sugammadex could help to solve the problem of inadequate muscle relaxation and residual neuromuscular blockade. While sugammadex is not widely used for MG patients for many reasons. In mainland China, less than 10% of the hospital have stocked sugammadex because it is expensive and not included in the basic Medicare reimbursement drug inventory. Therefore, using a minimal dose of intermediate-acting NMB is still quite a common choice of tracheal intubation for patients with MG. In this study, we have revealed that the pre-administration of magnesium sulfate at 60 mg.kg − 1 is associated with a significant decrease in rocuronium requirement with improving tracheal intubation condition for DLT placement.

Magnesium possesses an inhibitory effect on neuromuscular transmission and caused a decrease in muscle fibre membrane excitability. It decreases pre-junctional release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve terminal by decreasing the calcium conductance of presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channels, and it also reduced the sensitivity of the endplate to acetylcholine. Magnesium shows significant neuromuscular blockade at high plasma concentrations (5 to 10 mM), and also at lower concentrations (≥ 1 mM) in the presence of neuromuscular-blocking agents. Several studies had shown that magnesium sulfate could decrease the amount of rocuronium required to maintain adequate neuromuscular blockade during different types of surgery. In our study, magnesium sulfate pretreatment has led to a reduction of TOF ratio from 96 to 77%, and this has resulted in a significant decrease of the rocuronium dose needed to achieve the target TOF ratio.

### Ravulizumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis [^116Ksjxn]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

PLEX/PP and IVIg have been shown to reduce serum ravulizumab concentrations and a supplemental dose of ravulizumab is required to compensate for these interventions. Although data in the current study are limited, there was no accumulation of ravulizumab with the use of the supplemental dose indicated in the prescribing information, and ravulizumab concentrations were maintained above the therapeutic threshold for the duration of the dosing interval. Although no interaction with commonly administered MG medications was anticipated, it was notable that despite a high proportion of patients receiving concomitant medications for MG, there were no unexpected findings with respect to either serum ravulizumab or serum free C5 concentrations and all patients achieved serum free C5 concentrations below the target threshold. As ravulizumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and, therefore, a relatively large molecule, there is a low likelihood of drug–drug interaction via mechanisms such as CYP450, or P-glycoprotein or other transporters.

These pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings — rapid achievement of therapeutic ravulizumab concentrations and rapid inhibition of serum free C5 concentrations that were sustained through the 26-week treatment period — support the clinical results of the CHAMPION MG study, which showed the treatment effect of ravulizumab appeared within the first week following infusion and was sustained throughout 26 weeks. Clinical improvements were observed in measures of activities of daily living (MG-ADL) and disease severity (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score), and ravulizumab was well tolerated with a side-effect profile generally comparable with that of placebo. There were no cases of meningococcal infection during the RCP of CHAMPION MG. One case of meningitis has been reported during the ongoing open-label extension; however, the causative organism was not identified as Neisseria meningitidis. The risk of meningococcal infection that arises from ravulizumab's mechanism of action is mitigated by the requirement for patients to be vaccinated against meningococcal infections at least 2 weeks before initiating ravulizumab treatment.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus given the risk of elevated blood glucose.

5.4	Co-administration with Unapproved Tocolytics

Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with unapproved tocolytics (e.g., beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline, or with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine). Serious adverse events including pulmonary edema and hypotension have occurred [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5	Aluminum Toxicity

Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains less than 25 mcg/L of aluminum). Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment.

Patients with renal impairment who receive parenteral concentrations of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at concentrations associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

5.6	Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis.

Use of magnesium sulfate in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by neuromuscular respiratory failure. Symptoms of myasthenic crisis may include difficulty swallowing, ptosis, facial droop, weakness and/or difficulty breathing that may require intubation.

If myasthenic crisis is suspected, discontinue use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately. Secure the patient's airway. Consider intensive care unit admission and elective intubation, if respiratory failure is anticipated. Once the airway is secure, confirm the diagnosis. Therapies include plasmapheresis and plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunomodulating therapy in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids.

### Magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps [^117LJtZw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs.

Main Results

We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed. We found no RCTs evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease-state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease) other than a single small (inconclusive) study in people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered cramps.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113BnMrG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is regarded an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission as (a) auto-antibody depositions are detectable at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); (b) autoantibodies from MG patients cause MG symptoms when passively transferred into rodents; (c) active immunization of animals with auto-antigens reproduces the disease; and (d) antibody-depleting therapies decrease the severity of MG symptoms.

The incidence of MG ranges from 0.25 to 2.0 per 1,000,000. Due to effective treatment strategies and normal life expectancy, the prevalence of MG has risen in recent years to about 72:1,000,000 (range 15–179). About 10% of patients are children and adolescents. There is an increased familial risk for MG. Siblings or first-grade relatives of affected patients have a risk of 4.5% for developing MG reflecting a profound genetic disposition for the disorder.

The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. A pragmatic clinical classification distinguishes pure ocular myasthenia from generalized myasthenia with mild, moderate and severe manifestation. Ocular myasthenia exclusively affects the outer ocular muscles including the M. levator palpebrae and presents with ptosis and double vision. Ptosis and double vision may be transient, fluctuating or progressive during the day. Only 10–20% of patients show muscle fatigability and weakness persistently restricted to the outer ocular muscles. The majority of patients proceed to generalized muscle fatigability and weakness within 24 months after the disease onset. Generalized myasthenia is defined as any clinical affection of muscle groups other than outer ocular muscles independent of its severity.

The fluctuating muscle fatigability and weakness is illustrated by a typical decremental response of the amplitude and/or area under the curve of the elicited muscle compound action potential of the fifth compared to the first stimulus upon repetitive supramaximal stimulation of the accessory or facial nerve with a frequency of 3 Hz before and after isometric tetanic contraction. The lack of an incremental response of amplitudes and areas under the curve of the compound muscle action potential upon supramaximal repetitive nerve stimulation using a frequency of 30 Hz or upon pre- and post-tetanic single stimulation proofs the post-synaptic nature of the neuromuscular transmission defect. Single fiber electromyography typically shows increased jitter and intermittent conduction blocks reflecting instable neuromuscular transmission.

### Frequency and severity of myasthenia gravis exacerbations associated with the use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and azithromycin [^113cxinR]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) exacerbation, defined as worsening MG symptoms, can occur in up to 30% of MG patients within the first 6 years of symptom onset. Myasthenic crisis requiring intubation or noninvasive ventilation to avoid intubation is the most severe form of MG exacerbation. MG exacerbation or crisis can be triggered by a number of etiologies including infection, surgery, medication, tapering of immunotherapy, pregnancy, and stress and can also occur in the absence of any identifiable triggers.

A number of medications can alter the function of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) through different mechanisms, resulting in MG exacerbation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, interferons, and penicillamine may lead to autoimmune reactions at the NMJ, resulting in the development of de novo MG or exacerbation of pre‐existing MG. The second general mechanism for medication‐induced MG exacerbation is impaired signal transmission at the NMJ via blockade of action potential propagation, inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release, or degradation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on the postsynaptic membrane. Medications belonging to this category include beta‐adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, magnesium, neuromuscular blockers, anesthetics, lithium, corticosteroid, and various antibiotics.

Fluoroquinolones and macrolides are the two major classes of antibiotics that have been traditionally linked to MG exacerbation. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black‐box warning on the risk of MG exacerbation with the use of fluoroquinolones. Two international MG practice guidelines advised that fluoroquinolones and macrolides be avoided or used with caution in MG patients. The potential risk of MG exacerbation by these commonly used antibiotics is well recognized among patients and caregivers. However, the presumed antibiotic‐induced MG exacerbation is not supported by data from randomized clinical trials or prospective studies, but is based on retrospective analyses or case series with conflicting observations. The true incidence of fluoroquinolone or macrolide induced MG exacerbation and its severity currently remain unknown.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between the use of two fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and one macrolide (azithromycin) and the occurrence of MG exacerbation, and to identify predictors of antibiotic‐associated MG exacerbation (AAMGE) in a large group of myasthenic patients.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^115eysuz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present study must be praised for bringing potential interactions between individual nutrients into the focus of interest. Because the intake of Mg is often inadequate and several other factors are also known to impair Mg supply (for example, diuretics use, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcohol consumption, stress factors), more attention should in future be paid to possible consequences of insufficient or deficient Mg supply in the general population. Further studies on the interactions between Mg supply and vitamin D status should include a more detailed assessment of individual Mg status (for example, by measuring biochemical parameters of Mg status or by adjusting statistical analysis for stress factors, diuretics use, alcohol consumption and concomitant diagnoses such as diabetes); a more detailed investigation of different components of the vitamin D-parathyroid hormone axis in general populations; clarification of the dose?response relationship; and the realization of randomized controlled trials to verify whether oral Mg is indeed able to improve vitamin D status and survival.

### Magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps [^111aYeRn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often presented to physicians in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or disorders of the motor neuron (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this indication has never been evaluated by systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 October 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2011), LILACS (January 1982 to September 2011), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to September 2011), AMED (January 1985 to October 2011) and SPORTDiscus (January 1975 to September 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors and obtained patient level data for three of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. All data on adverse effects were collected from the included RCTs.

Main Results

We identified seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (N = 322 including cross-over controls). Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial. For idiopathic cramps (largely older adults presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps), differences in measures of cramp frequency, magnesium versus placebo, were small, not statistically significant, and without heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (-3.93%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.12% to 13.26%, moderate quality evidence) and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (0.01 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.55, moderate quality evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group (95% CI -28% to 12%, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence). Meta-analysis was not possible for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo. While we could not determine the number of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).

Management when MG/LEMS patients have already contracted COVID‑19 — continue usual care in mild disease; adjust for severe illness. Most patients have mild disease and should continue the current best practice standard of care for MG/LEMS. Corticosteroid doses might need to be increased per standard infection/stress protocols. If symptoms are severe with hospitalization, it may be necessary to consider pausing current immunosuppression temporarily, especially with concurrent infections or sepsis, and immune depleting agents should not be given under such conditions.

Symptomatic and IS treatment of MG.

1. Pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. Pyridostigmine dose should be adjusted as needed based on symptoms. The ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can be an indicator that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or IS therapy should be used in all patients with MG who have not met treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine.
2. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used alone when corticosteroids are contraindicated or refused. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used initially in conjunction with corticosteroids when the risk of steroid side effects is high based on medical comorbidities. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be added to corticosteroids when: a. Steroid side effects, deemed significant by the patient or the treating physician, develop; b. Response to an adequate trial (table e-1) of corticosteroids is inadequate; or c. The corticosteroid dose cannot be reduced due to symptom relapse.
3. Nonsteroidal IS agents that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. The following factors should be considered in selecting among these agents: a. There is widespread variation in practice with respect to choice of IS agent since there is little literature comparing them. b. Expert consensus and some RCT evidence support the use of azathioprine as a first-line IS agent in MG. c. Evidence from RCTs supports the use of cyclosporine in MG, but potential serious adverse effects and drug interactions limit its use. d. Although available RCT evidence does not support the use of mycophenolate and tacrolimus in MG, both are widely used, and one or both are recommended in several national MG treatment guidelines.
4. Patients with refractory MG should be referred to a physician or a center with expertise in management of MG. In addition to the previously mentioned IS agents, the following therapies may also be used in refractory MG: a. Chronic IVIg and chronic PLEX (see IVIg and PLEX, no. 6); b. Cyclophosphamide; c. Rituximab, for which evidence of efficacy is building, but for which formal consensus could not be reached.
5. IS agent dosage and duration of treatment a. Once patients achieve treatment goals, the corticosteroid dose should be gradually tapered. In many patients, continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help to maintain the treatment goal. b. For nonsteroidal IS agents, once treatment goals have been achieved and maintained for 6 months to 2 years, the IS dose should be tapered slowly to the minimal effective amount. Dosage adjustments should be made no more frequently than every 3–6 months (table e-1). c. Tapering of IS drugs is associated with risk of relapse, which may necessitate upward adjustments in dose. The risk of relapse is higher in patients who are symptomatic, or after rapid taper. d. It is usually necessary to maintain some immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life.
6. Patients must be monitored for potential adverse effects and complications from IS drugs. Changing to an alternative IS agent should be considered if adverse effects and complications are medically significant or create undue hardship for the patient.

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^114mCGy4]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate inducing acute respiratory failure in a patient with myasthenia gravis [^1129d6To]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 90s with a background of myasthenia gravis and atrial fibrillation presented to hospital following a fall. While in the emergency department it was noted that she was in atrial fibrillation with a fast-ventricular response and as part of her management was given intravenous magnesium. Following this she developed acute respiratory failure and required intubation and ventilation. The patient recovered quickly and was extubated in the intensive care unit the next day. On subsequent days, the patient received two further doses of intravenous magnesium before the link was identified. On both of these occasions she again developed respiratory failure which were managed with non-invasive ventilation. This case highlights the importance of all members of the team being aware of the drugs that can induce a myasthenic crisis. It also stimulates further research into the development of a guide of how to safely treat symptomatic hypomagnesaemia in patients with myasthenia gravis.

Glucocorticosteroids

In retrospective studies, glucocorticosteroids (GCS) like prednisone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone have shown to improve clinical symptoms within several weeks to months (normally within 4–8 weeks) in about 70–80% of patients. Due to side effects, long-term oral GCS are usually combined with steroid-sparing immunsuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporin A, methotrexate, mycophenolat mofetil or tacrolimus. During the first days after initiation of GCS therapy a transient deterioration of myasthenic symptoms may occur especially in patients with a pronounced affection of bulbar muscle groups.

Three different dosing regimens are currently used in clinical practice:
Initial dosage of 10–20 mg/day prednisone equivalent and dosage increase of 5 mg/day per week until a stable remission is reached (at about 1 mg/day/kg bodyweight). Advantage: prevention of a transient deterioration of myasthenic symptoms during the first days of treatment, disadvantage: slow clinical improvement.
Start with a dosage of 1–1.5 mg/day/kg bodyweight prednisone equivalent in combination with a steroid-sparing immunosuppressant until induction of stable clinical remission and subsequent dosage reduction of 5 mg/day every 4 weeks with the aim of total cessation of GCS therapy. Advantage: rapid clinical improvement. Disadvantage: Transient deterioration of myasthenic symptoms during the first days of treatment in about 10% of patients.
Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse-therapy using 500–2000 mg/day for 3–5 consecutive days followed by an oral taper. This treatment regimen may lead to a transient deterioration of myasthenic symptoms potentially inducing myasthenic crisis due to a direct membrane effect of GCS. Moreover, an acute steroid myopathy may — in some cases — contribute to the overall clinic deterioration in this situation. Hence, this treatment regimen is only used in manifest myasthenic crises and in combination with plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption or intravenous immunoglobuline therapy in an intermediate or intensive care setting.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate (MTX) has been used for several decades now as a treatment for MG. MTX competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with an affinity of about 1000-fold that of dihydrofolate. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active metabolite tetrahydrofolate involved in the de-novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins and thus reduces proliferation among others of lymphocytes. Most prominent side effects of MTX include hepatotoxicity, ulcerative stomatitis, leucopenia, anemia, infections, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, acute pneumonitis, and rarely pulmonary fibrosis and kidney failure.

Despite its long-term use in patients with MG, controlled clinical trials were lacking until recently. A recent clinical trial compared MTX (17.5 mg/week) in 24 patients with generalized MG with AZA (2.5 mg/day/kg bodyweight) regarding its steroid-sparing effect and showed an equivalent effect within a treatment period of 2 years. MTX at a dosage of 7.5–25 mg/week in combination with folic acid can thus be regarded as a second-line drug for the treatment of MG. Due to its less frequent interactions with other drugs, MTX may be preferred over CSA especially in older multimorbid patients.

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG.

### Drugs and myasthenia gravis… [^115aum2w]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is a disease of the neuromuscular junction in which normal transmission of the neuron-to-muscle impulse is impaired or prevented by acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Several classes of drugs have been associated with clinical worsening of existing myasthenia gravis, and a small subset of drugs, most notably the antirheumatic agent penicillamine, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variant of the disease. Recent case reports and other documented evidence link a number of specific agents with clinical worsening of myasthenia gravis. Arch Intern Med. 1997; 157: 399–408 Wittbrodt ET.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^11756drW]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to select immunosuppressive agent dosage and complete duration of treatment as follows:

- taper the corticosteroid dose gradually once patients achieve treatment goals; recognize that continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help to maintain the treatment goal in many patients

- taper the nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agent dose slowly to the minimal effective amount once treatment goals have been achieved and maintained for 6 months to 2 years; make dosage adjustments no more frequently than every 3–6 months

- recognize that tapering of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with risk of relapse, which may necessitate upward adjustments in dose; the risk of relapse is higher in symptomatic patients and after rapid taper

- recognize that it is usually necessary to maintain some immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life.

### Guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1175gLRm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). High credibility.

MG and LEMS during COVID-19 — treatment escalation or change decisions need to be individualized based on the relative severity of COVID-19 infection and MG/LEMS in consultation with local expert(s). We are continuing to monitor this quickly evolving situation and these recommendations may be modified as data becomes available. As decisions regarding immunotherapy use should be individualized and made by the person with MG and his/her healthcare provider, we encourage that patients contact their MG provider with questions and for further guidance.

### Implementation of a myasthenia gravis drug-disease interaction clinical decision support tool reduces prescribing of high-risk medications [^1143nvvL]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

High-risk medication exposure is a modifiable risk factor for myasthenic exacerbation and crisis. We evaluated whether real-time electronic clinical decision support (CDS) was effective in reducing the rate of prescribing potentially high-risk medications to avoid or use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.

Methods

An expert panel reviewed the available drug-disease pairings and associated severity levels to activate the alerts for CDS. All unique alerts activated in both inpatient and outpatient contexts were analyzed over a two-year period. Clinical context, alert severity, medication class, and alert action were collected. The primary outcome was alert override rate. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of unique medication exposures avoided and predictors of alert override.

Results

During the analysis period, 2817 unique alerts fired, representing 830 distinct patient-medication exposures for 577 unique patients. The overall alert override rate was 85% (80.3% for inpatient alerts and 95.8% for outpatient alerts). Of unique medication-patient exposures, 19% were avoided because of the alert. Assigned alert severity of "contraindicated" were less likely to be overridden (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–0.56), as well as alerts activated during evening staffing (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.87).

Discussion

Implementation of a myasthenia gravis drug-disease interaction alert reduced overall patient exposure to potentially harmful medications by approximately 19%. Future optimization includes enhanced provider and pharmacist education. Further refinement of alert logic criteria to optimize medication risk reduction and reduce alert fatigue is warranted to support clinicians in prescribing and reduce electronic health record time burden.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^111na4xT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Medications that Should Be Used with Caution

Most of the following agents are thought to pose theoretical risks to patients with botulism. (Substantive evidence exists for the risk associated with aminoglycosides.)

Antimicrobials

Concerns exist about the ability of clindamycin to block acetylcholine release, and its action might work together with that of aminoglycosides. Theoretical concerns exist regarding penicillins increasing toxin load through cell lysis and with tetracycline through chelation of calcium. However, avoiding the use of these agents in a patient with a comorbid infection must be weighed against the benefits of treating the comorbid condition. Patients with botulism who are being treated with antimicrobial agents should be observed for clinical deterioration that could be related to receiving the antibiotic.

Magnesium, Calcium, and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

Magnesium, a competitive inhibitor of presynaptic calcium-dependent acetylcholine release, produces dose-dependent skeletal muscle paralysis and prolongs paralysis from NMBAs and diseases such as myasthenia gravis. In a cattle study, calcium infusions were reported to increase paralysis and dissemination of botulinum toxin. Calcium-channel blockers (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem) can interact with aminoglycosides to produce complete neuromuscular blockade among patients who do not have botulism and theoretically should be avoided on the basis of this interaction. A single report has been published of pretreatment of mice with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline resulting in rapid botulism-induced death.

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

Any agent that can cause paralysis, including NMBAs, should either be avoided or be used after careful consideration and with appropriate monitoring. The NMBA succinylcholine induces sustained depolarization of motor endplate at the myoneuronal junction. The nondepolarizing NMBAs, such as rocuronium, vecuronium, and pancuronium, block acetylcholine from binding to motor endplate receptors.

Key Points for Clinicians

Patients with suspected, symptomatic botulism should be treated with BAT and receive supportive care (e.g. intensive care including intubation and mechanical ventilation when necessary).
Evidence does not indicate benefit from any treatment modalities other than antitoxin, although data are limited.

Recommendation

Aminoglycosides, magnesium, clindamycin, tetracycline, or calcium should only be administered to patients with botulism after careful consideration and with appropriate monitoring.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^111C2Ztj]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus

Tacrolimus (TCM) like CSA is a calcineurin inhibitor effectively inhibiting antigen-specific lymphocyte activation, differentiation and exertion of effector functions in lymphocytes. The efficacy of TCM compared to CSA is 10–100 times stronger. Side effects are the same as those occurring under CSA and exhibit a strong dosage dependency. TCM was developed in Japan and is licensed for the treatment of MG there. Several open clinical studies and smaller case series report beneficial clinical effects of TCM (3–5 mg/day) in patients with therapy-refractory MG. In a multicenter, open cohort study in 79 patients with MG, low-dosage TCM (0.1 mg/day/kg bodyweight) could replace combination therapy consisting of CSA and prednisolon and provide good clinical stabilization including regression of nAChR-Ab titers. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 80 patients with MG with minimal clinical disease under an oral prednisolone therapy (10–20 mg/day) studied the steroid-sparing effect of TCM (3 mg/day) over a period of 28 weeks. The oral prednison therapy was reduced stepwise starting after 4 weeks of TCM treatment. However, no significant difference was detected between TCM and placebo regarding the mean oral prednisolone dosage during the last 12 weeks of the follow-up periode. Due to the study population and the short follow up, this study provides little evidence on the long-term efficacy of TCM in patients with MG and insufficient treatment response on the GCS-therapy. Like CSA, TCM is nephro- and neurotoxic and exhibits multiple drug interactions.

### Advising patients who use dietary supplements [^115yEQs5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Public use of dietary supplements is quite prevalent, with an estimated 1 of 5 patients using such substances in an effort to maintain or promote their health. Despite their popularity, patients and physicians are often unaware of the limited regulation of these products as well as their potential risks and benefits. Lack of physician knowledge in these areas has the potential to strain the doctor-patient relationship. In this review, we present a 6-step approach to advising patients who are considering use of dietary supplements. Our framework includes a discussion of regulatory issues, efficacy and safety, potential supplement-drug interactions, and monitoring for adverse events and therapeutic effects.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1124eMLn]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis receiving neuromuscular blocking agents — dosing, monitoring, and interactions: We recommend that a reduced dose of an NMBA be used for patients with myasthenia gravis and that the dose should be based on PNS with TOF monitoring (good practice statement), and we make no recommendation on which muscle group should be monitored in patients with myasthenia gravis undergoing treatment with NMBAs (insufficient evidence). Sensitivity to NMBAs varies greatly among patients with myasthenia, and individual assessment is necessary; patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors are at risk for experiencing prolonged neuromuscular blockade due to prolonged inactivation of succinylcholine, pyridostigmine inhibits the metabolism of mivacurium and therefore delays recovery, and discontinuing the cholinesterase inhibitor on the day of surgery increases the risk of respiratory distress.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment for myasthenia gravis [^115WchXL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In myasthenia gravis, antibody-mediated blockade of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction abolishes the naturally occurring 'safety factor' of synaptic transmission. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary symptomatic treatment of muscle weakness but there is controversy about their long-term efficacy, dosage and side effects. This is the second update of a review published in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in all forms of myasthenia gravis.

Search Methods

On 8 July 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials regarding usage of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Two authors scanned the articles for any study eligible for inclusion. We also contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data and searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

The types of studies were randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants were myasthenia gravis patients diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition. The intervention was treatment with any form of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Types of outcome measures Primary outcome measureImprovement in the presenting symptoms within one to 14 days of the start of treatment. Secondary outcome measures(1) Improvement in the presenting symptoms more than 14 days after the start of treatment.(2) Change in impairment measured by a recognised and preferably validated scale, such as the quantitative myasthenia gravis score, within one to 14 days and more than 14 days after the start of treatment.(3) Myasthenia Gravis Association of America post-intervention status more than 14 days after start of treatment.(4) Adverse events including muscarinic side effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author (MMM) extracted the data, which were checked by a second author. We contacted study authors for extra information and collected data on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We did not find any large randomised or quasi-randomised trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in generalised myasthenia gravis either for the first version of this review or this update. One cross-over randomised trial using intranasal neostigmine in a total of 10 participants was only available as an abstract. It included three participants with ocular myasthenia gravis and seven with generalised myasthenia gravis. Symptoms of myasthenia gravis (measured as improvement in at least one muscle function) improved in nine of the 10 participants after the two-week neostigmine treatment phase. No participant improved after the placebo phase. Lack of detail in the report meant that the risk of bias was unclear. Adverse events were minor.

Authors' Conclusions

Except for one small and inconclusive trial of intranasal neostigmine, no other randomised controlled trials have been conducted on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. The response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in observational studies is so clear that a randomised controlled trial depriving participants in a placebo arm of treatment would be difficult to justify.

### Do women with pre-eclampsia, and their babies, benefit from magnesium sulphate? The magpie trial: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^117QrnnP]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

The study MAGPIE was published by Altman D and colleagues in 2002 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Preeclampsia and Eclampsia. In the MAGPIE study, the trial question was: what is the role of magnesium sulfate in patients with preeclampsia, and their babies? In the MAGPIE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MAGPIE study, the population was: 10141 female patients. The inclusion criteria were female patients who had not given birth or were ≤ 24 hours postpartum with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria ≥ 1+. The key exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to magnesium, hepatic coma with a risk of renal failure, or myasthenia gravis. In the MAGPIE study, the interventions were: n = 5071 magnesium sulfate (5 g IV) n = 5070 placebo (10 mL normal saline). In the MAGPIE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in eclampsia (0.8% vs. 1.9%; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.6). In the MAGPIE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in maternal death (0.2% vs. 0.4%; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14) No significant difference in neonatal death (12.7% vs. 12.4%; RR 1.02, 99% CI 0.92 to 1.14). In the MAGPIE study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in side effects (24% vs. 5%). In the MAGPIE study, the conclusion was: in female patients who had not given birth or were ≤ 24 hours postpartum with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria ≥ 1+, magnesium sulfate was superior to placebo with respect to eclampsia.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma… [^113KaN55]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Adults and children who were treated in the emergency department for acute asthma exacerbations Efficacy End Points: Hospital admission Harm End Points: Medication adverse effects. Subgroup analysis of adults who initially presented with life-threatening asthma found that 31% in the magnesium treatment group were admitted vs. 39% in the placebo group. The one study that specifically evaluated the differences in admissions to the intensive care unit found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The most commonly cited adverse effects were flushing, fatigue, nausea, headache, and tingling and burning at the administration site.

Three studies showed a statistically significant increase in adverse effects in the magnesium sulfate group compared with the placebo group, but the other eight studies did not. Only four studies reported on hypotension; two of these studies showed a statistically significant increase in the rate of hypotension in the magnesium sulfate group vs. the placebo group, whereas the other two studies found no difference. Caveats: Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to have a greater benefit in children than in adults. However, although the studies of children were judged to be of good methodological quality, the small number of participants and the heterogeneity of trials led to low confidence in the results. In adults, the greatest benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate occurred in patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations.

The severity of the exacerbation was based on the patient's initial presentation and was determined retrospectively from data extracted from the various studies included in the meta-analysis. The BTS/SIGN guidelines have been updated, using the previous categories plus the addition of a new level of severity labeled "near-fatal asthma exacerbation" for patients who require mechanical ventilation. Although it appears that patients who presented in life-threatening distress benefited the most from intravenous magnesium sulfate, other factors, such as more attention from hospital staff or shorter time to receive treatment, may have played a role in the better outcomes in this subgroup. The studies differed in the timing, dosage, and frequency of magnesium sulfate administration; types of other medications given; and the order in which medications were administered. This made it difficult to determine the exact degree of effect attributable to treatment with magnesium sulfate.

### Assessment: symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^111SHqqK]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps — evidence-based treatment conclusions and recommendation: On the basis of single Class II studies, Naftidrofuryl, vitamin E, and diltiazem are possibly effective in the treatment of muscle cramps, whereas data regarding magnesium preparations (2 Class II studies) and gabapentin (1 study in ALS) show that these agents are probably not effective in the treatment of muscle cramps. Recommendation: Naftidrofuryl, diltiazem, and vitamin B complex may be considered for the treatment of muscle cramps (Level C).

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^113xq4Xq]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that pediatric patients with acquired autoimmune ocular MG are more likely than adult patients to go into spontaneous remission. Consider administering pyridostigmine as initial therapy in young pediatric patients with only ocular symptoms of MG. Consider initiating immunotherapy if goals of therapy are not met.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115tWNob]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer pyridostigmine as part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. Adjust pyridostigmine dose as needed, based on symptoms. Recognize that the ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can be an indicator that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies.

### Low magnesium levels can be associated with long-term use of PPIs… [^116doeqR]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

2 Patients who take prescription PPIs usually stay on therapy for an average of about 180 days.
3. Prescription PPIs include Nexium, Dexilant, Prilosec, Zegerid, Prevacid, Protonix, and AcipHex. Vimovo is a prescription combination drug product that contains a PPI. Over-the-counter PPIs include Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC, and Prevacid 24HR. Low serum magnesium levels can result in serious adverse events including muscle spasm, irregular heartbeat, and convulsions; however, patients do not always have these symptoms. Treatment of hypomagnesemia generally requires magnesium supplements. Treatment in patients taking a PPI and who have hypomagnesemia may also require stopping the PPI.

Healthcare professionals should consider obtaining serum magnesium levels prior to initiation of prescription PPI treatment in patients expected to be on these drugs for long periods of time, as well as patients who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin, diuretics or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia. For patients taking digoxin, a heart medicine, this is especially important because low magnesium can increase the likelihood of serious side effects. Healthcare professionals should consider obtaining magnesium levels periodically in these patients.
- Hypomagnesemia occurs with both loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics. These agents can cause hypomagnesemia when used as a single agent or when combined with other anti-hypertensives.

The FDA review suggests an association between hypomagnesemia-related serious adverse events and prolonged PPI use. However, because hypomagnesemia is likely under-recognized and under-reported, the available data are insufficient to quantify an incidence rate for hypomagnesemia with PPI therapy.

### The effect of magnesium on the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex: an ex vivo laboratory study [^1132eQKH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this ex vivo study, we investigated the neuromuscular effects of magnesium and its interaction with rocuronium and sugammadex. In agreement with previous studies, magnesium in itself induced dose-dependent suppression of muscle contraction force. The mechanism of magnesium's neuromuscular effect is multifactorial, including decreased liberation of acetylcholine from the presynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction and a decreased depolarizing effect of acetylcholine on the motor end plate. These effects can be reversed by increasing the calcium concentration, implicating antagonism of calcium as an underlying cause.

Magnesium also caused a left-shift in the concentration-response curve of rocuronium, similar to its effect on d-turbocurarine. The interaction between magnesium and rocuronium appears to be synergistic, as the reduction in muscle contraction force exceeds the sum of isolated rocuronium and magnesium effect. Previously it was suggested that this might be attributed to decreased liberation of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals due to an inhibition a voltage-gated calcium channels by magnesium, however, there is also in vitro evidence for receptor-level synergism in the case of vecuronium and magnesium.

Upon first inspection, pre-block administration of magnesium enhanced the actions of sugammadex as well. However, one has to consider the dose-sparing effect of magnesium, resulting in lower rocuronium concentrations to achieve the same level of neuromuscular block. Therefore the amount of NMBA sugammadex has to bind is less, which might explain the apparent left-shift in the concentration-response curve of sugammadex. Conversely, if we increased the concentration of magnesium only after commencing reversal of block (at partial recovery), the potentiation of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block by additional magnesium increased the depth of block and shifted the concentration-response curve of sugammadex to the right. This effect might be attributed to the synergism between magnesium and unbound rocuronium molecules. However, even under these circumstances, we saw no significant increase in the full reversal dose of sugammadex. Although we cannot entirely rule out an interaction between magnesium and sugammadex from our data, previous microcalorimetry experiments failed to show any affinity between magnesium and sugammadex. Therefore, the likelihood of a clinically significant interaction between magnesium and sugammadex is small and probably not relevant when compared with the more pronounced potentiation of rocuronium's effect by magnesium.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000, and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

### Guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117H37c5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). High credibility.

Advice for patients in ongoing MG clinical trials — prioritize patient interest and regulatory oversight. We strongly recommend that decisions about in‑person evaluations and treatments under a clinical trial be based on patients' best interest. Such decisions would typically need discussion and approval by the study sponsor, institutional review board, and medical monitor, and should be in keeping with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^1175tdAe]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to plasma exchange, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to perform plasma exchange as short-term treatment option in patients with impending and manifest myasthenic crisis and in patients with significant respiratory or bulbar dysfunction. Initiate corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents at the same time to achieve a sustained clinical response. Consider waiting for several days for plasma exchange to have a beneficial effect before initiating corticosteroids because they may cause transient worsening of myasthenic weakness.

### Batoclimab as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with myasthenia gravis: rationale and study design of a phase 3 clinical trial [^11238Vqy]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

All analyses will be conducted using Statistical Analysis Software V.9.4 or greater. The analysis of efficacy endpoints in the induction period will be primarily based on full analysis set (FAS)-1, comprising all randomised participants who receive any study treatment in the induction period. Efficacy assessments during the maintenance period will be primarily based on FAS-2, defined as all re-randomised participants who receive any study treatment during the maintenance period. The primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures approach (MMRM), with change from baseline in MG-ADL at each timepoint being the outcome and baseline MG-ADL score, nonsteroidal immunosuppressant use (yes/no), baseline QMG score (< 16 or ≥ 16), visit, treatment group, and visit-by–treatment group interaction as covariates. Secondary and tertiary continuous efficacy endpoints will be analysed using an MMRM similar to that described for the primary efficacy analysis; categorical endpoints will be analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method with adjustment for stratification factors in the induction (non-steroidal immunosuppressant use [yes/no], baseline QMG [< 16 or ≥ 16]) or maintenance periods (induction period treatment assignment [340 or 680 mg], improvement in QMG from baseline to week 12 [< 5 points or ≥ 5 points]), as appropriate.

For patients who discontinue study drug and do not receive a prohibited rescue medication, analysis of efficacy outcomes post-treatment discontinuation will proceed based on observed values. For patients who discontinue study drug and are treated with a prohibited rescue medication, the worst available blinded score post-treatment discontinuation will be assigned for visits occurring through the end of the study period. Of note, the worst available score may be obtained at an unscheduled visit prior to the administration of rescue medication or occur after the use of rescue medication in patients who continue to deteriorate. At intercurrent visits that are post-treatment discontinuation but prior to use of rescue medication, the actual observed value at each visit will be used.

Safety outcomes will be assessed by study period, based on all patients who receive treatment in the induction (SAF1), maintenance (SAF2), LTE-1 (SAF3), and LTE-2 (SAF4) periods. AEs, electrocardiograms, vital signs and safety laboratory data will be reviewed and summarised on an ongoing basis during the trial to evaluate the safety of participants.

### Total drug treatment and comorbidity in myasthenia gravis: a population-based cohort study [^113DNQbP]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Table 3
Number of the 830 MG patients receiving various prescription medications compared with the number in a similar group, with regard to age and sex, in the general national population

In all, 29% of MG patients received treatment with hypnotics and sedatives, and such drugs were twice as often given to MG patients than to controls for the age group < 50 years (1.2–2.3). 21% received antidepressants, twice as often given to male MG patients than to male controls (1.3–2.2). For the remaining age and sex groups, slightly more MG patients than controls were treated with hypnotics, sedatives and antidepressants. 20% received anxiolytics, whilst 7% received antipsychotics (Table 3). Anxiolytics and antipsychotics were prescribed to MG patients and controls with the same frequency.

Myasthenia gravis patients were twice as often treated with antiepileptic drugs (1.7–2.5). They were also more frequently treated with calcium-channel blockers (1.2–1.7) and lipid-modifying agents (1.1–1.4), but with the same frequency as in the controls with beta-blocking agents (0.9–1.2). All four drug groups were given more frequently to MG patients < 50 years compared with controls at the same age (Table 3). However, the number of users of calcium-channel blockers, lipid-modifying agents and beta-blocking agents was too low to provide enough statistical power (N = 6, 11, 11 respectively).

The DDDs of pyridostigmine were significantly lower for MG patients < 50 years compared with those ≥ 50 years (P < 0.001). There was no difference between men and women (P = 0.8). Immunomodulating agents were prescribed less to patients < 50 years (P < 0.001) and women (P = 0.001) compared with patients ≥ 50 years and men (Table 4); 406 MG patients (49%) had no immunomodulating agents expedited during the study period. The mean number of new groups of immunomodulating agents used per year was not significantly different between the two age and sex groups (P = 0.2 and P = 0.9, respectively; Fig. 2a and b). Regression analyses with mutual adjustment for age and sex did not alter the differences regarding age and sex.

Muscle cramps — adverse events reported in trials: No serious side effects occurred in trials evaluating gabapentin, vitamin B complex, diltiazem, and magnesium for treatment of muscle cramps, and minor side effects such as lightheadedness, nausea, and abdominal discomfort occurred infrequently and with equal frequency in controls and treatment groups in trials of vitamin B complex and magnesium. In magnesium studies, diarrhea was equally common (10%) in magnesium- and placebo-treated patients in one trial and slightly more frequent in magnesiumtreated patients (30% vs 17%, p = 0.1) in another trial. With gabapentin, minor side effects that occurred more frequently included lightheadedness, drowsiness, falls, and limb swelling, and a small trial of diltiazem did not report any side effects in the treated or placebo patients.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: a systematic review [^114eQiDd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Case reports also highlighted the potential for an increased risk of adverse effect occurrence among particular groups of women – those with renal insufficiency or failure, and those with neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, and other rare myopathies, such as mitochondrial myopathy. The potential for prolonged/enhanced neuromuscular blockade when magnesium sulphate is used in conjunction with general anaesthetic agents and antihypertensive agents including nifedipine was also shown. Whilst this potential interaction between magnesium sulphate and nifedipine was highlighted, reassuringly no increased neuromuscular blockade was shown in the retrospective cohort study that compared the use of nifedipine versus other/no antihypertensive during magnesium sulphate treatment (Table 4). Though an excess of respiratory problems and minor bleeding was shown among women receiving nifedipine, compared with no antihypertensive, the condition of women receiving nifedipine was considered comparatively more severe (more severe hypertension, more frequent pre-eclampsia symptoms), which was suggested to account for this difference.

Adverse effects not previously reported in randomised trials that were discussed in case reports included marked bilateral labial swelling, severe paralytic ileus, marked osteoporotic change, and urinary tract stone formation. In each case, magnesium sulphate had been used as a tocolytic agent for a prolonged period (nine, three, 101 and 21 days respectively). The relevant Cochrane reviews have shown magnesium sulphate to be ineffective at delaying or preventing preterm birth. Acknowledging this and the maternal adverse effects of magnesium sulphate, from minor to unpleasant to potentially fatal, its use as a tocolytic appears inappropriate, as has been strongly stated by Grimes and Nanda. Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States recently advised health care professionals against the use of magnesium sulphate as a tocolytic for more than five to seven days due to associated harm to developing fetal bones (the use of the drug for tocolysis is 'off-label' (not approved by the Food and Drug Administration)). In view of the extremely widespread use of antenatal magnesium sulphate in obstetric practice, the potential neonatal and infant adverse effects of antenatally administered magnesium sulphate additionally require comprehensive evaluation, such as by systematic review.

### The effect of magnesium on the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex: an ex vivo laboratory study [^116Sp8k1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The ex vivo nature of our study poses limitations with regards to the direct clinical applicability of the results. One major confounder is that through a large portion of the preparation process the tissue specimen is in a hypoxic state. At present we do not know what kind of receptor level changes this might induce or how this might affect intracellular ion trafficking and utilization. However, any such effects should be uniform among specimens as they were harvested in a similar fashion. The distinct advantage of this ex vivo system is that it allows the precise quantitative characterization of phenomena to a degree that is hard to achieve in in vivo, let alone clinical studies. Connections and interactions that are otherwise masked by the gross dosing of study drugs (relative to the concentration-response curve) or study endpoints that are only surrogates of actual efficacy (i.e. time to reversal of block with a fixed dose of sugammadex as opposed to an actual concentration-response relationship) can be thus uncovered. If the available clinical data are interpreted in the context of our ex vivo findings, several clinically relevant assumptions regarding the effects of magnesium can be made.

When magnesium is given prior to initiation of neuromuscular block and there is no compensatory reduction in non-depolarizing NMBA dose, then potentiation and left-shift of the concentration-response curve will cause a faster onset time and a prolonged block, as has already been shown for vecuronium and rocuronium. While one could expect potentiation of neuromuscular block by magnesium pretreatment to prolong reversal with sugammadex, two clinical studies failed to show any significant effect. An ex vivo study also came to the conclusion that increasing magnesium concentration does not systematically increase reversal time by sugammadex.

When magnesium is administered after the non-depolarizing NMBA or during a/following reversal, then total reversal dose of sugammadex is still unchanged, however, the degree of neuromuscular block caused by unbound NMBAs will be increased. Magnesium given after incomplete spontaneous recovery or pharmacological reversal can cause a recurrent neuromuscular block, even if the TOF ratio is > 0.9. The degree of the block can be clinically significant even if the concentration of magnesium remains in the near-physiological range. Therefore magnesium should be administered carefully postoperatively and quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is advised to confirm full reversal and exclude return of neuromuscular block, even when using sugammadex.

### Guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112CdYAw]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). High credibility.

Patients on existing therapies for MG/LEMS — continue maintenance treatment, do not stop symptomatic agents, and practice enhanced distancing. MG/LEMS patients should continue their current treatment and are advised not to stop any existing medications unless specifically discussed and approved by their healthcare provider. Symptomatic therapies should not be discontinued unless there are other clinical reasons to do so. For patients already on immunosuppressive medications, it is recommended to practice extra‑vigilant social distancing and use alternatives to face‑to‑face consultations when clinically appropriate. When altering or stopping immunosuppressive therapy, patients and providers should consider specific risks and benefits, including age, comorbid health conditions, and location.

### Magnesium sulfate in dextrose [^113MUhRW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10	OVERDOSAGE

Manifestations of magnesium toxicity include a drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and disappearance of the patellar reflex. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq per liter, the deep tendon reflexes decrease. As the serum magnesium level approaches 10 mEq per liter, the tendon reflexes disappear and respiratory paralysis may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Other signs and symptoms of magnesium overdosage include flushing, sweating, hypotension, weakness, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis, cardiac arrest, and prolongation of PR and QRS intervals. Patients with renal impairment and underlying neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis may experience magnesium intoxication at lower magnesium concentrations (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis).

If patient is experiencing magnesium toxicity, immediately discontinue Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Artificial respiration may be required. Administer an injectable calcium salt to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hypermagnesemia in the newborn (after administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection to the mother) may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium.

### Myasthenia gravis masquerading as dysphagia: unveiled by magnesium infusion [^111GXNkX]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder that typically affects the ocular, bulbar, neck, proximal limbs and respiratory muscles. Dysphagia can occasionally be the only presenting symptom leading to extensive but ultimately futile gastrointestinal workup. Delay in diagnosis and use of certain pharmacological agents in the interim can lead to a myasthenic crisis, which though diagnostic is life threatening. We document a case of dysphagia as the only symptom of myasthenia, diagnosed after a magnesium infusion precipitated myasthenic crisis. A 70-year-old Caucasian woman who had had progressive dysphagia for 2 years, for which multiple oesophageal dilations were performed. During a hosptalisation for further gastrointestinal workup, she went into myasthenic crisis (respiratory failure) after receiving magnesium replacement. She required ventilatory support and received five plasma exchange (PLEX) treatments after myasthenia was confirmed by the detection of high antiacetylcholine receptor antibody. Though her symptoms improved, she had a prolonged hospital stay (25 days) and required 18 days of mechanical ventilation. This underscores the morbidity associated with a delay in diagnosis of this condition. This case report suggests that neuromuscular causes should be considered early in elderly patients presenting with dysphagia. Timely diagnosis, initiation of management and avoidance of drugs that affect neuromuscular transmission may help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with myasthenic crisis.
