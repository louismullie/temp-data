## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage a 41-year-old woman with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, severe hyperglycemia, mixed dyslipidemia, low vitamin D, and mild hyponatremia, including which medications to start, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the severity and phenotype of hyperglycemia to determine urgency and initial pharmacotherapy. Then, I should verify kidney function thresholds to decide metformin use. Next, I will evaluate dyslipidemia and triglyceride-related pancreatitis risk. After that, I need to address vitamin D deficiency and mild hyponatremia. Finally, I will lay out the full initial medication plan, lifestyle and education, and a 3–6 month monitoring and titration schedule, with built-in safety checks and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity and phenotype of hyperglycemia. An A1C of 13.0% with a random glucose of 358 mg/dL places her in the category of symptomatic, high-catabolic type 2 diabetes where guidelines recommend immediate combination therapy and consideration of basal insulin due to catabolism and the magnitude of A1C elevation above goal, so I should not delay intensification here [^116YSn1B] [^111HQmAu].

> Wait, let me verify metformin candidacy. Her creatinine of 0.55 mg/dL and no stated kidney disease history suggest preserved renal function, and I should double-check an eGFR, but with this creatinine in a 41-year-old woman I anticipate eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², making metformin appropriate, with a practical start of 500 mg twice daily with titration to 1000 mg twice daily if tolerated, alongside vitamin B12 monitoring if continued long term and temporary holding for acute illness or iodinated contrast per ADA/KDIGO guidance [^116YAZC1] [^112uVKLy] [^115H5Aiy].

> Hold on, I should verify insulin needs now. Given A1C > 10% and glucose > 300 mg/dL with likely catabolism, initiating basal insulin is appropriate, and I initially thought of 10 units nightly as a starting dose, but wait, that is a bit high for someone I have not yet screened for hypoglycemia risk and weight trajectory, so let me reconsider and start at 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, which is about 6–12 units nightly, with a plan to titrate by 2 units every 3 days based on fasting glucose until the fasting target is achieved, while counseling on hypoglycemia and providing SMBSE materials [^116YSn1B] [^111HQmAu].

> I need to check the cardiometabolic risk modifiers. Adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist such as semaglutide or dulaglutide offers glycemic lowering, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk reduction and can blunt insulin-associated weight gain, so combining metformin with a GLP-1 RA and basal insulin is reasonable in this high-A1C, likely overweight presentation, with attention to GI tolerability and contraindications such as MEN2 or personal/family medullary thyroid cancer history [^111gnj4N] [^116YSn1B].

> Next, I should review dyslipidemia. The triglycerides are 298 mg/dL, which is in the moderate range where the priority is to optimize glycemic control, implement lifestyle measures, and maximize statin therapy before adding triglyceride-specific agents, so I will initiate high-intensity statin therapy for a patient with diabetes aiming for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction, with the caveat that the current LDL-C of 47 mg/dL may limit absolute LDL lowering but the statin remains indicated for ASCVD risk reduction in diabetes and for HDL raising indirectly through glycemic improvement [^114hABYf].

> I should confirm pancreatitis risk. With triglycerides < 500 mg/dL, acute pancreatitis risk is not high, so fenofibrate or omega-3s are not urgent now, but I will recheck a fasting lipid panel in 3 months after glycemic optimization and lifestyle therapy, and if triglycerides persist ≥ 150 mg/dL with optimized statin and lifestyle, I will consider adding icosapent ethyl or fenofibrate based on shared decision-making and ASCVD risk features per ACC and ADA pathways [^114hABYf] [^113KvqTq].

> Let me think about vitamin D. At 17.1 ng/mL, she is deficient, and while most trial data for diabetes prevention are in prediabetes, correction of deficiency is reasonable and safe at 2000–4000 IU daily with recheck in about 3 months, keeping total intake within tolerable upper limits and recognizing that routine intensive monitoring is not mandatory in otherwise healthy adults [^112YtL7L] [^113dFp3a].

> I will now examine the mild hyponatremia. Sodium 133 mmol/L is borderline and could reflect hyperglycemia-related translocational shifts, but I should also consider hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, diuretics, or SIADH, so I will plan to recheck sodium with glucose and serum osmolality after glycemic correction and obtain a basic metabolic panel, TSH, and morning cortisol if the hyponatremia persists, while correcting glucose and volume status cautiously [^notfound].

> Putting this together, my initial medication plan is: metformin 500 mg twice daily with titration to 1000 mg twice daily if tolerated. Basal insulin starting at 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, roughly 6–12 units nightly, with 2-unit titrations every 3 days to a fasting glucose of 80–130 mg/dL. A GLP-1 receptor agonist such as semaglutide weekly or dulaglutide weekly to augment glycemic control, weight management, and cardiometabolic risk reduction. High-intensity statin such as atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily for ASCVD risk reduction in diabetes. And vitamin D3 2000–4000 IU daily with reassessment of 25(OH)D in 3 months, with a contingency to add fenofibrate or icosapent ethyl if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL on repeat testing and shared decision-making supports it [^116YSn1B] [^111gnj4N] [^114hABYf] [^112YtL7L].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and education because medication without behavior change will underperform. I will arrange diabetes self-management education, medical nutrition therapy emphasizing reduced refined carbohydrates and weight loss, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity as tolerated, and screening for and support with cost-related adherence barriers, as these steps meaningfully augment pharmacotherapy and improve outcomes [^111BMTFs] [^115JRcg9].

> I need to ensure a structured follow-up cadence. Short-interval visits are critical in the first months, so I will plan SMBG review and insulin titration weekly to every 2 weeks initially, then formal reassessment at 3 months for A1C, fasting glucose, lipid panel, renal function, vitamin D, and sodium, with the expectation that if A1C remains above goal, I will escalate insulin and/or add an SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven cardiorenal benefit, recognizing SGLT-2 efficacy wanes as eGFR declines below 45 and that GLP-1 RAs are preferred in advanced CKD or when SGLT-2s are not suitable [^115BGuVq] [^111CwBAi] [^114Qx47f].

> Let me first confirm monitoring specifics. I will obtain A1C every 3 months until at goal, then every 6 months. Check a comprehensive metabolic panel, including creatinine/eGFR, electrolytes, and liver enzymes at least annually and more frequently if CKD risk or therapy changes. Monitor vitamin B12 periodically with long-term metformin. And reassess the need for, or dose of, medications with higher hypoglycemia risk at each visit to minimize hypoglycemia burden, aligning with ADA standards [^116YAZC1] [^115BGuVq] [^116heVy6].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed potential pitfalls. I will instruct to hold metformin during acute illness, hypoperfusion, or before iodinated contrast and resume after renal function stabilizes, review drug–drug interactions, and screen for pregnancy plans given teratogenicity risks with some agents and the need for contraception counseling in people of childbearing potential, while ensuring blood pressure, weight, and albumin-to-creatinine ratio are addressed in parallel given their impact on cardiorenal outcomes [^113t8Fdo] [^111NJALE] [^1141dvLH].

Start **metformin** unless contraindicated [^117WzJKy] and initiate **basal insulin** for severe hyperglycemia (A1C 13%, glucose 358 mg/dL) [^116YSn1B]. Add a **GLP-1 RA** for weight/cardiovascular benefit and consider an **SGLT-2 inhibitor** if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114CAaUz] [^111gnj4N]. Start **high-intensity statin** for ASCVD risk, add icosapent ethyl if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statin therapy [^113QxPS4] [^114hABYf], and treat vitamin D deficiency with 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks then maintain at 1,000–2,000 IU daily. Monitor renal function, electrolytes, and lipids; reinforce lifestyle measures and address secondary causes of dyslipidemia.

---

## Glycemic management

### Initial pharmacologic therapy

- **Metformin**: First-line unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², severe GI intolerance, or metabolic acidosis) [^112Sit7t] [^115H5Aiy].
- **Basal insulin**: Initiate for severe hyperglycemia (A1C > 10% or glucose > 300 mg/dL) [^111HQmAu].
- **GLP-1 receptor agonist**: Add for weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and improved glycemic control [^114CAaUz].
- **SGLT-2 inhibitor**: Consider if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² for cardiorenal benefits [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

Monitoring should include **A1C every 3 months** until at goal, then every 6 months, along with **regular renal function and electrolyte checks** [^115BGuVq] [^1177CBvm]. Adjust therapy based on A1C, hypoglycemia risk, and tolerability [^113pBd7W].

---

## Lipid management

### Initial pharmacologic therapy

High-intensity statin therapy (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) is indicated for diabetes with high ASCVD risk [^113QxPS4]. Consider **icosapent ethyl** if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statin therapy [^114hABYf].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications should emphasize weight loss, dietary changes, and regular physical activity to improve lipid profiles and overall cardiovascular risk [^114hABYf] [^111XGpnH].

---

## Vitamin D deficiency management

For vitamin D deficiency, prescribe **cholecalciferol 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks**, then maintain with 1,000–2,000 IU daily. Recheck 25(OH)D after 8–12 weeks and adjust the maintenance dose to maintain levels ≥ 30 ng/mL [^notfound].

---

## Additional considerations

### Hyponatremia

Evaluate for **SIADH, adrenal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism**, and correct sodium cautiously to avoid osmotic demyelination.

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Schedule **regular follow-up** to assess glycemic control, lipid profile, renal function, and electrolytes, and reinforce adherence to medications and lifestyle changes [^115BGuVq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Condition** | **Recommended therapy** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Hyperglycemia | - Metformin <br/> - Basal insulin <br/> - GLP-1 RA <br/> - SGLT-2 inhibitor | - A1C every 3–6 months <br/> - Renal function <br/> - Electrolytes |

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease in children and adolescents — type 2 diabetes management indicates that in patients with type 2 diabetes, therapeutic lifestyle changes should be the initial interventions for hyperglycemia, and if lifestyle changes do not succeed in achieving a goal of near-normal glycemia (HbA1c < 7%), drug therapy should be initiated. For children or adolescents with type 2 diabetes, only metformin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this use — and only in children older than 10 years; however, metformin should be avoided in children and adolescents with diabetes and CKD. Cautions regarding the use of other oral agents in children and adolescents with diabetes and CKD are the same as those described for adults, and TZDs should not be used because of concerns about liver toxicity due to the experience with troglitazone.

If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

Comprehensive Care: Targets for Optimum Management and Selection of Therapy

Clinical Targets

The management strategy of T2D should be comprehensive and address all risks. A number of targets should be set and periodically reassessed to ensure goals are effectively achieved. In the last decade, the care of T2D was established beyond glycemic control, and the evaluation and follow-up of metabolic, cardiac, and renal risks are required, motivating the role of a multidisciplinary panel of experts from different specialties. Table 3 shows the recommendations that should be aimed for by physicians for a controlled T2D. These general recommendations are in line with international ones and can be fine-tuned on a case-by-case basis according to the patient's profile and characteristics.

Table 3
Recommendations for the management of major clinical manifestations of type 2 diabetes

BNP B-type natriuretic peptide, DBP diastolic blood pressure, ECG electrocardiography, ECHO echocardiography, HbA1c glycated hemoglobin, LDL-C low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, NT-proBNP N-terminal prohormone of BNP, SBP systolic blood pressure, T2D type 2 diabetes, UACR urine albumin to creatinine ratio

a With evidence of kidney impairment and if UACR ≥ 300 mg/g or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² more frequent testing is recommended; i.e. every 3 months

Target achievement must be evaluated every 3–6 months, and adjustments to treatment must be made if the goal(s) are not met, in order to reduce complications.

Tailoring Treatment of T2D to Improve Cardio-Renal Outcomes

Use of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy

Local guidance in the management of T2D relies on recommendations from major international societies, such as the ADA, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the KDIGO organization. Table 4 summarizes treatment recommendations laid down by these societies.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1152rvgh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic management of diabetes in older individuals — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend metformin as the initial oral medication chosen for glycemic management in addition to lifestyle management, and this recommendation should not be implemented in patients who have significantly impaired kidney function [estimated GFR (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²] or have a gastrointestinal intolerance; metformin is highly effective, may reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, and does not cause hypoglycemia or weight gain, and because clinical events that may precipitate acute kidney injury can cause metformin accumulation with a potential risk for lactic acidosis, metformin use is often stopped when patients are hospitalized, with vitamin B12 levels monitored yearly; in patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes who have not achieved glycemic targets with metformin and lifestyle, we recommend that other oral or injectable agents and/or insulin should be added to metformin.

Shared decision-making example — older adult with type 1 diabetes (T1D): Mrs. Jones is a 72-year-old woman with T1D who has had diabetes for 40 years and hypertension on two agents with SBP between 132 and 140, with stage 3 CKD with a GFR of 42. Her HbA1c has been between 6.2 and 6.9 for the last 10 years, and she uses long-acting basal insulin and rapid-acting insulin up to five times daily. From her glucometer, her lowest glucose is 62 mg/dL in the fasting state and otherwise her fasting mean glucose is 128 mg/dL; she reports feeling "fuzzy" and "clumsy" when her glucose is > 200 mg/dL. As part of SDM, she agreed to wear a continuous glucose monitor for up to 10 days, and both parties agreed to focus on the glucose ranges rather than HbA1c with a glucose range of fasting, 100 to 150 mg/dL, and bedtime, 150 to 180 mg/dL, while avoiding glucose levels > 200 mg/dL as much as possible.

### Management of type 2 diabetes with a treat-to-benefit approach improved long-term cardiovascular outcomes under routine care [^114d7RW1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Results of cardiovascular outcome trials enabled a shift from "treat-to-target" to "treat-to-benefit" paradigm in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, studies validating such approach are limited. Here, we examined whether treatment according to international recommendations for the pharmacological management of T2D had an impact on long-term outcomes.

Methods

This was an observational study conducted on outpatient data collected in 2008–2018 (i.e. prior to the "treat-to-benefit" shift). We defined 6 domains of treatment based on the ADA/EASD consensus covering all disease stages: first- and second-line treatment, intensification, use of insulin, cardioprotective, and weight-affecting drugs. At each visit, patients were included in Group 1 if at least one domain deviated from recommendation or in Group 2 if aligned with recommendations. We used Cox proportional hazard models with time-dependent co-variates or Cox marginal structural models (with inverse-probability of treatment weighing evaluated at each visit) to adjust for confounding factors and evaluate three outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular mortality (HF-CVM), and all-cause mortality.

Results

We included 5419 patients, on average 66-year old, 41% women, with a baseline diabetes duration of 7.6years. Only 11.7% had pre-existing cardiovascular disease. During a median follow-up of 7.3years, patients were seen 12 times at the clinic, and we recorded 1325 MACE, 1593 HF-CVM, and 917 deaths. By the end of the study, each patient spent on average 63.6% of time in Group 1. In the fully adjusted model, being always in Group 2 was associated with a 45% lower risk of MACE (HR 0.55; 95% C. I. 0.46–0.66; p < 0.0001) as compared to being in Group 1. The corresponding HF-CVM and mortality risk were similar (HR 0.56; 95%CI 0.47–0.66, p < 0.0001 and HR 0.56; 95% C. I. 0.45–0.70; p < 0.0001. respectively). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. No single domain individually explained the better outcome of Group 2, which remained significant in all subgroups.

Conclusion

Managing patients with T2D according to a "treat-to-benefit" approach based international standards was associated with a lower risk of MACE, heart failure, and mortality. These data provide ex-post validation of the ADA/EASD treatment algorithm.

### Fenofibrate (antara) [^1149VgQu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Prior to Initiation of Antara

Assess lipid levels before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or medications) of high triglyceride levels and manage as appropriate.
Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Antara and should continue this diet during treatment with Antara.
In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting Antara.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 30 mg or 90 mg orally once daily. ○ Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.
- **Primary hyperlipidemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 90 mg orally once daily.
- Administer Antara as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food.
- Advise patients to swallow Antara capsules whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew capsules.
- Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating Antara. Discontinue Antara in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment.
- If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.
- Advise patients to take Antara at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of Antara and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Treatment with Antara should be initiated at a dosage of 30 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dose.
Antara is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1.73m), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients

Dosage selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus — additional risk-based statin recommendations: In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In adults older than 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and who are already on statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue statin therapy. In adults with diabetes mellitus and 10-year ASCVD risk of 20% or higher, it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In adults older than 75 years with diabetes mellitus, it may be reasonable to initiate statin therapy after a clinician–patient discussion of potential benefits and risks. In adults 20 to 39 years of age with diabetes mellitus of long duration (≥ 10 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus, ≥ 20 years of type 1 diabetes mellitus) or with albuminuria (≥ 30 mcg of albumin/mg creatinine), estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, retinopathy, neuropathy, or ABI (< 0.9), it may be reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Chronic kidney disease diagnosis and management: a review [^112cYLRs]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Observations

Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², albuminuria ≥ 300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

3 Results

3.1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Respondents

A total of 105 HCPs from all Spanish regions (except La Rioja) responded to the survey: 60% PCPs and 40% endocrinologists. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 46 (12) years, and 64% were female. Respondents' professional characteristics are shown in Table S1. The mean (SD) years of clinical experience was 17.0 (12) and 85.7% worked in the public sector. The respondents reported attending a mean (SD) number of 24.3 (13.0) people with T2D weekly, including 2.8 (3.0) newly diagnosed cases. Of these, 42.5% were aged ≤ 65 years, and 80.1% presented with overweight or obesity.

3.2 General Management Practices atDiagnosis

Almost all respondents reported following a clinical practice guideline (98%), with guidelines from the ADA/EASD (82%) and the Network of Groups for the Study of Diabetes in Primary Care (RedGDPS) (51%) being the most used. The SED and SEEN guidelines were also followed by a high percentage of respondents (49% and 45%).

The respondents were asked to report the percentage of patients for whom they evaluate a list of clinical parameters at T2D diagnosis (Figure S1). More than 90% of respondents reported assessing HbA1c levels, fasting glucose, lipids, serum creatinine and smoking status in > 75% of patients. Despite the majority (80%) of respondents evaluating BMI for > 75% of patients at diagnosis, waist circumference was assessed in < 24% of patients by 40% of respondents. Body composition was assessed in > 25% of patients by < 20% of respondents.

Regarding the assessment of CV risk, more than 90% of the HCPs evaluated blood pressure, smoking habits, low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, family history of CVD, age and BMI (Figure S2). However, < 50% of survey respondents reported evaluating triglyceride levels, waist circumference and triglycerides/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio.

Diabetes mellitus, age 20 to 39 years — evidence on ASCVD rates and statin benefit is limited; rates are low in those < 30 years and may reach intermediate risk by 30 to 39 years, especially with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus or type 1 diabetes mellitus of > 20 years' duration. It may be reasonable to discuss initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years or with major complications, including nephropathy (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg albumin/mg creatinine) or an ABI of < 0.9.

It is increasingly common for nephrologists to be faced with the question of whether starting dialysis on an elderly patient is appropriate. We present an extraordinary case of a 103-year-old person who has become the oldest patient in our unit, reportedly the world, to not only remain on haemodialysis, but to thrive on it. This case adds to the compelling literature, which suggests that it is indeed the number and severity of comorbidities that is more likely to impact survival than age alone.

A new diagnosis of T2D at the time of presenting with an A1C ≥ 12% was found to be a confounding variable in the regression analysis. Therefore, additional post hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results between newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed patients. There were significantly greater reductions in A1C in newly diagnosed patients compared to patients with established diabetes (−6.3% vs. −2.7%, p = 0.001, Table 5), with A1C differences emerging within 3–5 months from baseline (Fig. 1). Twenty-one out of 24 newly diagnosed patients (87.5%) were classified as responders, achieving an A1C ≤ 9%, which was significantly higher than the 41.1% of patients with established diabetes (p < 0.001). In addition, 17 (70.9%) of the newly diagnosed population achieved the ADA-recommended goal A1C of ≤ 7% as opposed to 12 (13.3%) of previously diagnosed patients. This occurred despite the fact that newly diagnosed patients were less likely to be initially treated with insulin (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001) or receive insulin at any point throughout the year (29.2% vs. 81.1%, p < 0.001). Of note, 16 of the 24 patients (67%) started a single non-insulin medication; 14 of those achieved an A1C ≤ 9% and 10 of those achieved the ADA-recommended A1C of ≤ 7% within a year. Details regarding the other initial treatment regimens of newly diagnosed patients are shown in Table 6.

Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

### Management of dyslipidemia in adults… [^116fZGrU]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The target LDL cholesterol value in patients with coronary heart disease or other atherosclerotic disease is 100 mg per dL or lower. If the LDL level does not exceed 100 mg per dL in a patient with coronary heart disease, the patient should begin the step I diet, regularly participate in physical activity and stop smoking. Annual lipoprotein analysis is indicated for this group. Premenopausal women and men 35 years of age or younger with dyslipidemia but without other risk factors for coronary heart disease or a genetic predisposition are generally considered at low risk. Multiple Drug Therapy As mentioned previously, the NCEP guidelines define a target LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg per dL as a goal for high-risk patients with established coronary heart disease. But this population, even with a step II diet, often cannot achieve such a low LDL level. An LDL level greater than 130 mg per dL requires further reduction in patients with coronary heart disease, and combination drug regimens are sometimes required. * An additional cholesterol-lowering drug is probably required if the LDL cholesterol level remains above the target level after three months of single-drug therapy. In patients with coronary heart disease and LDL levels between 100 and 130 mg per dL, clinical judgment is needed to decide whether to initiate cholesterol-lowering medication in conjunction with dietary therapy. Follow-Up of Drug Therapy Because of biologic and analytic variability of lipoprotein levels, it is advisable to obtain at least two lipoprotein levels during one to two months of maximum dietary therapy before beginning drug therapy. 11 If it seems likely that pharmacotherapy will be needed, baseline liver function tests should also be performed.

After starting drug therapy, the LDL cholesterol level should be measured in about six weeks and again in 12 weeks. 11 Liver function and other tests for drug toxicity can be done at these times. If the LDL goal is reached, lipid levels should be checked every six to 12 months. 32 Follow-up analysis should occur six to eight weeks after a change in drug therapy. In patients receiving nicotinic acid, follow-up measurements should be obtained four to six weeks after a stable dose has been reached. 19.

2.3.6 Summary of Medications for Diabetes, Lipid, and Kidney Disorders

Along with lifestyle recommendations, pharmacotherapy is usually necessary to address the multiple cardiorenal and metabolic defects of patients with and without T2D. The table provides a brief summary of the most common benefits, concerns, and contraindications for medication classes commonly used for patients with T2D, hyperlipidemia, HF, and/or CKD. Treatment decisions should be made based on good clinical judgement, individual patients' needs and characteristics, product indications and restrictions, clinical practice guidelines, and other relevant factors.

2.3.6.1. Antihyperglycemic agents.

Thorough reviews of the attributes of antihyperglycemic classes can be found elsewhere. Compared with sulfonylureas, metformin is associated with increased cardiovascular safety and more durable antihyperglycemic effects. This agent does not promote hypoglycemia and may induce mild weight loss. It should not be initiated if eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, but established therapy may be continued with stable eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop, and supplementation may be needed to address associated anemia and/or peripheral neuropathy. Among patients with prediabetes, metformin may delay progression to T2D.

GLP1-RAs yield robust glycemic reductions as well as decreases in weight, BP, and lipids and carry a low risk of hypoglycemia. Most GLP1-RAs are given as injections (daily or weekly); currently one oral formulation is available. Dulaglutide, liraglutide, and injectable semaglutide have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes. – Gastrointestinal side effects can be mitigated by careful, slow dose titration. GLP1-RAs are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MCT or MEN type 2, and caution should be exercised in patients with a history of acute pancreatitis. Eenatide is contraindicated if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and renal function should be monitored with all GLP1-RAs, especially in patients with nausea and possible dehydration.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^113qLMDb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and significantly contribute to ongoing morbidity. For the past two decades, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended metformin as the first-line therapy for T2D, owing to its efficacy, affordability, weight neutrality, and benefits in cardiovascular outcomes as well as its potential role in slowing kidney disease progression. However, the latest 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, joint issued by ADA and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), also advocates for the inclusion of sodium-glucose -cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in all diabetes patients as part of the comprehensive approach to managing glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and renovascular risk. Specifically, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for all T2D patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) above 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to mitigate CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline HbA1c, or metformin use. These recommendations are particularly crucial for patients with multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, established ASCVD, or diabetic kidney disease.

Substantial evidence indicates that inadequate glycemic control within the initial years following T2D diagnosis is strongly correlated with a higher risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as increased mortality. This "glycemic legacy" effect, consistently observed in both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies, underscores the critical importance of selecting first-line medications or combination therapies for T2D that not only optimize glycemic control but also provide significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits.

In recent years, accumulating data has reinforced the benefits of metformin in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in patients with progressive CKD and eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless the 2022 joint ADA and KDIGO guidelines, while recognizing metformin's superior efficacy in glycemia control, highlight a reduced efficacy in cardiovascular and renal protection when compared with SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether metformin offers additional renal protection and survival benefits when combined with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the real-world impact of a combined metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors regimen, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone, on renal progression outcomes and all-cause mortality in T2D patients.
