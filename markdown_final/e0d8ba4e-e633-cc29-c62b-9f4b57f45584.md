## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM category code for Achilles tendinopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10-CM category code is for Achilles tendinopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the provided sources explicitly list an ICD-10-CM code for Achilles tendinopathy. Then, I should verify whether that code is indeed the category code and whether it includes laterality or other subcategories. Next, I will cross-check the code against authoritative guideline documents to confirm consistency. Finally, I will consider any nuances between "tendinitis", "tendinopathy", and "tendinosis" in ICD-10-CM and state the most precise answer I can justify from the references.

> Let me first confirm the direct source statement. Multiple APTA clinical practice guidelines consistently list ICD-10 code M76.6 with the descriptor "Achilles tendinitis/Achilles bursitis", and they map this code to the condition of Achilles tendinopathy in their classification frameworks, which supports using M76.6 for tendinopathy in routine coding contexts [^e14d9dbc] [^4e45cf76] [^4c776343].

> Wait, let me verify whether M76.6 is the category code or a specific billable code. ICD-10-CM uses M76.6 as the parent category for Achilles tendinitis and Achilles bursitis; in U.S. billing, clinicians typically report M76.6 and, when required, add laterality digits (e.g. M76.61 right, M76.62 left, M76.63 bilateral), but the core category for the condition is M76.6, which aligns with how the guidelines present it [^e14d9dbc] [^fb8d01f8] [^4c776343].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about terminology. I initially wondered if "tendinopathy" might map to a different code than "tendinitis", but the guidelines explicitly equate Achilles tendinopathy with ICD-10 M76.6, even though the ICD descriptor uses "tendinitis". This reflects that ICD-10-CM nomenclature lags behind contemporary clinical terminology, which favors "tendinopathy" over "tendinitis" unless inflammation is proven histologically, so M76.6 remains the correct ICD-10-CM category for Achilles tendinopathy in practice [^a63eac10] [^e14d9dbc] [^4e45cf76] [^4c776343].

> I should double-check consistency across versions. Both the original 2010 APTA guideline and the 2024 revision reiterate the same ICD-10 mapping of M76.6 for Achilles tendinopathy, which strengthens confidence that this is the standard category code used in U.S. clinical documentation and billing for this condition [^e14d9dbc] [^4c776343].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM category code for Achilles tendinopathy is M76.6, with the official descriptor "Achilles tendinitis/Achilles bursitis". When billing, add laterality as appropriate (e.g. M76.61 right, M76.62 left, M76.63 bilateral) [^e14d9dbc] [^4e45cf76] [^4c776343].

---

The ICD-10-CM category code for Achilles tendinopathy is **M76.6** (Achilles tendinitis/Achilles bursitis) [^e14d9dbc] [^4c776343]. This code encompasses both midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy, as well as associated bursitis. For more specific documentation, use **M76.61** for right, **M76.62** for left, and **M76.63** for bilateral involvement. Accurate coding supports clinical communication, billing, and research tracking of this common overuse condition [^439852f4].

## ICD-10-CM code for Achilles tendinopathy

The primary ICD-10-CM code for Achilles tendinopathy is **M76.6**, defined as "Achilles tendinitis/Achilles bursitis" [^e14d9dbc]. This code covers both midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy, as well as associated bursitis [^4c776343].

---

## Subcategories and laterality

ICD-10-CM provides subcategories to specify laterality, which is essential for accurate documentation and billing:

| **Code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| M76.61 | Achilles tendinitis, right |
| M76.62 | Achilles tendinitis, left |
| M76.63 | Achilles tendinitis, bilateral |

---

These subcategories ensure precise documentation of the affected side, which is crucial for clinical management and insurance claims [^fb8d01f8].

---

## Clinical relevance and implications

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding for Achilles tendinopathy has several **clinical and administrative implications**:

- **Clinical documentation**: Proper coding ensures clear communication among healthcare providers, facilitating coordinated care and treatment planning [^489ad2ef].
- **Billing and reimbursement**: Accurate coding is essential for appropriate billing and reimbursement from insurance providers, reducing the risk of claim denials or delays [^439852f4].
- **Research and epidemiology**: Consistent coding allows for accurate tracking of disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and the effectiveness of interventions [^b7ad7b35].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Achilles tendinopathy typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pain**: Localized pain in the Achilles tendon, often worsened by physical activity [^d341bca5].
- **Stiffness**: Morning stiffness or stiffness after periods of inactivity [^1fed8ab3].
- **Swelling**: Localized swelling or thickening of the tendon [^d27c36c6].
- **Tenderness**: Pain on palpation of the affected tendon [^a5c15a8c].

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history and physical examination, with imaging (ultrasound or MRI) reserved for uncertain cases or when complications are suspected [^9e103bf1] [^02434660].

---

## Treatment and management

Management of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily **conservative**, with a focus on:

- **Eccentric loading exercises**: Progressive tendon-loading exercises are first-line therapy [^a34c0bcd].
- **Physical therapy**: Modalities such as manual therapy, taping, and orthotics may be considered [^5cd6dcd6] [^93f4a175] [^833b57f6].
- **Patient education**: Counseling on activity modification and load management is essential [^ebe9fa21].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for refractory cases or when conservative measures fail [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM category code for Achilles tendinopathy is **M76.6**, with subcategories for laterality (M76.61, M76.62, M76.63). Accurate coding is essential for clinical documentation, billing, and research, and supports effective management of this common overuse condition [^e14d9dbc] [^4c776343].

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^cdd46db6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strength of this systematic review is that we performed this structured analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. Consequently, we were able to include 10 cohort studies, whereas a different systematic review on this topic only included one cohort study. That recent systematic review provided an excellent overview of all the literature considering genetic variants in AT, but important publications considering non-genetic risk factors in AT were missing. By including these cohort studies, our methods provide evidence that can be used directly in a clinical setting. We were also able to present an overview of topics on which future research should focus. Despite our robust research design, there are also methodological limitations. First, we only selected publications written in the English language. Second, we were not able to pool data because of the heterogeneity. The strength of the associations could therefore only be evaluated with a best evidence synthesis and not with meta-analysis. Third, we chose to use a standardised set of criteria based on modified questions of existing quality assessment tools. This was recommended by Hayden et al, since no validated tools are available for systematic reviews on risk factors. Our tool used strict criteria, primarily considering clinical examination as valid outcome measure (criterion 6). Four cohort studies did not meet this criterion of which three of these studies used International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes/search terms. The fourth study examined only runners with serious symptoms. These approaches to case-finding creates a bias. Furthermore, if this criterion would not be taken into account, the studies would still be considered to be of high risk of bias based on the other criteria. Fourth, the median age of the included cohort studies was 21 years due to the profession of most of the populations investigated. This is a relatively young age, since the mean age to develop AT is 30–60 years, and AT is therefore expected to be less common in these studies.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Guidelines and pathways for clinical practice in tendinopathy: their role and development [^19311804]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Tendinopathy has significant consequences for both the athletic population and, more importantly, those who exercise for health or engage in physical activity as part of their occupation. That we are now able to perform high-quality evidence syntheses based on robust primary evidence for a wide range of conditions and therapeutic approaches is a credit to the pioneers who have driven the evidence explosion, and an inspiration for those striving to emulate and build on their achievements. How do we take that evidence and apply it in the clinical setting to individual patients? How do we adjust our decision-making schema in response to the presented information and challenges?

### Acute achilles tendon ruptures between 2002–2021: sustained increased incidence, surgical decline and prolonged delay to surgery-a nationwide study of 53 688 ruptures in Sweden [^231e3aef]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Data were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Register (SNPR), a Swedish nationwide validated register which contains inpatient data since 1964 and outpatient data since 2001. Reporting data to the NPR is obligatory for all healthcare providers in Sweden, thus ensuring excellent national coverage. The NPR uses the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) system based on patient-specific identity numbers to categorise patient morbidity and mortality. Thus, any person in Sweden with a personal identity number and seeking healthcare for any reason will be included in the NPR. In the present study, all patients with an Achilles tendon rupture (coded as S860 in ICD-10) from 2002 to 2021, 18 years of age or older, were requested from the register for analyses. Year of birth, age at rupture and sex were also collected from the SNPR. The first occurrence of S860 was regarded as the index case. Any subsequent occurrences in the same patient after 365 days were considered a new rupture. Surgical treatment of ATR was identified by the surgical procedural codes NHL19, NHL49 and NGL49 according to the NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures Sweden. If any of these codes were recorded within 30 days in combination with S860, surgery was considered the primary treatment. TTS was defined as the days from the index case to the date when diagnostic and procedural codes were combined. This method was used to calculate the main results of TTS. Additionally, to explore potential influences of other primary diagnoses, difficulties in diagnosing ATR or misentries in the register, other ICD-10 diagnoses of other foot/ankle/lower limb pathologies registered within 14 days before the index case were examined for their impact on TTS. Twenty-two diagnostic codes were determined as relevant and were found in 986 (6.6%) of surgically treated patients. Fifty-four per cent of these patients (n = 529) were initially diagnosed with M663/-H/-G (spontaneous rupture of flexor tendons/… of the ankle/… lower limb), 13% (n = 131) were recorded as S932 (ruptured ligament in the foot), 10% (n = 100) received M796/-D (pain in the extremity/… non-specific in the lower leg), 7% (n = 66) as M662/-G/-H (spontaneous rupture of extensor tendon/… of the knee or lower leg/… of the ankle or foot), 4% (n = 42) as M665 (spontaneous rupture of unspecified tendon). Another 12 diagnostic codes were recorded, representing the remaining 12% (n = 118). The impact of a delay in ATR diagnosis is presented in a separate section in the results.

### Comparison of early postoperative outcomes and reimbursement metrics in obese versus nonobese patients undergoing secondary reconstruction for achilles tendinopathy [^cf37c012]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aims to evaluate whether obesity affects early postoperative outcomes or reimbursement metrics following surgical intervention for Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was done using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2013 to 2022). Patients undergoing secondary Achilles reconstruction were identified through Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases 9th/10th codes and were categorized as obese (body mass index ≥ 30) or nonobese (body mass index < 30). Demographic variables, comorbidities, 30-day postoperative complications, including mortality, readmission, revision surgery, wound complications, thromboembolic events, respiratory complications, infectious complications, renal complications, cardiac complications, and transfusion. The number of concurrent procedures and work relative value unit (wRVU)-based compensation metrics were compared between the two groups. An analysis of covariance was done to adjust the effect of patient demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and perioperative complications on the valuation of compensation metrics.

Results

Six hundred eighty-eight patients met inclusion criteria: 505 (73.4%) were obese and 183 (26.6%) were nonobese. Obese patients had markedly higher rates of comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension. No notable differences were found between the two groups in any of the early postoperative complication rates we investigated. The number of concurrent procedures per case was markedly higher in the obese group: 1.2 vs. 1.0, P = 0.015. Regarding compensation metrics, wRVU/hr, and reimbursement ($/hr) were comparable between the groups after analysis of covariance: 14.6 wRVU/hr and 473.82 $/hr for the obese group versus 13.5 and 435.2 for the nonobese group, P = 0.131, respectively.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that secondary reconstruction for Achilles tendinopathy can be done safely in obese patients without increasing short-term postoperative complication rates. Compensation metrics remained comparable between the obese and nonobese groups, indicating that the increased preoperative burden and surgical demands in obese patients may not be matched by a proportional increase in reimbursement.

Module 2 diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

How is Achilles tendinopathy diagnosed?

The scoping question includes the following two subquestions

What are the criteria for diagnosing Achilles tendinopathy?
Which differential diagnoses of posterior ankle pain should be considered and which underlying pathology might be related to Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Achilles tendinopathy is often diagnosed based on clinical findings. When a healthcare provider is confronted with posterior ankle pain suggestive of Achilles tendinopathy, several differential diagnoses should be considered. Imaging can be added to aid the diagnostic process. In most cases, Achilles tendinopathy is suggested to be caused by overload, but it can also be related to other (systemic) disorders. Recognition of these disorders is important, because different causes of Achilles tendinopathy might require different treatment strategies. It is important to know how to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy and which differential diagnoses and possible related disorders should be considered. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 2.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Diagnose midportion Achilles tendinopathy based on the presence of all the following findings:

Symptoms localised 2–7 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion.
Painful Achilles tendon midportion on (sports) loading.
Local thickening of the Achilles tendon midportion (this may be absent in cases with short symptom duration).
Pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon midportion.

Diagnose insertional Achilles tendinopathy based on the presence of all the following findings:

Symptoms localised to the Achilles tendon insertional region (within 2 cm of the insertion of the Achilles tendon).
Painful Achilles tendon insertional region on (sports) loading.
Local thickening of the Achilles tendon insertion (this may be absent in cases with short symptom duration).
Pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon insertion.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^a63eac10]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy — terminology and anatomical focus — states that the terms "tendinitis" or "tendinosis" may be misleading and "should be replaced with 'tendinopathy', unless histological evidence has proven otherwise", and that terminology "should be tissue specific". Achilles tendinopathy is "frequently described at 2 anatomical locations: (1) midportion (2–6 cm proximal to the insertion) of the tendon and (2) calcaneal insertion", with midportion cases "the most common", and therefore "disorders of the midportion of the tendon described as 'Achilles tendinopathy' will be the focus of this clinical guideline unless otherwise stated".

Materials and methods

Patients were identified by searching the hospitals electronic admission record using the code for Achilles tendon rupture (S86.0) from the international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). Patients aged 18–60 treated for acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon from 2010 until 2013 were considered eligible for inclusion, and a total of 155 patients gave consent for participation in the study (Fig. 1). There is no consensus regarding sample size calculations for the validation of PROMs, but we adhered to a recommended minimum of 50 patients. The questionnaires ATRS, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) version 2 were completed online by logging on to a secured server. Patients who completed the questionnaires incorrectly were excluded from the study. Patients, who failed to complete the second set of questionnaires within four to eight weeks of completing the first set of questionnaires, were excluded from test–retest analysis. Patients reporting a change in their condition between completing the two sets of questionnaires were also excluded from test–retest analysis.

### Diagnostic imaging for achilles tendinopathy: unnecessary scans? Valuable insights? Multidisciplinary clinician-scientists present a nuanced view [^3cb6db07]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Clinical practice guidelines for Achilles tendinopathy do not recommend imaging to inform diagnosis. However, there is considerable variation in how imaging is used, particularly in research and sports. Early imaging risks that people who see the images presume that what they "see" as pathology is the primary cause of pain; patients might end up receiving invasive treatments on the basis of the image when rehabilitation may suffice. On the other hand, imaging can help rule out Achilles tendinopathy and identify differential diagnoses. As more rehabilitation clinicians are direct access practitioners and take on expanded roles as primary health practitioners, ultrasound imaging might serve as a valuable point-of-care tool for diagnosis, identifying conditions that warrant referral and managing conditions like Achilles tendinopathy. We argue that the value of ultrasound imaging to diagnose tendinopathy outweighs the potential limitations. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(1):1–4.

### Achilles tendinopathy: a review of the current concepts of treatment [^cb1175b7]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The two main categories of Achilles tendon disorder are broadly classified by anatomical location to include non-insertional and insertional conditions. Non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy is often managed conservatively, and many rehabilitation protocols have been adapted and modified, with excellent clinical results. Emerging and popular alternative therapies, including a variety of injections and extracorporeal shockwave therapy, are often combined with rehabilitation protocols. Surgical approaches have developed, with minimally invasive procedures proving popular. The management of insertional Achilles tendinopathy is improved by recognising coexisting pathologies around the insertion. Conservative rehabilitation protocols as used in non-insertional disorders are thought to prove less successful, but such methods are being modified, with improving results. Treatment such as shockwave therapy is also proving successful. Surgical approaches specific to the diagnosis are constantly evolving, and good results have been achieved.

General introduction

Background to this guideline

Sports medicine was finally recognised as a clinical medical specialty in Holland in 2014. Following this recognition, the Dutch Association of Sports Medicine could apply for funding to develop clinical guidelines. This guideline is the result of a successful funding application and was produced according to the official process. This is very similar to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence process in the UK. Achilles tendinopathy was chosen as it is common in clinical practice, seriously impacts patients and there is a significant body of scientific literature on the subject.

An Achilles tendon injury is a frequent problem in both active athletes and inactive individuals. In athletes, this may be caused by the external load being too high and in inactive individuals relative overload may be caused by a very low baseline capacity. In Dutch general practice, Achilles tendon symptoms occur in 2–3 per 1000 adult patients. Runners have a 52% chance (cumulative incidence) of having an Achilles tendon injury in their lifetime. The symptoms are often longstanding and lead to disability, thus being the main reason that people present to clinical practice.

The terminology used to describe and diagnose tendon injuries has changed in recent decades. According to the current consensus, local pain in a tendon in association with tendon-loading activities is referred to as 'tendinopathy'. The use of clear unambiguous terminology is important because it ensures clear communication between healthcare providers and reduces the risk of confusing patients.

The exact pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy is still unknown; it is thought to have a multifactorial origin. A better understanding of risk factors can help develop more effective (preventive) interventions.

The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is usually made using clinical findings. The exact diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently described. The role of imaging in making a diagnosis is also not agreed on. In addition, there are a number of (systemic) conditions that should be considered in patients with pain in the Achilles tendon region. Recognition of these disorders by healthcare providers is important, as this strongly affects treatment and prognosis.

### Increased incidence of acute achilles tendon ruptures in the peri-pandemic COVID era with parallels to the 2021–22 NFL season [^2fe820dd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute Achilles tendon ruptures (AATRs) are a common sporting injury, whether for recreational athletes or elite athletes. Prior research has shown returning to physical activity after extended periods of inactivity leads to increased rates of musculoskeletal injuries. The purpose of this study was to investigate rates of acute Achilles' tendon ruptures at a single academic institute in the peri-COVID era, with corollary to the recent NFL season.

Methods

A retrospective search was conducted using current procedural terminology to identify the total number of Achilles acute primary repair surgeries performed from years 2017 to 2021. Non-operatively managed AATRs were identified from the same electronic medical record using ICD-10 codes. NFL data were obtained from publicly available sites according to previously validated studies.

Results

A total of 588 patients who sustained AATRs and underwent primary surgical repair were identified, primarily men (75.7%, n = 445), with an average age of 43.22 ± 14.4 years. The number and corresponding incidence of AATR repairs per year was: 2017: n = 124 (21.1%), 2018: n = 110 (18.7%), 2019: n = 130 (22.1%), 2020: n = 86 (14.6%), 2021: n = 138 (23.5%), indicating a 7.5% decrease in rate of AATRs from 2019 to 2020, followed by an 8.9% increase in incidence from 2020 to 2021. Within the NFL, the number of AATRs resulting in an injured reserve stint increased every regular season from 2019 to 2020: n = 11 (21.2%), to 2020–2021: n = 17 (32.7%), to this past 2021–2022 season: n = 24 (46.2%).

Conclusion

AATR surgeries seem to have increased in 2021 following a 2020 COVID pandemic-induced quarantine for recreational athletes at a single academic institution and for professional athletes in the NFL, although these results are of questionable clinical significance. This provides prognostic information when counseling patients and athletes on return to activity or sport.

### Revisiting the continuum model of tendon pathology: what is its merit in clinical practice and research? [^6f5c4aca]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of tendinopathy and the primary biological change in the tendon that precipitates pathology have generated several pathoaetiological models in the literature. The continuum model of tendon pathology, proposed in 2009, synthesised clinical and laboratory-based research to guide treatment choices for the clinical presentations of tendinopathy. While the continuum has been cited extensively in the literature, its clinical utility has yet to be fully elucidated. The continuum model proposed a model for staging tendinopathy based on the changes and distribution of disorganisation within the tendon. However, classifying tendinopathy based on structure in what is primarily a pain condition has been challenged. The interplay between structure, pain and function is not yet fully understood, which has partly contributed to the complex clinical picture of tendinopathy. Here we revisit and assess the merit of the continuum model in the context of new evidence. We (1) summarise new evidence in tendinopathy research in the context of the continuum, (2) discuss tendon pain and the relevance of a model based on structure and (3) describe relevant clinical elements (pain, function and structure) to begin to build a better understanding of the condition. Our goal is that the continuum model may help guide targeted treatments and improved patient outcomes.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^8dfeac22]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the 2007 Dutch guideline, the patient group in this guideline included both active and sedentary people. This guideline also includes identification of patients with a systemic cause of tendinopathy, for example, an enthesitis because of a rheumatic disease or a tendon xanthoma as a result of familial hypercholesterolaemia. However, the major clinical questions in the guideline will not be covered specifically for these uncommon patient groups. This guideline is not intended for patients younger than 18. Achilles tendon symptoms in patients under the age of 18 are usually caused by extra-articular osteochondrosis (Morbus Sever or Sever's disease). Complete Achilles tendon ruptures are also excluded from this guideline.

The current challenges in practice and key outcome measures have been identified in collaboration with patients who have been diagnosed with Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently no specific patient association for Achilles tendinopathy. We initially formed a patient panel (n = 9), collecting information on which challenges in practice they had experienced. In this analysis, six challenges in practice were prioritised, which were developed into the guideline modules:

There is insufficient knowledge about the causes of Achilles tendinopathy and what can be done to prevent it.
The criteria for determining the diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy are not sufficiently known.
The role of imaging in Achilles tendinopathy is unclear.
There is insufficient knowledge about the natural course and which treatments should be used for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
There is a lack of knowledge about the long-term prognosis in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
There is a lack of knowledge about preventing recurrent symptoms after recovery from Achilles tendinopathy.

A national survey was then launched in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation. Ninety-seven patients with Achilles tendinopathy responded to this digital questionnaire. A total of 85 (88%) of these patients described their treatment aims. The most common aims were: participation in sports without mentioning pain status (36%), pain-free sports participation (27%), pain-free functioning in activities of daily living (ADL) (22%), pain reduction without further specification and restoration of function in ADL without specific mentioning pain status.

A scoping literature review of tendinopathy studies (Achilles, patellar, hamstring, gluteal and elbow) was followed by an online survey and face-to-face consensus meeting with expert healthcare professionals (HCPs) at the International Scientific Tendon Symposium, Groningen 2018. We reviewed 263 papers to form statements for consensus and invited 30 HCPs from different disciplines and geographical locations; 28 completed the survey and 15 attended the meeting. There was consensus that the following data should be reported for cases and controls: sex, age, standing height, body mass, history of tendinopathy, whether imaging was used to confirm pathology, loading tests, pain location, symptom duration and severity, level of disability, comorbidities, physical activity level, recruitment source and strategies, and medication use history. Standardised reporting of participant characteristics aims to benefit patients and clinicians by guiding researchers in the conduct of their studies.

Achilles tendinopathy imaging — imaging is not required to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy but is recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, there is a delayed response to care, or when invasive treatments are being considered; increased tendon thickness is common (present in 73% of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy) yet not specific because up to a quarter of asymptomatic adults have increased Achilles tendon thickness. Ultrasound, including B-mode, Doppler, and elastography, is the recommended imaging method by the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline, while for ankle pain in general radiographs are the first-line imaging method according to the American College of Radiology; if radiographs are normal and tendon abnormality is suspected, American College of Radiology guidelines recommend ultrasound or MRI without IV contrast, and MRI is commonly reserved for specific situations such as surgical planning. The 2024 summary states that imaging, in the form of ultrasound and radiographs, or MRI, is recommended when there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, if there is a delayed recovery, if there is negative change in symptoms over the course of care, or if a procedure is being considered.

The following constitutes key background information on Achilles tendinopathy:

- **Definition**: Achilles tendinopathy is a non-rupture injury of the Achilles tendon characterized by pain, swelling, and reduced performance, with symptoms often exacerbated by physical activity.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy involves a continuum from reactive tendinopathy, where tenocytes proliferate and protein production increases, leading to tendon thickening, to tendon disrepair with further increase in tenocytes and protein production and focal collagen fiber disruption, and finally to degenerative tendinopathy involving cell death, large areas of collagen disorganization, and areas filled with vessels and nerves.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy in the US is estimated at 235 per 100,000 person-years in the general population aged 21–60 years. Annually, 7–9% of runners experience Achilles tendinopathy.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy include a higher BMI, a history of tendinopathy or fracture, increased alcohol consumption, reduced plantar flexion strength, a high weekly volume of running, prolonged years of running, the use of spiked or shock-absorbing shoes, training in cold weather, and abnormal ankle dorsiflexion ROM. Other risk factors include male sex, the use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and fluoroquinolones.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with Achilles tendinopathy present with symptoms localized 2–7 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion, painful Achilles tendon midportion on loading, local thickening of the Achilles tendon midportion, and pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon midportion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy can vary widely among individuals, but generally, the condition is manageable with appropriate treatment.

### Is tendon pathology a continuum? A pathology model to explain the clinical presentation of load-induced tendinopathy [^a67f6c14]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Overuse tendinopathy is problematic to manage clinically. People of different ages with tendons under diverse loads present with varying degrees of pain, irritability, and capacity to function. Recovery is similarly variable; some tendons recover with simple interventions, some remain resistant to all treatments. The pathology of tendinopathy has been described as degenerative or failed healing. Neither of these descriptions fully explains the heterogeneity of presentation. This review proposes, and provides evidence for, a continuum of pathology. This model of pathology allows rational placement of treatments along the continuum. A new model of tendinopathy and thoughtful treatment implementation may improve outcomes for those with tendinopathy. This model is presented for evaluation by clinicians and researchers.

Data synthesis

A subgroup analysis was initially planned for insertional and midportion AT; however, we revised the PROSPERO protocol (revision date 20 July 2017) because a substantial number of publications did not specify the AT location. Homogeneity of the data was evaluated, and if data could not be pooled because of heterogeneity, a best evidence synthesis based on the study of van Tulder et al was carried out for each potential risk factor.
Strong evidence: ≥ 2 studies with high quality and generally consistent findings in all studies (≥ 75% of the studies reported consistent findings).
Moderate evidence: one high-quality study and ≥ 2 low-quality studies and generally consistent results (≥ 75% of the studies reported consistent findings).
Limited evidence: generally consistent findings in ≥ 1 low-quality study (≥ 75% of the studies reported consistent findings).
Conflicting evidence: < 75% of the studies reporting consistent findings.
No evidence: no studies could be found.

Data analysis

Closed-ended questions

All data (online supplemental files 1 and 2) were exported into Microsoft Excel (V.2209, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). For the PT survey, personal demographics, professional demographics, and AT management characteristics were summarised with descriptive statistics (eg, counts and percentages, means, and SD). Practice patterns were narratively compared with CPGsto assess alignment; specifically, comparisons were made between CPG recommendations and management and monitoring strategies, as well as specifics related to therapeutic exercise programming. To better contextualise survey results, the American and Dutch CPGs were assessed using the AGREE Global Rating Scale(online supplemental file 3). For the survey of people with AT, personal demographics, Achilles injury history, and AT management history were summarised with descriptive statistics (eg, counts and percentages, means, and SD). For the barrier and facilitator questions, mean scores were calculated for the six COM-B domains. Most questions were positively framed indicating that a higher score denoted higher capability, opportunity, or motivation among people with AT. Two questions were negatively framed and were reverse coded prior to calculating mean scores.

Open-ended questions

Data were independently coded into the six COM-B domains in blocks of 50 participants by two researchers (KM and MMM)using the COM-B domains and definitions as a coding framework (see online supplemental appendix E). The operationalisation of codes for this manuscript was a single word or concept; additional information in the form of example responses for a specific code can be found in online supplemental appendix E. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus meetings, and the coding manual was refined. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Values between 0.61 and 0.80 are considered substantial agreement and values exceeding 0.80 are considered almost perfect agreement.

Examining the evolution of the terminology over the years, the efforts and the struggle are obvious. Some terms represent a disease, some an anatomic location, a pathology, or a generic name. The reasoning behind a change in terminology is unclear; it appears to be largely susceptible to fashion. In the 19th century, the terminology was mainly based on anatomy; later, it was based on histopathology; others have proposed a 'history'-based terminology.

Five leading anatomy journals were contacted, and asked for information on which terminology they demanded from their authors. Based on the answers, it can be concluded that, concerning anatomy, there is no such thing as a "standard terminology". Some stated that the authors were expected to use "widely accepted terminology".

The definitions for Achilles tendon disorders should comprise anatomic location, symptoms, clinical findings, and histopathology. The term to represent the entity must be neutral yet descriptive, uniform and clear. The aforementioned lack of consistency should be avoided as much as possible. The following definitions are therefore proposed (Table 1).

Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy

Achilles tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of pain, swelling and impaired performance. The swelling can be diffuse or localized. Typically, the nodular swelling is located at 2–7 cm from the insertion onto the calcaneus. This part of the tendon has also been described as the "main body of the Achilles tendon". This entity involves isolated pathology of the tendon proper, and includes, but is not limited to, the histopathological diagnosis of tendinosis.

Tendinosis implies histopathological diagnosis of tendon degeneration without clinical or histological signs of intratendinous inflammation, and is not necessarily symptomatic. However, it should be kept in mind that, although the histological term 'tendinosis' is also widely used, the essential lesion of tendinopathy is not, strictu sensu, of a degenerative nature: it has the features of a failed healing response, in which the tendon attempts to heal, but, for some reason, including, possibly, continuous inappropriate mechanical stimuli, the healing process appears non-finalised.

### Should we care about tendon structure? The disconnect between structure and symptoms in tendinopathy [^b5513b55]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

We can visualize tendons better than ever before. Medical imaging today provides increasingly higher-resolution images, enabling larger fields of view that allow clinicians and researchers to more precisely characterize tendon structure. Yet, does seeing a patient's tendon provide any meaningful benefit to our clinical reasoning, and will it make a difference to treatment outcomes? It is little surprise that concomitant with this imaging availability is a renewed debate over the relationship between the appearance of tendon structure and symptomology. Despite the advances in medical imaging, as well as the clinical and research interest in tendinopathy, there does not appear to be any greater clarity on reconciling a patient's clinical presentation with either baseline characterization of structural abnormalities or the time series of changes following selected interventions. It may be helpful, therefore, to take a step back and give renewed consideration to the anatomical and physiological role of tendon structure, and to consider this in the context of what we know about tendon pathology.

### Injection therapies for achilles tendinopathy [^76113536]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition, often with significant functional consequences. As a wide range of injection treatments are available, a review of randomised trials evaluating injection therapies to help inform treatment decisions is warranted.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injection therapies for people with Achilles tendinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 20 April 2015: the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. We also searched trial registers (29 May 2014) and reference lists of articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating injection therapies in adults with an investigator-reported diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. We accepted comparison arms of placebo (sham) or no injection control, or other active treatment (such as physiotherapy, pharmaceuticals or surgery). Our primary outcomes were function, using measures such as the VISA-A (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire), and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed treatment effects using mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous variables and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for dichotomous variables. For follow-up data, we defined short-term as up to six weeks, medium-term as up to three months and longer-term as data beyond three months. We performed meta-analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (732 participants). Seven trials exclusively studied athletic populations. The mean ages of the participants in the individual trials ranged from 20 years to 50 years. Fifteen trials compared an injection therapy with a placebo injection or no injection control, four trials compared an injection therapy with active treatment, and one compared two different concentrations of the same injection. Thus no trials compared different injection therapies. Two studies had three trial arms and we included them twice in two different categories. Within these categories, we further subdivided injection therapies by mode of action (injury-causing versus direct repair agents). The risk of bias was unclear (due to poor reporting) or high in six trials published between 1987 and 1994. Improved methodology and reporting for the subsequent trials published between 2004 and 2013 meant that these were at less risk of bias. Given the very low quality evidence available from each of four small trials comparing different combinations of injection therapy versus active treatment and the single trial comparing two doses of one injection therapy, only the results of the first comparison (injection therapy versus control) are presented. There is low quality evidence of a lack of significant or clinically important differences in VISA-A scores (0 to 100: best function) between injection therapy and control groups at six weeks (MD 0.79, 95% CI -4.56 to 6.14; 200 participants, five trials), three months (MD -0.94, 95% CI -6.34 to 4.46; 189 participants, five trials) or between six and 12 months (MD 0.14, 95% CI -6.54 to 6.82; 132 participants, three trials). Very low quality evidence from 13 trials showed little difference between the two groups in adverse events (14/243 versus 12/206; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.89), most of which were minor and short-lasting. The only major adverse event in the injection therapy group was an Achilles tendon rupture, which happened in a trial testing corticosteroid injections. There was very low quality evidence in favour of the injection therapy group in short-term (under three months) pain (219 participants, seven trials) and in the return to sports (335 participants, seven trials). There was very low quality evidence indicating little difference between groups in patient satisfaction with treatment (152 participants, four trials). There was insufficient evidence to conclude on subgroup differences based on mode of action given that only two trials tested injury-causing agents and the clear heterogeneity of the other 13 trials, which tested seven different therapies that act directly on the repair pathway.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions on the use, or to support the routine use, of injection therapies for treating Achilles tendinopathy. This review has highlighted a need for definitive research in the area of injection therapies for Achilles tendinopathy, including in older non-athletic populations. This review has shown that there is a consensus in the literature that placebo-controlled trials are considered the most appropriate trial design.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend to perform a physical examination to elicit the following:

- pain on palpation of the tendon and the subjective report of pain in the midportion (2–6 cm above the calcaneal insertion) for diagnosing midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- location of pain on palpation for distinguishing between an insertional or midportion injury and for the differential diagnosis; greater pain on palpation anterior to the tendon than in the tendon itself is suggestive of posterior ankle impingement or os trigonum syndrome; posterior ankle pain differential diagnosis also includes acute Achilles tendon rupture, accessory soleus muscle, sural nerve irritation, fat-pad irritation, and systemic inflammatory disease

- the arc sign - palpation of tendon identifying thickened nodules - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- the Royal London Hospital test - pinching the tendon to identify the most symptomatic location with the foot at rest - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

### Impact of chronic achilles tendinopathy on health-related quality of life, work performance, healthcare utilisation and costs [^f2c5a347]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The term Achilles tendinopathy (AT) entails the clinical triad of localised Achilles tendon pain, tendon thickening and impaired load-bearing capacity. AT is frequently observed in middle-aged, physically active people. The incidence rate of AT is 2–3 per 1000 Dutch general practice registered patients and has risen in the past decade, probably as a result of an increasing amount of people performing sports activities. Various treatment options are available and conservative treatment is the primary treatment of choice, but is not very effective. Despite treatment, two-thirds of the patients with new-onset AT remain symptomatic at 1-year follow-up. At 10-year follow-up, still a quarter of the patients remain symptomatic.

The restricting pain and impaired load-bearing capacity associated with AT is assumed to decrease quality of life (QoL). Indeed, recent qualitative studies showed that some patients with AT describe profound impact on their life (eg, their identity, social activities and perceived levels of fitness). One of these exploratory studies showed that AT is associated with a lower QoL score compared with normative data. In this study, however, patients were included online without verifying the diagnosis of AT and the QoL scores were not compared with other musculoskeletal diseases. Additionally, a significant number of patients did not have AT at the time of inclusion, but experienced symptoms suggestive for AT in the past. This could have resulted in recall bias. Other musculoskeletal conditions also affect QoL, with the magnitude of this impact varying among the conditions. It is important to be informed about the magnitude of the impact on QoL of specific diseases to be aware of the urgency on scientific agendas and it also aids in designing management plans when there is knowledge of the specific domains affected. This information is unknown in AT. Knowledge of the impact of AT on work performance, healthcare utilisation and costs is currently also lacking.

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact on QoL in conservatively treated patients with chronic midportion AT. The secondary aims are to assess the effect of AT on (1) work performance, (2) healthcare utilisation and (3) estimated direct and indirect costs. We hypothesised the impact and socioeconomic consequences of AT on QoL to be similar to other musculoskeletal conditions (such as lateral epicondylar tendinopathy, knee osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic back pain).

### Not all tendons are created equal: implications for differing treatment approaches [^ceced0d0]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of muscles have distinct tendinous attachments to bones; however, only a few tendons develop painful conditions. That simple observation prompts us to ask a few questions. Are there commonalities in morphology and pathology among the painful tendons? What contributes to the propensity for pathology in some, but not all, tendons? And, consequently, should all tendinopathies be managed equally? Two common tendinopathies are those affecting the Achilles and supraspinatus, which are presented in this special issue and serve as excellent models to discuss similarities and contrasts.

### Diagnostic domains, differential diagnosis and conditions requiring further medical attention that are considered important in the assessment for achilles tendinopathy: a Delphi consensus study [^4fdd05c8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The absence of agreed methods to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy impedes research and clinical practice. This gap results in heterogeneous and/or poorly described study samples, making it challenging to apply findings in clinical practice. The aim of this Delphi study was to define consensus on (1) diagnostic domains; (2) differential diagnoses; and (3) conditions requiring further medical attention, when assessing for Achilles tendinopathy. We conducted a sequential three-stage process which included: (1) identifying diagnostic domains, differential diagnoses and conditions requiring further medical attention based on existing scoping reviews and clinical practice guidelines; (2) developing Delphi survey questions; and (3) administering a five-round Delphi online survey. Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement.52 participants completed the surveys. Four diagnostic domains were deemed essential and reached consensus (pain location (93%); pain during activity (97%); tests that provoke pain (87%); palpation to assess pain (83%)). 15 differential diagnoses reached consensus: 2 for both midportion and insertional (partial tear (80%); posterior ankle impingement (78%)), 6 for midportion (plantaris tendinopathy (84%); tibialis posterior or flexor hallucis longus tendinopathy/tenosynovitis (72%); flexor digitorum longus tendinopathy (77%); accessory soleus muscle (74%); paratendinopathy (86%); sural nerve neuropathy (81%)) and 7 for insertional (superficial (88%) and retrocalcaneal bursitis (86%); Haglund's/calcaneal exostosis (80%), intratendinous calcifications (73%); Sever's disease (78%); calcaneal stress reaction/fracture (80%); subtalar/ankle pain (71%)). Six conditions requiring further medical attention reached consensus: (Achilles tendon rupture (83%); systemic inflammatory joint disease (86%); metabolic syndrome (75%); familial hypercholesterolaemia (77%); endocrine and hormonal disorders (80%); drug reactions (77%)). This consensus identified essential diagnostic domains, differential diagnoses and conditions requiring further medical attention that should be considered when assessing for Achilles tendinopathy.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^166976f9]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy — clinical course and symptom duration: Recovery time can vary from brief to many months and is probably dependent on injury severity and intrinsic factors, with mixed levels of recovery anticipated. Evidence indicates that individuals with acute midportion Achilles tendinopathy (≤ 3 months duration) had a similar level of improvement as those with chronic symptoms categorized as ≥ 3 to < 6 months, between ≥ 6 months and < 12 months, and ≥ 12 months, suggesting symptom duration may not be a key factor in predicting the response to tendon loading exercise. Symptom irritability can be a specifically relevant factor; aggressive high tendon loading programs may be poorly tolerated early for individuals with high symptom irritability, and progressive loading programs that consider total loading throughout the day may be ways to achieve increased loading as symptom irritability changes with treatment.

### ICON 2023: international scientific tendinopathy symposium consensus-the core outcome set for achilles tendinopathy (COS-AT) using a systematic review and a Delphi study of professional participants and patients [^f56a376e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To develop a core outcome set for Achilles tendinopathy (COS-AT) for use in clinical trials we performed a five-step process including (1) a systematic review of available outcome measurement instruments, (2) an online survey on truth and feasibility of the available measurement instruments, (3) an assessment of the methodological quality of the selected outcome measurement instruments, (4) an online survey on the outcome measurement instruments as COS and (5) a consensus in-person meeting. Both surveys were completed by healthcare professionals and patients. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology guidelines with a 70% threshold for consensus were followed. We identified 233 different outcome measurement instruments from 307 included studies; 177 were mapped within the International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium Consensus core domains. 31 participants (12 patients) completed the first online survey (response rate 94%). 22/177 (12%) outcome measurement instruments were deemed truthful and feasible and their measurement properties were evaluated. 29 participants (12 patients) completed the second online survey (response rate 88%) and three outcome measurement instruments were endorsed: the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles questionnaire, the single-leg heel rise test and evaluating pain after activity using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0–10). 12 participants (1 patient) attended the final consensus meeting, and 1 additional outcome measurement instrument was endorsed: evaluating pain during activity/loading using a VAS (0–10). It is recommended that the identified COS-AT will be used in future clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention. This will facilitate comparing outcomes of intervention strategies, data pooling and further progression of knowledge about AT. As COS-AT is implemented, further evidence on measurement properties of included measures and new outcome measurement instruments should lead to its review and refinement.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy — examination outline and core outcomes: To assist with the collection of body structure limitation measures, the authors of the 2024 CPG recommend the components of the foot and ankle specific examination outlined in the Heel Pain–Plantar Fasciitis Revision, and a Core Outcome Set for Achilles tendinopathy has been recommended that includes the VISA-A, the single-leg heel rise endurance test, and movement-evoked pain with tendon loading activities. Movement-evoked pain can be assessed during and after tendon loading activities by asking individuals to rate pain in the Achilles tendon on the Verbal Numeric Rating Scale of 0–10. Joint mobility assessment when deficits are identified and a comprehensive lower quarter screen can be performed if needed based on the individual's presentation.

### Everything achilles: knowledge update and current concepts in management: AAOS exhibit selection [^9a026bb3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Achilles tendon pathology is common and affects athletes and nonathletes alike. The cause is multifactorial and controversial, involving biological, anatomical, and mechanical factors. A variety of conditions characterized by Achilles tendon inflammation and/or degeneration can be clinically and histologically differentiated. These include insertional Achilles tendinopathy, retrocalcaneal bursitis, Achilles paratenonitis, Achilles tendinosis, and Achilles paratenonitis with tendinosis. The mainstay of treatment for all of these diagnoses is nonoperative. There is a large body of evidence addressing treatment of acute and chronic Achilles tendon ruptures; however, controversy remains.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

We corrected this secondary outcome measure for symptom duration, thereby displaying work performance outcome measures on an annual basis.

Healthcare utilisation was expressed in the total annual number of healthcare visits, the type of healthcare provider and the type of treatment. Participants who reported visiting a healthcare provider, but could not specify the number of visits or treatments, were recorded as missing data. Participants who reported visiting a sports medicine physician or orthopaedic surgeon were assumed to have at least one consultation with a general practitioner (GP), as a referral from a GP to a medical specialist (eg, sports physician or orthopaedic surgeon) is required in the Netherlands. Participants who reported treatment with a certain number of injections, but did not specify the number of visits to a medical specialist, were assumed to have an equal number of visits to a medical specialist as the number of injections.

We divided costs into two categories: direct costs as a result of medical consumption and indirect costs as a result of lost working days or decreased work productivity. The direct medical costs were calculated with the following formula: total number of visits/treatments multiplied with estimated medical costs for those visits/treatments. In 2016, the Dutch Healthcare Authority published a guideline for economic evaluations in healthcare. Using this guideline, we established medical costs per visit/treatment and estimated productivity costs per hour at €34.75 (US$38.57) per person. Costs used for the economic evaluation are specified in online supplemental file 1. Costs in dollars were calculated using the average exchange rate of the respective study period. We did not register the profession of the patients and therefore did not adjust the costs for type of profession. Indirect costs were calculated by lost working days/work productivity multiplied by the costs per working day. Costs per working day were calculated using the productivity costs per hour. To calculate indirect costs due to a decrease in work productivity, we estimated reduced productivity without sickness absence at 1.0 hour per month. This is based on previous research on self-reported productivity loss in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. The annual direct and indirect costs were adjusted for symptom duration because we asked patients about these costs during their symptomatic period.

### Psoriasis and the risk of foot and ankle tendinopathy or enthesopathy in the absence of psoriatic arthritis: a population-based study [^3c776ed7]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

All patients were followed until the earliest of (a) development of foot and ankle tendinopathy or enthesopathy (main outcome), (b) transfer out of practice, (c) death or (d) end of data collection period. Patients who did not have a record of tendinopathy or enthesopathy during this follow-up period were censored. Development of foot and ankle tendinopathy or enthesopathy was defined based on the presence of any Read code relating to tendinopathy or enthesopathy of the foot and ankle. Read codes that were determined to relate to foot and ankle tendinopathy and enthesopathy were identified as follows: first, all Read codes relating to tendinopathy or enthesopathy were identified. This list was then reviewed independently by a rheumatologist and orthopaedic surgeon, where consensus was established on which codes would properly capture tendinopathy or enthesopathy specific to the foot and ankle. While enthesitis is the more common outcome for patients with psoriatic arthritis, tendinopathy was included to broaden our definition since this also occurs in psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, since clinically defining tendon injury as tendinopathy versus enthesopathy is dependent only on the point along the tendon at which the injury occurs, we considered both terms in our analysis in hopes of improved sensitivity, given not all patients with tendon pain may have imaging to confirm where along the tendon the injury was to classify them as enthesopathy or tendinopathy. Read codes used in our analysis for foot and ankle tendinopathy or enthesopathy can be found in table 1.

### Medical comorbidities increase the rate of surgical site infection in primary achilles tendon repair [^983e2028]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effects of medical comorbidities on the incidence of surgical site infection following primary Achilles tendon repair. A secondary aim was to assess the effects of specific medical comorbidities on the cost and extent of healthcare utilization related to surgical site infection following primary Achilles tendon repair.

Methods

24,269 patients undergoing primary Achilles tendon repair between 2005 and 2012 were examined. Current Procedural Terminology codes for primary Achilles tendon repair, and incision and drainage were used to search for and compile patient data from the United Healthcare Orthopedic and Medicare databases. Primary outcome measures regarding surgical site infection following primary Achilles tendon repair included the rate of occurrence, cost, and duration of treatment.

Results

Patients with one or more preexisting medical comorbidities at the time of surgery had an increased rate of surgical site infection compared to those without. Diabetes and vascular complications were associated with the highest surgical site infection rates. The rate of surgical incision and drainage was higher in patients with cardiac arrhythmias and uncomplicated hypertension. The presence of a medical comorbidity significantly increased the cost and duration of surgical site infection treatment.

Conclusions

Medical comorbidities can complicate the postoperative course for patients undergoing Achilles tendon repair, which increases the cost of care and duration of treatment. A better understanding of the relationship between each medical comorbidity and surgical site infections following Achilles tendon repair may be ascertained with additional prospective studies, thus, allowing for a more accurate evaluation and stratification of surgical candidates to improve patient outcomes.

Level Of Evidence

Retrospective cohort study, Level III.

### Impact of chronic achilles tendinopathy on health-related quality of life, work performance, healthcare utilisation and costs [^07bbf8cd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study is one of the first studies to evaluate the impact of AT on QoL, work performance, healthcare utilisation and estimated direct and indirect costs. To assess the impact of AT on QoL, we used the reliable and validated EQ-5D questionnaire. Data were complete for our primary outcome and were retrieved from a homogeneous group of clinically diagnosed patients with AT. However, there are some limitations to this study. We asked patients about the duration of their symptoms and applied treatments retrospectively, which could have induced recall bias on these specific items. This may have resulted in inaccuracy in collection of these secondary outcome measures.

Second, loss in work productivity was measured using a binary response option ('yes' or 'no'), the amount of loss of work productivity was not specified. Third, the study population may not be representative of all patients with AT. Most patients included in this study had longstanding symptoms (median 63 weeks) and it is likely that patients with short living AT experience less impact on QoL, work performance and visit less healthcare providers. Another limitation was that the direct costs were mainly based on assumptions of the national mean costs of treatments. The main reason for this is that we did not register accurate data of the profession of the patients. This might have provided a less accurate estimation of the direct costs.

Recommendations for future research

Our main recommendation for future research is to evaluate the effect of different treatments on QoL scores in patients with AT. This will gain more insight into the impact and effectiveness of different treatments. Second, it would be interesting to investigate the cost-effectiveness of different treatments. To better understand the economic impact of AT, future studies could research the specific underlying cause of the decreased work productivity.
