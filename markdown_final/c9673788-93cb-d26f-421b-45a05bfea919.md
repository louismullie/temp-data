## Question

What is a recommendation for sundowning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a recommendation for managing sundowning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining sundowning and its clinical context. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and guideline strength. Next, I will examine nonpharmacologic strategies as first-line therapy. After that, I need to review pharmacologic options with dosing, timing, and safety. Finally, I will integrate a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight special considerations and monitoring needs, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and context. Sundowning refers to evening agitation, confusion, or behavioral disturbances that worsen in the late afternoon or early evening in patients with dementia, often overlapping with sleep-wake disturbances and circadian dysregulation, and it is associated with caregiver burden and institutionalization risk, so any recommendation must weigh benefits, risks, and feasibility in real-world care settings [^958d5f4f] [^3934f6b2] [^12357a66].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment hierarchy. I need to check the strength of evidence and guideline direction. High-quality guidance consistently prioritizes nonpharmacologic interventions as first-line for behavioral symptoms in dementia, including sleep and evening disturbances, reserving medications for refractory cases or when risks are acceptable, which aligns with APA dementia guidelines and JAMA evidence-based reviews [^fed830e3] [^3934f6b2] [^98c96ea5].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic strategies with the best support. Let me think about environmental and behavioral levers: maintain regular sleep-wake times, limit daytime napping, avoid evening fluids and caffeine, establish calming bedtime rituals, and provide adequate daytime physical and cognitive activities; these are core elements in APA guidance and are echoed in dementia behavioral management frameworks, with additional emphasis on caregiver education and problem-solving to tailor interventions to triggers and routines [^fed830e3] [^3934f6b2] [^98c96ea5].

> Wait, let me verify the role of light therapy. Morning bright light can help entrain circadian rhythms and has been studied in dementia, sometimes combined with melatonin, though evidence quality varies; nonetheless, given low risk, structured morning light exposure is reasonable to incorporate alongside sleep hygiene, while avoiding bright light in the evening that could exacerbate arousal [^notfound].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options for refractory cases, starting with melatonin, because it is commonly used. Cochrane reviews show low-certainty evidence that melatonin up to 10 mg has little or no clinically meaningful benefit for major sleep outcomes in Alzheimer's disease, so I should not overstate its effect; if used, it is reasonable to trial 3–6 mg at bedtime, monitor for response, and discontinue if ineffective, recognizing that some guidelines advise against fast-release melatonin for insomnia without circadian factors, which tempers enthusiasm for routine use here [^12357a66] [^a139d851] [^6cb32eaa].

> Let me consider trazodone next, since it is frequently used off-label for dementia-related sleep disturbance. A small RCT in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's showed that 50 mg at bedtime increased total nocturnal sleep by about 42 minutes and improved sleep efficiency without serious adverse events in the short term; given the limited evidence, I should frame this as a conditional option after nonpharmacologic measures, with careful monitoring for orthostasis, falls, and daytime sedation, especially in older adults [^12357a66] [^a139d851].

> I should double-check antipsychotic use for evening agitation. APA suggests that if psychotic symptoms coexist with sleep disturbance, a second-generation antipsychotic may be the initial pharmacologic choice, and evening dosing can align peak levels with evening behavioral problems; however, I need to emphasize the FDA boxed warning for increased mortality in older adults with dementia-related psychosis and the need to use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and reassess frequently, which makes this a last-resort strategy rather than routine [^53b097ca] [^fed830e3].

> But wait, what about orexin antagonists or other hypnotics. Cochrane highlights that suvorexant probably increases total sleep time by about 28 minutes and reduces time awake after sleep onset in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's, with no clear excess of adverse events versus placebo in short trials; however, these data are newer and not specific to sundowning per se, so I should present them as emerging options for persistent insomnia after other approaches fail, with shared decision-making about uncertain long-term benefits and access considerations [^12357a66].

> I need to ensure I address safety and comorbidities that modify choices. Benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics are generally discouraged in older adults with dementia due to falls, cognitive impairment, and respiratory suppression, and sleep apnea is common in dementia and a relative contraindication to sedatives that depress respiration; thus, I should screen for sleep apnea and avoid benzodiazepines outside of exceptional, short-term circumstances with close monitoring [^fed830e3] [^d705e6dc].

> Let me integrate a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check each step. Start with comprehensive nonpharmacologic measures for 2–4 weeks, including regular sleep-wake scheduling, daytime activity, evening routines, and caregiver education; if inadequate, consider a monitored trial of melatonin 3–6 mg at bedtime with discontinuation if no benefit; if still problematic, consider trazodone 50 mg at bedtime with fall-risk precautions; reserve antipsychotics for severe agitation or psychosis after weighing risks, and consider orexin antagonists in selected cases of persistent insomnia; throughout, reassess triggers, medications, and comorbidities at each step and de-prescribe if ineffective or risky [^fed830e3] [^3934f6b2] [^12357a66].

> Hold on, I should verify special considerations. In Parkinson's disease, circadian dysregulation and dopaminergic deficits may contribute to sundowning-like phenomena; preclinical work suggests REV-ERBα antagonism may restore circadian mood-related behaviors in PD models, but this remains investigational and should not guide current practice, so I will mention it only as a research signal rather than a clinical recommendation [^f32d101c] [^140b69f7].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and caregiver support are explicit. Track evening agitation frequency and severity, sleep parameters, falls, and daytime function; provide caregiver training and respite resources; and coordinate with primary care, neurology, and psychiatry as needed, because sustained improvement often depends on consistent implementation and timely adjustments rather than any single intervention [^3934f6b2] [^fed830e3].

Sundowning is best managed with **nonpharmacologic strategies first** [^3934f6b2], including consistent daytime routines, exposure to bright light in the morning [^notfound], and minimizing evening stimulation. If needed, **low-dose trazodone at bedtime** [^12357a66] can improve sleep and reduce evening agitation, while antipsychotics are reserved for severe cases due to risks [^53b097ca]. Melatonin is generally ineffective for sundowning [^12357a66] [^a139d851], and benzodiazepines should be avoided because of falls and cognitive effects [^d705e6dc]. Caregiver education and environmental adjustments are essential, and medications should be reviewed to remove agents that worsen confusion or sedation [^3934f6b2] [^fed830e3].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line)

Nonpharmacologic measures are the **foundation of sundowning management** [^3934f6b2] and should be optimized before adding medications:

- **Consistent daily routine**: Regular wake, meal, and bedtime schedules help stabilize circadian rhythms [^fed830e3].

- **Morning bright light exposure**: 30–60 minutes of bright light in the morning can improve circadian alignment and reduce evening agitation [^notfound].

- **Evening routine**: Calm, predictable activities (e.g. soft music, warm milk, dim lighting) reduce overstimulation [^fed830e3].

- **Daytime activity**: Physical and social engagement reduce daytime sleepiness and improve nighttime sleep [^fed830e3].

- **Environmental modifications**: Reduce noise, clutter, and evening visitors; use nightlights to reduce disorientation [^notfound].

- **Caregiver education**: Training in redirection, communication, and stress reduction improves outcomes and reduces caregiver burden [^3934f6b2].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions (second-line)

Medications are reserved for **persistent, severe, or dangerous sundowning** after nonpharmacologic measures fail:

| **Medication** | **Evidence** | **Recommendation** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Trazodone 50 mg qHS | Moderate | First-line pharmacologic option | Improves total sleep time and sleep efficiency; monitor for orthostasis and sedation [^12357a66] [^a139d851] |
| Quetiapine 12.5–25 mg qHS | Low | Short-term use only | Effective for agitation/psychosis; monitor for sedation, orthostasis, metabolic effects [^53b097ca] |
| Risperidone 0.5–1 mg qHS | Low | Short-term use only | Effective for severe agitation/psychosis; monitor for EPS, metabolic effects [^notfound] |
| Melatonin 3–6 mg qHS | Low | Generally not recommended | Little benefit for sleep or agitation in dementia [^12357a66] [^a139d851] |
| Benzodiazepines | None | Avoid | High risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and paradoxical agitation [^d705e6dc] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Underlying causes**: Evaluate for pain, infection, constipation, dehydration, and medication effects that can worsen sundowning [^3934f6b2].

- **Safety**: Prioritize fall prevention, supervision, and caregiver support, especially if wandering or aggression occurs [^7c9757a1].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess regularly to taper or discontinue medications when possible [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Nonpharmacologic strategies first**: Consistent routines, morning light, daytime activity, and evening calm [^fed830e3].

- **Pharmacologic options**: Trazodone 50 mg qHS is the preferred first-line medication; antipsychotics are reserved for severe cases [^12357a66] [^53b097ca].

- **Avoid**: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives that increase fall and cognitive risks [^d705e6dc].

- **Caregiver support**: Essential for implementation and safety [^3934f6b2].

---

Sundowning management hinges on **nonpharmacologic measures**, with trazodone as the preferred medication when needed; antipsychotics are reserved for severe cases, and benzodiazepines should be avoided.

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias—administration timing and frequency considerations include leveraging side effects for benefit, evening dosing to address sundowning, and dosing frequency: A more sedating agent may be given at bedtime for patients with insomnia with agitation or psychosis; antipsychotics are most commonly administered in the evening so peak levels align with evening behavioral problems; most have long half-lives so once-a-day dosing is generally sufficient, with quetiapine usually given twice daily, though morning or twice-daily dosing of other agents may help some patients.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^12357a66]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non-drug interventions are recommended as the first-line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, and sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed-effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin-receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer-reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. We found low-certainty evidence that melatonin doses up to 10 mg may have little or no effect on any major sleep outcome over eight to 10 weeks in people with AD and sleep disturbances. We could synthesise data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; 2 studies, n = 184), and the ratio of day-time to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; 2 studies; n = 184). From single studies, we found no evidence of an effect of melatonin on sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, number of night-time awakenings, or mean duration of sleep bouts. There were no serious adverse effects of melatonin reported. We found low-certainty evidence that trazodone 50 mg for two weeks may improve TNST (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; 1 study, n = 30), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; 1 study, n = 30) in people with moderate-to-severe AD. The effect on time awake after sleep onset was uncertain due to very serious imprecision (MD -20.41 minutes, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; 1 study, n = 30). There may be little or no effect on number of night-time awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; 1 study, n = 30) or time asleep in the day (MD 5.12 minutes, 95% CI -28.2 to 38.4). There were no serious adverse effects of trazodone reported. The small (n = 74), phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg was reported only in summary form on the sponsor's website. We considered the certainty of the evidence to be low. There was no evidence of any important effect of ramelteon on any nocturnal sleep outcomes. There were no serious adverse effects. We found moderate-certainty evidence that an orexin antagonist taken for four weeks by people with mild-to-moderate AD probably increases TNST (MD 28.2 minutes, 95% CI 11.1 to 45.3; 1 study, n = 274) and decreases time awake after sleep onset (MD -15.7 minutes, 95% CI -28.1 to -3.3: 1 study, n = 274) but has little or no effect on number of awakenings (MD 0.0, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.5; 1 study, n = 274). It may be associated with a small increase in sleep efficiency (MD 4.26%, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.26; 2 studies, n = 312), has no clear effect on sleep latency (MD -12.1 minutes, 95% CI -25.9 to 1.7; 1 study, n = 274), and may have little or no effect on the mean duration of sleep bouts (MD -2.42 minutes, 95% CI -5.53 to 0.7; 1 study, n = 38). Adverse events were probably no more common among participants taking orexin antagonists than those taking placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.99; 2 studies, n = 323).

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to guide decisions about drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many widely prescribed drugs, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks for these common treatments. We found no evidence for beneficial effects of melatonin (up to 10 mg) or a melatonin receptor agonist. There was evidence of some beneficial effects on sleep outcomes from trazodone and orexin antagonists and no evidence of harmful effects in these small trials, although larger trials in a broader range of participants are needed to allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Systematic assessment of adverse effects in future trials is essential.

Dementia—associated neuropsychiatric and behavioral features include apathy, avolition, and withdrawal; depressed mood (with or without neurovegetative changes) with sleep disturbances and anxiety independent of depression; and suicidal behavior in mildly impaired individuals with insight into deficits. Patients may manifest “catastrophic reactions” to minor stressors, develop delusions (spousal infidelity, persecution, theft; misidentifications; and impostor delusions), and have hallucinations across sensory modalities, with visual hallucinations most common; some exhibit evening agitation or other behavioral disturbances referred to as “sundowning”.

### Sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and amyloid β among cognitively healthy later-life adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f08900ae]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting one in ten adults over the age of 65 worldwide, which poses a considerable economic challenge. More than 6.5 million older Americans suffered from AD in 2022, and the estimated cost for AD is $321 billion worldwide. By 2050, the number of AD cases in the US is expected to reach 12.7 million individuals. Neurodegenerative processes associated with AD result in the accumulation of senile plaques and pathologic changes in Amyloid β (Aβ) throughout the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serum. AD biomarkers may be present even decades before clinical AD symptoms appear. However, few effective disease-modifying treatments exist to delay the onset of AD symptoms. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify modifiable risk factors and develop novel interventions to decrease the risk of AD.

Alterations in sleep duration and efficiency can lead to numerous consequences for health and well-being and increase the risk of AD. Current guidelines state that healthy sleep is a sleep duration of 7 or more hours per night for adults between 18 and 60, 7–9 h for adults between 61 and 64, and 7- 8 h for 65 years and older. However, later-life adults who are older than 50 typically experience less than 7 h of sleep duration and 85% sleep efficiency compared to younger adults. In particular, slow-wave sleep declines significantly with age. In addition to the changes in sleep structures, sleep disorders including insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing increase with age. Additionally, individuals with mild cognitive impairment or AD often experience disruptions in sleep and experience sundown syndrome. However, this condition often occurs years prior to impairment.

### Clinical recommendations for pain, sedation, withdrawal and delirium assessment in critically ill infants and children: an ESPNIC position statement for healthcare professionals [^e465e23a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Delirium

Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder due to a somatic illness or its treatment. According to DSM-5 the core diagnostic criteria for delirium are (Table 1) (a) a disturbance of attention or awareness; (b) this disturbance is accompanied by changes in cognition that cannot be better accounted for by another pre-existing neurocognitive disorder (e.g. mental retardation, dementia); (c) the condition develops within hours or days, and often fluctuates during the day, typically worsening in the evening (‘sundowning’) and (d) there are indications from the patient’s history, examination or laboratory results that the disturbance is probably the result of a medical condition or its treatment. The pathogenesis of delirium is largely unknown. The sufferers may be hyperactive, hypoactive or show signs of both states. Typical for the hypoactive delirium are slowed or sparse speech, hypoactive or slowed motor activity as well as lethargy, also described as reduced awareness or apathy. Adults and children largely show the same symptoms although hallucinations and hypoactive delirium are hard to observe in the very young children. However, delirium has been described in infants below 1 year of age. Delirium has not been described in neonates to date. Increasing evidence suggests there is a positive association between illness severity and paediatric delirium. Many risk factors for delirium have been identified. These can be classified as patient-related, iatrogenic and environmental. Patient factors (e.g. infections, metabolic disorders, withdrawal from medications, restraints and sleep disturbance) and environmental factors may contribute to developing delirium.

The reported prevalence of paediatric delirium (PD) in PICU patients is 4–29 %. Colville et al. found that 3 months after discharge one-third of PICU patients reported memories of psychotic features, including delusions and disturbing hallucinations, suggestive of delirium during PICU admission. Adult delirium has been associated with higher mortality and morbidity and longer length of hospital stay. PD, too, is associated with longer length of stay and—as we suspect—increased morbidity. Thus, early recognition of this serious neuropsychiatric disorder is essential, and PICU nurses could facilitate this task.

Recommendation

Search for potential sources of paediatric delirium and to take appropriate actions (grade of recommendation = D).

### Recommended treatment strategies for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness [^6dbf7a01]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common and bothersome phenomenon. It can be associated with insufficient sleep syndrome, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, shift work disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, or Parkinson's disease. Once the underlying cause of the excessive sleepiness is determined, clinicians must select the most appropriate behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to reduce daytime sleepiness, alleviate other symptoms, improve functioning, and ensure the safety of patients and those around them. Patient history, adverse effects, and efficacy in specific conditions should be considered in pharmacologic treatment options for patients with EDS.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^a139d851]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia, through identification and analysis of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, in March 2013 and again in March 2016, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions, as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results from the included study reports. We obtained additional information from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found six RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (222 participants, four studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study), and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, limited information available).The participants in the trazodone study and almost all participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with AD who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality.There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or ADL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to AD. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

### Fasting and recovery from exercise [^5d652397]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Recovery after strenuous exercise involves processes that are dependent on fluid and food intake. Current sports nutrition guidelines provide recommendations for the quantity and timing of consumption of nutrients to optimise recovery issues such as refuelling, rehydration and protein synthesis for repair and adaptation. Recovery of immune and antioxidant systems is important but less well documented. In some cases, there is little effective recovery until nutrients are supplied, while in others, the stimulus for recovery is strongest in the period immediately after exercise. Lack of appropriate nutritional support will reduce adaption to exercise and impair preparation for future bouts. Ramadan represents a special case of intermittent fasting undertaken by many athletes during periods of training as well as important competitive events. The avoidance of fluid and food intake from sunrise to sundown involves prolonged periods without intake of nutrients, inflexibility with the timing of eating and drinking over the day and around an exercise session, and changes to usual dietary choices due to the special foods involved with various rituals. These outcomes will all challenge the athlete's ability to recover optimally between exercise sessions undertaken during the fast or from day to day.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^dc6af2ee]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendation strength—implications for users specify that strong recommendations indicate that almost all patients should receive the recommended course of action and may serve as a quality criterion, whereas conditional recommendations indicate most patients should receive the suggested course of action but different choices may be appropriate and clinicians must align decisions with patient values and preferences; the ultimate judgment regarding suitability must be made by the clinician and the patient.

### Cancer and overgrowth manifestations of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome: management recommendations from the international PHTS consensus guidelines working group [^3cc65fee]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

These clinical guidelines for PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) surveillance and management have direct implications for improving patient care and outcomes. By providing standardized, evidence-based recommendations for cancer screening and overgrowth management across multiple affected organ systems, healthcare providers can deliver more consistent and comprehensive care to patients with PHTS. The international consensus approach, incorporating input from both medical experts and patient advocates, ensures the guidelines are both clinically robust and practical for implementation. These recommendations will particularly benefit genetic counselors, oncologists, and primary care physicians in making informed decisions about individualized surveillance programs, potentially enabling earlier cancer detection and more effective intervention strategies for patients with PHTS worldwide.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^6ac1585b]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine guideline—environmental safety measures for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) emphasize injury prevention by removing hazards and separating bed partners when necessary. Sharp furniture like nightstands should be moved or padded, a soft carpet, rug, or mat should be placed next to the bed to reduce injurious falls, and patients with severe, uncontrolled RBD should be recommended to sleep separately from partners or at least place a pillow between them.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease [^c14f9d71]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease through identification and analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 31 March 2013 using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, "rest-activity", sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with Alzheimer's disease who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors working independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias and results from the included study reports. Additional information was obtained from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available).The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe AD; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate AD. In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD. We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies). Other outcomes were reported in single studies. We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies.Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or ADLs. No serious adverse effects were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment). The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in AD. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in AD, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to AD patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems. There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in AD. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

### Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia [^3934f6b2]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral symptoms such as repetitive speech, wandering, and sleep disturbances are a core clinical feature of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. If untreated, these behaviors can accelerate disease progression, worsen functional decline and quality of life, cause significant caregiver distress, and result in earlier nursing home placement. Systematic screening for behavioral symptoms in dementia is an important prevention strategy that facilitates early treatment of behavioral symptoms by identifying underlying causes and tailoring a treatment plan. First-line nonpharmacologic treatments are recommended because available pharmacologic treatments are only modestly effective, have notable risks, and do not effectively treat some of the behaviors that family members and caregivers find most distressing. Examples of nonpharmacologic treatments include provision of caregiver education and support, training in problem solving, and targeted therapy directed at the underlying causes for specific behaviors (eg, implementing nighttime routines to address sleep disturbances). Based on an actual case, we characterize common behavioral symptoms and describe a strategy for selecting evidence-based nonpharmacologic dementia treatments. Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia can significantly improve quality of life and patient-caregiver satisfaction.

### ACC / AHA / HRS versus ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Syncope: JACC guideline comparison [^3d47bb61]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Syncope is a commonly encountered and challenging problem in medical practice. Presentations are variable, and the causal mechanism often remains elusive even after extensive (and often expensive) evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help guide the multidisciplinary approach necessary to diagnose and manage the broad spectrum of patients presenting with syncope. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, published its first syncope guidelines in 2017. The European Society of Cardiology released the fourth iteration of its syncope guidelines in 2018. This review highlights the differences and congruencies between the 2 sets of recommendations, their implications for clinical practice, the remaining gaps in understanding, and areas of future research.

Recommendation strength definitions and ordering—The recommendations in this guideline define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients in most situations. A “strong” recommendation is one that clinicians should follow for almost all patients, and a “conditional” recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the appropriateness of the patient care strategy for all. The order of the recommendations is not intended to convey prioritization but is listed from strong to conditional within each disorder group.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^96061232]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Drug-induced/exacerbated REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)—conditional discontinuation, diagnosis, and antidepressant strategy are specified: “drug-induced/exacerbated RBD is the most common etiology for RBD in patients younger than age 50 years,” and the panel makes “a conditional recommendation for drug discontinuation in drug-induced/exacerbated RBD if it is safe to do so.” If dream enactment persists after stopping the inciting agent, the guideline states “we recommend diagnosing the patients with either isolated RBD or secondary RBD (if there is a clear underlying disorder) and treating accordingly,” noting that reducing or stopping a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor “may take several months” for improvement and that RBD after an inciting agent may emerge within “weeks or months, not years.” For those still needing antidepressants, it notes “many do well on an agent with a lower serotonergic profile such as bupropion,” and advises “The risks and benefits of discontinuing a drug known to induce RBD that has been taken uneventfully for a prolonged period of time should be carefully assessed.”

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^8986726f]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Patients with PD experience motor symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability; however, non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disorders, psychiatric disorders, sensory disturbances, and autonomic disabilities, are also common. Approximately 45% of patients with PD experience depression and anxiety. Disturbances in sleep–wake cycles and mood disorders are associated with dysregulated circadian rhythms. One relatively common circadian rhythm disturbance among elderly individuals and patients with dementia and neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, is “sundowning syndrome”. This syndrome, also called nocturnal delirium, is characterized by the occurrence or exacerbation of behavioral disturbances, especially neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, confusion, anxiety, and depression, in a temporal pattern during the late afternoon or early evening. These behaviors disrupt both patients and caregivers, and circadian disturbances represent a serious detriment to an individual’s quality of life. However, the neural basis underlying sundowning syndrome behavior and its connection with circadian rhythm disturbances remain unknown.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^cd1c557e]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures

Seizures occur in a significant minority of individuals with PLAN, and seizure types may include generalized tonic seizures, focal seizures, and myoclonic seizures. Epileptic spasms have also been reported. Complex epilepsy phenotypes have not been reported. Seizures tend to occur later in the disease course and are not generally refractory to treatment., An EEG may show fast rhythms,,,, although this does not need to be routinely obtained if there is no clinical suspicion for seizures.

How can seizures be distinguished from nonepileptic phenomena?

Individuals with PLAN, particularly infantile PLAN later in disease, may have nonepileptic stiffening or jerking episodes that can only be distinguished from seizure with an ictal EEG.Without an EEG, there are other clues that can help with this determination. Seizures tend to be unprovoked, not interruptible, stereotyped, and involve loss of awareness and a postictal period. A video of the event may be helpful. If uncertainty remains after EEG, and the spells are frequent and bothersome, a trial of an antiseizure medication could be considered.

What is the most effective first-line and second-line antiepileptic medication for PLAN patients with seizures?

There is no evidence for a specific approach to seizure management in PLAN. As with other children, seizure medications are chosen based on seizure type and side effect profile.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: consensus panel recommendations for clinical management and additional research [^a8cf14be]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation syndrome. This article summarizes recommendations with respect to future research as well as clinical management recommendations for SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Participants

In April 2004, a panel of physicians convened in New York City to discuss recommendations for clinical management of and additional research on SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Evidence

Previous guidance for management of SRI discontinuation syndrome was proposed in 1997 in a consensus meeting also chaired by Alan F. Schatzberg. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles on SRI discontinuation syndrome that have been published since 1997.

Consensus Process

The 2004 panel reviewed important preclinical and clinical studies, discussed prospective investigation of this syndrome in clinical trials, and suggested the establishment of a research network to collect data in naturalistic settings. The panel also reviewed the management recommendations published in 1997 and subsequently updated the recommendations, taking into account the latest clinical data as well as the personal experience of its members with patients.

Conclusions

Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of SRI discontinuation syndrome and to identify the patient populations and agents that are most affected by this phenomenon. Management strategies include gradual tapering of doses and should emphasize clinical monitoring and patient education.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^458a25bc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the management of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RBD: It is critically important to help patients maintain a safe sleeping environment to prevent potentially injurious nocturnal behaviors. In particular, the removal of bedside weapons, or objects that could inflict injury if thrown or wielded against a bed partner, is of paramount importance. Sharp furniture like nightstands should be moved away or their edges and headboard should be padded. To reduce the risk of injurious falls, a soft carpet, rug, or mat should be placed next to the bed. Patients with severe, uncontrolled RBD should be recommended to sleep separately from their partners, or at the minimum, to place a pillow between themselves and their partners.

Recommendations

The following recommendations, with medications listed in alphabetical order, are a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for RBD in adults. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend…") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest…") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed recommendations for symptomatic and long-term management [^02ea655f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In this two-part project, we analysed each step in AE management in a real-life chronological order that covers the first neurological presentation, diagnostic workup, acute management, bridging therapy, and long-term management and monitoring. We focused on practical management questions and used published research and expert opinion to provide broad recommendations to clinicians. We understand that AE is a heterogeneous disease and that treatment strategies may differ from one antibody-related syndrome and/or one clinical subtype to another. However, individual AE syndromes are rare and information on the specific antibody is usually lacking at the time of presentation. This makes it necessary to establish a common general approach to AE to guide initial management until the specific antibody is revealed. Moreover, many cases of AE are not linked to any of the commercially available antibodies, which adds to the importance of having a common approach. In addition, many AE syndromes have common clinical and pathogenic features making standardisation of certain aspects of both acute and long-term management possible for some of these syndromes.

A major limitation to our survey questionnaire is generalisation. When addressing a diverse clinical entity like AE with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes and patient demographics/comorbidities, it is difficult to develop specific questions for every possible clinical scenario. Therefore, our recommendations may not be suitable for all patients and clinicians will still need to make individual decisions based on each patient’s unique circumstances.

Our AEACN survey results highlight the diversity of practice across institutions when it comes to AE management and emphasise the need for development of standards of care. Although no consensus was reached for most of the survey questions, the survey results showed which approaches are most popular among AE clinicians and which steps in AE management are most divisive and therefore require more research. More formal consensus techniques like the Delphi method were not implemented to avoid misinterpretation of our recommendations as firm treatment guidelines. A major goal of this paper was to showcase both agreements and disagreements in AE management in order to inform future observational and interventional studies. In this evolving field, presenting firm consensus guidelines in the absence of strong scientific evidence can have a negative impact on future research efforts. On the other hand, translating practice patterns into management recommendations remains a major limitation to this paper. However, the recommendations did not rely solely on survey results and incorporated available evidence from several AE subtypes and related immune-mediated disorders.

Establishing expectations in RBD—education, safety, and monitoring are emphasized: “Patients and bed partners should know that dream enactment is a neurological disorder that can start during any phase of the night. It may occur every night or infrequently,” and “Degree of injury, rather than vocalization or intensity of movement, determines the extent of harm.” When dream enactment is noninjurious, “escalating pharmacotherapy is usually unwarranted” because more aggressive or sedating therapy “is often futile and dangerous, increasing the risk of nighttime falls and daytime sleepiness.” The guideline adds that “ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the severity of dream enactment and treatment efficacy and to explore whether bed partners should be sleeping separately.”

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^8f6cdfe5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Secondary RBD due to a medical condition—definition and conditional guidance—includes underlying disorder associations and recommended therapies. Patients with secondary RBD have an emergence of dream enactment with PSG-documented elevation in REM sleep motor tone in the presence of a clear underlying disorder, most commonly an alpha-synuclein disorder such as dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease, or type I narcolepsy, and in DLB/PD it is more likely in older patients (> 50 years old). The guideline states, We are making conditional recommendations for the use of 3 agents in the treatment of secondary RBD: clonazepam, immediate-release melatonin, and rivastigmine, and also chose to make a conditional recommendation against the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for secondary RBD; targeting subthalamic or globus pallidus interna regions has not demonstrated improved dream enactment control in PD with RBD. Several disease-targeted treatments did not meet the threshold for recommendation but may be considered in appropriate clinical contexts rather than solely for RBD.

### Proceedings of the sleep and epilepsy workgroup: section 2 comorbidities: sleep related comorbidities of epilepsy [^c8d0c07e]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, treatment of insomnia in these disorders improves psychiatric outcomes. Relationships between psychiatric disorders and insomnia are probably dynamic. For example, hypotheses in relationships between PTSD and insomnia propose that acute sleep deprivation during trauma exposure may be adaptive for survival, and subacute insomnia post-trauma may protect from consolidating the traumatic memory. However, chronic post-traumatic insomnia may contribute to the development of PTSD.

Sleep disturbances also accompany thought disorders. Patients with schizophrenia experience shorter sleep time and decreased slow-wave sleep. Most sleep problems, however, can be considered iatrogenic; weight gain from antipsychotics use can lead to increased sleep-disordered breathing (a problem that is underevaluated in epilepsy).

Sleep disturbances are a prominent comorbidity of the dementias. Insomnia increases the risk of Alzheimer dementia (AD) specifically, but sleep-disordered breathing is associated with a higher incidence of dementias regardless of cause. Up to 2 of 3 patients with AD have sleep problems, including sundowning and other severe behavioral problems. In Lewy body dementia, 60% to 95% of patients experience excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, or REM sleep behavioral disturbances. Although PWE also experience high rates of insomnia,since the behavioral consequences may be less dramatic, attention to disturbed sleep patterns of patients and their caregivers may yield important improvements to daytime function.

Although somewhat outside of the scope of presentations during the workshop, the participants noted that parasomnias, because of an enhanced incidence in psychiatric disease, place patients at risk for misdiagnosis of seizures.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^71487137]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In sundowning syndrome, circadian patterns of behavioral disturbances are worse in the late afternoon/evening among the elderly and patients with dementia and neurodegenerative disorders over 60 years of age. Although previous studies have revealed that aged and transgenic Alzheimer’s disease mouse models represent certain aspects of sundowning syndrome, such as increased locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors in the afternoon, the explanation for sundowning syndrome was inadequate because of the lack of an animal model and neurobiological mechanism studies associated with circadian rhythms. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice exhibit disturbances in their circadian patterns of mood-related behaviors with increased depression- and anxiety-like phenotypes only at dawn. These phenotypes are observed with sundowning syndrome in humans, because the period CT22-01 in nocturnal mice corresponds to the late afternoon/evening hours for humans, with the cessation of daily activity. The endogenous circadian rhythm was disturbed in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice, which is consistent with a previous study. The present study demonstrated the pathophysiological molecular links between midbrain DAergic neurons and the circadian timing system, shedding light for the first time on the causal relationship between sundowning syndrome and a hypoDAergic state in a PD animal model. These results facilitate our understanding of the etiology of sundowning syndrome from a chronobiological aspect. Although animal research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of the sundowning syndrome in PD, there are several limitations with application to clinical studies. Although the timing of sundowning syndrome is at the onset of an inactive period in both humans and mice, the disruptive behaviors of sundowning syndrome are expressed in the late afternoon and evening in humans, versus at dawn in mice, which are nocturnal species. Furthermore, sundowning syndrome is a complex behavioral disorder, including agitation, delusion, and hallucination. Although we focused on depression- and anxiety-like disorders in PD mouse models, it is difficult to exactly replicate human complex psychiatric disorders in a mouse model.

Grade recommendation justification

Despite the low quality of evidence for the majority of outcomes, and the results being driven largely by a single trial,conservative fluid management may be beneficial without evidence of harm. We therefore suggest that in adult patients with ARDS, clinicians consider the use of a conservative fluid strategy which uses fluid restriction, diuretics and possibly hyperoncotic albumin to avoid a positive fluid balance in preference to a liberal fluid strategy.

Sleep

What methods and interventions help most in addressing a good sleeping routine?

It is important to inquire about sleep as it often has a major impact on quality of life of the individual with PLAN and those who care for and live with that person. However, if the sleep issue is not causing problems (eg, the child wakes up overnight but does not wake family members and is rested during the day), then no intervention may be required. The approach is to address behavioral components of insomnia, evaluate the sleep environment, investigate medical factors impacting sleep, and consider medications (see Table 1).

Table 1. 
Sleep Difficulties, Testing, and Interventions in PLAN.

Autonomic

Are there specific interventions for the autonomic dysfunction seen in PLAN? (temperature dysregulation, discoloration of hands and feet)

Autonomic dysfunction may take the form of decreased circulation, constipation, urinary retention, decreased gastric motility, and temperature dysregulation. Treatment is supportive. Reassurance can be given that the discoloration in the extremities is not dangerous. In the later stages of infantile PLAN, caregivers may need to be cautious in hot or cold environments, which may lead to vital sign changes. Individuals with adult PLAN may also have orthostatic hypotension like adults with classic Parkinson disease, and it is reasonable to take a similar approach.

### Deep phenotyping in 3q29 deletion syndrome: recommendations for clinical care [^c9e97cdd]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, many of the medical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric findings, although frequent, are nonspecific. Many symptoms noted require medical intervention, but do not necessarily signal the need for genetic testing. As a result, for individuals with 3q29 deletion syndrome, identifying the underlying genetic diagnosis remains a challenge. However, given the constellation of 3q29 deletion syndrome phenotypes, including developmental and neuropsychiatric manifestations, a genetic diagnosis is imperative for developing strategies for effective management. Once 3q29 deletion syndrome is diagnosed, the findings and recommendations in the current study provide clinicians and families a road map for evidence-based care and treatment for individuals with 3q29 deletion syndrome.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^0241b154]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

As stated above, if patients with nOH are experiencing supine hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 160–180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 90–100 mmHg), the decision to treat should be individualized. However, if patients with nOH are experiencing severe supine hypertension (systolic blood pressure of >180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of >110 mmHg), they could be treated in the evening using short-acting anti-hypertensive agents (Table 5). Individuals with the most severe supine hypertension often have the most severe nOH and therefore these patients should be educated in the risks of worsening nOH with treatment. In particular, nocturnal visits to the bathroom may become dangerous if supine hypertension is treated too aggressively. It is also important for these patients to avoid the use of diuretics and long-acting antihypertensive agents because the blood volume depletion attendant to diuretics and hypotensive effects of long-acting antihypertensive may markedly worsen nOH, even though they might have been intended to mitigate supine hypertension. Additionally, patients with nOH must avoid the supine posture during the day. A head-up reclining posture is recommended for repose.

Table 5 
Proposed treatments for supine hypertension related to nOH

*Short-acting antihypertensive medications for treatment of supine hypertension should only be administered at bedtime, not during daytime hours. Many medications have BID or TID as the recommended dosing regimen, and patients may inadvertently start taking these medications during daytime hours and worsen symptoms of nOH

a Use of clonidine carries a risk of a morning ‘hangover’ effect

Limitations

There are a number of limitations to the current publication. The recommendations listed in this document are based on expert opinion, but do not contain sufficient evidence to support official guidelines. However, the recommendations were included with the goal of providing practical information to the many physicians without specific training or experience in autonomic disorders that are most likely to manage patients with orthostatic hypotension. Additional studies are necessary to determine the utility of these recommendations.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^0ef9606e]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Survival of preterm infants continues to improve, with those at 22–23 weeks of gestation now having reasonable chances of making it home to their families. There is a growing trend towards offering initial life support to infants born at lower perceived levels of viability, which in some countries is now defined as low as 22 weeks of gestation. However, we caution that recommendations given in these guidelines are based on evidence from studies, which almost without exception, have been generated in times where the resuscitation of the most preterm infants was not often attempted, and until very recently, infants of the lowest gestations were not included in clinical trials. We therefore recommend caution when applying current recommendations to the most preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Until more evidence is available, these guidelines apply mainly to management of RDS in infants with gestational ages of greater than 24 weeks. Managing RDS remains a key component of neonatal intensive care. European data from 2014 to 2016 show that around 50% of all babies born between 22 +0 and 32 +6 weeks receive surfactant; therefore, relevant skills for surfactant administration and mechanical ventilation (MV) remain important.

RDS is caused by pulmonary immaturity and surfactant deficiency, resulting in respiratory insufficiency from soon after birth. There is now less emphasis on radiographic diagnosis and grading of RDS, such as “ground glass with air bronchograms.” Definitions based on blood gas analyses are also redundant, as management has moved towards an approach of pre-emptive treatment with surfactant based on clinical assessment of work of breathing and inspired oxygen requirement to avoid worsening RDS. The aim of modern RDS management is to maximise survival while minimising complications such as air leaks and BPD. Many strategies for prevention and treatment of RDS and providing early respiratory support have been tested in clinical trials and are summarised in updated systematic reviews, all of which inform these guidelines. This current version updates previous versions after critical examination of the most recent evidence available to end of 2022. We have again used a format of summarising management strategies followed by evidence-based recommendations according to the GRADE system to reflect the authors' judgement of the evidence supporting each of the statements (Table 1). Summary of recommendations is shown in Table 2.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^fed830e3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias—sleep disturbance management emphasizes nonpharmacological strategies and careful sequencing; clinicians should consider behavioral and environmental interventions, combine nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and seek to avoid use of multiple psychotropic medications; other initial steps may include establishing regular sleep and waking times, limiting daytime sleeping, avoiding fluid intake in the evening, establishing calming bedtime rituals, and providing adequate daytime physical and mental activities; pharmacological treatment should be instituted only after other measures have been unsuccessful and the potential benefits outweigh the risk of side effects; if another behavioral or neuropsychiatric condition is present and medications for that condition have sedative properties, clinical practice favors prescribing that agent at bedtime, if appropriate; if the patient has psychotic symptoms and sleep disturbance, second-generation antipsychotics may be the initial treatment of choice; if there are clear deficits in sleep hygiene, education and behavioral management might be the preferred treatment course; identification of sleep apnea is particularly important, which may affect 33%–70% of patients with dementia, and this condition is a relative contraindication to the use of benzodiazepines or other agents that suppress respiratory drive.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) safety—environmental risk mitigation and when to escalate: Sleeping safely is challenging in RBD, as any patient can intermittently have violent episodes of dream enactment. Of paramount importance is the removal of loaded firearms and in particular handguns, as they can be discharged during a dream enactment episode. When violent dream enactment persists despite these interventions or in situations with a high risk for injury, pharmacotherapy can be considered.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^7c9757a1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Wandering risk and prevention in dementia— families should be advised that patients with dementia may wander away from home and that wandering may be dangerous to patients, and provision of adequate supervision is important to prevent patients from wandering. However, since walking may be beneficial, both as stimulation and exercise, it should not be limited unnecessarily; providing access to a large, safe area for walking or opportunities for supervised walks is ideal, and environmental changes may also be necessary to prevent unsupervised departures, with the addition of a more complex or less accessible door latch at home potentially helpful. If wandering occurs at night when caregivers are asleep, pharmacological intervention may be indicated, and in institutional settings, electronic locks or electronic devices that trigger an alarm when the patient tries to leave may be used. Although visual or other subjective barriers have been tried, there is no evidence that these subjective barriers prevent wandering in cognitively impaired people, and if patients are prevented from leaving on their own, adequate supervision must be provided to ensure emergency egress. Pharmacotherapy is rarely effective in the treatment of wandering unless due to an associated condition such as mania, and provision should be made for locating patients should wandering occur, including referrals to the Safe Return Program of the Alzheimer’s Association (1-888-572-8566) or similar programs, which should be considered for patients at risk of wandering.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^87a9d5db]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

The mean effective dose in adults is 75‐100 mg daily or 1‐1.5 mg/kg body weight. 3, 15, 28 Amitriptyline is best titrated in 10‐25 mg increments as this improves tolerability by allowing adaptation to and preventing discontinuation from side effects, particularly daytime sedation. This improves the ultimate efficacy of the medication. Most of the panelists used 10 mg but some used 25 mg. As always, this needs to be individualized based upon the patient response. The incidence of side effects with AT varies from 9% to 25% although this did not result in discontinuation of the drug in most studies. 19 Side effects include daytime sedation, weight gain, dryness of mouth, and constipation. The night‐time administration of AT can often promote sleep, whereas the lingering daytime sedation tends to improve or resolve in 8‐12 weeks. Though most studies have only evaluated AT, NT may be used alternatively to minimize side effects. Given the risk of prolongation of the QTc interval and cardiac arrhythmias, we recommend obtaining an EKG at baseline, once during titration at ~50 mg and after the target dose is reached. More frequent monitoring will vary between individual patients, based on their response to AT and concomitant use of other medications that can prolong the QT interval. It is recommended that the QTc be maintained at <470 msec for women and <450 msec for men. The dosage of AT should be reduced or stopped if there is QTc prolongation or development of significant side effects. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias appears to be low, and no serious adverse events have been reported with its use in CVS. Serious psychiatric side effects such as psychotic reactions, hypomania, and delirium may occur with the treatment of depression with amitriptyline but are not reported in CVS, perhaps due to the higher doses typically used to treat the former. 29

Prognosis and counseling in isolated RBD—risk stratification, disclosure approaches, and resources are detailed: “We believe clinicians should, if the patient desires, tactfully and explicitly discuss the relationship and provide the patient with a customized risk assessment.” Chronic alpha-synuclein–linked symptoms coexisting with RBD “are strong predictors of phenoconversion in less than 5 years,” whereas their absence with a serotonergic antidepressant “is associated with a lower risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder in the next 5 years.” Pending guidance, the task force presents “2 general approaches… based upon the TF’s unanimous consensus: patient-centered risk disclosure and watchful waiting.” After diagnosis, “the provider should explore the patient’s knowledge about isolated RBD,” and “Clinicians should present the literature fairly and in plain language,” while offering research connections to groups “such as the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy consortium,” “the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative,” and “the International RBD Study Group.” The document notes “The watchful waiting approach… may be appropriate… in the setting of severe, active psychiatric illness,” and “we suggest the American Academy of Neurology’s position statement, ‘Ethical Considerations in Dementia Diagnosis and Care.’”

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^0e7ad76f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1aa9be6d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Long COVID is a complex condition characterized by more than 200 documented symptomsthat persist or develop following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.This multisystemic disease affects various bodily functions and causes significant neurological and psychological distress.According to the World Health Organization, 10–20% of COVID-19 patients go on to develop long COVID.With over 65 million cases reported worldwide as of 2023,long COVID presents challenges across all demographics, with particular prevalence in females and adults aged 18 years and older,regardless of the initial infection’s severity.

Long COVID has many definitions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients with long COVID experience a “range of ongoing symptoms and conditions” lasting at least 3 months postinfection.The National Center for Infectious Diseases describes it as a group of symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients that “persist or emerge four weeks after the initial infection.”The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence further defines long COVID as symptoms developing during or after infection that prolong for “more than 12 weeks” and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.Additionally, the World Health Organization characterizes long COVID as the persistence or emergence of new symptoms 3 months after initial infection, lasting at least 2 months without any other explanation.

Among the neurological and psychological symptoms reported, sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent.Sleep disturbances encompass disorders that disrupt normal sleep patterns, classified in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition into 6 major categories: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnolence and narcolepsy, circadian rhythm disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders.Studies on long COVID–associated sleep disturbances have identified common issues such as insomnia, frequent awakenings,difficulty falling or staying asleep,and excessive daytime sleepiness.Chinvararak and Chalderfound that about 46% of patients with long COVID experienced sleep disturbances, with insomnia affecting 38%. Similarly, Seighali et al’smeta-analysis reported a 45% prevalence of sleep disorders among 15,362 patients. If not adequately managed, these disturbances can impair physical, psychological and social health,increase anxietyand dyspnoea,and significantly reduce quality of life.

### Lifestyle management in polycystic ovary syndrome-beyond diet and physical activity [^4d9a26ce]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and research gaps

The 2018 International Evidence-Based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS highlights lifestyle (diet, physical activity and/or behavioural) management as the primary initial treatment strategy. It is important to consider that the definition of lifestyle management may warrant expansion consistent with the whole person model of healthcare provision, which may include care addressing psychological and sleep interventions, as well as a range of TCIM approaches. In line with patient interest, and to assist women and healthcare providers in understanding the evidence to aid safe implementation of adjunct therapies, rigorous assessment of the evidence for these alternative lifestyle strategies in PCOS management in warranted. Using a holistic definition of patient care, this review has summarised evidence to date on the traditional components of lifestyle change (diet, physical activity and behavioural change), psychological interventions and non-pharmacological strategies (sleep, supplements, herbal medicine and other TCIM approaches). Table 6 provides a overview of current guideline recommendations alongside the key findings from this review, summarising the identified research gaps that need to be addressed before evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice can be updated.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy: ASCO guideline [^06c9e61d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy experts was convened to develop the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 to 2021.

Results

The systematic review identified 35 eligible publications. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus.

Recommendations

The multidisciplinary team issued recommendations to aid in the recognition, workup, evaluation, and management of the most common CAR T-cell-related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, B-cell aplasia, cytopenias, and infections. Management of short-term toxicities associated with CAR T cells begins with supportive care for most patients, but may require pharmacologic interventions for those without adequate response. Management of patients with prolonged or severe CAR T-cell-associated cytokine release syndrome includes treatment with tocilizumab with or without a corticosteroid. On the basis of the potential for rapid decline, patients with moderate to severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome should be managed with corticosteroids and supportive care.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.

This British Association for Psychopharmacology guideline replaces the original version published in 2010, and contains updated information and recommendations. A consensus meeting was held in London in October 2017 attended by recognised experts and advocates in the field. They were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aiming to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate, or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was circulated to all speakers for comments, which were incorporated into the final statement.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for wandering of people with dementia in the domestic setting [^6ae81efa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting, but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting. The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear. In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering, it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Also, the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a 'one size fits all' kind of explanation is unlikely. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non-pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects, in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment. This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non-pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia. The secondary objective is to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available and to set an agenda for future research.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 11 May 2006 using the terms exit* or wander* or elopement or ambulat* or walk*. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing intervention with no intervention or usual treatment ('standard care') or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

No suitable trials of non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention and management of wandering in the domestic setting were found.

Main Results

As no randomised controlled trials were found, no results can be reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^f32d101c]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss. Motor deficits experienced by patients with Parkinson’s disease are well documented, but non-motor symptoms, including mood disorders associated with circadian disturbances, are also frequent features. One common phenomenon is “sundowning syndrome,” which is characterized by the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms at a specific time (dusk), causing severe quality of life challenges. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of sundowning syndrome in Parkinson’s disease and their molecular links with the circadian clock. We demonstrated that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mice, as Parkinson’s disease mouse model, exhibit increased depression- and anxiety-like behaviors only at dawn (the equivalent of dusk in human). Administration of REV-ERBα antagonist, SR8278, exerted antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in a circadian time-dependent manner in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice and restored the circadian rhythm of mood-related behaviors. 6-OHDA-lesion altered DAergic-specific Rev-erbα and Nurr1 transcription, and atypical binding activities of REV-ERBα and NURR1, which are upstream nuclear receptors for the discrete tyrosine hydroxylase promoter region. SR8278 treatment restored the binding activities of REV-ERBα and NURR1 to the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter and the induction of enrichment of the R/N motif, recognized by REV-ERBα and NURR1, as revealed by ATAC-sequencing; therefore, tyrosine hydroxylase expression was elevated in the ventral tegmental area of 6-OHDA-injected mice, especially at dawn. These results indicate that REV-ERBα is a potential therapeutic target, and its antagonist, SR8278, is a potential drug for mood disorders related to circadian disturbances, namely sundowning syndrome, in Parkinson’s disease.

### Psychophysiological responses in people living with dementia after an art gallery intervention: an exploratory study [^9a2938bc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The present study has some limitations. Due to the population under investigation, it is possible that some saliva collection protocols were not followed precisely, such as brushing of teeth while unsupervised. Groups One to Four were collected with a researcher and care staff supervising. However, it was not possible to confirm that all participants followed the protocol precisely. The present study collected passive drool samples despite previous studies recommending the use of oral swab collection methods. In the pilot and feasibility study of PLWD by Bourne et al. (2019), the researchers had difficulty with using oral swabs due to chewing and recommended passive drool sample collection in future studies to facilitate greater volume for analysis. Indeed, the present study excluded two participants from the saliva analysis due to insufficient volumes provided. As such, recommendations have been made to conduct diurnal cortisol sampling across three consecutive days for the most reliable results ; however, the practicality with PLWD is questionable. Our sampling schedule did not include an afternoon or pre-dinner sample, meaning the potential presence of sundowning could not be evaluated. We did not ask participants about their medication regime, nor did we exclude participants based on their medications, as it is expected the majority of participants receive pharmacological treatment, which may have included glucocorticoids. We also requested study partners to complete an events diary to assess stress-related confounders. However, several study partners did not provide comprehensive information, and we could not report this data.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^5da1f059]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—lifestyle management recommends that lifestyle intervention (exercise alone or multicomponent diet combined with exercise and behavioural strategies) should be recommended for all women with PCOS, for improving metabolic health including central adiposity and lipid profile. Healthy lifestyle behaviours encompassing healthy eating and/or physical activity should be recommended in all women with PCOS to optimize general health, quality of life, body composition and weight management (maintaining weight, preventing weight gain and/or modest weight loss). Healthcare professionals should be aware that lifestyle management is a core focus in PCOS management, lifestyle management goals and priorities should be co-developed in partnership with women with PCOS, and value women's individualized preferences, and there are benefits to a healthy lifestyle even in the absence of weight loss.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^ec971b41]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

Recurrent unexplained falls are most likely associated with a cardiovascular cause.
The commonest cardiovascular causes of falls in rank order are orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syndrome, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, bradyarrhythmias and atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
The investigation (and subsequent management and specialist referral criteria) of syncope, and therefore, recurrent unexplained falls can be performed according to locally applicable guidelines such as the 2018 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope.
If orthostatic hypotension is suspected but not detected using traditional methods—oscillometer or sphygmomanometer, referral for beat-to-beat orthostatic measurement is recommended as the association of falls with orthostatic hypotension measured using beat-to-beat methods is more consistent.
If vasovagal syncope or delayed orthostatic hypotension is suspected and diagnostic uncertainty remains, older adults should be referred for head up tilt tests.
If arrhythmias are suspected after clinical assessment, based on locally applicable guidelines individuals should be referred for external or internal cardiac monitoring.
For assessment for orthostatic hypotension, individuals should be supine for at least 5 minutes before baseline blood pressure is recorded; on standing, blood pressure should be taken as soon as possible (40–60 seconds), followed by measurements at 1-minute intervals up to 3 minutes, or up to 5 minutes if symptoms suggested a delayed orthostatic hypotension response.
Orthostatic hypotension most commonly occurs as a result of dehydration, concomitant medications, autonomic dysfunction and with alpha synucleopathy diseases (such as PD, dementia with Lewy Bodies or multisystem atrophy). It is also common in older adults with hypertension.
Short-term 24–48 hours cardiac rhythm monitoring is not indicated unless events occur daily. Prolonged external or internal ambulatory cardiac monitoring is indicated if arrhythmias are suspected as a cause of falls or syncope, after clinical assessment.
Older adults with unexplained syncope, suspected syncope or unexplained falls who require carotid sinus massage or head up tilt tests should be referred to an appropriate specialist, according to locally applicable guidelines.

### Developing an intervention for fall-related injuries in dementia (DIFRID): an integrated, mixed-methods approach [^d4ca9cc5]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

CMOc4: embedding interventions in day to day life

Individually tailoring exercises to the preferences, interests, and physical and cognitive abilities of people with dementia has been described as ‘vital’ to successful interventions for this patient group. Cognitive impairment may affect the ability of patients to follow instructions and consequently, rehabilitation success [,,–,–]. However, some people with dementia may have relatively well preserved procedural memory which may enable them to form new habits. ‘Embedding’ interventions into existing routines could also help make them habitual. Effective tailoring requires specialised training for staff and carers involved in intervention delivery ; including a staff training component in the intervention was therefore seen as essential (see CMOc8).

Stakeholders agreed with the consensus panel’s recommendation to use the principles underlying the Otago exercise programme (i.e. individually tailored; progressive; stable and sustainable; and using walking alongside strength and balance), although they indicated that implementation of this programme is often inconsistent with the recommended format due to resource limitations. Stakeholders emphasised that meaningful activities should include mental and social stimulation as well as physical activity:

This gentleman had really bad dementia. He had sundown so he was up all night. The family came in, and we had a game of dominos. I couldn’t communicate with him. You bring out the dominos and he won every time. It was like a different person came out in that dominos. […] Then, by making him stay awake all day and doing meaningful activities to keep him active, he was more likely to sleep at night. […] He is not getting up and falling over.

(Prof 121, focus group with specialist nurses)

Music and dance were also considered particularly valuable. Exploring the barriers (including cultural barriers) to meaningful activity was identified as one way to increase the likelihood of successfully engaging patients in new activities.

While setting patient-centred goals achieved a high level of consensus among the panel, some stakeholders had reservations about how this might work in practice:

I don’t think I could do it. Like, make a cup of tea. I wouldn’t trust myself.

(Interview, Patient 13)

Professional stakeholders also identified potential problematic elements of goal setting, including the difficulty of engaging people with dementia in setting goals, the potential for them to lose interest in things they previously enjoyed, and ensuring goals were those of the patient and not only the carer.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)—individualized acute management: Manage acute FPIES individually according to severity and review treatment strategies with the caregivers of each patient. [Strength of recommendation: Moderate; Evidence strength: IIb/III; Evidence grade: C]. The primary goal in management of severe FPIES is restoration of stable hemodynamics through aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation (eg, 10-20 mL/kg boluses of normal saline) and a single dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg; maximum, 60-80 mg) can be used although no studies support this recommendation; in severe reactions patients might require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, vasopressors, bicarbonate, and methylene blue, and epinephrine autoinjectors are not routinely recommended/prescribed for FPIES, while mild-to-moderate acute FPIES can resolve with oral rehydration at home.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^8b7455c7]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Sleep-related problems have been reported repeatedly, both in individuals with NIPBL and SMC1A variants and in clinically diagnosed individuals, with a widely variable frequency (12–72%) and ranging from nightly apnoea and insomnia to daytime drowsiness and frequent daytime napping,– (R49). Difficulties in falling asleep and staying asleep occur in 55–65% of individuals as early as infancy. Consecutive days without sleep were reported in 30% of 74 individuals with clinically diagnosed CdLS. Snoring has been reported in 17% of 46 individuals with CdLS in one studyand in 63% of 22 individuals with CdLS in another studyand may lead to daytime sleepiness. Behavioural interventions and melatonin may be helpful in treating sleep disorders in those with CdLS (unpublished observations, L.M.K and A.Se.). Few adults have been reported to have sleep problems, suggesting spontaneous improvements over time.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^7dee4a69]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as the triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, and abnormal gas exchange, and is found in 10–32% of patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only known cure for HPS, but patients can develop severe posttransplant hypoxemia, defined as a need for 100% inspired oxygen to maintain a saturation of ≥85%. This complication is seen in 6–21% of patients and carries a 45% mortality. Its management requires the application of specific strategies targeting the underlying physiologic abnormalities in HPS, but awareness of these strategies and knowledge on their optimal use is limited. We reviewed existing literature to identify strategies that can be used for this complication, and developed a clinical management algorithm based on best evidence and expert opinion. Evidence was limited to case reports and case series, and we determined which treatments to include in the algorithm and their recommended sequence based on their relative likelihood of success, invasiveness, and risk. Recommended therapies include: Trendelenburg positioning, inhaled epoprostenol or nitric oxide, methylene blue, embolization of abnormal pulmonary vessels, and extracorporeal life support. Availability and use of this pragmatic algorithm may improve management of this complication, and will benefit from prospective validation.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^9ad522ca]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Moderately impaired patients with Alzheimer’s disease—safety, supervision, driving, supports, and symptom management should be addressed routinely. As patients become more impaired, they are likely to require more supervision to remain safe, and safety issues should be addressed as part of every evaluation. Families should be advised about the possibility of accidents due to forgetfulness, of difficulties coping with household emergencies, and of the possibility of wandering, and should be advised to determine whether the patient is handling finances appropriately and to consider taking over the paying of bills and other responsibilities. At this stage of the disease, nearly all patients should not drive, and families should be counseled to undertake measures to prevent patients from driving. A referral for some form of respite care may be helpful, and families should begin to consider and plan for additional support at home as well as discuss the patient’s possible transfer to a long-term care facility. Treatment for cognitive symptoms should also be considered; for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, currently available data suggest that the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor plus memantine is more likely to delay symptom progression than a cholinesterase inhibitor alone during this stage of the illness. Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, and combativeness are prevalent, it may be helpful to reassure families that these symptoms are often treatable, and for patients in whom wandering is the only symptom, pharmacotherapy will rarely be indicated.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^140b69f7]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss. Motor deficits experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease are well documented, but non-motor symptoms, including mood disorders associated with circadian disturbances, are also frequent features. One common phenomenon is "sundowning syndrome," which is characterized by the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms at a specific time (dusk), causing severe quality of life challenges. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of sundowning syndrome in Parkinson's disease and their molecular links with the circadian clock. We demonstrated that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mice, as Parkinson's disease mouse model, exhibit increased depression- and anxiety-like behaviors only at dawn (the equivalent of dusk in human). Administration of REV-ERBα antagonist, SR8278, exerted antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in a circadian time-dependent manner in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice and restored the circadian rhythm of mood-related behaviors. 6-OHDA-lesion altered DAergic-specific Rev-erbα and Nurr1 transcription, and atypical binding activities of REV-ERBα and NURR1, which are upstream nuclear receptors for the discrete tyrosine hydroxylase promoter region. SR8278 treatment restored the binding activities of REV-ERBα and NURR1 to the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter and the induction of enrichment of the R/N motif, recognized by REV-ERBα and NURR1, as revealed by ATAC-sequencing; therefore, tyrosine hydroxylase expression was elevated in the ventral tegmental area of 6-OHDA-injected mice, especially at dawn. These results indicate that REV-ERBα is a potential therapeutic target, and its antagonist, SR8278, is a potential drug for mood disorders related to circadian disturbances, namely sundowning syndrome, in Parkinson's disease.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy: ASCO guideline [^786c5eb0]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline—CAR T-cell therapy immune-related adverse events outlines that a multidisciplinary panel conducted a systematic literature review (2017 to 2021) and that the systematic review identified 35 eligible publications; because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus. The multidisciplinary team issued recommendations to aid in the recognition, workup, evaluation, and management of common chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell–related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), B-cell aplasia, cytopenias, and infections. Management of short-term toxicities associated with CAR T cells begins with supportive care for most patients, but may require pharmacologic interventions for those without adequate response; management of patients with prolonged or severe CAR T–cell–associated cytokine release syndrome includes treatment with tocilizumab with or without a corticosteroid, and patients with moderate to severe immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome should be managed with corticosteroids and supportive care. The purpose is to increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and guideline development involved an informal consensus process with a multidisciplinary panel.

Adult ICU delirium—single-component nonpharmacologic strategies: We suggest not using bright light therapy to reduce delirium in critically ill adults (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Bright light therapy, family participation in care, and a psychoeducational program were the only single-component ICU interventions studied, and three studies of bright therapy did not demonstrate beneficial effect on either delirium incidence or ICU LOS; panel members therefore issued a conditional recommendation against its use.

### Treatments for somnambulism in adults: assessing the evidence [^6d151441]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, is a parasomnia of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep where movement behaviours usually confined to wakefulness are displayed during sleep. Generally, if sleepwalking is causing distress or danger in spite of safety measures, medical or psychological treatment is indicated. Clinicians will need to assess the evidence for treatment options. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (EBM) multifile databases were searched. No properly powered rigorous controlled trials were found for treatment of sleepwalking in adults. Seven reports described small trials with some kind of control arm, or retrospective case series which included 30 or more patients. With no high quality evidence to underpin recommendations for treatments of somnambulism, full discussion with patients is advised. Adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials are now needed, and multi-centre collaborations may be required to obtain the sample sizes required.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^ae9a22e4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and Intensive Care Society Guideline Development Group have used GRADE methodology to make the following recommendations for the management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The British Thoracic Society supports the recommendations in this guideline. Where mechanical ventilation is required, the use of low tidal volumes (<6 ml/kg ideal body weight) and airway pressures (plateau pressure <30 cmH 2 O) was recommended. For patients with moderate/severe ARDS (PF ratio<20 kPa), prone positioning was recommended for at least 12 hours per day. By contrast, high frequency oscillation was not recommended and it was suggested that inhaled nitric oxide is not used. The use of a conservative fluid management strategy was suggested for all patients, whereas mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure and the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours was suggested for patients with ARDS with ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PF) ratios less than or equal to 27 and 20 kPa, respectively. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was suggested as an adjunct to protective mechanical ventilation for patients with very severe ARDS. In the absence of adequate evidence, research recommendations were made for the use of corticosteroids and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal.

### Current guidelines and standards of practice for restless legs syndrome [^d602f52d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Algorithms for treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Patients with RLS are divided into 3 groups: (1) those with intermittent RLS symptoms; (2) those with daily RLS symptoms; and (3) those whose symptoms are refractory to standard treatments. Many patients do not require medication, and symptoms often can be relieved with good sleep hygiene and avoidance of medications and factors that provoke symptoms. Recent large-scale clinical trials have proved the efficacy of therapy for RLS when it is required. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly. The first step in managing RLS is to ensure that there is an adequate diagnosis; this involves discriminating RLS from other conditions that may share a number of features. Finally, it is important to tailor treatment to the needs of each individual patient.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: what it means for clinical practice [^daa445a1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012 and now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and updating the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy. The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy-the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. Also, where appropriate, similarities and differences between the current recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, whereas the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of inherited polyposis syndromes [^6fb5c2b5]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Treatment for FAP—counseling, natural history, and care setting are specified: Treatment should include thorough counseling about the nature of the syndrome, its natural history, its extracolonic manifestations, and the need for compliance with recommendations for management and surveillance. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. In untreated patients with classic FAP, colorectal cancer is nearly universal by age 40, and there are no randomized or prospective trials of different surveillance strategies. Affected individuals have a risk of extracolonic manifestations, and duodenal cancer and desmoid tumors are the most common causes of death in patients with FAP after colorectal cancer, with recent data suggesting that the incidence of gastric cancer is increasing. Based on low-quality evidence, we recommend that clinicians caring for patients with polyposis should have specialized expertise in the field and, ideally, work within a multidisciplinary team.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^b29fd778]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Implementation

All healthcare professionals should be encouraged to evaluate sleep in a multimodal manner (sleep satisfaction, timing, efficiency, duration, alertness, sleep disorders) in all patients with the involvement of partners/relatives, when needed. In case of abnormal sleep habits and/or sleep patterns, personalized counselling about the role of sleep in BP management and advice on modification of sleep habits should be implemented. Clear and achievable goals should be set in collaboration with the patient, potential challenges and barriers and motivating strategies should be discussed and strategies implemented. Patients experiencing persistent sleep difficulties (≥4 weeks) should be referred to a sleep specialist for further evaluation and management. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is beneficial for patients with hypertension, improving sleep quality and decreasing SBP and DBP by 8.6 and 5.6 mmHg, respectively.

At policy level, regulations of working schedules and educational programs in the sleep field must be promoted. Population-based awareness programs addressing healthy sleep must be supported.

### Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^5f2662ee]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Actinic keratosis guideline—strength of recommendations and implications are defined as follows: Strong recommendation for the use of an intervention uses the wording “We recommend” and implies “Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens; recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances.” Conditional recommendation for the use of an intervention uses “We conditionally recommend” and implies “Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden; recommendation applies to most patients, but most appropriate action may differ, depending on the patient or other stakeholder values.” Strong recommendation against the use of an intervention uses “We recommend against” with the implication “Risk and burden clearly outweigh benefits; recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances.” Conditional recommendation against the use of an intervention uses “We conditionally recommend against” with the implication “Risks and burden closely balance with benefits; recommendation applies to most patients, but most appropriate action may differ, depending on the patient or other stakeholder values.” A Good Practice Statement uses “We recommend” when “Guidance was viewed by the Work Group as imperative to clinical practice and developed when the supporting evidence was considerable but indirect and the certainty surrounding the intervention’s impact was high, with the benefits clearly outweighing the harms (or vice versa),” and “Good Practice Statements are strong recommendations, as the certainty surrounding the impact of the recommended intervention is high. Implementation of these strong recommendations is considered to clearly result in beneficial outcomes.”

Acute heart failure syndromes clinical policy—recommendation strength definitions are provided: Level A recommendations. Generally accepted principles for patient management that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (ie, based on strength of evidence Class I or overwhelming evidence from strength of evidence Class II studies that directly address all of the issues). Level B recommendations. Recommendations for patient management that may identify a particular strategy or range of management strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (ie, based on strength of evidence Class II studies that directly address the issue, decision analysis that directly addresses the issue, or strong consensus of strength of evidence Class III studies). Level C recommendations. Other strategies for patient management that are based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or in the absence of any published literature, based on panel consensus.

### Comparative effectiveness of implantable defibrillators for asymptomatic Brugada syndrome: a decision-analytic model [^cc28f9be]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disorder associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) attributable to ventricular arrhythmias.Yet SCD risk is variable and most patients will not have an event.Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) can avert SCD,but are associated with immediate and long‐term risks, require repeated interventions to maintain, are expensive, and may reduce quality‐of‐life.Therefore, proper risk stratification and recommendations for ICD implantation are of critical importance in BrS management.

Some individuals are at sufficiently high SCD risk that ICDs are clearly indicated, such as those with a history of malignant arrhythmias.Conversely, some are at recognizably low risk such that ICDs are not recommended, such as asymptomatic individuals with normal resting ECGs.In contrast, the optimal management of asymptomatic individuals with spontaneous ST‐segment elevation in the right precordial leads (ie, type I Brugada pattern), who have an ≈3‐fold SCD risk,,is unclear and current guidelines do not provide explicit recommendations for or against ICD.Management typically includes observation,though risk stratification with electrophysiologic study (EPS) and ICD implant for high risk findings may be reasonable.At the same time, recent innovations such as the subcutaneous ICD may offer a favorable adverse event profile, thereby potentially altering the risk‐benefit equation in favor of ICD‐based strategies.

Although uncertainty in the optimal management of BrS remains a challenge, the rarity of the condition renders a definitive clinical trial impractical. We therefore developed a decision‐analytic model to estimate the comparative effectiveness of contemporary management strategies for individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrographic pattern, across a range of plausible clinical scenarios.

### Understanding and approaching excessive daytime sleepiness [^dbcfa3af]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a public health issue. However, it remains largely undervalued, scarcely diagnosed, and poorly supported. Variations in the definition of EDS and limitations in clinical assessment lead to difficulties in its epidemiological study, but the relevance of this symptom from a socioeconomic perspective is inarguable. EDS might be a consequence of several behavioural issues leading to insufficient or disrupted sleep, as well as a consequence of sleep disorders including sleep apnoea syndrome, circadian disorders, central hypersomnolence disorders (narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia), other medical or psychiatric conditions, or medications. Furthermore, EDS can have implications for health as it is thought to act as a risk factor for other conditions, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Because of the heterogeneous causes of EDS and the complexity of its pathophysiology, management will largely depend on the cause, with the final aim of making treatment specific to the individual using precision medicine and personalised medicine.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^d705e6dc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks. This guidance reflects the general lack of evidence for the long-term clinical benefit of BZDs, as well as research demonstrating that the clinical benefits may decrease over time while the risks persist. – Meta-analyses of patients taking BZDs for insomnia demonstrated minor improvements in sleep onset, increased sleep duration, and decreased nighttime awakenings. However, therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks due to changes in BZD receptor density and/or affinity resulting from chronic use, while risks remain present. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BZDs to placebo for insomnia in adults over age 60 showed a 3.8-fold increase in daytime sedation, a 4.8-fold increase in cognitive impairment, and a 2.6 fold increase in incidence of psychomotor effects (e.g. falls, motor vehicle accidents).Another meta-analysis showed an increased risk of hip fractures (RR 1.34) associated with current and recent BZD use in older adults.In addition to its psychomotor effects, BZDs may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension in older adults, which also contributes to fall risks.

Although long-term BZD use should generally be avoided, exceptions do exist. For example, long-term BZD use may be indicated in patients with severe treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or bipolar spectrum disorders. – Long-term BZD use may also be appropriate for medical conditions such as complex seizure disorders,spasticity,, sleep disorders involving abnormal movements (e.g. rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome),and catatonia. Finally, BZDs have a role in palliative and end-of-life care.In any of these patient populations, clinicians should consider consulting with an appropriate specialist to determine whether BZD tapering is indicated and manage the process when it is.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^f10ef0d9]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Immediate-release melatonin for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD)—The TF identified 1 randomized controlled trial and 9 observational studies that assessed the efficacy of immediate-release melatonin in patients with isolated RBD, and these studies demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD dream enactment and vocalization episode frequency. The TF stated that the overall certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision and the risk of bias associated with observational studies, and commonly reported adverse events included daytime sleepiness, headache, trouble thinking, and nausea. The TF determined that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects was strongly in favor of immediate-release melatonin, noted that the costs of the medication are relatively small compared to the potential high cost of injury due to dream enactment during sleep, and that the vast majority of patients would most likely use immediate-release melatonin compared to no treatment for their isolated RBD. Remarks emphasized that as melatonin is not regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in the United States and several other jurisdictions, different formulations could potentially lead to varying efficacy between different melatonin brands.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of sleep disorders in older persons [^01a4ad31]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep-related disorders are most prevalent in the older adult population. A high prevalence of medical and psychosocial comorbidities and the frequent use of multiple medications, rather than aging per se, are major reasons for this. A major concern, often underappreciated and underaddressed by clinicians, is the strong bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and serious medical problems in older adults. Hypertension, depression, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are examples of diseases that are more likely to develop in individuals with sleep disorders. Conversely, individuals with any of these diseases are at a higher risk of developing sleep disorders. The goals of this article are to help guide clinicians in their general understanding of sleep problems in older persons, examine specific sleep disorders that occur in older persons, and suggest evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the assessment and treatment of sleep disorders in older persons. No such recommendations are available to help clinicians in their daily patient care practices. The four sections in the beginning of the article are titled, Background and Significance, General Review of Sleep, Recommendations Development, and General Approach to Detecting Sleep Disorders in an Ambulatory Setting. These are followed by overviews of specific sleep disorders: Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, Restless Legs Syndrome, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, Parasomnias, Hypersomnias, and Sleep Disorders in Long-Term Care Settings. Evidence- and expert- based recommendations, developed by a group of sleep and clinical experts, are presented after each sleep disorder.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) or paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS) is a life-threatening autoimmune blistering disease commonly associated with lymphoproliferative neoplasms. This article focuses on current management strategies in PNP/PAMS, and reported instances of their treatment successes and failures. Due to the rarity of the condition and the high rates of treatment failure, no randomized control trials exist to guide the evidence-based treatment of this condition; all evidence to date on the efficacy of therapeutic modalities has been gained from individual case reports, small case series, and expert recommendations.

### Oral melatonin for non-respiratory sleep disturbance in children with neurodisabilities: systematic review and meta-analyses [^21c3c83c]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Method

This systematic review was undertaken in accordance with the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination's ‘Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Health Care’ 33 and is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 34 Data synthesis was undertaken in accordance with the Cochrane handbook. 35 The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42016034067).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were assessed for eligibility on the basis of the criteria outlined in Table SI (online supporting information). Concerns have been expressed by others that a crossover design may be inappropriate because of uncertainty about the duration of the effect of interventions on sleep patterns and circadian rhythm and therefore the most appropriate duration for the washout period. 18 We agree with these concerns. However, given that the aim was to undertake a broad review and there were few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) likely to be available, we included crossover studies.

Databases searched included Applied Social Science Abstracts & Indexes (ASSIA); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR); Conference Proceedings Citation Index; Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); Embase; Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC); MEDLINE; MEDLINE In‐Process; PsycINFO; Science Citation Index; Social Care Online; and Social Policy & Practice. Searches were undertaken in February and March 2016, and updated in February 2017.

The database, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway were also searched for ongoing and completed trials. We reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Searches were not limited by date, language, or study design. The search strategy was broad and aimed to identify both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. Appendix S1 (online supporting information) outlines the search strategy used for Medline, which was adapted for use in other databases.
