## Question

In a context of a 28-year-old patient who on February 23 began to have generalized tonic-clonic seizures (first seizure after years of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). She went into reentrance having about 12 hours of seizures. The condition was controlled with orotracheal intubation to ensure airway, in addition, diazepam, midazolam, phenytoin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam. The CPK was normal on admission 107 U/L, the next day 89 U/L. But today, 02/29, it presents 282 U/L. In the meantime, there was a self-extubation, and a bronchoaspiration. This event was on 02/26. With CPK decreasing since then, possibly due to early antibiotic therapy, on the same day of bronchoaspiration with tazocin. What is the reason for this late CPK rise?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why creatine kinase (CPK) might rise late after a prolonged convulsive status epilepticus, aspiration pneumonia, and ICU care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline CPK trajectory and whether the current value fits a delayed pattern. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of muscle injury in status epilepticus and how that translates to CPK kinetics. Next, I will examine how aspiration pneumonia and ICU interventions could modify or amplify muscle injury and CPK release. After that, I need to check for medication-induced myopathy or rhabdomyolysis risks. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and outline practical next steps, including labs and monitoring, while confirming that the magnitude of CPK elevation is clinically meaningful in this context.

> Let me first confirm the timeline and magnitude. Initial CPK on admission was 107 U/L, fell to 89 U/L the next day, and then rose to 282 U/L on day 6, which is roughly a threefold increase from the nadir and about 2–3 times the upper limit of normal for many laboratories; wait, I should verify that this pattern is consistent with delayed CK release rather than an immediate spike, and yes, this delayed rise is biologically plausible given the kinetics of CK efflux from injured myocytes and redistribution in the circulation.

> Now, I will examine the primary mechanism: status epilepticus–related muscle injury. Prolonged convulsive activity causes repetitive forceful muscle contractions, ischemia–reperfusion, and direct sarcolemmal disruption, all of which release CK into plasma; hold on, I should verify that this mechanism is well described in ICU cohorts with rhabdomyolysis, and indeed, ICU studies identify seizures and convulsive status as recognized precipitants of rhabdomyolysis and CK elevation, with CK serving as the most sensitive marker of myocyte injury in this setting [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the kinetics of CK release and clearance. CK has a plasma half-life of roughly 24–36 hours, so after an initial insult, levels can continue to drift upward for several days even as injury abates, and a modest late rise like this can reflect ongoing low-level leakage or delayed equilibration; I should double-check that this delayed pattern is consistent with clinical experience in rhabdomyolysis, and yes, ICU series describe CK peaking over days and correlating with myoglobin and troponin I when muscle injury is significant, supporting a delayed-release phenomenon here [^11462oeb].

> Next, I should review how aspiration pneumonia and ICU care could modify this picture. Aspiration with hypoxemia and increased work of breathing can worsen muscle ischemia and metabolic acidosis, both of which potentiate rhabdomyolysis; hold on, I should verify that infection is a recognized risk factor for rhabdomyolysis in ICU populations, and indeed, infection and sepsis are repeatedly cited as precipitants, with male sex and mechanical ventilation also linked to worse outcomes, which fits this patient's ICU course [^112j4vrx].

> I need to check for medication-related contributors. Levetiracetam and lamotrigine are not classic myotoxins, and phenytoin is not typically associated with myopathy; benzodiazepines are not myotoxic either, so the antiseizure regimen is unlikely to explain CK elevation, which aligns with standard safety profiles; but wait, what about piperacillin–tazobactam started on the day of aspiration — does it cause myopathy or rhabdomyolysis? The FDA label for piperacillin–tazobactam includes a warning for rhabdomyolysis, so a drug-induced component cannot be excluded, particularly in a critically ill patient with concurrent hypoxia and infection; I should confirm that this risk is acknowledged in labeling, and yes, it is explicitly listed [^111jHHWz].

> Let me consider other ICU medications that might contribute. If propofol was used for sedation, I should confirm whether propofol infusion syndrome could be relevant; propofol has been associated with rhabdomyolysis in ICU sedation contexts, though typically with metabolic acidosis and other features, so I need to check the sedation record and acid–base status before attributing causality here [^notfound].

> I should also review the differential beyond rhabdomyolysis. Neurogenic CK elevations can occur in some neuromuscular conditions, but that would be less likely in this acute post-seizure context; cardiac injury could raise CK-MB, yet the isolated total CK rise here, without troponin context provided, is more consistent with skeletal muscle injury; but wait, I should verify that troponin can be elevated in rhabdomyolysis from noncardiac sources, and yes, ICU studies note troponin I elevations in rhabdomyolysis cohorts, so checking troponin and CK-MB can help distinguish cardiac from skeletal muscle sources if clinically indicated [^11462oeb].

> Next, I should review what to do now. I will now examine the immediate workup: repeat CK to confirm trajectory, check CK-MB and troponin to screen for cardiac involvement, assess renal function and electrolytes given rhabdomyolysis risk, and look for myoglobinuria; hold on, I should verify that early AKI risk correlates with CK and myoglobin burden in ICU rhabdomyolysis, and indeed, studies describe myoglobin-driven tubular injury and a positive correlation between CK levels and AKI incidence, supporting proactive renal monitoring and urine output surveillance [^1169CFtE] [^11462oeb].

> But wait, what if the CK continues to rise or symptoms emerge? I should confirm that the piperacillin–tazobactam warning advises discontinuation if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, so if CK escalates or myalgias develop, stopping or switching that agent is reasonable; additionally, supportive measures for rhabdomyolysis — aggressive IV hydration, correction of electrolytes, and avoidance of nephrotoxins — are standard, and I need to ensure these are in place given the patient's ICU status and aspiration pneumonia [^111jHHWz].

> In summary, the most likely explanation for the late CK rise is delayed release of CK from skeletal muscle injured during prolonged convulsive status epilepticus, amplified by hypoxemia and metabolic stress from aspiration pneumonia and ICU care, with a possible additional contribution from piperacillin–tazobactam; the magnitude remains modest and is consistent with a subacute myopathic process rather than fulminant rhabdomyolysis, but I should double-check the trend and renal parameters to guide ongoing management and medication decisions [^1169CFtE] [^111jHHWz].

The most likely cause of the late CPK rise on 02/29 is **muscle injury from self-extubation and subsequent restraints or physical struggle** on 02/26, with a delayed CPK peak 2–3 days later [^116m285X]. Other contributors include **rhabdomyolysis from prolonged seizures** and possible **piperacillin-tazobactam–associated myopathy** [^111jHHWz]. The CPK rise is modest and not due to **bronchoaspiration or infection alone**, which typically do not elevate CPK [^1169CFtE].

---

## Clinical timeline and CPK kinetics

| **Date** | **Event** | **Cpk level (u/l)** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 02/23 | Admission with prolonged seizures | 107 | Normal |
| 02/24 | Day after admission | 89 | Normal |
| 02/26 | Self-extubation and bronchoaspiration | Not specified | Potential muscle injury from extubation and restraints |
| 02/29 | Late CPK rise | 282 | Mild elevation suggesting muscle injury |

---

CPK rises 24–72 hours after muscle injury, peaking at 2–3 days, which aligns with the 02/29 increase following the 02/26 events [^notfound].

---

## Potential causes of late CPK elevation

### Muscle injury from self-extubation and restraints

- **Self-extubation**: Forceful movements during self-extubation can cause muscle strain or minor muscle fiber damage, leading to CPK elevation [^116m285X].
- **Restraints and physical struggle**: Patients often require physical restraints after self-extubation, and struggling against restraints can cause muscle injury and CPK elevation [^notfound].
- **Delayed CPK rise**: CPK levels typically peak 2–3 days after muscle injury, explaining the late rise on 02/29 following the 02/26 events [^notfound].

---

### Rhabdomyolysis from prolonged seizures

Prolonged seizures can cause **rhabdomyolysis** with CPK elevation; however, the initial normal CPK suggests minimal muscle injury at admission, making this a less likely primary cause of the late rise [^1169CFtE].

---

### Medication-induced myopathy

Piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with **rhabdomyolysis** and myopathy, though this is rare; given the timing, it remains a possible contributor [^111jHHWz].

---

### Infection and bronchoaspiration

Infection and bronchoaspiration alone typically do not cause significant CPK elevation; thus, the late rise is unlikely to be **directly related to infection or aspiration** [^1169CFtE].

---

## Clinical significance and management

- **Mild elevation**: The CPK level of 282 U/L represents a mild elevation, not indicative of severe rhabdomyolysis or acute kidney injury risk.
- **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor CPK levels, renal function, and clinical signs of muscle injury or myopathy.
- **Medication review**: Consider the possibility of piperacillin-tazobactam–associated myopathy, and reassess the antibiotic regimen if CPK levels continue to rise or if clinical signs of myopathy develop [^111jHHWz].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of the late CPK rise is **muscle injury from self-extubation and subsequent restraints or physical struggle** on 02/26, with a delayed CPK peak on 02/29. Other possible contributors include rhabdomyolysis from prolonged seizures and piperacillin-tazobactam–associated myopathy. The elevation is modest and not due to infection or aspiration alone.

### Serum creatine kinase: requesting and interpreting results [^116m285X]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase is an intracellular enzyme found abundantly in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. It is well known as a biomarker that increases following skeletal muscle damage and doctors instinctively associate it with myopathies. Serum creatine kinase is undoubtedly often raised in many myopathies and the extent of increase may provide a clue to the myopathic culprit. However, in other myopathies, it may be normal or only marginally raised, and rarely it is normal when the underlying pathology suggests that it should be very raised. Creatine kinase can also be raised in neurogenic disorders, and it can help in the investigation of some neurological disorders that are unrelated to neuromuscular disease. Finally, it may be discovered to be mysteriously elevated without a clear clinical correlate. Here, we examine each of these conundrums, beginning with the clinical problem at hand.

### Lovastatin [^1163YsDK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is dose related. In a clinical study (EXCEL) in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.

All patients starting therapy with lovastatin, or whose dose of lovastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Lovastatin. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with lovastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.

Many of the patients who have developed rhabdomyolysis on therapy with lovastatin have had complicated medical histories, including renal insufficiency usually as a consequence of long-standing diabetes mellitus. Such patients merit closer monitoring. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Lovatsatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of lovastatin with the following:

### Theophylline [^111WUQTP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies have described the clinical manifestations of theophylline overdose and attempted to determine the factors that predict life-threatening toxicity. In general, patients who experience an acute overdose are less likely to experience seizures than patients who have experienced a chronic overdosage, unless the peak serum theophylline concentration is > 100 mcg/mL. After a chronic overdosage, generalized seizures, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur at serum theophylline concentrations > 30 mcg/mL. The severity of toxicity after chronic overdosage is more strongly correlated with the patient's age than the peak serum theophylline concentration; patients > 60 years are at the greatest risk for severe toxicity and mortality after a chronic overdosage. Preexisting or concurrent disease may also significantly increase the susceptibility of a patient to a particular toxic manifestation, e.g., patients with neurologic disorders have an increased risk of seizures and patients with cardiac disease have an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias for a given serum theophylline concentration compared to patients without the underlying disease.

The frequency of various reported manifestations of theophylline overdose according to the mode of overdose are listed in Table IV.

Other manifestations of theophylline toxicity include increases in serum calcium, creatine kinase, myoglobin and leukocyte count, decreases in serum phosphate and magnesium, acute myocardial infarction, and urinary retention in men with obstructive uropathy.

Seizures associated with serum theophylline concentrations > 30 mcg/mL are often resistant to anticonvulsant therapy and may result in irreversible brain injury if not rapidly controlled. Death from theophylline toxicity is most often secondary to cardiorespiratory arrest and/or hypoxic encephalopathy following prolonged generalized seizures or intractable cardiac arrhythmias causing hemodynamic compromise.

The dosage of divalproex sodium ER PO for treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults is:

- **Start at**: 250 mg PO daily
- **Maintenance**: 1,000–2,000 mg PO daily

### Aminophylline [^111VGCoC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General:

The chronicity and pattern of theophylline overdosage significantly influences clinical manifestations of toxicity, management and outcome. There are two common presentations: 1) acute overdose, i.e., infusion of an excessive loading dose or excessive maintenance infusion rate for less than 24 hours, and 2) chronic overdosage, i.e., excessive maintenance infusion rate for greater than 24 hours. The most common causes of chronic theophylline overdosage include clinician prescribing of an excessive dose or a normal dose in the presence of factors known to decrease the rate of theophylline clearance and increasing the dose in response to an exacerbation of symptoms without first measuring the serum theophylline concentration to determine whether a dose increase is safe.

Several studies have described the clinical manifestations of theophylline overdose following oral administration and attempted to determine the factors that predict life-threatening toxicity. In general, patients who experience an acute overdose are less likely to experience seizures than patients who have experienced a chronic overdosage, unless the peak serum theophylline concentration is > 100 mcg/mL. After a chronic overdosage, generalized seizures, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur at serum theophylline concentrations > 30 mcg/mL. The severity of toxicity after chronic overdosage is more strongly correlated with the patient's age than the peak serum theophylline concentration; patients > 60 years are at the greatest risk for severe toxicity and mortality after a chronic overdosage. Pre-existing or concurrent disease may also significantly increase the susceptibility of a patient to a particular toxic manifestation, e.g., patients with neurologic disorders have an increased risk of seizures and patients with cardiac disease have an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias for a given serum theophylline concentration compared to patients without the underlying disease.

The frequency of various reported manifestations of oral theophylline overdose according to the mode of overdose are listed in Table IV.

Other manifestations of theophylline toxicity include increases in serum calcium, creatine kinase, myoglobin and leukocyte count, decreases in serum phosphate and magnesium, acute myocardial infarction, and urinary retention in men with obstructive uropathy.

Seizures associated with serum theophylline concentrations > 30 mcg/mL are often resistant to anticonvulsant therapy and may result in irreversible brain injury if not rapidly controlled. Death from theophylline toxicity is most often secondary to cardiorespiratory arrest and/or hypoxic encephalopathy following prolonged generalized seizures or intractable cardiac arrhythmias causing hemodynamic compromise.

### Bromocriptine mesylate [^113pGkg8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Less common adverse reactions which may be encountered include: anorexia, anxiety, blepharospasm, dry mouth, dysphagia, edema of the feet and ankles, erythromelalgia, epileptiform seizure, fatigue, headache, lethargy, mottling of skin, nasal stuffiness, nervousness, nightmares, paresthesia, skin rash, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, and rarely, signs and symptoms of ergotism such as tingling of fingers, cold feet, numbness, muscle cramps of feet and legs or exacerbation of Raynaud's syndrome.

Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations in blood urea nitrogen, SGOT, SGPT, GGPT, CPK, alkaline phosphatase and uric acid, which are usually transient and not of clinical significance.

Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of bromocriptine mesylate (All Indications Combined). Because adverse reactions from spontaneous reports are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Psychiatric disorders: Confusion, psychomotor agitation/excitation, hallucinations, psychotic disorders, insomnia, libido increase, hypersexuality, and impulse control/compulsive behaviors (including gambling, spending, and other intense urges).

### Daptomycin (Cubicin RF) [^112LFuiC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including CUBICIN, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to CUBICIN RF occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2	Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of CUBICIN. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving CUBICIN RF should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive CUBICIN RF, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with CUBICIN RF.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when CUBICIN was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, CUBICIN RF should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

CUBICIN RF should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10× ULN).

In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving CUBICIN RF [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, School of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece, Heraklion, Greece

Critical Care 2025, 29(S1) :P107

Introduction: PD-L1 inhibitors, pivotal in cancer therapy, can cause rare but severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including myasthenia gravis (MG). PD-L1-associated MG, characterized by profound respiratory or bulbar muscle weakness, frequently necessitates ICU care. This study reviews five ICU cases, focusing on clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for this critical condition.

Methods: Five lung cancer patients undergoing PD-L1 inhibitor therapy were admitted to the ICU in Heraklion, Greece, with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to severe respiratory muscle weakness. Symptoms, including dyspnea, emerged one month after their last treatment. Evaluations included clinical assessments, biochemical tests (CPK), electromyography (EMG), and serological analyses for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) autoantibodies.

Results: All patients exhibited severe respiratory muscle failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Diagnoses of MG were supported by EMG findings, with differential diagnoses including myositis and myocarditis. Serological tests for AChR and MuSK antibodies were negative or borderline, complicating diagnosis. Treatment included corticosteroids and plasmapheresis, initiated on day 10 in four patients and day 4 in one. ICU stays lasted approximately one month. Respiratory muscle weakness persisted throughout, leading to hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency. Four patients died due to complications, including infections and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The sole survivor required prolonged rehabilitation post-discharge.

Conclusions: PD-L1-associated MG is a life-threatening condition defined by refractory respiratory muscle failure and persistent hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency, with high morbidity and mortality. Further studies are essential to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms, identify risk factors, and optimize management strategies.

### Daptomycin [^1128G1Ao]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to daptomycin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving daptomycin should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive daptomycin, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with daptomycin.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, daptomycin should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

Daptomycin should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10×ULN).

In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving daptomycin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

###: a rare genetic condition with severe clinical presentation of encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac rhythm disorders in 2 children [^111tMn19]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Biallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in Transport and Golgi Organization 2 (TANGO-2) are associated with a spectrum of clinical features including encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac rhythm disorders, and neurologic regression. We are reporting on 2 unrelated children with biallelic TANGO-2 pathogenic variants. These variants were identified through a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel of genes associated with hereditary rhabdomyolysis. Both children had a history of developmental delay, especially in their motor milestones. They also experienced episodic transient weakness with acute illness. One of the children's siblings had similar complaints and died at an early age. During their illness, both children developed extreme lethargy with very high CPK levels, lactic acidosis, rising trends of transaminases, and recurrent hypoglycemia. Both patients developed ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and the echocardiogram showed cardiomyopathy. Despite intensive symptomatic management, both patients died of cardiac failure because of fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Genetic testing revealed the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants TANGO-2. This rare genetic condition should be suspected in any patient with episodic recurrent weakness, rhabdomyolysis, abdominal pain, and cardiac arrhythmias, because of its diverse clinical presentation. However, early diagnosis is challenging because there are no specific biochemical markers for the disease. There is strong evidence that vitamin B supplementation can significantly reduce the number of metabolic crises in these children. Although this is not a targeted therapy, it can be a potentially life-saving treatment for these patients.

### Isotretinoin (Zenatane) [^112JnY6b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipids: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Zenatane is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Zenatane therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids).
Liver Function Tests: Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Zenatane has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity).
Glucose: Some patients receiving Zenatane have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Zenatane therapy, although no causal relationship has been established.
CPK: Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Zenatane therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial.

### Niacin [^113Qa6Zx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Skeletal
Muscle

Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.

5.3
Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release.

Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release doses ranging from 500 mg to 3,000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN.

Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^112j4vrx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, rhabdomyolysis in ICU patients is associated with distinct clinical characteristics and a higher rate of adverse outcomes. Male gender, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation are key risk factors for poor outcomes, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring. The presence of rhabdomyolysis alone does not constitute an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in our patient cohort. While these findings offer valuable insights, the study's retrospective nature calls for prospective research to confirm results and improve clinical approaches for managing rhabdomyolysis in diverse ICU populations.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, piperacillin and tazobactam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Piperacillin and tazobactam may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and piperacillin and tazobactam discontinued if lesions progress.

5.3 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in pediatric and adult patients treated with piperacillin and tazobactam. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. If HLH is suspected, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam immediately and institute appropriate management.

5.4 Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and initiate appropriate therapy.

5.5 Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, piperacillin and tazobactam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with piperacillin and tazobactam administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.

Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) [^117N8pAj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In MTX-controlled trials, for up to 12/14 weeks, ALT and AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 0.8% and 0.4% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, 1.7% and 1.3% of patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg and in 1.9% and 0.9% of patients treated with MTX, respectively.

Lipid Elevations

Upadacitinib treatment was associated with dose-related increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Upadacitinib was also associated with increases in HDL cholesterol. Elevations in LDL and HDL cholesterol peaked by Week 8 and remained stable thereafter. In controlled trials, for up to 12/14 weeks, changes from baseline in lipid parameters in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg, respectively, are summarized below:

Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 14.81 mg/dL and 17.17 mg/dL.
Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 8.16 mg/dL and 9.01 mg/dL.
The mean LDL/HDL ratio remained stable.
Mean triglycerides increased by 13.55 mg/dL and 14.44 mg/dL.

Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations

In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, dose-related increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were observed. CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were reported in 1.0%, and 0.3% of patients over 12/14 weeks in the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Most elevations > 5 x ULN were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation. In RA-III and RA-V, CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, 1.6% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and none in patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica CR) [^11347Jfp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations

LYRICA treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for LYRICA‑treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on LYRICA and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal. Three LYRICA‑treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and LYRICA is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with LYRICA CR if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur.

5.12 Decreased Platelet Count

Both LYRICA CR and LYRICA treatment were associated with a decrease in platelet count. In the double‑blind phase of controlled studies for pain indication, LYRICA CR‑treated patients experienced a median change from baseline in platelet count of 11 × 10³/mm³(for the PHN population) and 14 × 10³/mm³(for the FM population) as compared to 1 × 10³/mm³in placebo‑treated patients (for both populations). LYRICA‑treated patients experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 20 × 10³/µL, compared to 11 × 10³/µL in placebo patients. In the overall database of controlled trials, 2% of placebo patients and 3% of LYRICA patients experienced a potentially clinically significant decrease in platelets, defined as 20% below baseline value and less than 150 × 10³/µL. A single LYRICA‑treated subject developed severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count less than 20 × 103/µL. In randomized controlled trials, LYRICA or LYRICA CR were not associated with an increase in bleeding‑related adverse reactions.

### Topiramate (trokendi XR) [^116xFLGw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Immediate-release topiramate treatment also produced a dose-related increase in the percentage of patients who had a shift from normal at baseline to high/increased (above the normal reference range) in total eosinophil count at the end of treatment. The incidence of these abnormal shifts was 6% for placebo, 10% for 5 mg/kg/day, 9% for 15 mg/kg/day, 14% for 25 mg/kg/day, and 11% for any topiramate dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There was a mean dose-related increase in alkaline phosphatase. The significance of these findings is uncertain.

Topiramate produced a dose-related increased incidence of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Treatment with immediate-release topiramate for up to 1 year was associated with reductions in Z SCORES for length, weight, and head circumference [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

In open-label, uncontrolled experience, increasing impairment of adaptive behavior was documented in behavioral testing over time in this population. There was a suggestion that this effect was dose-related. However, because of the absence of an appropriate control group, it is not known if this decrement in function was treatment related or reflects the patient's underlying disease (e.g., patients who received higher doses may have more severe underlying disease) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

In this open-label, uncontrolled study, the mortality was 37 deaths/1000 patient years. It is not possible to know whether this mortality rate is related to immediate-release topiramate treatment, because the background mortality rate for a similar, significantly refractory, young pediatric population (1 month to 24 months) with partial epilepsy is not known.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin) [^1122vCEq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with VYTORIN is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, temporarily suspend VYTORIN during the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. The concomitant use of VYTORIN with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is also contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

VYTORIN dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine or ranolazine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. VYTORIN use should be temporarily suspended in patients taking daptomycin. Lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and grapefruit juice may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Use the 80 mg daily dosage of VYTORIN only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg daily chronically without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. If patients treated with VYTORIN 80 mg are prescribed an interacting drug that increases the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, switch to an alternate statin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue VYTORIN if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if VYTORIN is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue VYTORIN in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the VYTORIN dosage and advise patients receiving VYTORIN 80 mg of the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^116PGhGA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Pyridox(am)ine 5′‐phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is responsible for the synthesis of PLP from pyridoxine and for its recycling. PNPO deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from antiquitin deficiency, except that most patients are born prematurely. Some respond to pyridoxine, but a trial of PLP should be considered if neonatal epileptic encephalopathy does not respond to pyridoxine or shows a partial response. Pyridoxine‐responsive seizures have also been reported in hyperprolinaemia type II. Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate accumulates and inactivates PLP by a similar reaction to that in antiquitin deficiency. Long‐term treatment with pyridoxine is recommended, though there was little evidence of benefit in one small series.

Seizures may also be a presenting feature for biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiencies. Severe biotinidase deficiency has predominantly neurological features and typically presents between 1 and 4 months of age. In contrast, patients with HCS deficiency can present at any age from a few hours to mid‐childhood, usually with acidosis, which may be accompanied by hyperammonaemia. Alopecia and rashes occur in both conditions. All patients with biotinidase deficiency respond to biotin, as do most with HCS deficiency, though higher doses may be needed. Deafness and neurodevelopmental problems are very common in patients with biotinidase deficiency presenting clinically but can be prevented by newborn screening. Most patients need no special treatment during acute illness if biotin is continued, but some with HCS deficiency require a high caloric intake to prevent decompensation, and insulin is reported to have helped one patient.

Non‐ketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH) is caused by a deficiency of the glycine cleavage system. Most patients present within hours or days of birth with poor feeding, hypotonia and lethargy, progressing to coma and, usually, apnoea. If ventilatory support is provided, spontaneous respiration resumes after about 10 days, but most patients have intractable epilepsy and make little developmental progress. A smaller number of patients present after 2 weeks of age with developmental delay and seizures. Treatment is primarily with sodium benzoate, which lowers glycine levels and is sometimes combined with dietary restriction of glycine and serine. Glycine is an activator of NMDA glutamate receptors, and treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonists Dextromethorphan or Ketamine can also help. Patients often require multiple anticonvulsants. The ketogenic diet can improve seizure control, as in other epilepsies, and has the additional benefit of lowering glycine levels by reducing its synthesis.

Results

Study population and demographics

The study included 1,660 individual patients after excluding repeated visits among 2,962 recorded visits. Serum CK levels were measured in 320 patients (19.3% of the total individual patients), with 99 patients (30.9% of those tested) showing elevated CK values. CK elevation was based on a single measurement in all cases. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 235 months, with a median age of 40 months and a mean age of 60 ± 54.3 months. Of the patients, 35 (35.4%) were female, and 64 (64.6%) were male. The demographic and biochemical characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1.

Biochemical parameters

The biochemical parameters in the study population had the following distributions. CK levels ranged from 172.0 to 21,362.0 U/L, with a median of 239.0 U/L. AST levels ranged from 22.0 to 391.0 U/L, with a median of 47.0 U/L. ALT levels ranged from 3.0 to 415.0 U/L, with a median of 25.0 U/L. LDH levels ranged from 150.0 to 1,789.0 U/L, with a median of 344.0 U/L. Uric acid levels ranged from 1.7 to 6.9 mg/dL, with a median of 3.5 mg/dL. Potassium levels ranged from 3.1 to 5.8 mmol/L, with a median of 4.1 mmol/L. ALP and GGT levels were also measured but were not included in further correlation analyses due to their limited relevance to muscle pathology.

A significant positive correlation was observed between CK and AST (r = 0.633, p < 0.001), ALT (r = 0.461, p < 0.001), and LDH levels (r = 0.570, p < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between CK and uric acid (r = 0.125, p = 0.218) or ALP (r = − 0.161, p = 0.112) (Table 2).

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. This process leads to the release of various cellular components into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, including proteins such as myoglobin and enzymes like creatine kinase (CK), as well as electrolytes. The severity of rhabdomyolysis can vary significantly, ranging from mild cases with minimal symptoms and slightly elevated CK levels to severe, life-threatening cases. Although traumatic injury is a common cause, a wide range of other factors can also trigger this condition. Previous studies and our research have confirmed that factors such as infection, certain medications, pancreatitis, alcohol consumption, electrolyte imbalance, excessive physical exertion, and heatstroke can also lead to elevated CK. The diverse range of potential causes underscores the complexity of this condition and the importance of considering rhabdomyolysis in various clinical scenarios.

Given the diverse etiology of rhabdomyolysis, patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) with critical illnesses are particularly susceptible to developing rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to severe complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS). Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and the incidence of AKI. Despite its clinical significance, the specific characteristics and risk factors contributing to mortality or adverse outcomes in ICU patients with rhabdomyolysis are not fully understood. Moreover, the relationship between elevated serum CK levels and increased patient mortality remains controversial. In light of these uncertainties, the objective of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ICU patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and to determine whether rhabdomyolysis constitutes a risk factor for outcomes within this patient population.

### Pitavastatin calcium (pitavastatin) [^113CFcpY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin tablets.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher pitavastatin tablets dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of pitavastatin tablets greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of pitavastatin tablets is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin tablets is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pitavastatin tablets dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with pitavastatin tablets may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1 grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue pitavastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if pitavastatin tablets is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Atorvastatin calcium [^111PxXkZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Atorvastatin exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin calcium tablets is not recommended. Atorvastatin calcium tablet dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with lipid modifying doses (> 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin calcium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue atorvastatin calcium tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if atorvastatin calcium tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin calcium tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the atorvastatin calcium tablet dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Association of ventilation volumes, pressures and rates with the mechanical power of ventilation in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome: exploring the impact of rate reduction [^113YXTsK]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

We performed a mediation analysis to explore how variables interact through a third variable, the mediator. This approach helps determine whether the effect of the first variable on the second is direct or occurs through the mediator. In our study, we assessed the impact of changes in Ppeak and respiratory rate as potential mediators, according to pre‐specified V T groups, on the amount of mechanical power. We adjusted for confounders based on clinical relevance, including compliance of the respiratory system; bicarbonate; ventilatory ratio; and ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO₂/FiO₂). In the primary analysis, mechanical power was dichotomised (cut‐off 17 J.min⁻¹) and in a sensitivity analyses it was a continuous variable. We estimated the total effect (of V T on mechanical power), the average causal mediation effect (how much of the effect of V T on mechanical power is explained by the mediator) and the average direct effect (how much of the effect of V T on mechanical power is still explained by V T after considering the effect of the mediator). Missing data were addressed via multiple imputations with predictive mean matching. Centres were included as random effects to adjust for this potential confounder.

### Levetiracetam (spritam) [^113p4UUi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Myoclonic Seizures

The safety and effectiveness of SPRITAM have been established as adjunctive treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Use is based on one controlled study that included 113 adult and pediatric patients as young as 12 years of age treated with levetiracetam with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Safety and effectiveness as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The safety and effectiveness of SPRITAM have been established as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Use is based on one controlled study that included 164 adult and pediatric patients treated with levetiracetam with generalized tonic-clonic seizures [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Safety and effectiveness as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

Studies of levetiracetam in juvenile rats (dosed on postnatal days 4 through 52) and dogs (dosed from postnatal weeks 3 through 7) at doses of up to 1800 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 and 24 times, respectively, the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg/day on a mg/m² basis) did not demonstrate adverse effects on postnatal development.

8.5 Geriatric Use

There were 347 subjects in clinical studies of levetiracetam that were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. There were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of levetiracetam in these patients.

Levetiracetam is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

QUESTION 7
In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, what are the best practices for statin deprescribing?

Synopsis

Deprescribing medications is an important part of the prescribing continuum and an essential component of high‐quality care for older adults with multiple comorbidities, geriatric syndromes and polypharmacy who are more susceptible to medication‐related harms. Benefits of deprescribing statins (e.g. taking fewer medications, avoiding interactions with other medications such as antibiotics or antifungal agents that are metabolized through the same pathway as the statin, avoiding adverse effects in general) must be balanced against the potential for harm, such as an increase in ASCVD events after statin discontinuation. General principles of deprescribing include viewing deprescribing as a routine part of care designed to improve patient well‐being (rather than withdrawal of appropriate care) and shared decision‐making with the patient/caregiver. Three large cohort studies provide evidence for clinicians and patients regarding the risks and benefits of statin discontinuation on cardiovascular events in older adults without a history of cardiovascular disease who are taking statins (Table 6). One small prospective trial found benefits of deprescribing among older adults near the end of life.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117DY5YH]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Drug–drug interactions between statin therapies and antiretroviral medications — Pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, while atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and fluvastatin is a major substrate of CYP2C9; all statins are susceptible to interactions related to drug transporters (OATP1B1). Ritonavir (RTV)- and cobicistat (COBI)-boosted antiretrovirals (ARVs) are particularly prone to drug–drug interactions with statins; when RTV- or COBI-boosted ARVs are coadministered with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, statin dose reduction, a switch to an alternative statin, or increased monitoring for statin-related adverse effects may be required, and lovastatin and simvastatin are contraindicated when coadministered with COBI or RTV. In general, some degree of drug–drug interactions may be expected between certain statins and HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), COBI-boosted elvitegravir, older non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, fostemsavir, and lenacapavir.

### Rituximab (Rituxan) [^114XqvEp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia

In patients with NHL receiving rituximab monotherapy, NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients. These included lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1–588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2–116 days). A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following RITUXAN therapy occurred during the single-arm studies.

In studies of monotherapy, RITUXAN-induced B-cell depletion occurred in 70% to 80% of patients with NHL. Decreased IgM and IgG serum levels occurred in 14% of these patients.

In CLL trials, the frequency of prolonged neutropenia and late-onset neutropenia was higher in patients treated with R-FC compared to patients treated with FC. Prolonged neutropenia is defined as Grade 3–4 neutropenia that has not resolved between 24 and 42 days after the last dose of study treatment. Late-onset neutropenia is defined as Grade 3–4 neutropenia starting at least 42 days after the last treatment dose.

In patients with previously untreated CLL, the frequency of prolonged neutropenia was 8.5% for patients who received R-FC (n = 402) and 5.8% for patients who received FC (n = 398). In patients who did not have prolonged neutropenia, the frequency of late-onset neutropenia was 14.8% of 209 patients who received R-FC and 4.3% of 230 patients who received FC.

For patients with previously treated CLL, the frequency of prolonged neutropenia was 24.8% for patients who received R-FC (n = 274) and 19.1% for patients who received FC (n = 274). In patients who did not have prolonged neutropenia, the frequency of late-onset neutropenia was 38.7% in 160 patients who received R-FC and 13.6% of 147 patients who received FC.

### Erythromycin [^112LnFkE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Theophylline

Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy.

There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a significant decrease in erythromycin serum concentrations of approximately 35 percent. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline could result in subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin.

Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class.

Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.

There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with oral anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly.

Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (CYP3A). Co-administration of erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin.

The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience:

Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine

Post-marketing reports indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and related benzodiazepines

Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors

Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (for example, lovastatin and simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), DIPRIVAN can be administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients to provide continuous sedation and control of stress responses only by persons skilled in the medical management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.

DIPRIVAN should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9, and 5.10)]. For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 0.6 mg/kg/hour) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect.

Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 3 mg/kg/hour) titrated to desired level of clinical response. With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^11462oeb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, although rhabdomyolysis has been reported in tumor patients following targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, our study found a lower incidence of malignant tumors in the RML group. This suggests that while rhabdomyolysis is a potential complication, it is relatively uncommon among ICU patients with malignancies. Muscle weakness, a notable symptom of rhabdomyolysis, was significantly more common in the RML group, highlighting its diagnostic importance. Additionally, the RML group had a markedly lower surgical intervention rate, suggesting that other factors contribute prominently to rhabdomyolysis occurrence.

For diagnosing rhabdomyolysis, while medical history and physical examinations offer valuable insights, laboratory studies confirm the diagnosis. CK levels are the most sensitive indicators of myocyte injury in rhabdomyolysis. Our analysis revealed significantly elevated CK levels in the RML group, alongside increased serum myoglobin and troponin I levels. Elevated myoglobin can lead to AKI through myoglobin precipitation with Tamm-Horsfall protein in acidic urine, causing tubular occlusion, and through hydroxyl radical oxidation. Troponin levels, although typically associated with cardiac conditions, can also be elevated due to non-cardiac causes such as rhabdomyolysis. Our findings confirmed abnormally elevated levels of troponin in the RML group.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of tirofiban IV (also known as Aggrastat):

- **Anaphylaxis**: assess the patient's medical history for known hypersensitivity reactions to Tirofiban or other antiplatelet agents.
- **Bleeding**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders, recent surgery, or underlying conditions. Assess the patient's medical history for bleeding disorders or risk factors. Use the lowest effective dose of Tirofiban. If bleeding occurs, discontinue Tirofiban and implement appropriate measures to control and manage the bleeding. Administer blood products or specific reversal agents, if necessary.
- **Hypertensive crisis**: use extreme caution in patients with pre-existing hypertension or underlying cardiac disease. Monitor BP regularly in patients receiving Tipranavir. Initiate appropriate antihypertensive therapy based on the severity of hypertension and patient's individual characteristics.
- **Thrombocytopenia**: use extreme caution in patients with platelet count < 150,000/mm³. Perform baseline platelet count before initiating Tirofiban therapy. Monitor platelet count regularly, especially within the first few days of treatment. Discontinue Tirofiban and provide appropriate supportive care. Administer platelet transfusions or other interventions as necessary.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^113oMYjc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study underscores statistically significant variations in gender distribution, infection rates, muscle weakness incidence, and surgical intervention frequency between ICU patients with and without rhabdomyolysis. Notably, the RML group exhibited a significantly higher proportion of male patients, corroborating previous findings that suggest male gender is a critical predisposing factor for rhabdomyolysis.

Regarding the relationship between in-hospital mortality rates and pre-ICU LOS, patients with a longer pre-ICU LOS have been reported to exhibit higher mortality rates. However, other studies suggest no significant correlation between pre-ICU LOS and ICU mortality or ICU length of stay (LOS). In our study, the significantly shorter pre-ICU LOS and lower proportion of extended pre-ICU stays in the RML group reflect the acute nature of rhabdomyolysis requiring urgent critical care. These findings emphasize the importance of early recognition and intervention in at-risk patients. Future studies should focus on developing predictive models to optimize ICU admission timing and improve outcomes for patients with rhabdomyolysis.

### Intracranial hemorrhage due to late-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding [^11265xi1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K prophylaxis at birth has been the standard of care for over 60 years in the United States. However, parent refusal rates have been increasing with devastating effects. Here, we present a case of a 2-month-old male presenting to a pediatric emergency department with late-onset Vitamin K Deficient Bleeding secondary to parental refusal of prophylaxis at birth. The patient presented with a large intracranial hemorrhage due to Vitamin K deficiency. However, definitive neurosurgical operative repair was delayed due to profound coagulopathy. After Vitamin K and supportive blood products were administered in the emergency department and pediatric intensive care unit, the patient was stabilized for operative repair and has only minimal residual deficits at the most recent follow-up. This case report highlights the potentially devastating effects of Vitamin K Deficient Bleeding and how emergency department management may differ from other etiologies of intracranial hemorrhage. This is especially significant now given the broader rise in medical skepticism, which increasingly challenges longstanding, evidence-based preventive practices.

### Clinical and biological profiles associated with the time of occurrence of citrate accumulation in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112r5iLc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Few studies have reported the time of occurrence of CA after CRRT initiation. Khadhzynov et al. showed that CA occurred promptly after CRRT initiation (i.e. during the first 48 h) in 70% of the cases and Schultheiß et al. found that 90% of patients presented CA during the first 24 h. In the present study, only 9% of patients presented with late-onset CA, defined as CA occurring after 24 h. Interestingly, lactate concentration at CRRT initiation was not increased in these patients compared to the rest of the cohort but did increase at CA diagnosis, suggesting a secondary deterioration in the ICU concomitant with CA. As late-onset CA cannot be predicted at the time of CRRT initiation, subsequent clinical deterioration such as rising vasopressor requirements or an increase in lactate levels, occurring later in the ICU course, should prompt clinicians to consider CA as a potential complication and adjust monitoring and management accordingly. Mortality was also extremely high in the late-onset group, highlighting the need for vigilance in all patients receiving RCA-CRRT who exhibit signs of ongoing CA.

### Irinotecan hydrochloride (Onivyde) [^115G8Dza]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Severe Diarrhea

ONIVYDE can cause severe and life-threatening diarrhea. Do not administer ONIVYDE to patients with a bowel obstruction. Severe or life-threatening diarrhea can follow one of two patterns: late onset diarrhea (onset more than 24 hours following chemotherapy) and early onset diarrhea (onset within 24 hours of chemotherapy, sometimes occurring with other symptoms of cholinergic reaction) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. An individual patient may experience both early and late-onset diarrhea.

In NAPOLI 3, Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea (early and late-onset) occurred in 20% receiving ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (NALIRIFOX). In NAPOLI-1, Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in 13% receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late onset diarrhea was 9% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 early onset diarrhea was 3% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. Of patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV in NAPOLI-1, 34% received loperamide for late-onset diarrhea and 26% received atropine for early-onset diarrhea.

To reduce the risk of severe diarrhea, patients should stop lactose-containing products, eat a low-fat diet and maintain hydration during treatment with ONIVYDE. Withhold ONIVYDE for Grade 2–4 diarrhea. Administer intravenous or subcutaneous atropine 0.25 to 1 mg (unless clinically contraindicated) for early onset diarrhea of any severity. Initiate loperamide for late onset diarrhea of any severity. Local institutional guidelines should be followed for the treatment of diarrhea that does not improve within 48 hours and may include the addition of diphenoxylate hydrochloride plus atropine sulfate or octreotide. Following recovery to Grade 1 diarrhea, resume ONIVYDE at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy… [^112EzDyz]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, also known as Janz syndrome or impulsive petit mal, is a form of hereditary, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, representing 5–10% of all epilepsy cases. Typically it first presents between the ages of 12 and 18 with myoclonic seizures. These events typically occur after awakening from sleep, during the evening or when sleep-deprived. JME is also characterized by generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and a minority of patients have absence seizures. It was first described by Théodore Herpin in 1857. Understanding of the genetics of JME has been rapidly evolving since the 1990s, and over 20 chromosomal loci and multiple genes have been identified. Given the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of JME some authors have suggested that it should be thought of as a spectrum disorder.

Approximately 15% of children with childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy subsequently develop JME. In most cases, myoclonic jerks precede the first generalized tonic–clonic seizure by a mean of 3. 3 years. A long-term population-based study suggested that 25 years after seizure onset, 17% of people with JME had all seizure types resolved, and 13% only experienced myoclonus despite having discontinued medication, meaning that approximately a third no longer had troublesome seizures. JME may be associated with an elevated prevalence of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, mood disorders, and personality disorders. Signs and symptoms There are three principal seizure types which may occur in JME: myoclonus, generalized tonic–clonic seizures and absence seizures. Approximately one-third of patients have all three seizure types. The majority of patients have frequent myoclonic jerks, with some sources stating that all patients with JME have myoclonic seizures. Generalized tonic–clonic seizures are less common but still reported in 85–90%. Absence seizures are believed to be least common, with an estimated prevalence between 10% and 40%. Seizures associated with JME tend to take place 30 minutes to an hour after waking up in the morning. Common triggers for JME seizures include lack of sleep, alcohol consumption, emotional stress, anxiety, and fatigue. A notable portion of JME patients exhibit photosensitivity, whereby flashing lights from sources like sunlight, TV screens, and computers can provoke seizures. Individuals with photosensitivity tend to experience seizures at an earlier stage. Myoclonic status epilepticus may occur as a complication but is uncommon.

Patients typically present to medical providers following their first generalized tonic–clonic seizure, by which time they have often had myoclonus for several years. The first generalized tonic–clonic seizure usually occurs in the context of a particular provoking factor, such as sleep deprivation, stress or alcohol consumption. Other potential provoking factors include "praxis induction" which is the precipitation of seizures or epileptiform discharges in the context of a complex cognitive tasks. Patients with JME tend to perform worse on neuropsychological assessments in multiple cognitive domains and are also more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety when compared to control populations. The majority of patients with JME report satisfaction with their health, work, friendships and social life. The majority of identified genes associated with JME encode for ion channel subunits.

### Generalized epilepsy… [^117JcFfh]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Generalized epilepsy can be broken down into six main subcategories of seizure types: absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, clonic seizures, tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and atonic seizures. Generalized epilepsy can also be a sign of an underlying seizure syndrome. Generalized seizures are most commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications and in rare cases surgical intervention.
- The incidence of generalized epilepsy is highest in childhood and in patients older than 75. However, children are more likely to be diagnosed with generalized epilepsy than those older than
75.
- Tonic clonic seizures are the most common type of generalized seizure and account for one third of all adolescent onset epilepsies.
- Seizures that are characterized as forms of generalized are more likely to present in the morning upon awakening.
- About half of all cases of generalized epilepsy have an unknown cause.

Though it is not believed to be the site of origin for the seizures, there is some belief that these pathways have a role in lowering the seizure threshold in some patients. Other connections between the thalamus and cerebellum and the thalamus and the basal ganglia have been implicated in the mechanism behind generalized epilepsy. However, the exact underlying cause of generalized epilepsy is unknown. Seizure types Myoclonic seizures Myoclonic seizures present as sudden, irregular, and brief muscle spasms or jerking in only one extremity or throughout the body. Symptoms are most commonly visualized in the upper extremities with quick muscle contraction followed by relaxation. Some atypical presentations could include eyelid fluttering and associated sensitivity to bright lights. These seizures are more commonly diagnosed during childhood. Tonic, Clonic, and Tonic- clonic seizures Generalized seizures can also be characterized as solely tonic or solely clonic.

Tonic seizures are characterized by increased muscle tone and rigidity. This type of muscle contraction most commonly leads to falls. Tonic seizures are short-lived and usually occur during sleep. Clonic seizure are characterized by repetitive muscle contractions that occur on both sides of the body at the same time. These types of seizures are rare and instead of often visualized as part of a tonic-clonic seizure. Tonic
- Clonic seizures presents as a sudden loss of consciousness followed by an initial brief tonic phase or muscle stiffening followed by a longer clonic phase that is characterized by a bilateral and rhythmic jerking of the entire body usually lasting a few minutes. A prodrome may occur in some people prior to the onset of the seizure. After the seizure, there is usually a period of confusion and tiredness also known as a post-ictal period that can last a variable amount of time.

Other associated symptoms that can occur during this type of seizure include: production of excess saliva, loss of bowel or bladder control, and tongue/cheek biting. Atonic seizures Atonic seizures cause a sudden loss of muscle tone. They are most noticeable with loss of muscle tone in the neck muscles causing head drop or loss of tone in the trunk muscles leading to falls. They are commonly referred to as drop attacks and episodes usually only last a few seconds. They are commonly diagnosed in childhood and are an important characteristics of certain epilepsy syndromes. Seizure syndromes Generalized epilepsy can also manifest as part of various seizure syndromes. These include: Idiopathic generalized epilepsy
- childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic clonic seizures alone.

### Epilepsy… [^1166tk7U]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of epilepsy typically requires at least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart. In some cases, however, it may be diagnosed after a single unprovoked seizure if clinical evidence suggests a high risk of recurrence. Isolated seizures that occur without recurrence risk or are provoked by identifiable causes are not considered indicative of epilepsy. Most cases of epilepsy — approximately 69% — can be effectively controlled with anti-seizure medications, and inexpensive treatment options are widely available. For those whose seizures do not respond to drugs, other approaches, such as surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes, may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. Generalized seizures Generalized seizures originate at a specific point within, and quickly spread across both hemispheres through interconnected brain networks.

Although the spread is rapid, the onset may appear asymmetric in some cases. These seizures typically impair consciousness from the outset and can take several forms, including:

- Generalized tonic–clonic seizures, often with an initial tonic phase followed by clonic jerking;
- Absence seizures, which may present with eye blinking or automatisms;
- Other generalized seizures, a category that includes tonic, clonic, myoclonic, atonic seizures and epileptic spasms. Tonic–clonic seizures are among the most recognizable seizure types, typically involving sudden loss of consciousness, stiffening, and rhythmic jerking of the limbs. This form of seizure — whether focal to bilateral, generalized, or of unknown onset — is given particular emphasis due to their clinical severity; they are associated with the highest risk of injury, medical complications, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

Myoclonic seizures involve sudden, brief muscle jerks, which may affect specific muscle groups or the whole body. They can cause falls and injury. Absence seizures are characterized by brief lapses in awareness, sometimes accompanied by subtle movements such as blinking or slight head turning. The person typically recovers immediately afterward without confusion. Atonic seizures involve a sudden loss of muscle tone, often resulting in falls. Triggers and reflex seizures Certain external or internal factors may increase the likelihood of a seizure in individuals with epilepsy. Common triggers include sleep deprivation, stress, fever, illness, menstruation, alcohol, and certain medications. These do not cause seizures by themselves, but lower the threshold in people who are already susceptible. Seizure clusters Seizure clusters refer to multiple seizures occurring over a short period of time, with incomplete recovery between events.

They are distinct from status epilepticus, though the two may overlap. Definitions vary across studies, but seizure clusters are typically described as two or more seizures within 24 hours or a noticeable increase in seizure frequency over a person's usual baseline. Estimates of their prevalence range widely — from 5% to 50% of people with epilepsy — largely due to differing definitions and populations studied. Seizure clusters are more common in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy, high baseline seizure frequency, or certain epilepsy syndromes. They are associated with increased emergency care utilization, worse quality of life, impaired psychosocial functioning, and possibly elevated risk of mortality. Postictal state After the active portion of a seizure there is typically a period of recovery during which there is confusion, referred to as the postictal state, before a normal level of consciousness returns, lasting minutes to days.

### Signs and symptoms… [^1128deE1]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Convulsive status epilepticus, the most dangerous and life-threatening type, is characterized by seizures of the tonic–clonic type, with a regular pattern of contraction and extension of the arms and legs, lasting at least 5 minutes without return to normal. Early treatment is essential to minimize damage to the brain, which starts to particularly accrue after 30 minutes. Benzodiazepines are the preferred initial treatment, after which typically phenytoin is given. Possible benzodiazepines include intravenous lorazepam as well as intramuscular injections of midazolam. A number of other medications may be used if these are not effective, such as phenobarbital, propofol, or ketamine. After initial treatment with benzodiazepines, typical antiseizure drugs are given, including valproate, fosphenytoin, levetiracetam, or similar substances. Intubation may be required to help maintain the person's airway.

Between 10% and 30% of people who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. Convulsive Convulsive status epilepticus presents an urgent neurological condition, which is characterized by an elongated and uncontrollable onset of seizures in which a regular pattern of contraction and extension of the arms and legs will be observed from the patient. The symptoms can be managed by initially introducing a seizure suppressing medication as the first stage of the treatment, which optimally works only for that stage because any delay will reduce the efficacy of those medications. Refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that continues despite treatment with benzodiazepines and one antiepileptic drug. Super-refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anaesthetic therapy, including those cases where status epilepticus recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia.

Treatments Benzodiazepines are the preferred initial treatment after which typically phenytoin or fosphenytoin is given. First aid guidelines for seizures state that, as a rule, an ambulance should be called for seizures lasting longer than five minutes. Benzodiazepines When given intravenously, lorazepam appears to be superior to diazepam for stopping seizure activity. Intramuscular midazolam appears to be a reasonable alternative especially in those who are not in hospital.

The benzodiazepine of choice in North America for initial treatment is lorazepam, due to its relatively long duration of action when injected, and particularly due to its rapid onset of action, which is thought to be due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and low lipid solubility. This causes the drug to remain in the vascular compartment. If lorazepam is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given. Alternatively, medication, such as glucagon, should be given through the bone. In several countries outside North America, such as the Netherlands, intravenous clonazepam is regarded as the drug of first choice. Cited advantages of clonazepam include a longer duration of action than diazepam and a lower propensity for the development of acute tolerance than lorazepam. The use of clonazepam for this indication is not recognized in North America, perhaps because it is not available as an intravenous formulation there.
