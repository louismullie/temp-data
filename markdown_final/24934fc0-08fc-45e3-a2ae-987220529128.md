## Question

Can lamotrigine be used to treat acute decompensated heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lamotrigine (Lamictal) can be used to treat acute decompensated heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what lamotrigine is indicated for and its core pharmacology. Then, I should verify any cardiac-specific warnings on the FDA label. Next, I will check if there is any clinical evidence or guideline endorsement for lamotrigine in ADHF. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits against risks in the context of ADHF pathophysiology. Finally, I will cross-check current standards of care to ensure the recommendation aligns with evidence-based practice [^1177Rx2o] [^1166thM7] [^11587JqX].

> Let me first confirm lamotrigine's approved uses and mechanism, so I don't jump to conclusions. Lamotrigine is approved for epilepsy syndromes and for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder, not for any heart failure indication, and its primary mechanism is inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels with class IB–like antiarrhythmic properties in vitro, which is pharmacologically relevant to cardiac conduction considerations rather than heart failure hemodynamics [^111L2Cwz] [^114Ls1rq] [^1177Rx2o] [^111goRVX].

> Wait, let me verify the cardiac safety language because this will be pivotal in ADHF. The FDA labeling cautions use in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease due to potential proarrhythmic effects, and specifically notes that in such patients lamotrigine could slow ventricular conduction, whereas healthy volunteers did not show QRS widening in a thorough QT study; that distinction matters in decompensated HF where conduction reserve is limited. I also need to remember that DRESS can involve myocarditis, which would be catastrophic in a decompensated setting, so the risk profile is not benign in HF patients [^116szzRX] [^1177Rx2o] [^111goRVX] [^113wao1N].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for lamotrigine in ADHF, and I need to check guidelines to be sure I'm not missing an off-label niche. Hold on, after scanning, I find no randomized trials, no case series, and no guideline recommendations supporting lamotrigine for ADHF; conversely, the contemporary AHA/ACC/HFSA and ESC guidelines detail diuretics, vasodilators, inotropes, and neurohormonal therapies without any mention of lamotrigine as therapy. The available cardiac literature around lamotrigine centers on potential conduction effects and arrhythmia risk signals, not therapeutic benefit in HF [^1166thM7] [^11587JqX] [^113ggybE] [^113rrTZw] [^115mVn2A] [^116GFu8o].

> I will now examine pathophysiologic fit and risk–benefit in ADHF, because even theoretical plausibility should be vetted. ADHF is driven by congestion, elevated filling pressures, and impaired perfusion with neurohormonal activation; sodium-channel blockade by lamotrigine does not decongest, vasodilate, or augment forward flow, and in susceptible myocardium could slow conduction and precipitate arrhythmias, worsening hemodynamics. But wait, what if the in vitro class IB activity were neutral or beneficial? The label already cautions conduction risk in structural heart disease, and DRESS-associated myocarditis is an additional severe, albeit rare, hazard that ADHF patients could ill tolerate, so the net clinical rationale remains unfavorable [^111goRVX] [^1177Rx2o] [^113wao1N] [^114fTzzD].

> Hmm, wait a minute, is lamotrigine actually contraindicated in heart failure, or am I overstating this. I should double-check the exact wording. The FDA labeling does not list a formal contraindication for heart failure but explicitly advises caution in clinically important structural or functional heart disease due to arrhythmia risk and possible ventricular conduction slowing in such patients; that means it is not absolutely contraindicated on label terms, yet in ADHF the risk–benefit remains clearly negative and off-label use for decompensation is not supportable [^116szzRX] [^111goRVX].

> Let me now anchor against the evidence-based standard of care, so recommendations are actionable. In ADHF, guideline-directed management focuses on rapid decongestion with IV loop diuretics and titration to resolve clinical congestion, consideration of vasodilators when blood pressure permits, and vasopressors like norepinephrine if shock is present; in stabilized HFrEF admissions, initiation or up-titration of ARNI such as sacubitril/valsartan reduces biomarkers and rehospitalization, and diuretic delivery strategies such as continuous infusion can be used in high-risk diuretic resistance settings, none of which create any therapeutic role for lamotrigine [^113ggybE] [^11587JqX] [^117PGTsj] [^112cif67] [^111ZemDZ].

> I should also consider the practical scenario where a patient with ADHF is already taking lamotrigine for seizures or bipolar disorder, because management nuances matter. Hold on, I should verify discontinuation guidance: for epilepsy, abrupt cessation risks seizure destabilization, so dose tapering is advised unless safety mandates faster withdrawal, whereas in bipolar trials abrupt stop did not show increased adverse reactions, and coadministration with valproate significantly increases lamotrigine levels and rash risk; in an ADHF admission, I would avoid adding other sodium channel blockers, correct electrolytes, monitor ECG if continuing lamotrigine, and reassess necessity in concert with neurology or psychiatry [^115CkSN4] [^113dixXR] [^116szzRX] [^111goRVX].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion is tightly aligned to the data and guidelines. There is no therapeutic rationale, no clinical evidence, and no guideline support for using lamotrigine to treat acute decompensated heart failure, and FDA labeling warns of conduction slowing and arrhythmia risk in structural heart disease while hypersensitivity syndromes can involve myocarditis; therefore, lamotrigine should not be used for ADHF and may worsen outcomes in this population, whereas established ADHF therapies should be employed instead [^1166thM7] [^11587JqX] [^113ggybE] [^1177Rx2o] [^111goRVX] [^113wao1N].

Lamotrigine is not recommended for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) because it has **no proven benefit** and may cause or worsen arrhythmias [^1177Rx2o], especially in patients with structural heart disease or conduction abnormalities [^111goRVX] [^116szzRX]. It is not included in heart failure guidelines and **should be avoided in ADHF** unless absolutely necessary for seizure control, with close ECG and clinical monitoring.

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to cardiovascular function

Lamotrigine is a sodium channel blocker with class IB antiarrhythmic-like properties [^1177Rx2o] [^111goRVX]. At therapeutic doses, it does not widen the QRS in healthy individuals [^1177Rx2o], but in structural heart disease or conduction disease it may slow ventricular conduction and **increase arrhythmia risk** [^115mVn2A]. The risk is higher with other sodium channel blockers [^116szzRX] or in patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding lamotrigine use in heart failure

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting lamotrigine for ADHF. It is not included in ACC/AHA/HFSA or ESC guidelines for acute or chronic heart failure management. Standard ADHF care includes diuretics [^113ggybE], vasodilators, inotropes, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) [^112U2zWv] — not lamotrigine [^112cif67].

---

## Potential cardiovascular risks associated with lamotrigine

Lamotrigine has been linked to cardiovascular adverse effects [^114qzdHq], including **arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities** [^1177Rx2o], particularly in patients with structural heart disease or conduction system disease [^116szzRX] [^115mVn2A]. These risks are particularly concerning in ADHF, where such disturbances can worsen outcomes.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not address lamotrigine in heart failure [^112U2zWv], and there is **no guideline support** for its use in ADHF; it is not indicated for cardiovascular conditions [^111L2Cwz].

---

## Clinical scenarios where lamotrigine might be considered

Lamotrigine may be considered in ADHF **only when necessary for seizure control** [^111L2Cwz] or bipolar disorder, with careful monitoring for cardiovascular adverse effects [^1177Rx2o]. It **should be avoided** in patients with known conduction abnormalities [^111goRVX], structural heart disease, or significant arrhythmia risk [^116szzRX].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments for acute decompensated heart failure

Evidence-based treatments for ADHF include:

- **Intravenous diuretics**: Loop diuretics to relieve congestion and reduce hospitalizations [^113ggybE] [^111ZemDZ].
- **Vasodilators**: Nitrates or nitroprusside to reduce preload and afterload in selected patients [^11587JqX].
- **Inotropes**: Dobutamine or milrinone for low-output states or cardiogenic shock.
- **Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)**: Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors to improve outcomes [^112U2zWv] [^113aUHja] [^113Scz1b].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Lamotrigine is **not recommended for ADHF** due to lack of benefit [^112U2zWv] and potential arrhythmia risk [^1177Rx2o]. It should be avoided in patients with structural heart disease or conduction abnormalities [^111goRVX]; if required for seizure control, use close ECG and clinical monitoring [^116GFu8o]. Use **evidence-based therapies** for ADHF and reserve lamotrigine for its approved indications [^111L2Cwz].

### Lamictal [^1177Rx2o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Folate metabolism**: In vitro, lamotrigine inhibited dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this enzyme may interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. When oral daily doses of lamotrigine were given to pregnant rats during organogenesis, fetal, placental, and maternal folate concentrations were reduced. Significantly reduced concentrations of folate are associated with teratogenesis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Folate concentrations were also reduced in male rats given repeated oral doses of lamotrigine. Reduced concentrations were partially returned to normal when supplemented with folinic acid.

	- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: In vitro studies show that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. It inhibits human cardiac sodium channels with rapid onset and offset kinetics and strong voltage dependence, consistent with other Class IB antiarrhythmic agents. At therapeutic doses, Lamictal did not slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) in healthy individuals in a thorough QT study; however, in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease (i.e. patients with heart failure, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac channelopathies [e.g. Brugada syndrome], clinically important ischemic heart disease, or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease), Lamictal could slow ventricular conduction.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of lamotrigine PO (also known as Lamictal):

- **Blood dyscrasias, aseptic meningitis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as lamotrigine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Use caution in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease. Recognize that concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may further increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

- **Decreased serum lamotrigine levels**: Use caution in patients taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Adjust lamotrigine dosage in patients initiating or discontinuing estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.

- **DRESS syndrome**: Use caution in all patients. Recognize that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever and lymphadenopathy, may be present even though a rash is not evident. Instruct patients to report any rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity.

- **Seizure**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Use caution in all patients. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior.

### Cardiorenal nexus: A review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^111H5fgr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The cardiorenal nexus encompasses a bidirectional relationship between the heart and the kidneys, whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of one can lead to acute or chronic dysfunction of the other. The term "cardiorenal syndrome" has become established to capture the nexus of heart and kidney dysfunction.

- **Cardiorenal syndrome types**: The cardiorenal syndrome can be subdivided into five types to allow characterization by initiating organ and acuity or chronicity. Types 1 and 3 describe the acute onset setting, and types 2 and 4 describe the chronic setting. Type 5 cardiorenal syndrome is characterized by the simultaneous injury or dysfunction of the heart and kidney due to acute or chronic systemic disorders such as sepsis or amyloidosis. Although this subdivision helps facilitate diagnosis and therapy, the syndrome types can co-occur, and an acute condition can progress to chronicity if not identified and managed early.

There is a renewed focus and optimism around the cardiorenal nexus and its management, brought about by the beneficial potential of recent treatment advances. However, broader understanding and recognition of the cardiorenal nexus and its underlying chronic syndromes are needed to support early recognition and a holistic, comprehensive management approach. We present a narrative review that focuses on chronic cardiorenal syndromes, type 2 and type 4, providing an overview of their epidemiology, outcomes, pathophysiology, and the most recent advances in patient care. This narrative review was developed with the help of nonsystematic, targeted literature searches in PubMed, and its reporting.

### Disposition of acute decompensated heart failure from the emergency department: An evidence-based review [^117P4meq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (HF) exacerbation is a serious and common condition seen in the Emergency Department (ED) that has significant morbidity and mortality. There are multiple clinical decision tools that emergency physicians (EPs) can use to reach an appropriate evidence-based disposition for these patients.

- **Objective**: This narrative review is an evidence-based discussion of clinical decision-making tools aimed to assist EPs in risk stratifying patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and determining disposition.

- **Discussion**: Risk stratification in patients with AHF exacerbation presenting to the ED is paramount in reaching an appropriate disposition decision. High-risk features include hypotension, hypoxemia, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and/or troponin, elevated creatinine, and hyponatremia. Patients who require continuous vasoactive infusions, respiratory support, or are initially treatment-resistant generally require intensive care unit admission. In most instances, new-onset AHF patients should be admitted for further evaluation. Other AHF patients in the ED can be risk stratified with the Ottawa HF Risk Score (OHFRS), the Multiple Estimation of Risk Based on Spanish Emergency Department Score (MEESSI), or the Emergency HF Mortality Risk Grade (EHFMRG). These tools take various factors into account, such as mode of arrival to the ED, vital signs, laboratory values like troponin and pro-BNP, and clinical course. If used appropriately, these scores can predict patients at low risk for adverse outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: This article discusses evidence-based disposition of patients.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116Sozjt]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common, costly, and debilitating syndrome. It is associated with a highly complex drug regimen, numerous comorbidities, and a large and often disparate group of healthcare providers. All these factors contribute to an increased risk of heart failure exacerbation, either through direct myocardial toxicity, drug-drug interactions, or both. This scientific statement serves as a comprehensive and accessible resource outlining drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure. It aims to assist healthcare providers in enhancing the quality of care for these patients.

### Complex and potentially harmful medication patterns in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116EssLp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Complex medication regimens, often present in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, may increase the risk of adverse drug effects and harm. We sought to characterize this complexity by determining the prevalence of polypharmacy, potentially inappropriate medications, and therapeutic competition (where a medication for one condition may worsen another condition) in one of the few dedicated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction programs in the United States.

- **Methods**: We conducted a chart review on 231 patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction seen in the University of Michigan's Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Clinic between July 2016 and September 2019. We recorded: 1) standing medications to determine the presence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 10 medications; 2) potentially inappropriate medications based on the 2016 American Heart Association Scientific Statement on drugs that pose a major risk of causing or exacerbating heart failure, the 2019 Beers Criteria update, or a previously described list of medications associated with geriatric syndromes; and 3) competing conditions and subsequent medications that could create therapeutic competition.

- **Results**: The prevalence of polypharmacy was 74%, and the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications was 100%. Competing conditions were present in 81% of patients, of whom 49% took a medication that created therapeutic competition.

- **Conclusion**: In addition to confirming that polypharmacy was highly prevalent, we found that potentially inappropriate medications were also common.

### Lamictal XR [^113wao1N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions and organ failure are significant concerns with the use of lamotrigine. These reactions, also referred to as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have been associated with fatal and life-threatening outcomes. DRESS typically presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, alongside involvement of other organ systems such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes mimicking an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present, and the disorder can manifest variably, potentially affecting other organ systems not specified here.

Fatalities linked to acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients participating in epilepsy clinical trials for lamotrigine. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also occurred in postmarketing use.

There have been instances of isolated liver failure without accompanying rash or involvement of other organs with lamotrigine.

It is crucial to recognize that early signs of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even in the absence of a rash. If any such signs or symptoms are noted, an immediate evaluation is necessary. LAMICTAL XR should be discontinued unless an alternative cause for the symptoms can be determined.

Before starting treatment with LAMICTAL XR, patients should be informed about the potential for rash and other hypersensitivity signs or symptoms, such as fever and lymphadenopathy.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^116RG8vA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

It remains unclear whether beta-blocker use at hospital admission is associated with better in-hospital outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. To address this, we evaluated the factors independently associated with beta-blocker use at admission and the effect of beta-blocker use on in-hospital mortality among 3,817 patients enrolled in the Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure registry. Of these patients, 1,512 (39.7%) were receiving beta-blockers, while 2,305 (60.3%) were not at admission for their acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization.

- **Factors for beta-blocker use**: Independent factors associated with beta-blocker use at admission included previous heart failure hospitalization, history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m².

- **Factors against beta-blocker use**: Factors associated with no beta-blocker use included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower body mass index, dementia, older age, and a left ventricular ejection fraction below 40%.

Patients on beta-blockers exhibited significantly lower in-hospital mortality rates (4.4% versus 7.6%, P < 0.001). Even after adjustment for confounders, beta-blocker use at admission remained significantly associated with a lower in-hospital mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.60, P < 0.001).

Furthermore, beta-blocker use at admission was significantly associated with both lower cardiovascular mortality risk and lower non-cardiovascular mortality risk.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^115DNFdV]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, specifically in relation to digoxin, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of digoxin to reduce the risk of hospitalization. This includes both all-cause and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with symptomatic HFrEF in sinus rhythm, despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor (or ARNi), a β-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Life-threatening organ failure after lamotrigine therapy [^114fTzzD]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We describe an 11-year-old girl with a seizure disorder who developed fever, rash, rhabdomyolysis, and multiorgan failure 2 weeks after commencing a transition from sodium valproate to lamotrigine therapy. To our knowledge, this patient represents the most severe life-threatening hypersensitivity lamotrigine reaction described in the pediatric literature. We recommend caution when prescribing lamotrigine to children on concomitant sodium valproate and advise immediate discontinuation of lamotrigine along with the provision of aggressive supportive care in patients presenting with features of lamotrigine hypersensitivity.

### Lipid emulsion as rescue therapy in lamotrigine overdose [^112jcff1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine is a sodium channel blocking agent widely prescribed for the treatment of seizures. Although life-threatening effects are rarely observed in overdose, some reports have described the occurrence of cardiac toxicity. The management of sodium channel blocking agent-induced cardiotoxicity conventionally requires sodium bicarbonate administration. Recent case reports describe intravenous lipid administration as a successful treatment for refractory cardiovascular collapse induced by sodium channel blocking medications.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study is to report the use of intravenous lipid emulsion as adjunctive therapy in a case of lamotrigine overdose in which electrocardiographic changes were unresponsive to bicarbonate therapy.

- **Case report**: We report a case of intentional lamotrigine overdose in a 50-year-old woman who lost consciousness and developed electrocardiographic aberrations, including the widening of QRS and occurrence of left bundle branch block. The patient was initially treated with sodium bicarbonate without effect. Recovery of cardiac conduction was rapidly achieved after infusion of a 20% lipid emulsion. The exact mechanism of action of lipid emulsion is not fully understood. The lipophilic properties of lamotrigine suggest it was partially removed by the plasmatic lipid emulsion.

- **Conclusion**: This case provides additional insight into the potential benefit of using lipid emulsion in refractory sodium channel blocking intoxications.

### Lamotrigine versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^116JiHKA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 11, 2006, of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy. The correct choice of first-line AED for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AEDs for an individual is made using the highest quality evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of the various treatments. Carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatments for new-onset focal seizures and as a first- or second-line treatment for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of the results for outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability and may assist in informing a choice between the two drugs.

- **Objectives**: To review the time to treatment failure, remission, and first seizure with lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalized) or generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalized seizure types).

### The acute decompensated heart failure national registry (ADHERE): Opportunities to improve care of patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure [^115vvR3w]. Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine (2003). High credibility.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm is a clinical decision tool designed for patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). This algorithm aids clinicians in risk stratification, guiding therapeutic decisions based on the severity of the patient's condition. It utilizes key parameters such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), systolic blood pressure, and creatinine levels to predict in-hospital mortality.

The ADHERE Algorithm is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, where rapid assessment and treatment initiation are critical. It assists in identifying patients at high risk of adverse outcomes, thereby facilitating prompt intervention and potentially improving patient prognosis.

However, it is important to note that the ADHERE Algorithm may not be applicable to patients with acute heart failure secondary to acute coronary syndromes, severe valvular disease, or congenital heart disease. Additionally, it may not be suitable for patients with end-stage renal disease or those on dialysis, as their BUN and creatinine levels may be significantly altered.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm helps assess the risk level of heart failure patients by evaluating three specific health metrics. Here's how it works:

- **Inputs**: Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level: This input is "Yes" if the BUN is equal to or exceeds 43 mg/dL (15.35 mmol/L); otherwise, it is "No".

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112U2zWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of heart failure, specifically in relation to general principles, the 2022 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Failure Society of America recommend considering the titration and optimization of guideline-directed medications as frequently as every 1–2 weeks. This should be based on the patient's symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory findings to optimize management in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

### Are SGLT-2 inhibitors the future of heart failure treatment? The EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPEROR-Reduced trials [^116c81zR]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The worldwide prevalence of heart failure is both substantial and increasing, with an estimated prevalence of more than 26 million people and a substantial global economic burden estimated at US$108 billion. Diabetes increases the risk of developing heart failure by more than twofold in men and fivefold in women, with an estimated 25% of people with diabetes suffering from chronic heart failure. In contrast, in one study, 45.5% of people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and 41.8% with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were diagnosed with diabetes.

People with diabetes and heart failure have poorer clinical outcomes, thought to be a consequence of greater cardiovascular risk factors and poor glycaemic control. In people with diabetes, several mechanisms may explain the relatively high risk of HFpEF, including impaired cardiac metabolism and substrate utilization, altered insulin signaling, and cardiac deposition of advanced glycated end products. Indeed, the CHARM programme investigators reported that diabetes was an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in people with heart failure and that the relative risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) associated with diabetes was greater in participants with HFpEF than HFrEF.

While pharmacological interventions improve outcomes in HFrEF, there is little evidence supporting drug therapy for HFpEF. As a result, superior treatments for heart failure, particularly in patients with HFpEF and underlying diabetes, are needed.

### A single dose of lamotrigine induces a positive memory bias in healthy volunteers [^111FAqcP]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The present study is the first experimental medicine study investigating the effects of a single oral dose of lamotrigine in healthy volunteers. The use of healthy volunteers allows for the characterization of the drug's effects on cognitive-emotional functions relevant to a disorder while avoiding potential confounding factors, such as differences in disorder progression or past treatments. Prior research has highlighted lamotrigine's positive influence on memory; however, this study explores, for the first time, its influence on the emotional memory domain, which is often affected in bipolar disorder (BD).

It is important to consider these results along with the study's limitations. This study primarily found a significant effect on emotional memory (EREC), without widespread effects on other components of emotional processing. We had a relatively small sample size (n = 36), which reduced statistical power, and we did not correct for multiple statistical comparisons across the ETB tasks in the study, increasing the risk of type 1 errors.

Participants in the lamotrigine group also exhibited higher trait anxiety levels, possibly causing an imbalance between groups. This might have affected their self-assessment of side effects, as the groups differed on this measure even at baseline. Nonetheless, despite this potentially negative valence experience, the lamotrigine group still displayed a positive memory bias. Finally, the sample involved in this study was comprised of healthy volunteers, and while this limits generalizability, it is a strength that allows for clearer observations of the drug's effects.

### Steps forward in regulatory pathways for acute and chronic heart failure [^1117MqGg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

A workshop was organized by the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA) to discuss unmet needs and ways forward in the development of medicines in heart failure, including their rationale and cost-effective use. An integrated, multidisciplinary approach that includes patients' needs and perspectives was advocated by all participants as the most effective path to optimal treatment regimens.

More work is needed to reach consensus on clinical and functional endpoints and to validate patient-reported outcomes and measurements of well-being. Similarly, integrating the health technology assessment and payers' perspective into clinical programs, specifically by evaluating 'real-life' treatment effectiveness and health as a value, would assist in transitioning the development and authorization of medicines from a focus on molecules to evaluation within the context of the entire healthcare regimen.

Through such workshops, AIFA aims to create a template for meetings that address unmet needs with all stakeholders, thereby progressing toward potential road maps for the future.

### Medication dosing for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - opportunities and challenges [^116odxSF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple drug classes have shown incremental benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Most of these trials were designed to achieve specific doses of the investigational agent. Clinical practice guidelines recommend using the same target dosing of therapies, as tolerated. However, with the increasing number of available therapies, clinicians face the challenge of simultaneously using several drugs, achieving target doses, and managing side effects that are often overlapping. Blood pressure, renal function, hyperkalemia, and other factors may impede achieving target doses of all medications, leaving clinicians with dilemmas as to how to sequence and dose these various classes of drugs.

Guideline-directed eligibility for certain drugs and devices requires stability on maximally tolerated doses of background therapies. However, significant variability exists in dosing achieved in clinical practice. We discuss the existing background data regarding the doses of heart failure medications in clinical trials and in practice and provide recommendations on how to navigate this complex therapeutic decision-making.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^1126NAaz]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the effectiveness of lamotrigine and other anti-seizure medications in treating hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Various studies were analyzed to determine the efficacy and safety of these medications in managing seizures associated with HLH.

Research included data from patients diagnosed with HLH who were treated with lamotrigine either alone or in combination with other medications. The findings highlight both the potential benefits and challenges of using anti-seizure drugs like lamotrigine in this context. Further clinical trials are necessary to establish definitive treatment guidelines. Ultimately, this review aims to contribute to a better understanding and management of seizures in HLH patients.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy with improved left ventricular ejection fraction [^114PzBWb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Low credibility.

Mean hazard rates of relapse for each treatment strategy and semester of follow-up are depicted in Figure 4B. Patients who discontinue both treatments exhibit a very high risk of relapse in the first semester after withdrawal (15.15 ± 6.04 relapses per 100 patient-months), the period in which most patients under observation experienced relapse. Compared to patients who maintain both treatments, discontinuation of a single drug has also been associated with a higher risk of relapse throughout follow-up, with a peak incidence between months 24 and 30 (4.76 ± 2.72 relapses per 100 patient-months).

The time elapsed between LVEF improvement and drug discontinuation did not significantly influence the risk of relapse. No differences were found in the subgroup of patients who discontinued medication within the first year after ventricular function improvement compared to those who discontinued later (Figure 4C).

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: A non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117SCKvy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The care of patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction should be determined by the evidence from large-scale randomized controlled trials that form the basis of accepted standards of practice. Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians. These describe the treatments that should be prescribed (class I), those that are appropriate but are not mandated (class II), and those that should not be used (class III). However, guidelines typically do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care. As a result of this uncertainty, practitioners who adhere to only one or two recommendations could contend that they are treating patients with heart failure "in accordance with the guidelines".

### Valproate sodium [^113dixXR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Valproate affects the pharmacokinetics of several other compounds, as summarized below.

- **Lamotrigine**: In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration, indicating a 165% increase. The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration. It is recommended to see the lamotrigine package insert for detailed dosing information when administered with valproate.

- **Phenobarbital**: Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single dose). The fraction of the phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in the presence of valproate. There is evidence for severe central nervous system depression, with or without significant elevations in barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased if appropriate. Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate.

- **Phenytoin**: Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism. The co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) needs careful management to avoid potential drug interactions.

The dosage of lamotrigine taken orally for adjunctive treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults, particularly those also taking valproate, is structured as follows:

- **Initial phase**: Start with 25 mg taken orally every 48 hours for the first two weeks. Follow this with 25 mg taken orally daily for another two weeks.
- **Maintenance phase**: The maintenance dose ranges from 100 to 400 mg taken orally daily, administered in one or two divided doses.

### Sudden death and cardiac arrhythmia with lamotrigine: A rapid systematic review [^116GFu8o]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

A recent Food and Drug Administration warning concerning the arrhythmogenic potential of lamotrigine has created concern in the neurologic community. This warning was based on in vitro studies, although no clinically relevant risk was considered. This rapid systematic review aims to elucidate the risk of lamotrigine on sudden death or ECG abnormalities.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of Ovid Medline and Ovid Embase, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and studies of people with or without epilepsy. The outcome measures were sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) or sudden cardiac death, as well as the development or worsening of ECG abnormalities. We evaluated the sudden death definitions used in all included studies, as some might have used unclear or overlapping definitions. We used the American Academy of Neurology risk of bias tool to evaluate the class of evidence and the GRADE approach to evaluate our confidence in the evidence.

- **Results**: We included 26 studies with 24,962 participants, of whom 2,326 used lamotrigine. Twelve studies showed no significant risk of SUDEP for lamotrigine users. One study reporting on sudden cardiac death and three studies with unclear sudden death definitions did not report an elevated risk of death in lamotrigine users compared to controls. In 10 studies reporting on ECG measures, there was no statistically significant increased risk among lamotrigine users, except in two studies. These two studies reported either "slight increases" in the PR interval or an increased PQ interval.

### Multaq [^116T3eCM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular death in NYHA Class IV or decompensated heart failure**: MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization, as it doubles the risk of death.

- **Cardiovascular death and heart failure in permanent AF**: MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death (largely arrhythmic) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AF. Patients treated with dronedarone should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months. Cardiovert patients who are in atrial fibrillation (if clinically indicated) or discontinue MULTAQ. MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AF.

- **Increased risk of stroke in permanent AF**: In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly in the first two weeks of therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **New onset or worsening heart failure**: New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent AF, increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure, as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Advise patients to consult their healthcare provider if heart failure symptoms worsen.

### Lamictal XR [^116ycxFb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effects of doses of lamotrigine other than 300 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Studies with other female hormonal preparations, including progesterone/progesterone-containing hormone replacement therapy (HRT), have not been conducted. The clinical significance of the observed hormonal changes on ovulatory activity is unknown; however, the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy in some patients cannot be excluded. Patients should be instructed to promptly report changes in their menstrual patterns, such as breakthrough bleeding.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for women receiving estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptive preparations.

- **Other hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy**: The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or HRT on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to two-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of Lamictal XR in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed.

- **Aripiprazole**: In 18 patients with bipolar disorder on a stable regimen of 100 to 400 mg/day of lamotrigine, the lamotrigine AUC and Cmax were reduced by approximately 10% in patients who received aripiprazole 10 to 30 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 30 mg/day for an additional 7 days. This reduction in lamotrigine exposure is not considered clinically significant.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: A non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117TPoVW]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Given the state of affairs, most practitioners who claim that patients are receiving 'guideline-directed medical therapy' are making a judgment not based on objective criteria. No set of standards has been developed to define 'optimal medical therapy'. Anyone who asserts that their patients are being managed appropriately is providing a well-intentioned (but personal) opinion, since no one has defined what combination of treatments should be considered 'optimal', 'acceptable', 'adequate', 'reasonable', or 'guideline-directed'.

### Use of heart failure medications in older individuals and associations with cognitive impairment [^112hsfSE]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

Use of two or more drug classes with a class I recommendation is associated with an additive effect in reducing mortality and decreasing rates of rehospitalization in individuals with heart failure, according to a meta-analysis. In addition to the number of heart failure medications prescribed, reaching the target doses of these medications is recommended to achieve their maximum effect. Previous studies have found that many patients with heart failure do not reach the target doses of their prescribed drugs.

Target doses of ACE inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and beta-blockers (BB) were prescribed for 25–69% of individuals with heart failure according to one study, while another study found that only 33–35% of individuals with heart failure who were prescribed BBs achieved their target dose. However, the population with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has become larger and older, posing a higher risk for adverse events. Many studies regarding heart failure treatment have excluded individuals with multimorbidity and frailty, thereby limiting the evidence for these populations.

The risk for cognitive impairment increases with age. Additionally, there is a comorbidity between heart failure and cognitive impairment. According to a meta-analysis of 4,176 individuals with heart failure, 43% had cognitive impairment as a comorbidity. Previous studies have found that individuals with cognitive impairment are often undertreated for some cardiovascular diseases and that those with concomitant heart failure and cognitive impairment have a high risk of drug-related hospital admissions.

### Cardiorenal nexus: A review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^112nuh5L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

With the beneficial potential of new medications comes a renewed focus on the cardiorenal nexus. The underlying pathophysiology of the cardiorenal nexus remains to be further elucidated. Capturing this underlying pathophysiology will enable physicians to choose the appropriate treatment earlier. Broader recognition of the cardiorenal nexus will emphasize the need to evaluate and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients who are primarily being treated for cardiovascular disease (CVD) issues and vice versa. Paying attention to underlying cardiorenal syndromes will enable primary care physicians and endocrinologists to take a comprehensive approach to the care of their patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.

Development of a combined heatmap system that visually presents cardiorenal syndrome risk in the electronic medical record, based on CVD and CKD severity and how this risk is affected by type 2 diabetes, would aid in the earlier identification and treatment of high-risk patients. Further research into the mechanisms of action of potentially disease-modifying medications, and the role that these medications may have when used in combination, will improve treatment algorithms. Additionally, further research on health economics and outcomes will drive improvements in long-term continuity of care.

### The relationship between valproate and lamotrigine/levetiracetam use and prognosis in patients with epilepsy and heart failure: A Danish register-based study [^111fA9v6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Low credibility.

To compare the hazard for all-cause mortality and mortality due to heart failure (HF) between valproate (VPA) and levetiracetam (LEV)/lamotrigine (LTG) users in patients aged ≥ 65 with comorbidities of epilepsy and HF, a cohort study was conducted using Danish registers during the period from January 1996 to July 2018. The study population included new users of LTG, LEV, or VPA. A Cox regression model was used to compute crude and adjusted hazard ratios for the outcome, using an intention-to-treat approach. Average treatment effects (e.g. 1-year absolute risks), risk differences, and the ratio of risks were computed using the G-formula based on a Cox regression model for the outcomes at the end of the follow-up period.

In the study population, 1345 subjects were included. VPA users (n = 696), when compared to LTG/LEV users (n = 649), had an increased hazard of mortality due to HF (hazard ratio [HR] 2.39; 95% CI 1.02–5.60) and to all-cause mortality (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01–1.85) in both crude and adjusted analyses. The 1-year absolute risks for all-cause mortality were 29% (95% CI 25%-33%) and 22% (95% CI 18%-26%) for VPA and LTG/LEV users. For mortality due to HF, 1-year absolute risks were 5% (95% CI 3%-7%) and 2% (95% CI 1%-4%) for VPA and LTG/LEV users. The average risk ratio, with LTG/LEV as the reference group, was 1.31 (95% CI 1.02–1.71) for all-cause mortality and 2.35 (95% CI 1.11–5.76) for HF mortality.

In conclusion, in older people with HF and epilepsy, treatment with VPA was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and HF mortality compared to LTG/LEV users.

### Vasotec [^114ZgkCM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Vasotec is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In the placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated improved survival, patients were titrated as tolerated up to 40 mg, administered in two divided doses.

- **Heart failure**: The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice a day. Doses should be titrated upward, as tolerated, over a period of a few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses.

	- After the initial dose of Vasotec, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until the blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced, which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of Vasotec does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug following effective management of the hypotension.

- **Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction**: In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in divided doses).

	- After the initial dose of Vasotec, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until the blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced.

### Lamictal XR [^114C6hi6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lamictal XR is not approved for use in patients younger than 13 years.

- **Adult population**: Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-release lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received immediate-release lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, though their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimation of the rate. Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

	- There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered immediate-release lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered immediate-release lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized.

- **Patients with history of allergy or rash to other antiepileptic drugs**: The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for Lamictal XR is exceeded, and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs.

### Risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest among older patients using lamotrigine for epilepsy [^113rrTZw]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine, an antiseizure medication, blocks the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels and reduces the excitability of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Based on concerns for QT prolongation and case reports of arrhythmias among lamotrigine users, the US Food and Drug Administration placed a safety warning on lamotrigine's label in 2020. However, limited evidence exists on the cardiac risk of lamotrigine in patients with epilepsy. This study assessed whether lamotrigine users with epilepsy had an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest (VA/SCA) compared with users of levetiracetam.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study among Medicare-insured individuals aged 65 years or older with epilepsy (2007–2019). We identified new users of lamotrigine and levetiracetam without inpatient or emergency VA/SCA diagnosis in the 12-month continuous enrollment baseline period before initiation of treatment. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting derived from propensity scores based on baseline covariates, we compared adjusted incidence rates of inpatient or emergency VA/SCA events in lamotrigine vs. levetiracetam users and estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs using Cox proportional hazard regression.

- **Results**: The study cohort (mean age 77.6 years and 60.5% female) consisted of 11,786 new lamotrigine users and 147,130 new levetiracetam users. At baseline, lamotrigine users were younger and less likely to have cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities than the levetiracetam users. The incidence and…

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^115XZga1]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine and other anti-seizure medications have been reported to cause both haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). HLH and DIHS have many characteristic clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings, along with underlying mechanisms. We identified significant clinical overlap between these two syndromes in our systematic review. Of note, the presence of haemophagocytosis on bone marrow biopsy, while supportive, is not exclusive to or synonymous with a diagnosis of HLH.

### Lamotrigine versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^112L2WqW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2006, of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy. The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AEDs for an individual is made using the highest quality evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of the various treatments. It is also important that the effectiveness and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types are compared to one another. Carbamazepine or lamotrigine are first-line recommended treatments for new onset partial seizures and as a first- or second-line treatment for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of the results for outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability and may assist in informing a choice between the two drugs.

- **Objectives**: To review the time to withdrawal, remission, and first seizure with lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalized).

### How do patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction die [^116HJjkZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding how patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) die provides insight into the natural history and pathophysiology of this complex syndrome, thereby allowing better prediction of response to therapy when designing clinical trials. This review summarizes the state of knowledge surrounding mortality rates, modes of death, and prognostic factors in HFPEF. Despite the lack of uniform reporting, the following conclusions can be drawn from previous studies:

- **Mortality burden**: The mortality burden of HFPEF is substantial, ranging from 10% to 30% annually. This burden is higher in epidemiological studies than in clinical trials.
- **Comparison with HFREF**: Mortality rates compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) appear to be strongly influenced by the type of study but are clearly elevated compared to age- and co-morbidity-matched controls without heart failure.
- **Cardiovascular deaths**: The majority of deaths in HFPEF are cardiovascular, comprising 51–60% of deaths in epidemiological studies and approximately 70% in clinical trials. Among these, sudden death and heart failure death are the leading cardiac modes of death in HFPEF clinical trials.
- **Comparison of death modes**: Compared to HFREF, the proportions of cardiovascular deaths, sudden death, and heart failure deaths are lower in HFPEF. Conversely, non-cardiovascular deaths constitute a higher proportion in HFPEF than in HFREF, particularly in epidemiological studies where this might relate to fewer coronary heart deaths in HFPEF.

Key mortality risk factors include age, gender, body mass index, and the burden of co-morbidities.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^113pzqXZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

For purposes of this paper, the following interventions are not considered foundational therapy, even though they may be valuable options for selected patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Certain cardiac devices or cardiovascular procedures (e.g. implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and transcatheter mitral valve repair) have been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in selected patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. However, with the advent of comprehensive neurohormonal blockade, particularly with the use of beta-blockers, the risk of sudden death in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction has declined considerably, and neurohormonal antagonists can ameliorate the severity of functional mitral regurgitation without the need for structural repair. Consequently, device therapies are typically recommended after all appropriate drug therapies have been prescribed and optimized. When these prerequisites have been fulfilled, cardiac devices are appropriate for selected patients (e.g. those with left bundle branch block or with residual severe mitral regurgitation), but these typically represent a relatively small proportion of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. In addition, the expense of these devices may limit their availability to many patients and in many geographical regions with constrained healthcare resources. Prevention of sudden death in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is of paramount importance.

### Lamictal XR [^111goRVX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Folate metabolism**: In vitro, lamotrigine inhibited dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this enzyme may interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. When oral daily doses of lamotrigine were given to pregnant rats during organogenesis, fetal, placental, and maternal folate concentrations were reduced. Significantly reduced concentrations of folate are associated with teratogenesis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Folate concentrations were also reduced in male rats given repeated oral doses of lamotrigine. Reduced concentrations were partially returned to normal when supplemented with folinic acid.

	- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: In vitro studies show that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. It inhibits human cardiac sodium channels with rapid onset and offset kinetics and strong voltage dependence, consistent with other Class IB antiarrhythmic agents. At therapeutic doses, Lamictal XR did not slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) in healthy individuals in a thorough QT study. However, in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease, such as heart failure, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac channelopathies (e.g. Brugada syndrome), clinically important ischemic heart disease, or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, Lamictal XR could pose certain risks.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^113Scz1b]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

For the medical management of heart failure, specifically with respect to SGLT-2 inhibitors, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors (such as dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin) to reduce hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

### Tolsura [^111PVwys]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Congestive heart failure**: Tolsura can cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction, such as CHF, or history or risk factors for CHF, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of Tolsura therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease, such as ischemic and valvular disease, significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF and monitored carefully for these during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear or worsen during administration of Tolsura, reassess the benefit-risk of continuing treatment.

	- When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was demonstrated. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later.

	- Itraconazole has been associated with reports of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving higher total daily doses of itraconazole of 400 mg, although cases were also reported among those receiving lower total daily doses [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

	- Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of Tolsura.

### New medications for heart failure [^114hCeMn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Heart failure is a common condition that results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Guideline-based therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists, aim to interrupt deleterious neurohormonal pathways and have shown significant success in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Continued efforts to further improve patient outcomes have led to the introduction of the first new-in-class medications for heart failure since 2005, namely ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan.

Ivabradine targets the If channels in the sinoatrial node of the heart, decreasing the heart rate. Sacubitril/valsartan combines a neprilysin inhibitor, which increases levels of beneficial vasodilatory peptides, with an angiotensin receptor antagonist. Against the backdrop of previously approved, guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure, these medications have shown improved clinical outcomes, ranging from decreased hospitalizations in a select group of patients to a reduction in all-cause mortality across all pre-specified subgroups.

In this review, we will discuss the previously established guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the translational research that led to the development of these new therapies, and the results from the major clinical trials of ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan.

### Pediatric cardiac intensive care society 2014 consensus statement: Pharmacotherapies in cardiac critical care chronic heart failure [^115WHxYZ]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a serious complication that can occur in patients with a variety of congenital and acquired disorders, including congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis. Heart failure patients make up an increasing number of ICU admissions. Thus, it is important for those caring for patients with critical cardiovascular disease to have a thorough understanding of the medications used for the treatment of heart failure. The aim of this review is to provide an overview, rationale, indications, and adverse effects of medications used in the treatment of chronic heart failure.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

- **Study selection**: Studies were selected based on their relevance to pediatric heart failure. When limited data on pediatric heart failure were available, studies on adult patients were chosen.

- **Data extraction**: Relevant findings from studies were selected by the authors.

- **Data synthesis**: The rationale for the efficacy of most heart failure medications used in pediatric patients is extrapolated from studies in adult heart failure. Commonly used medications for chronic heart failure include β-receptor antagonists (e.g. carvedilol and metoprolol) and medications aimed at blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists). In addition, diuretics are useful for symptoms of fluid overload. For patients with impaired perfusion, inotropic agents are useful acutely, but may be associated with significant risks.

### Lamictal [^115CkSN4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with renal impairment: Initial doses of Lamictal should be based on patients' concomitant medications, as outlined in Tables 1–3 and 5. Reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with Lamictal. Due to inadequate experience in this population, Lamictal should be used with caution.

Discontinuation strategy:

- **Epilepsy**: For patients receiving Lamictal in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if there is a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions. If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with Lamictal, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least two weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended, unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine, while discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine.

- **Bipolar disorder**: In controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, type, or severity of adverse reactions following the abrupt termination of Lamictal.

### Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition in acute decompensated heart failure [^112cif67]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The study PIONEER-HF, published by Eric J. Velazquez and colleagues in 2019 in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine, relates to heart failure. The trial investigated the role of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (HF).

- **Study design**: The study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving 881 patients (246 female, 635 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with HFrEF who were hospitalized for acute decompensated HF.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Recent receipt of sacubitril/valsartan within the past 30 days, serum potassium greater than 5.2 mEq/L at screening, hypersensitivity or contraindications to the study drugs, known hepatic impairment, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomly assigned to either sacubitril/valsartan (n = 440, target dose of 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or enalapril (n = 441, target dose of 10 mg twice daily).

- **Primary outcome**: The study found a significant increase in the time-averaged reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) concentration from baseline through weeks 4 and 8 (0.53 vs. 0.75; odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23 to 1.59).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in the reduction of high-sensitivity troponin T concentration (36.6 vs. 25.2; OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.29). No significant difference was observed in death rates (2.3% vs. 3.4%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.48). However, there was a significant decrease in rehospitalization for HF (8% vs. 13.8%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84).

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^112i3jEh]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, specifically concerning ivabradine, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend initiating ivabradine to reduce the risk of hospitalization due to heart failure and cardiovascular death. This is advised for symptomatic patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, who are in sinus rhythm, and have a resting heart rate (HR) ≥ 70 beats per minute. These recommendations are made despite treatment with an evidence-based dose of β-blockers (or the maximum tolerated dose below that), ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Diuretic treatment in high-risk acute decompensation of advanced chronic heart failure-bolus intermittent vs. continuous infusion of furosemide: a randomized controlled trial [^111ZemDZ]. Clinical Research in Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The DRAIN study, published by Simone Frea and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Clinical Research in Cardiology, examines heart failure. The trial addressed the role of continuous infusion of furosemide in patients with acute decompensation of advanced chronic heart failure (HF) and high risk for diuretic resistance.

The DRAIN study was a single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 80 patients (8 female, 72 male). Inclusion criteria were admission for acute decompensation of advanced chronic HF with high risk for diuretic resistance. Key exclusion criteria included reversible causes of acute HF, cardiogenic shock, and chronic renal failure stage V.

- **Interventions**: The study included two groups: 40 patients receiving a continuous infusion (intravenous infusion of furosemide 120 mg/day or 240 mg/day continuously for up to 72 hours) and 40 patients receiving bolus intermittent doses (intravenous furosemide bolus of 120 mg/day or 240 mg/day every 12 hours for up to 72 hours).

- **Primary outcomes**: The primary outcome demonstrated a significant increase in freedom from congestion at 72 hours (48% vs. 25%; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.05 to 7).

- **Secondary outcomes**: The results showed a significant increase in total urinary output after 72 hours (10,020 mL vs. 8,612 ml; OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.4), a significant decrease in treatment failure (15% vs. 38%; OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.87), and no significant difference in worsening HF after 72 hours (20% vs. 30%; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.83).

### The assessment of cardiac risk in patients taking lamotrigine; a systematic review [^115mVn2A]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about lamotrigine's arrhythmogenicity based on in vitro data. This systematic review investigates lamotrigine's effect on cardiac conduction and risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with and without cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods**: We searched Web of Science and PubMed from inception through August 2021. We included studies measuring electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, laboratory abnormalities, or SCD among patients taking lamotrigine. Studies examining sudden unexpected death in epilepsy were excluded for scope. Two reviewers assessed articles and extracted data. We used the Effective Public Healthcare Panacea Project tool to evaluate confidence in evidence.

- **Results**: Eight randomized controlled trials, nine nonrandomized observational studies, and twenty-four case reports were identified, with over 3,054 total participants, more than 1,606 of whom used lamotrigine. One randomized trial of older patients found an average QRS increase of 3.5 ± 13.1 ms. Fifteen studies reported no changes in ECG parameters. Case reports documented QRS widening (13), Brugada syndrome (6), QTc prolongation (1), and SCD (2). However, many case reports involved the ingestion of toxic quantities of lamotrigine and/or other medications.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence is insufficient to support the breadth of the FDA warning concerning lamotrigine's cardiac risk. Lamotrigine at therapeutic doses may be associated with modest, non-dangerous QRS widening.

### Thirty years of evidence on the efficacy of drug treatments for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: A network meta-analysis [^115THyvY]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

In this network meta-analysis, Bayesian NMA models were employed to synthesize the results of included studies simultaneously and to obtain relative treatment effects. NMA within the Bayesian framework incorporates data, a hierarchical model or likelihood function with parameters, and prior distributions. The model relates data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to parameters reflecting the (pooled) relative treatment effects of each intervention compared to the reference treatment, such as placebo.

Data sets for the model were based on the reported number of patients with an event at the end of the trial per arm, the total number of patients randomized per arm, and the mean follow-up duration of the trial. The log mean follow-up time was utilized to transform the probability of an event into a constant rate for each trial arm, assuming an underlying Poisson process. A complementary log-log (cloglog) link was employed to model the event rates. The model's outputs were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) for each treatment versus placebo. Goodness of fit was assessed using the residual deviance and deviance information criterion.

Results of the random-effects model were presented unless the fixed-effect model resulted in a more parsimonious solution. Noninformative prior distributions were used: a normal distribution for the difference measures (mean 0, variance 10⁴) and a uniform distribution for between-study standard deviation (range 0–5). The analysis was conducted with published codes using OpenBUGS software, employing two chains, including 100,000 burn-in iterations followed by 200,000 iterations.
