## Question

Vertis cv trial

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the VERTIS CV trial, including its design, primary and secondary outcomes, renal and heart failure findings, subgroup analyses, safety, and how it fits within the broader SGLT2 inhibitor evidence base and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes. Next, I will examine renal and heart failure results, including eGFR slope and albuminuria. After that, I should review subgroup analyses and safety signals. Finally, I will contextualize the findings within class effects, guidelines, and real-world applicability, and close with practical clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't misstate basics. VERTIS CV was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, comparing ertugliflozin 5 mg, 15 mg, and placebo on a background of standard care; 8,246 patients were randomized and 8,238 received at least one dose, with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years and doses pooled for analyses, which aligns with the primary publications and registry entry [^34b48394] [^292cecfd] [^de4b0bec].

> I need to check the primary objective and whether noninferiority was met. The primary endpoint was time to first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke), and ertugliflozin met prespecified noninferiority versus placebo with HR 0.97 (95.6% CI 0.85–1.11; P < 0.001 for noninferiority), but did not demonstrate superiority for MACE, which is a key distinction I should preserve [^de4b0bec] [^cfbcd77d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about secondary outcomes; I should verify the hierarchical testing sequence. The first secondary endpoint, CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), did not meet superiority, so formal hypothesis testing ended there; however, prespecified analyses showed a significant 30% reduction in HHF with ertugliflozin versus placebo (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.90), and a 17% reduction in total HHF/CV death events, which are important clinical signals despite the hierarchical stop [^de4b0bec] [^1425d538] [^5abbb8fa].

> Next, I should review renal outcomes carefully because definitions and power matter. The prespecified secondary renal composite (doubling of serum creatinine, kidney replacement therapy, or renal death) did not show a significant reduction (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63–1.04), but an exploratory composite using a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, kidney replacement therapy, or renal death showed a 34% relative risk reduction (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.88), which is clinically meaningful though hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^abea8953] [^28150488].

> I will now examine the eGFR slope data to understand kidney function preservation. Ertugliflozin produced an initial eGFR dip at week 6 consistent with hemodynamic effects, followed by a slower long-term eGFR decline; the chronic slope difference versus placebo was about 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m²/year over 0–156 weeks, and the favorable slope exceeded the 0.75 mL/min/1.73 m²/year threshold proposed as a surrogate for kidney disease progression, supporting renoprotection despite the neutral prespecified renal composite [^2d52939e] [^770fac46].

> Let me consider albuminuria and CKD subgroups to ensure consistency. Ertugliflozin reduced albuminuria and slowed eGFR decline across CKD stages, including stage 3, with attenuated but still significant HbA1c lowering in CKD 3A and a nonsignificant HbA1c change at 15 mg in CKD 3B, which is expected given reduced filtered glucose; importantly, safety and kidney-related adverse events were similar to placebo in CKD subgroups, reinforcing tolerability down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^625ecee0] [^60a1534e] [^55cecfa3].

> I should double-check heart failure signals across ejection fraction strata. Post hoc analyses showed consistent HHF risk reduction across EF categories, including patients with EF > 60%, suggesting benefit beyond HFrEF; however, EF was abstracted from medical records and unavailable in a substantial proportion, so these results should be interpreted cautiously even though they align with class-wide HF benefits [^69f2eb47] [^b61ee3b8].

> Next, I should review subgroup and mechanistic analyses to see what modifies benefit. Effects on HHF and kidney outcomes were consistent regardless of baseline metformin use, insulin use, sulfonylurea use, or DPP-4 inhibitor use, and mediator analyses implicated early changes in hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum albumin, and uric acid — markers of volume status, hemoconcentration, and natriuresis — as key mediators of HHF and kidney benefit, which fits with SGLT2 physiology [^4ce86747] [^28150488] [^dbeb7c50] [^1716ec64].

> I need to ensure safety is accurately summarized. Amputation risk did not show a clear signal with ertugliflozin in VERTIS CV, unlike the CANVAS program signal for canagliflozin; ketoacidosis occurred rarely and genital mycotic infections were more frequent, consistent with the class; importantly, hypoglycemia was not increased overall, including in insulin-treated subgroups, which supports use with insulin when indicated [^0b023f4e] [^8a91bb2d].

> But wait, what about external validity and how VERTIS CV compares with other SGLT2 trials. VERTIS CV enrolled only patients with established ASCVD, making it less representative of general T2D populations than DECLARE-TIMI 58; observational and modeling studies suggest only about 7–21% of real-world T2D patients would meet VERTIS CV criteria, whereas DECLARE's broader inclusion yields higher eligibility, so absolute risk differences in VERTIS CV reflect a higher-risk secondary prevention population [^94d0fbdf] [^6c43da14] [^e2980cc3].

> Let me place these findings in the class context so I don't overgeneralize. Meta-analyses of SGLT2 inhibitors show a consistent 12–16% reduction in 3-point MACE across the class, but individual trials vary: EMPA-REG and CANVAS showed MACE benefit, whereas DECLARE-TIMI 58 and VERTIS CV were neutral for MACE yet consistently reduced HHF by about 30–35%, reinforcing a class effect for HF hospitalization while MACE effects are modest and heterogeneous across populations [^c3cf8c95] [^47aa09bc] [^cfbcd77d].

> I should confirm guideline positioning to ensure clinical relevance. Contemporary guidelines prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2D and ASCVD or high/very high CV risk, independent of metformin status, given consistent HHF reductions and renal benefits; VERTIS CV's neutral MACE but robust HHF reduction aligns with this risk-driven, cardiorenal-first approach and supports use of ertugliflozin when an SGLT2 inhibitor is indicated [^4ce86747] [^cfbcd77d].

> Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications. In patients with T2D and established ASCVD, ertugliflozin is reasonable to use for HF prevention and kidney protection, with expected HbA1c lowering that is attenuated as eGFR declines; monitor for volume depletion, genital infections, and rare ketoacidosis, and consider dose selection recognizing that 5 mg and 15 mg have similar clinical outcomes in VERTIS CV and that both doses achieved the HHF risk reduction, allowing individualized choice based on glycemic needs and tolerability [^de4b0bec] [^1425d538] [^625ecee0].

The VERTIS CV trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ertugliflozin in 8,246 patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, with a median follow-up of 3.5 years [^292cecfd]. Ertugliflozin met the **primary endpoint of noninferiority for MACE** (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85–1.11) [^de4b0bec] but did not reduce MACE or cardiovascular death versus placebo [^cfbcd77d]. It significantly reduced **hospitalization for heart failure by 30%** (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.90) [^1425d538] and slowed chronic eGFR decline by 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, indicating kidney protection [^2d52939e]. Safety was consistent with the SGLT2 class, with no excess of amputations or fractures, and a small increase in genital mycotic infections [^0b023f4e]. These results support ertugliflozin's use for heart failure and kidney outcomes in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes [^c3cf8c95].

---

## Primary cardiovascular outcomes

Ertugliflozin met the **primary endpoint of noninferiority for MACE** (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85–1.11; P < 0.001 for noninferiority) [^de4b0bec] but did not significantly reduce MACE or cardiovascular death versus placebo [^cfbcd77d].

---

## Heart failure outcomes

Ertugliflozin significantly reduced **hospitalization for heart failure (HHF)** by 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.90; P = 0.006) [^1425d538], with consistent effects across subgroups, including patients with and without baseline heart failure [^5208987a].

---

## Renal outcomes

Ertugliflozin slowed chronic **eGFR decline** by 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m²/year versus placebo (95% CI 0.85–1.27; P < 0.001) [^2d52939e], indicating kidney protection. An exploratory renal composite (≥ 40% sustained eGFR decline, kidney replacement therapy, or renal death) was reduced by 34% (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.88) [^28150488].

---

## Safety outcomes

Safety was consistent with the SGLT2 class: there was no excess of **amputations or fractures**, and a small increase in **genital mycotic infections** occurred [^0b023f4e]. Serious adverse events, including hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis, were uncommon and similar to placebo [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

The VERTIS CV trial demonstrates that ertugliflozin provides **cardiovascular safety** (noninferior MACE) [^de4b0bec] and significant benefits for heart failure and kidney outcomes in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes [^c3cf8c95]. These findings align with the broader SGLT2 inhibitor class and support use of ertugliflozin to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and slow kidney disease progression in this population [^8de11bc3].

Materials and Methods

The VERTIS CV trial (NCT01986881; protocol MK8835-004) was an event-driven trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease comparing ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) with placebo; ertugliflozin dose groups were pooled for all analyses. The protocol, design, and primary results have been previously published.

Initial Change in eGFR Tertiles

Regardless of treatment allocation, the entire trial population was categorized into tertiles defined by week 6 change in eGFR from baseline (mL/min per 1.73 m 2), tertile 1: change in eGFR > +1.00; tertile 2: change in eGFR > −5.99 and ≤ +1.00; and tertile 3: change in eGFR of ≤ −6.00.

We report the baseline characteristics by the eGFR "dip" tertile. We also evaluated the odds ratio for the ertugliflozin group of having a decrease in eGFR ≥ 6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at week 6 for the overall population and by baseline subgroups.

### Cardiorenal outcomes with ertugliflozin by baseline metformin use: post hoc analyses of the VERTIS CV trial [^4ce86747]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The universal guidance of treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with metformin first has been questioned since positive cardiovascular outcomes trials of antihyperglycemic agents were reported between 2015 and 2021, demonstrating cardiovascular efficacy of multiple glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This underpinned the paradigm shift in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, from a glucose-centric to a risk-driven, evidence-based cardiocentric strategy. Recommendations include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits as first-line antihyperglycemic therapy in drug-naive patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or at high/very high cardiovascular risk. The 2022 American Diabetes Association standards of medical care recommend glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, with or without metformin on the basis of glycemic needs, for those with T2D with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Whether background metformin treatment affects the cardiovascular benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors remains an important question.

Prespecified unadjusted analyses from the VERTIS CV trial (Evaluation of Ertugliflozin Efficacy and Safety Cardiovascular Outcomes, NCT01986881) conducted in patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with ertugliflozin suggested no interaction of the presence or absence of baseline metformin on the composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, the composite of cardiovascular death/hospitalization for heart failure, or 2 kidney composite end points (doubling of serum creatinine level, kidney replacement therapy, or death from kidney causes; sustained ≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, kidney replacement therapy, or death from kidney causes). However, unadjusted analyses do not take into consideration the differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the subpopulations with and without baseline metformin use, with the corresponding biases and confounding factors that may obscure relevant interactions.

### Cardiorenal outcomes with ertugliflozin by baseline metformin use: post hoc analyses of the VERTIS CV trial [^28150488]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

In VERTIS CV, 24% of patients were not on metformin at baseline. This subset of ≈2000 patients not treated with metformin is larger than that of almost every T2D metformin comparator trial before the 2008 regulatory guidance requiring cardiovascular safety assessments for all new medications developed for T2D. In the present analysis, we found no modification of ertugliflozin effect by baseline metformin use on any of the cardiorenal outcomes assessed.

The paradigm shift proposed in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Guidelineshas expanded discussion regarding whether metformin should remain first line, because other antihyperglycemic medications have demonstrated cardiorenal benefits in high-risk populations. In the overall VERTIS CV trial, ertugliflozin was noninferior to placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events. In addition, there was a 30% relative risk reduction with ertugliflozin in hospitalization for heart failure and a 34% relative risk reduction with ertugliflozin in the prespecified exploratory kidney composite outcome. In the present analyses with propensity adjustment, the hospitalization for heart failure and kidney outcomes with ertugliflozin were not modified by baseline metformin status. These findings suggest that metformin is unlikely to modulate the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiorenal outcomes and that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors accrue regardless of metformin use. Given the lack of robust proof of metformin efficacy for cardiovascular outcomes and a less rigorous assessment of cardiovascular safety compared with contemporary antihyperglycemic agents, the elevation of antihyperglycemic agents with proven cardiorenal efficacy and cardiovascular safety above metformin fully represents the application of evidence-based medicine.

Trial Design, Patient Population, and Treatment

The trial design, baseline characteristics, and main results of VERTIS CV have been published previously. In brief, VERTIS CV was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in patients with T2DM (glycohemoglobin 7.0%–10.5%) and established ASCVD, including coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease, comparing the effects of ertugliflozin with placebo on CV, renal, and metabolic outcomes. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or matching placebo once daily added to background standard-of-care diabetes therapy. VERTIS CV was initiated in 2013. Based on evolving knowledge of the potential role of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risk of CV events, the study was amended in 2016 to increase patient sample size so that these potential benefits could be assessed with adequate statistical power. Therefore, patients were recruited in 2 cohorts of ≈4000 patients each. General inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same for the 2 cohorts with the exception of excluding patients with HF and New York Heart Association class III and IV for cohort 1 and class IV only for cohort 2. To better characterize the VERTIS CV population, medical history of HF was collected at study entry. In addition, pretrial EF was captured from medical records when available in the overall population, retrospectively for cohort 1 and prospectively for cohort 2. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and was approved by local authorities. An independent ethics committee or institutional review board approved the clinical protocol at each study center. All patients provided written informed consent.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and safety cardioVascular outcomes trial (VERTIS-CV) [^34b48394]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), approved in the United States and European Union to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The VERTIS cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial (NCT01986881) has a primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of ertugliflozin versus placebo on major adverse CV events: time to the first event of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary objectives are to demonstrate superiority of ertugliflozin versus placebo on time to: 1) the composite outcome of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF); 2) CV death; and 3) the composite outcome of renal death, dialysis/transplant, or doubling of serum creatinine from baseline.

Methods

Patients ≥ 40 years old with T2DM (HbA1c 7.0–10.5%) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) of the coronary, cerebral, and/or peripheral arterial systems, were randomized 1:1:1 to once daily double-blind placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg added to existing therapy.

Results

8246 patients were randomized and 8238 received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Mean age was 64.4 years, 11.0% were ≥ 75 years old, and mean diabetes duration was 12.9 years with screening HbA1c of 8.3%. At entry, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease were present in 76.3%, 23.1%, and 18.8% of patients, respectively. HF was present in 23.1%, and Stage 3 kidney disease in 21.6% of patients.

Conclusion

The results from the VERTIS-CV trial will define the CV and renal safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in patients with T2DM and ASCVD.

### Ertugliflozin and slope of chronic eGFR: prespecified analyses from the randomized VERTIS CV trial [^2d52939e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

A reduction in the rate of eGFR decline, with preservation of ≥ 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year, has been proposed as a surrogate for kidney disease progression. We report results from prespecified analyses assessing effects of ertugliflozin versus placebo on eGFR slope from the eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and Safety CardioVascular outcomes (VERTIS CV) trial (NCT01986881).

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg (1:1:1). The analyses compared the effect of ertugliflozin (pooled doses, n = 5499) versus placebo (n = 2747) on eGFR slope per week and per year by random coefficient models. Study periods (weeks 0–6 and weeks 6–52) and total and chronic slopes (week 0 or week 6 to weeks 104, 156, 208, and 260) were modeled separately and by baseline kidney status.

Results

In the overall population, for weeks 0–6, the least squares mean eGFR slopes (ml/min per 1.73m 2 per week [95% confidence interval (95% CI)]) were -0.07 (-0.16 to 0.03) and -0.54 (-0.61 to -0.48) for the placebo and ertugliflozin groups, respectively; the difference was -0.47 (-0.59 to -0.36). During weeks 6–52, least squares mean eGFR slopes (ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year [95% CI]) were -0.12 (-0.70 to 0.46) and 1.62 (1.21 to 2.02) for the placebo and ertugliflozin groups, respectively; the difference was 1.74 (1.03 to 2.45). For weeks 6–156, least squares mean eGFR slopes (ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year [95% CI]) were -1.51 (-1.70 to -1.32) and -0.32 (-0.45 to -0.19) for the placebo and ertugliflozin groups, respectively; the difference was 1.19 (0.95 to 1.42). During weeks 0–156, the placebo-adjusted difference in least squares mean slope was 1.06 (0.85 to 1.27). These findings were consistent by baseline kidney status.

Conclusions

Ertugliflozin has a favorable placebo-adjusted eGFR slope > 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year, documenting the kidney function preservation underlying the clinical benefits of ertugliflozin on kidney disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Initial eGFR changes with ertugliflozin and associations with clinical parameters: analyses from the VERTIS CV trial [^8f46e619]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The population in this analysis, like the population in the analysis from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, has a lower risk for kidney disease than the population from the CREDENCE study. These analyses have limitations. As "dipping" status was defined based on eGFR change at 6 weeks, the analyses were not based on patients being randomized to eGFR categories. The classification of "dipping status" is a post-randomization stratification by a factor directly affected by the intervention, with all associated limitations of such stratified analyses. Although "dipping" status was associated with differential statistically significant effects on natriuresis- and glucosuria-related parameters, these changes may not have been clinically relevant. These were prespecified exploratory measures but were not controlled for type 1 error, while analyses of safety measures were post hoc and also not controlled for type 1 error. The number of participants decreased through the observation period, limiting the interpretability of the results at later time points. Finally, UACR does have inherent limitations due, in part, to variability of single UACR measures. Nevertheless, VERTIS CV included a large sample size, which mitigated some of the inherent limitations around the use of single UACR measurements at each time point. This analysis highlights the heterogeneity in responses seen in clinical trials, and the importance of characterizing these differences to further understand the efficacy and safety of medications.

In conclusion, in these analyses of data from VERTIS CV, the early eGFR "dip" was associated with kidney function preservation after week 6, possibly due to changes in glomerular hemodynamics due to treatment with ertugliflozin. eGFR "dipping" was also associated with larger natriuresis-related clinical effects and attenuation of glucosuria-linked factors. The degree of eGFR "dip" was not associated with meaningful safety findings. In VERTIS CV, the eGFR "dip" does not affect the sustained ≥ 40% decline in eGFR outcome compared with placebo.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular event protections: how applicable are clinical trials and observational studies to real-world patients? [^243cf1c1]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) is a new drug class for type 2 diabetes management based on reducing renal glucose re-absorption and increasing elimination of excess glucose. It decreases blood glucose levels and provides additional benefits through the control of body weight and blood pressure. Meta-analyses from three large randomized clinical trials (RCT), Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) program, Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE)-TIMI 58 trial, Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial, found that SGLT2i reduced major adverse cardiovascular event risks in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These trials established the fundamental evidence regarding the uses of SGLT2i for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, and the findings from another trial, the evaluation of ertugliflozin efficacy and safety cardiovascular outcomes (VERTIS-CV) will be available after 2020.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Trial design

VERTIS CV (identifier: NCT01986881) was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, multicentre trial. Detailed trial design and primary results have been previously reported.

Eligible participants (N = 8246) were randomized (1:1:1) to oral, once‐daily ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg or placebo in addition to background standard‐of‐care treatment, including diet and exercise counselling at every visit by protocol, consistent with local standards. Changes to the background glucose‐lowering treatment were not allowed for the first 18 weeks of the study except when participants met pre‐defined glycaemic rescue thresholds or were experiencing clinically significant hypoglycaemia but thereafter were encouraged.

2.2 Participants

Adults (aged ≥ 40 years) with T2D (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 53–91 mmol/mol), and stable, established ASCVD involving the coronary, cerebrovascular, and/or peripheral arterial systems were randomly assigned to oral, once‐daily ertugliflozin 5 mg, 15 mg or placebo. A minimum BMI of 18 kg/m 2 was required with no upper limit. Patients who were not weight‐stable (defined as < 5% change in body weight in the last 6 months), for example, due to a weight‐loss programme, a weight‐loss medication, other medication associated with weight changes or had undergone bariatric surgery, were excluded. Other relevant eligibility criteria are outlined in Table S1. Participants were grouped according to baseline BMI: < 25, 25– < 30, 30– < 35 and ≥ 35 kg/m 2. At baseline, 192 (3.5%) and 86 (3.1%) participants in the ertugliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, were receiving GLP‐1 receptor agonists compared with 268 (4.9%) and 153 (5.6%) at the end of the study.

### Cardiorenal outcomes with ertugliflozin assessed according to baseline glucose-lowering agent: an analysis from VERTIS CV [^2905f813]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In keeping with previously published VERTIS studies, ertugliflozin led to greater reductions in HbA1c, body weight and SBP compared with placebo., These reductions were irrespective of baseline glucose‐lowering agent, supporting the glycaemic, metabolic and haemodynamic benefits of adding ertugliflozin to any existing glucose‐lowering regimens. Changes in HbA1c, body weight and SBP with ertugliflozin versus placebo in each baseline glucose‐lowering agent class were similar to those observed in the overall VERTIS CV population.

The pattern of initial dip in eGFR with ertugliflozin treatment in all baseline glucose‐lowering agent drug classes, followed by stabilization, is consistent with the results from the overall VERTIS CV population. The change in UACR in all baseline glucose‐lowering agent classes observed in these analyses is also consistent with the results from the overall VERTIS CV population. The slowing of eGFR decline and lowering of UACR has also been reported with other SGLT2 inhibitors, with an analysis of the DECLARE TIMI study by baseline glucose‐lowering agent showing similar results. Together with the reduction in risk for the composite kidney outcome, these data emphasize the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risk for progression of diabetic kidney disease, regardless of choice of initial glucose‐lowering therapy.

### Ertugliflozin delays insulin initiation and reduces insulin dose requirements in patients with type 2 diabetes: analyses from VERTIS CV [^962198a2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

VERTIS CV evaluated the cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Objective

The aim of these analyses was to assess the insulin requirements of VERTIS CV patients over the trial duration.

Methods

Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg, 15 mg, or placebo once daily; mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Time to insulin initiation in patients who were insulin naïve at baseline, change in insulin dose in patients receiving baseline insulin, and hypoglycemia incidence in both patient groups were assessed.

Results

In VERTIS CV, mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 13.0 years; glycated hemoglobin was 8.2%. Among 4348 (53%) insulin-naïve patients, the likelihood of insulin initiation was significantly reduced with ertugliflozin vs placebo (ertugliflozin 5 mg: hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.58–0.84; ertugliflozin 15 mg: HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53–0.78). Time to insulin initiation was delayed with ertugliflozin; the estimated delay in reaching a 10% cumulative incidence of new insulin initiations vs placebo was 399 days with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 669 days with ertugliflozin 15 mg. Among 3898 (47%) patients receiving baseline insulin, the likelihood of requiring a ≥ 20% increase in insulin dose was significantly reduced with ertugliflozin vs placebo (ertugliflozin 5 mg: HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52–0.75; ertugliflozin 15 mg: HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.41–0.62). The incidence of hypoglycemia events was not increased with ertugliflozin treatment.

Conclusion

In VERTIS CV patients, ertugliflozin reduced the likelihood of insulin initiation, delayed the time to insulin initiation by up to ∼1.8 years, and reduced insulin dose requirements vs placebo, without increasing hypoglycemia events.

### Efficacy of ertugliflozin on heart failure-related events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: results of the VERTIS CV trial [^de4b0bec]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The primary results of the VERTIS CV trial have been published recently. This cardiovascular (CV) safety trial, performed to satisfy the 2008 guidance from regulatory agencies for new antihyperglycemic agents, found that patients with T2DM with ASCVD randomly assigned to ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg achieved the primary objective of noninferiority to placebo in time to first major adverse CV event, a composite end point of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 [95.6% CI, 0.85–1.11]; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The first secondary outcome in the hierarchical testing sequence was superiority for the time to composite of CV death or HHF, which was not met (HR, 0.88 [95.8% CI, 0.75–1.03]; P = 0.11 for superiority); therefore, formal hypothesis testing ended with this end point. In this report, we present results from prespecified analyses of the effect of ertugliflozin versus placebo on a series of HF-related outcomes from the VERTIS CV randomized clinical trial.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: are they all the same? A narrative review of cardiovascular outcome trials [^7df8bd5d]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A major difference in the study population in the VERTIS-CV trial was the higher proportion of participants with heart failure (~ 24%) compared with other major CVOTs (~ 10–15%). Additionally, over 80% of the participants with heart failure in VERTIS-CV had HFpEF and less than 20% had HFrEF, which may have skewed the results as the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF is currently unknown. The ongoing EMPEROR-preserved and DELIVER trials will soon publish their results on the effect of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin in this difficult-to-treat population and may shed light on this discussion point. Indeed, the proportion of HFpEF compared with HFrEF in other major CVOTs including DECLARE-TIMI is unknown and may have affected these results as we know SGLT2 inhibitors improved cardiovascular mortality in DAPA-HF, at least.

Differences in the population risk for cardiovascular events in different trials may also affect the statistical interpretation of cardiovascular outcomes. Whilst the EMPA-REG and VERTIS-CV trials included only participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI included participants with either established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This is reflected in the cardiovascular event rate between trials, as DECLARE-TIMI had the lowest cardiovascular event rate per 1000 patient years compared with CANVAS and EMPA-REG trials. This may cause a statistical artefact resulting in statistical insignificance between the dapagliflozin and placebo arms of the trial. Unfortunately, at the time of writing a comparative event rate per 1000 patient years with the VERTIS-CV study was not available as we await the full publication of trial outcomes.

### Glycemic efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease: an analysis from the VERTIS CV randomized trial [^625ecee0]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The observation that after the initial dip in eGFR with ertugliflozin treatment, eGFR returned to baseline and remained near or above baseline to the end of the study in patients with CKD stage 3, as opposed to remaining below baseline as was observed in the overall VERTIS CV population, is consistent with the results from CV outcomes trials of other SGLT2 inhibitors. As is the case for the long-term pattern of changes in eGFR observed in the overall VERTIS CV population, the present results also suggest an effect of ertugliflozin on the preservation of kidney function in patients with baseline eGFR levels between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

The goal of the VERTIS CV trial was to attempt to achieve glycemic equipoise between the placebo and ertugliflozin groups. Although it is unlikely the modest reductions in HbA1c observed in the CKD stage 3 subgroup contributed significantly to cardiorenal outcomes in these patients, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and other landmark studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between HbA1c reduction and decreased risk of microvascular complications (reviewed in reference). From that perspective, reductions in HbA1c of the magnitude observed in this analysis would be clinically meaningful. Moreover, the attenuated glycemic efficacy observed with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD stage 3 should be viewed within the broader context of other effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient population who are at high risk of further deterioration of kidney function over time and of HHF. Preservation of kidney function and reduction in the risk of HHF in patients with CKD stage 3 have been demonstrated by other members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class. In VERTIS CV, prespecified secondary analyses have demonstrated that treatment with ertugliflozin, compared with placebo, slowed the deterioration of kidney-filtering capacity (eGFR), reduced albuminuria (UACR), and reduced progression and increased regression of albuminuria across a range of baseline kidney function subgroups defined by baseline eGFR (including CKD stage 3), albuminuria, and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes risk categories. In VERTIS CV, the assessment of HHF risk was a prespecified secondary objective. The assessment showed that ertugliflozin treatment, compared with placebo, was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of HHF. In addition, the effect of ertugliflozin on reducing the risk of HHF was greater (higher relative risk reductions and absolute risk reductions) in the subgroup of VERTIS CV patients with CKD stage 3.

### Generalizability of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcome trials to the type 2 diabetes population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d245a976]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

What could be the reasons for these results? Firstly, this reflects the differences in the enrollment criteria of each CVOT. It is common knowledge that only patients with a history of cardiovascular disease could be enrolled in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and VERTIS-CV, while patients in primary prevention were eligible for CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58, too. In the former group of studies, there were only some minor variations, including: (1) age, since EMPA-REG OUTCOME enrolled adults of any age, while only subjects aged ≥ 40 years were considered eligible for VERTIS-CV; (2) HbA1c, ranging from 7.0 to 10.0% versus 7.0 to 10.5%, respectively; and (3) BMI, since EMPA-REG OUTCOME excluded subjects with a BMI > 45 kg/m 2, while VERTIS-CV included only those with a BMI ≥ 18 kg/m 2. On the other hand, concerning the latter group of studies, while in CANVAS two or more risk factors (in addition to age) were needed for a patient without a history of a cardiovascular disease to be eligible, only one risk factor (in addition to age) among hypertension, dyslipidemia or tobacco use was enough for DECLARE-TIMI 58. Other differences included: (1) age, since subjects with established cardiovascular disease could have been eligible for CANVAS if ≥ 30 years versus ≥ 40 years for DECLARE-TIMI 58; (2) type of cardiovascular events, with no clear reference to patients with unstable angina in two trials; (3) type of risk factors. Furthermore, DECLARE-TIMI 58 was characterized by a wider range of HbA1c, from 6.5% to 12.0%, versus 7.0% to 10 or 10.5% in the other protocols. The cut-off for the renal function may also play a role. Despite a more restrictive cut-off reported in DECLARE-TIMI 58 (CrCl ≥ 60 versus eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), this did not result in a lower prevalence of eligibility. Whether this could be partially due to the different equations employed for the estimation of the renal function, as DECLARE-TIMI 58 adopted the Cockroft-Gault formula and CANVAS, EMPA-REG OUTCOME and VERTIS-CV the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, is unclear (Additional file 3).

Discussion

The overall results of VERTIS CV together with the recently published meta-analysis indicate that the effect of ertugliflozin on HHF in patients with T2DM with ASCVD is consistent with that found across the class of SGLT2 inhibitors. In the current prespecified analyses, we report more detailed data with ertugliflozin on HF-related outcomes. In comparison with other recent SGLT2 inhibitor CV outcome trials in patients with T2DM, the VERTIS CV population included the largest proportion of patients with a history of HF, 23.7% of the overall trial population, similar to the proportion found in a typical diabetes clinical practice (20%–30%).VERTIS CV also had the largest set of data on pretrial EF available, for 60.7% of patients in the trial, facilitating additional analyses of CV outcomes based on the presence or absence of HF history, and EF values, as well.

Overall, patients included in VERTIS CV were well treated with guideline-directed medical therapy for use in patients with T2DM and established ASCVD, including β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, antiplatelets, and statins. Use of diuretics, specifically loop diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were higher in patients with HF history as expected for this population. Although CV disease treatments were balanced in general, the proportion of patients reported as taking statins and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists at baseline was slightly higher in VERTIS CV than the proportion in the other SGLT2 inhibitor CV outcome trials. In those with a history of HF in comparison with those without a history of HF, and those with HF and EF ≤ 45% in comparison with those with HF and EF > 45% or EF unknown, the baseline use of diuretics, especially loop diuretics, was notably higher. The group of patients with HF and reduced EF (EF ≤ 45%) had, as expected, a higher proportion of males and a higher proportion of patients with New York Heart Association class III functional status.

### Efficacy of ertugliflozin on heart failure-related events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: results of the VERTIS CV trial [^5208987a]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, although CV outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM have shown heterogeneous results with regard to the effects on CV death (HRs ranging from 0.62 to 0.98), there has been remarkable consistency in the observed reduction in risk for first event of HHF across these trials, with HRs ranging from 0.61 to 0.73. In VERTIS CV, the magnitude and timing of the reduction in risk of HHF, with consistent demonstration of an early benefit after study drug initiation, and the consistency of effect between doses correspond to what has been reported for other members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in patients with T2DM and different levels of CV risk (with and without ASCVD). Similar findings have been reported in trial populations with albuminuric diabetic kidney disease, and with HF and reduced EF with or without T2DM.

This report further characterizes the effects of ertugliflozin on HHF events by baseline subgroups. Most clinical, demographic, and background treatment characteristics in VERTIS CV had no apparent modifying effect on risk for first HHF with ertugliflozin treatment. Specifically, a history of HF, although representing a subgroup of higher absolute risk for HHF, had no apparent influence on the relative risk reduction of ertugliflozin treatment. With regard to background treatment, findings with diuretics overall and specifically loop diuretics suggest that the treatment effect of ertugliflozin on the time to first HHF outcome appears favorable. Effect modification by diuretic use was also previously suggested for the composite of HHF/CV death. Favorable interactions with diuretics on HHF and other CV outcomes have also been noted for other members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class. In the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure), which had a very high proportion (> 93%) of patients taking diuretics at baseline, a favorable impact of dapagliflozin on time to HHF was demonstrated.SGLT2 inhibitors are functional in the proximal tubule, proximal to the site of frequently used diuretic agents, and impacting sodium, chloride, and water handling in the renal tubule; hence, functional interaction with diuretics has mechanistic plausibility.

### Lower risk of heart failure and death in patients initiated on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs: the CVD-REAL study (comparative effectiveness of cardiovascular outcomes in new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) [^ca9d9e49]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Although intensive glucose lowering has, in randomized trials, failed to reduce what are arguably some of the most important outcomes in patients with T2D (all-cause death and incident HF), results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial demonstrated that such benefits are achievable within a short time frame with an SGLT-2i, likely via nonglycemic mechanisms. Ultimately, the main goals of treating patients with T2D are to prolong life and improve quality of life. Given that CVD (including HF) is a leading cause of mortality/morbidity in T2D, the results of the recent cardiovascular outcomes trials suggest that the time has come to shift from the narrow focus on hemoglobin A1c to a more comprehensive focus in which treatments proven to improve important outcomes (especially mortality) are prioritized.

Our findings address several key unanswered questions with regard to the potential role of SGLT-2i in the management of T2D, with important clinical implications. First, our results demonstrate that the effects associated with the use of SGLT-2i in regard to HHF and all-cause death are remarkably similar in real-world practice to those seen in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Second, we found no significant heterogeneity in results across countries, despite geographic variations in the use of specific SGLT-2i, suggesting that the associated lower risks for cardiovascular outcomes are likely class related. Indeed, for all outcomes evaluated, empagliflozin contributed < 7% of total exposure time. Third, we evaluated a broader cardiovascular risk population in general practice, where the overwhelming majority (87%) had no established CVD, suggesting that lower-risk patients may derive benefits with SGLT-2i similar to the patients with higher risk. If confirmed by data from ongoing trials (CANVAS[Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study; NCT01032629]; DECLARE [Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events; NCT01730534]; and VERTIS [Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Ertugliflozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Participants With Vascular Disease, The VERTIS CV Study {MK-8835-004}; NCT01986881]), this would have substantial impact on clinical practice. In this regard, we see the data produced from carefully conducted, methodologically rigorous, large multicountry epidemiological studies, as complementary to those generated by clinical trials, as they help establish the real-world effectiveness of treatments in a broad population of patients from clinical practice. Indeed, the importance of such studies for a broad range of objectives, including evaluation of treatment effects and outcomes, and their potential for complementing the knowledge gained from clinical trials, is being increasingly recognized, and the terminology describing these as real-world evidence has recently been accepted by major international regulatory bodies. –

### Glycemic efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease: an analysis from the VERTIS CV randomized trial [^3a2cf3d4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Ertugliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in adults with T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control.VERTIS CV was the CV outcome trial for ertugliflozin, conducted in patients with T2DM and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which assessed the CV safety of ertugliflozin. Enrollment criteria in VERTIS CV allowed for the entry of patients with an eGFR as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at screening, providing an opportunity for a characterization of glycemic efficacy, CV outcomes, and safety across a spectrum of kidney function. The present analyses assessed the glycemic efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in the subgroup of VERTIS CV patients with CKD stage 3 at trial entry.

### Heart failure outcomes captured by adverse event reporting in participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: observations from the VERTIS CV trial [^a96150bd]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings illustrate that ertugliflozin was associated with substantial reductions in risk of less severe HF events, which may not result in hospitalization, in addition to the previously reported reductions to HHF. These findings corroborate prior reports of other SGLT2i, which reduce outpatient worsening HF events and meaningfully improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with HF. Together, these findings highlight the potential effect of ertugliflozin in improving patients' prognosis and health status across the spectrum of HF event severity.

Another salient finding is the comparison of the efficacy of ertugliflozin on adjudicated HHF events to all investigator‐reported events. We noted substantially more AEs and SAEs for HF overall compared with adjudication‐confirmed HHF based on standardized definitions, and ertugliflozin was associated with a 34% and 38% reduction in total HF AEs and SAEs, respectively, which is similar to the previously reported 30% reduction in total adjudicated HHF events. Event adjudication is commonly performed in CV outcome trials to decrease subjectivity, lessen the risk of misclassification, and to improve internal validity. While adjudicated events are highly specific for event criteria, our study findings suggests that broader, less strict criteria for HF events may be utilized in future trials. Such an approach would increase the number of HF events and lessen the sample size requirements, potentially decreasing the cost and complexity of conducting a clinical trial. However, as non‐adjudicated events (such as peripheral oedema) are frequently less severe, caution should be maintained to ensure adequate power across the spectrum of both severe and non‐severe HF events to best understand treatment effects across the entire patient experience. These findings are limited by the post hoc nature of the analyses. While the MedDRA terms utilized have been well validated, and AEs were rigorously captured within the clinical trial, there is potential for misclassification of AEs as HF and reporting biases as they are subject to individual clinician interpretation rather than standardized adjudication processes. However, a consistent treatment effect of ertugliflozin on the risk for HF events as determined by investigator‐reported AEs/SAEs versus adjudicated HHF events suggests that reporting bias was not a major limiting factor and highlights the potential utility of investigator‐reported AEs as a pragmatic approach to assess HF outcomes.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular event protections: how applicable are clinical trials and observational studies to real-world patients? [^1bd2a772]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Existing CVD history provides strong associations with an increased risk of recurrent CVD events, for example, Hu et al indicated around two-fold increase in CVD mortality in patients with diabetes and previous myocardial infarction, compared with diabetes only. This may highlight the importance of separating the roles of medications for primary prevention for those without a CVD history, and secondary prevention of re-occurrence of CVD events. Similar to other studies, we considered the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and VERTIS-CV trial results only applicable to a small proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes with CVD history (26.4%–27.2%) before receiving SGLT2i in our cohort.

Although the CANVAS program and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes with varying CVD risks, such as prevalent CVD or non-prevalent CVD with at least one major risk factor (eg, dyslipidemia), only 75.9% of canagliflozin and 65.8% of dapagliflozin new users met their inclusion criteria of CVD risk for the corresponding clinical trials. In addition, adherence to SGLT2i might differ between clinical trials and real-world practice, which may contribute to contrasting results. For example, medication adherence can be confounded by selection bias, where patients with more severe diseases (eg, established CVD) tend to be more adherent to medication, perhaps due to a perception of greater need. Therefore, patients with established CVD may have better awareness of disease controls with optimal treatment outcomes. Based on our evaluations, we suggest that the findings from current CV outcome trials may not apply to real-world patients, especially in patients with lower CVD risk.

### How representative of a general type 2 diabetes population are patients included in cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors? A large European observational study [^27d21894]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) disease. 1 Recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have shown clinically important results in reducing CV risk when using sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2is), and further studies are upcoming. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 The generalizability of the results of clinical trials to common clinical practice is recognized as a major issue. This is often evaluated as external validity of the study as it is important in clinical decision making and in implementation of new clinical guidelines. As enrolment criteria vary among SGLT2‐i CVOTs, it is expected that they will have an impact on the external validity of the results. An understanding of external validity is particularly important as the recently updated ADA/EASD position statement concerning glucose‐lowering therapy in patients with T2D has strengthened the position of SGLT‐2is. 7 Many CVOTs include patients with a high risk of CV and with an expected high rate of CV events, to ensure that differences in CV outcomes may be reported with sufficient statistical power. As a consequence, various degrees of strict CVOT patient enrolment criteria may impact the representativeness of the trial population of a general T2D population and, thus, may also impact the external validity of study results. 8, 9

Four CVOTs that examined treatment with SGLT‐2is are within the scope of this study. 3, 4, 5, 6 Major differences exist among these CVOTs concerning inclusion criteria. Two of the trials included only patients with established CV disease (EMPA‐REG OUTCOME 5 and VERTIS‐CV 10), while the other two trials also included patients with additional CV risk factors (DECLARE‐TIMI 58, 6 ≥ 2 CV risk factors, and CANVAS, 4 ≥ 3 CV risk factors).

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the representativeness of four SGLT‐2i CVOTs (CANVAS, EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, VERTIS‐CV, DECLARE‐TIMI 58) by applying the respective main inclusion and exclusion criteria to a general T2D population within four European countries.

### Cardiorenal outcomes with ertugliflozin assessed according to baseline glucose-lowering agent: an analysis from VERTIS CV [^dbeb7c50]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess selected cardiorenal outcomes with ertugliflozin according to use of baseline glucose-lowering agent.

Materials and Methods

VERTIS CV was a cardiovascular (CV) outcome trial for ertugliflozin versus placebo, conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic CV disease. The primary outcome was time to the first event of CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke (major adverse CV events [MACE]), with other CV outcomes also assessed. Outcomes were analysed using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by baseline use of metformin, insulin, sulphonylureas (SUs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, with interaction testing to assess for treatment effect modification. Changes from baseline in glycaemic, metabolic and haemodynamic variables were also assessed.

Results

Of 8246 randomized patients, at baseline 6286 (76%) were on metformin, 3898 (47%) were on insulin, 3383 (41%) were on SUs and 911 (11%) were on DPP-4 inhibitors, alone or in combination therapy (67% used > 1 glucose-lowering agent at baseline). For each glucose-lowering agent evaluated, no evidence for effect modification was observed for MACE by baseline use of metformin (with: hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.790, 1.073; without: 1.13, 95% CI 0.867, 1.480), insulin (with: HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.765, 1.092; without: 1.06, 95% CI 0.867, 1.293), SUs (with: HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.890, 1.388; without: 0.90, 95% CI 0.761, 1.060) or DPP-4 inhibitors (with: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.502, 1.173; without: 1.00, 95% CI 0.867, 1.147) (all P interaction > 0.05). Similar results were observed for all secondary outcomes analysed.

Conclusion

In VERTIS CV, the effects of ertugliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes were consistent across subgroups of patients stratified by baseline glucose-lowering agent.

### Report from the CVOT summit 2020: new cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^d2cb8e38]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

The 6th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit "Cardiovascular and Renal Outcomes 2020" was the first to be held virtually on October 29–30, 2020. As in previous years, this summit served as reference meeting for in-depth discussions on the topic of recently completed and presented major outcome trials. This year, focus was placed on the outcomes of VERTIS-CV, EMPEROR-Reduced, DAPA-CKD, and FIDELIO-DKD. Trial implications for diabetes management and the impact on new treatment algorithms were highlighted for diabetologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and general practitioners. Discussion evolved from major outcome trials using SGLT-2 inhibitors for treatment and prevention of heart failure and chronic kidney disease in people with and without diabetes, to additional therapy options for chronic kidney disease with a novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Furthermore, challenges in diabetes management like COVID-19 and obesity, as well as novel treatment strategies and guidelines, were discussed. The 7th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial Summit will be held virtually on November, 18–19, 2021 (http://www.cvot.org).

### How generalizable are cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 inhibitors? A national database study: study protocol [^4de95fa8]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Further trials have been carried out more recently to explore whether other SGLT2 inhibitors used to treat T2DM patients have similar cardiovascular benefits. The multicenter trial to evaluate the effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events ([DECLARE])-TIMI 58; referred to hereafter as the DECLARE trial) demonstrated non-inferiority of dapagliflozin for major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with this drug compared to placebo, as well as significantly reduced hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death. Another CVOT, the Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Ertugliflozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Participants with Vascular Disease (VERTIS CV) trial, is estimated to be completed in September 2019. However, despite the cardiovascular safety/efficacy demonstrated by CVOTs, the real-world applicability of these findings to patients in clinical practice is uncertain.

We have previously compared the cardiovascular risk profile of T2DM patients in an English primary care dataset with that of trial participants using the inclusion criteria of the EMPA-REG trial. Our findings showed that the results of the EMPA-REG trial were only applicable to a small proportion of people with T2DM, and to an even smaller proportion of those prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor. The applicability of other SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs to real-world clinical practice in a primary care setting is yet to be elucidated.

In this protocol we describe the method which will be used in our study to compare the cardiovascular risk profile of patients in a real-world primary care setting to that of participants in each of the four SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs mentioned in the preceding text (CANVAS Program, DECLARE, EMPA-REG, and VERTIS CV). The results will inform the extent to which the previous and upcoming findings of each trial can be generalized to a real-world setting.

This prespecified exploratory analyses from VERTIS CV (NCT01986881) aimed to assess the effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor ertugliflozin on glucosuria-related (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c], uric acid, body weight) and natriuresis-related (blood pressure, haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum albumin) biomarkers according to kidney function risk category.

Materials and Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to placebo, ertugliflozin 5mg, or ertugliflozin 15mg (1:1:1). Analyses compared placebo (n = 2747) versus ertugliflozin (pooled; n = 5499) on glucosuria- and natriuresis-related biomarkers according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) subgroup and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (KDIGO CKD) risk category.

Results

Patients were classified according to KDIGO CKD low- (49%), moderate- (32%) and high-/very-high-risk categories (19%), and eGFR groups 1 (25%), 2 (53%) and 3 (19%). At Week 18, the high-/very-high-risk category had a smaller placebo-subtracted least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline (95% confidence interval) in HbA1c (-0.34 [-0.43, -0.25]) compared with the low- and moderate-risk categories (-0.54 [-0.60, -0.49] and-0.47 [-0.54, -0.40], respectively). This pattern was maintained throughout the study (P interaction = 0.0001). Similar patterns based on baseline eGFR G stage were observed. Placebo-subtracted LSM changes from baseline in uric acid were lowest in the high-/very-high-risk category at Weeks 6 and 18, but the pattern was not maintained after Week 156 (P interaction = 0.15). Effects of ertugliflozin on body weight and natriuresis-related biomarkers did not differ across KDIGO CKD categories.

Conclusions

In VERTIS CV, ertugliflozin was associated with physiologically favourable changes in glucosuria- and natriuresis-related biomarkers. Glycaemic efficacy of ertugliflozin was attenuated in patients with higher chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. Effects on other biomarkers were consistent, regardless of CKD risk stage.

### How representative of a general type 2 diabetes population are patients included in cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors? A large European observational study [^3fe61b39]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The most important differences among designs of the respective CVOTs are the inclusion criteria determining CV risk at baseline, relevant when using CV outcomes as measures. Here, two of the studies, DECLARE‐TIMI 58 and CANVAS, allowed for inclusion of patients without established CV disease, but with multiple CV risk factors, whereas the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME and VERTIS‐CV studies limited participants to T2D patients with established CV disease. 3, 4, 5, 6 Our results clearly show that the use of less restrictive CV inclusion criteria enhances representativeness, as in the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 6 and CANVAS 4 trials as compared to the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME and VERTIS‐CV trials. 3, 5

Wittbrodt et al. recently reported a comparison of representativeness of the CVOTs as compared to a US population when also using laboratory data to define enrolment criteria. 18 Interestingly, despite large differences in data sources as well as demographics and methods, striking similarities were found in the comparison of US and Dutch results when laboratory data were used in a sensitivity analysis (Figure S1, Online Supplemental Appendix). Compared to the results of our primary analysis without laboratory data, representativeness was reduced for all CVOTs and the most important explanation for this was the HbA1c inclusion limits. Also, the relative difference in representativeness between the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial and the other CVOTs increased substantially when including laboratory data, mainly HbA1c driven, as found in the study by Wittbrodt et al. 18 with less restrictive HbA1c inclusion criteria than that of the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial compared to the other trials (Figure S1, Online Supplemental Appendix).

### Association of SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^8de11bc3]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

When initially approved for clinical use, SGLT2 inhibitors had product-labeled cautions or contraindications for use in patients with reduced eGFR, based exclusively on the attenuation of glycemic efficacy as eGFR wanes and without specific safety concerns that typically underpin eGFR-based prescriptions. However, with the demonstration of CV and kidney benefits across the spectrum of kidney function in patients enrolled in trials to date, an eGFR as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the CANVAS trials, VERTIS CV, and CREDENCE, liberalization of these restrictions is now justified. For example, based on the results from CREDENCE, canagliflozin has a product-labeled indication to reduce the incidence and progression of kidney disease, approved for initiation down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, with use allowed to continue in patients taking canagliflozin until initiation of dialysis. Similarly, society recommendations and guidelines endorse the use of all SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or higher, independent of glucose considerations and based wholly on the CV and kidney benefits as supported by the present meta-analyses.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: are they all the same? A narrative review of cardiovascular outcome trials [^f368fd52]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials consistently results in improved cardiovascular risk factors, renal outcomes, HHF rates and does not lead to cardiovascular harm. However, there is some inconsistency with respect to 3-point MACE and cardiovascular mortality between different trials and even between trials investigating the same drug. These differences probably result from variations in the participant characteristics in each study and the subsequent cardiovascular event rate in each trial influencing statistical analysis. Yet, dissimilarities in their pharmacology such as their relative affinity for SGLT2 or pharmacodynamic properties may explain some of these differences. Nevertheless, there are now so many cardiovascular, renal and heart failure outcome trials with different study designs, interventions and outcomes it is increasingly difficult to see the wood from the trees. We await the full publication of the VERTIS-CV, DAPA-CKD, DELIVER and EMPEROR-preserved trials which we hope will shed some light on some of these discrepancies.

### Ertugliflozin and hospitalization for heart failure across the spectrum of pre-trial ejection fraction: post-hoc analyses of the VERTIS CV trial [^40493e66]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Of 8246 participants in VERTIS CV, 959 (11.6%) had EF ≤ 45, 2860 (34.7%) had EF > 45%–60%, 1187 (14.4%) had EF > 60%, and 3240 (39.3%) had unknown EF. Among participants with known EF, those with EF > 60% vs. EF ≤ 45% were more likely to be women, had a lower burden of coronary artery disease (80.0% vs. 95.6%), had a higher burden of cerebrovascular disease (22.5% vs. 11.4%), and had lower use of diuretics (43.1% vs. 58.5%) and beta-blocking agents (70.3% vs. 87.3%) at baseline.

### Initial eGFR changes with ertugliflozin and associations with clinical parameters: analyses from the VERTIS CV trial [^770fac46]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Using data from the ertugliflozin cardiovascular outcomes trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (VERTIS CV; NCT01986881), associations between the initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) "dip" with eGFR slope, glucosuria/natriuresis-related measures, and safety were investigated.

Methods

Patients were categorized into tertiles based on change in eGFR at week 6: > +1.00 mL/min/1.73 m2 (tertile 1), > -5.99 and ≤ +1.00 (tertile 2), and ≤ -6.00 (tertile 3). eGFR slope after week 6 and week 18 was assessed by tertile. Glucosuria/natriuresis-related measures were also determined. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed in the acute (baseline-week 6) and chronic periods (week 6–30 days after last dose of trial medication).

Results

In the ertugliflozin group, chronic eGFR slopes (95% CI, mL/min/1.73 m2/year; weeks 6–156) were -0.76 (-1.03, -0.50), -0.29 (-0.51, -0.07), and -0.05 (-0.26, 0.17) in tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p value < 0.001), and approximately -1.5 mL/min/1.73 m2/year across tertiles in the placebo group (p value = 0.79). At week 18, least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (%) were -0.77, -0.71, and -0.67 in tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in the ertugliflozin group; a similar tertile-associated trend was observed for uric acid. At week 18, LSM changes from baseline in hematocrit (%) were 2.07, 2.33, and 2.55 in tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in the ertugliflozin group; similar tertile-associated trends were observed for blood pressure. All pinteraction values were < 0.0001 for glucosuria- and natriuresis-related measures. Kidney-related AEs were reported more frequently in tertiles 3 and 2 in the chronic period for both placebo- and ertugliflozin-treated groups. In both periods and in all tertiles, incidences of AEs did not differ between placebo- and ertugliflozin-treated groups.

Conclusion

With ertugliflozin, the tertile with the largest initial dip in eGFR had a slower rate of chronic eGFR decline. Initial eGFR changes were associated with changes in both glucosuria- and natriuresis-related measures.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by sulfonylurea monotherapy: a substudy of VERTIS CV [^6e60fbed]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this substudy of the VERTIS CV trial, the addition of ertugliflozin to SU monotherapy reduced HbA1c from baseline at week 18 vs. placebo in patients with T2DM, but the difference was nonsignificant based on the prespecified primary analysis that was restricted to patients from Cohort 1. However, a post-hoc analysis that included a larger patient population (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and provided greater power to detect between-group differences demonstrated a significant difference, and is possibly more reflective of results that might occur when adding a SGLT2 inhibitor to SU monotherapy. In this substudy, ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated and the associated incidence of AEs was consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors. While recognizing the limitations of this study, these data suggest a favorable benefit–risk profile when ertugliflozin is combined with SUs in patients with T2DM.

### Long-term weight loss and cardiorenal outcomes by baseline BMI in the VERTIS CV trial [^493cfbb4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Previously, pooled data (N = 1377) from the VERTIS Phase 3 programme revealed similar findings. Participants with baseline BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 had a greater reduction in body weight and a higher proportion of participants achieving weight loss of ≥ 5% from baseline with ertugliflozin versus placebo at Week 26. Reductions in body weight ranged from 2.4 to 4.3 kg across BMI subgroups at 26 weekscompared with 2.7 to 8.2 kg across BMI subgroups at 5 years in the current analyses. The current analyses reinforce the findings from the VERTIS Phase 3 programme 26‐week analysis and suggest a longer‐term (follow‐up of ≥ 5 years), progressive weight loss benefit of ertugliflozin.

These data highlight the sustained weight loss potential of ertugliflozin in people with T2D and ASCVD across the BMI spectrum including those with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2. More broadly, SGLT2 inhibitor‐associated weight loss has been examined, with meta‐analyses showing modest, dose‐dependent weight reduction of 1.5–2 kg versus placebo in randomized controlled trials of ≥ 2 years. For dapagliflozin, weight reduction of ~4.5 kg from baseline is maintained ≥ 4 years.

Reductions from baseline in HbA1c were consistently greater with ertugliflozin versus placebo across BMI subgroups, although the greatest reductions were observed in the highest BMI subgroup (≥ 35 kg/m 2). The previously conducted pooled analyses of (N = 1377) from the VERTIS Phase 3 programme also demonstrated HbA1c reductions with ertugliflozin versus placebo across BMI subgroups. This suggests that people with T2D will benefit from the glycaemic efficacy of ertugliflozin regardless of BMI. This is consistent with the results of a meta‐analysis of antihyperglycaemic agents including the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin and canagliflozin with people categorized by baseline BMI. The observed HbA1c reduction was apparent in participants with BMI ≥ 25 to < 30 as well as in those with BMI ≥ 30. Regression analysis indicated that the reduction in HbA1c was independent of baseline BMI.

### Efficacy of ertugliflozin on heart failure-related events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: results of the VERTIS CV trial [^5abbb8fa]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The mechanistic plausibility of potential effect modification by ertugliflozin on risk for first HHF in patients with reduced eGFR and those with albuminuria also has supporting evidence from other members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class. Consistent with the results from VERTIS CV, in a meta-analysis of CV outcome studies of SGLT2 inhibitors that included canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, the reduction in HHF was suggested to be greater in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL·min –1 ·1.73 m –2, and in the CREDENCE trial (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) that specifically studied patients with reduced eGFR and albuminuria, there was clear benefit with regard to HHF.

Because the time to first event outcome does not account for recurrent events of HHF or subsequent mortality, the VERTIS CV protocol prespecified analyses of total HHF and the composite total HHF/CV death to better assess effects on net morbidity burden. Although the effect on risk for first event of the composite of HHF/CV death did not achieve statistical significance in the primary VERTIS CV analysis, the present prespecified secondary analysis indicates that ertugliflozin reduced total events of HHF/CV death by 17% and total HHF events by 30%.

Subgroup analyses of the overall study population based on EF regardless of the presence or absence of HF suggested that the HR estimated for EF ≤ 45% was lower with ertugliflozin treatment than that for EF > 45% or unknown EF, although the interaction test was not statistically significant. When the EF categories were split into those with and without a history of HF, the results were consistent with the overall results. Data from DAPA-HF in patients with reduced EF, together with ongoing trials in populations with HF with preserved or reduced EF, will provide additional insights into patient populations that may benefit the most from SGLT2 inhibition with regard to CV-related outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin and sulfonylurea: a sub-study of VERTIS CV [^046cb4b9]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors represent a class of AHAs that decrease renal glucose reabsorption from the proximal tubule of the kidney, thereby enhancing urinary glucose excretion and reducing plasma glucose and HbA1c. Unlike SUs, SGLT2 inhibitors act independently of beta cell function and insulin sensitivity, are not associated with hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy, and are associated with weight loss. SGLT2 inhibitors have also been demonstrated to have cardiovascular (CV) and renal benefits. Because of their cardiorenal benefits, recent society guidances and consensus statements are recommending the use of SGLT2 inhibitors earlier in the treatment algorithms for patients with T2DM with established or at an increased risk of CV disease and in those with chronic kidney disease.

Ertugliflozin is a selective SGLT2 inhibitor that has been evaluated as both monotherapy and in combination with other AHAs in the phase 3 VERTIS (eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and Safety) clinical program. Data from the VERTIS suite of studies have shown that ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) results in clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, is associated with reductions in body weight and blood pressure, and is generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with other SGLT2 inhibitors. However, the addition of ertugliflozin as third-line therapy on a background of metformin and SU has not been previously studied. The VERTIS CV trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of ertugliflozin on CV and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and established atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). The VERTIS CV trial included sub-studies to assess the efficacy of ertugliflozin in combination with other AHAs on glycemic and metabolic endpoints. The results reported here describe the efficacy and safety in patients who were inadequately controlled with metformin and a SU.

### Cardiorenal outcomes, kidney function, and other safety outcomes with ertugliflozin in older adults with type 2 diabetes (VERTIS CV): secondary analyses from a randomised, double-blind trial [^9e743f73]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2023). High credibility.

Background

VERTIS CV was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre cardiovascular outcomes trial that evaluated the cardiovascular efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The primary objective of VERTIS CV was to show non-inferiority of ertugliflozin to placebo with respect to the primary outcome, major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke). The analyses reported here aimed to assess cardiorenal outcomes, kidney function, and other safety outcomes with ertugliflozin in older adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with younger participants.

Methods

VERTIS CV was done at 567 centres in 34 countries. Participants (aged ≥ 40 years) with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to once-daily ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo in addition to background standard-of-care treatment. Random assignment was done with the use of an interactive voice-response system. The study outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death, cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, prespecified kidney composite outcomes, kidney function, and other assessments of safety. Cardiorenal outcomes, kidney function, and safety outcomes were evaluated by baseline age (≥ 65 years and < 65 years [prespecified] and ≥ 75 years and < 75 years [post hoc]). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01986881.

Findings

Between Dec 13, 2013, and July 31, 2015, and between June 1, 2016, and April 14, 2017, 8246 adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were recruited to the study and randomly assigned. 2752 patients were assigned to ertugliflozin 5 mg, 2747 patients to ertugliflozin 15 mg, and 2747 patients to placebo. 8238 participants received at least one dose of ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo. 4145 (50·3%) of 8238 participants were aged 65 years and older, including 903 (11·0%) participants aged 75 years and older. 5764 (70·0%) of 8238 participants were male and 2474 (30·0%) were female, and 7233 (87·8%) of 8238 participants were White, 497 (6·0%) were Asian, 235 (2·9%) were Black, and 273 (3·3%) were classified as other. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower and the type 2 diabetes duration longer for those aged 65 years and older versus those younger than 65 years, and for those aged 75 years and older versus those younger than 75 years. Cardiovascular outcomes were more common in the older age subgroups than in the younger age subgroups. Similar to the overall VERTIS CV cohort, ertugliflozin did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death alone, or the kidney composite outcome (using doubling of serum creatinine, dialysis or transplantation, or kidney death), and reduced the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and the exploratory kidney composite outcome (using a 40% sustained eGFR decrease, dialysis or transplantation, or kidney death) in the older age subgroups (p interaction > 0·05 for outcomes assessed). A slower decline in eGFR and a smaller increase in the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were observed over time in all age subgroups taking ertugliflozin compared with placebo. Across age subgroups, safety outcomes were consistent with the known profile of ertugliflozin.

Interpretation

The effects of ertugliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes, kidney function, and safety outcomes were generally similar across age subgroups. These results have the potential to help clinical decision making by providing a longer-term evaluation of the cardiorenal safety and overall tolerability of ertugliflozin in a large population of older adults.

### Defining the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in primary care: time to think differently [^28fb67f9]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOMES, CANVAS and DECLARE TIMI 58 conducted in 34,322 people with T2DM (60.2% with established atherosclerotic CVD), demonstrated that SGLT2is reduced the risk for CV death or HHF by 23% (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71–0.84). Reduction in HHF was observed in all CVOTs analysed in the study, regardless of atherosclerotic CVD or history of HF. The VERTIS CV trial, which investigated the impact of ertugliflozin on CV outcomes, did not show a significant difference vs. placebo in the composite of death from CV causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke; however, results demonstrated a decreased risk of death from CV causes or HHF in people receiving ertugliflozin. SGLT2is were also shown to reduce MACE incidence in older patients with T2DM. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis which evaluated both GLP1-RAs and SGLT2is showed that SGLT2is reduce MACE outcomes in older adults (over 65 years of age) by 16% (OR 0.831, 95% CI 0.699–0.989). The study included the main SGLT2i CVOTs (EMPA-REG OUTCOMES, CANVAS, DECLARE TIMI 58 and CREDENCE).

Furthermore, although designed to primarily assess CV outcomes, many CVOTs have shown that SGLT2is exert renal protective effects. The EMPA-REG OUTCOMES, CANVAS, VERTIS CV, and DECLARE TIMI 58 trials assessed CV and renal outcomes in people with diabetes receiving empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin and dapagliflozin, respectively, in addition to standard of care. Results from these trials showed significant benefits over placebo in terms of composite renal outcome of doubling serum creatinine/sustained decrease of 40% or more in eGFR, ESKD or death from renal or CV cause (HRs between 0.54 and 0.76). A recent meta-analysis of CVOTs indicated that SGLT2is reduced the risk of progression of renal disease by 45% (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.48–0.64), with a similar benefit in people with and without atherosclerotic CVD. Overall, both the renal and CV endpoint data (Table 1) strongly indicate that SGLT2is are an effective tool to manage T2DM across the cardiorenal continuum.

### Heart failure outcomes captured by adverse event reporting in participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: observations from the VERTIS CV trial [^ee47e38b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

In VERTIS CV, ertugliflozin was associated with a 30% risk reduction for adjudication-confirmed, first and total hospitalizations for heart failure (HHF) in participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the impact of ertugliflozin on the broader spectrum of all reported heart failure (HF) events independent of adjudication confirmation.

Methods and Results

Data from participants who received ertugliflozin (5 or 15mg) were pooled and compared versus placebo. HF events included all investigator-reported HF adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) based on the narrow standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query 'cardiac failure'. Terms for orthopnoea, dyspnoea, and peripheral oedema were evaluated separately. The effect of ertugliflozin on the first HF event was assessed by Cox proportional hazard models. Total HF events were assessed by Andersen-Gill models to account for first and recurrent events. A total of 8238 participants received ≥ 1 dose of ertugliflozin or placebo (mean follow-up 3.5years). Investigator-reported HF events and AE capture yielded 420 first and 627 total HF events (vs. 238 and 345 adjudication-confirmed HHF events, respectively, in the primary analyses). Ertugliflozin reduced the risk for first (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.84; p < 0.001) and total HF AEs (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57–0.78; p < 0.001), with similar results for first and total HF SAEs. Additionally, ertugliflozin reduced oedema risk, but not orthopnoea/dyspnoea.

Conclusion

The effect of ertugliflozin was consistent across the spectrum of total investigator-reported HF AEs and was similar in magnitude to adjudicated HHF events.

### Effects of ertugliflozin on uric acid and gout-related outcomes in persons with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: post hoc analyses from VERTIS CV [^04dd6576]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To conduct post hoc analyses of the VERTIS CV (NCT01986881) trial to explore the effects of ertugliflozin on serum uric acid (UA) and gout-related outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomised (1:1:1) to placebo, ertugliflozin 5mg or ertugliflozin 15mg. Mean UA over time (260weeks) was evaluated for pooled ertugliflozin versus placebo overall, and by baseline quintile of UA (≤ 4.3mg/dL [≤ 255.8 µmol/L], > 4.3–5.1mg/dL [> 255.8–303.4 µmol/L], > 5.1–5.8mg/dL [> 303.4–345.0 µmol/L], > 5.8–6.9mg/dL [> 345.0–410.4 µmol/L] and > 6.9mg/dL [> 410.4 µmol/L]), glycated haemoglobin level, albuminuria status, estimated glomerular filtration rate and KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) risk category. The effect of ertugliflozin on a composite of gout onset or initiation of anti-gout medication was assessed.

Results

The mean UA levels at baseline were 5.67 and 5.62mg/dL in the placebo and ertugliflozin groups, respectively. Ertugliflozin reduced UA over Weeks 6–260 compared with placebo, with least squares mean (LSM) changes (95% confidence interval [CI]) from baseline at Week 260 of 0.07mg/dL (-0.02, 0.15) and -0.19mg/dL (-0.25, -0.13) in the placebo and pooled ertugliflozin groups, respectively. At Week 260, placebo-adjusted LSM change (95% CI) from baseline in UA was -0.26mg/dL (-0.36, -0.16) with ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin was associated with reductions in UA across baseline UA quintiles compared with placebo. The incidence of the composite of gout-related outcomes was 84/2539 (3.3%) for placebo and 133/5091 (2.6%) for ertugliflozin (hazard ratio for the composite 0.76 [95% CI 0.580, 1.002]).

Conclusions

Ertugliflozin was generally associated with lowering UA overall and across subgroups compared with placebo, and numerically reduced rates of gout-related outcome events.

### Cardiovascular effects of new oral glucose-lowering agents: DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors [^31b20966]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin in DECLARE TIMI-58

A prespecified meta-analysis of CV events from 21 phase 2b/3 RCTs with dapagliflozin suggested the potential for a beneficial CV effect in any of the populations investigated. The ongoing DECLARE trial (Dapagliflozin Effect on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events-TIMI Group 58; URL: Unique identifier: NCT01730534) that is comparing dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily with placebo recruited a large proportion of T2DM patients in primary CV prevention (10 228 out of 17 276 individuals). The results will allow to decide whether the CV protection by SGLT-2 inhibitors could be extended to all patients at risk of CVD (both in primary and secondary prevention) and whether the awaited findings with dapagliflozin support a class effect without significant heterogeneity.

Ertugliflozin in VERTIS-CVOT

Ertugliflozin is a new SGLT-2 inhibitor that has been extensively investigated in the large VERTIS (Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Ertugliflozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Participants With Vascular Disease, the VERTIS-CV study) clinical program and is currently in a final phase of clinical development.VERTIS-CVOT (URL: Unique identifier: NCT0198688) is a placebo-controlled RCT to assess CV outcomes following treatment with ertugliflozin (5 or 15 mg once daily) in patients with T2DM and established vascular disease, a population almost similar to that enrolled in EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

Dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes — DECLARE-TIMI 58 and VERTIS-CV report neutral effects on atherosclerotic major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) but benefits for heart failure (HF): in DECLARE-TIMI 58, dapagliflozin showed nonsignificant reductions in MACE (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.03) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.04), while significantly lowering the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or HF hospitalization (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.95); the 10-mg dose is approved to reduce HF risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at established or high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In VERTIS-CV, ertugliflozin had a similar primary endpoint risk to placebo (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.85–1.11) and reduced the rate of hospitalization for heart failure.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin and sulfonylurea: a sub-study of VERTIS CV [^f8a9166b]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

VERTIS CV is the cardiovascular outcome trial for the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor ertugliflozin. A sub-study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately glycemic-controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea (SU).

Methods

Patients with T2DM, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and an HbA1c of 7.0–10.5% on stable metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day) and moderate to high SU doses were randomly assigned to once-daily ertugliflozin (5 or 15 mg) or placebo. The primary sub-study objectives were to assess the effect of ertugliflozin on HbA1c compared with placebo and to evaluate safety following 18 weeks of treatment. Key secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7%.

Results

Of the 8246 patients enrolled in VERTIS CV, 330 were eligible for this sub-study (ertugliflozin 5 mg, n = 100; ertugliflozin 15 mg, n = 113; placebo, n = 117). This subgroup had a mean (SD) age of 63.2 (8.4) years and T2DM duration of 11.4 (7.4) years. At week 18, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg were each associated with significantly greater least squares (LS) mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c relative to placebo (placebo-adjusted LS mean [95% CI] -0.66% [-0.89, -0.43] and -0.75% [-0.98, -0.53], respectively, p < 0.001 for each dose vs placebo). Ertugliflozin significantly reduced FPG and BW compared with placebo (p < 0.001), but not systolic BP. Adverse events were reported in 48.0%, 54.9%, and 47.0% of patients in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, and placebo groups. The incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 11.0% (5 mg), 12.4% (15 mg), and 7.7% (placebo), and of severe hypoglycemia 2.0% (5 mg), 1.8% (15 mg), and 0.9% (placebo).

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM and ASCVD, ertugliflozin added to metformin and SU improved glycemic control, reduced BW, and was generally well tolerated.

3.2.2 Changes in

The changes in HbA1c over time between ertugliflozin and placebo are presented in Figure S5. There were 4664 participants with HbA1c data through 3 years (329, < 25 kg/m 2; 1496, 25– < 30 kg/m 2; 1723, 30– < 35 kg/m 2; 1116, ≥ 35 kg/m 2) and 1530 with data through 5 years (113, < 25 kg/m 2; 496, 25– < 30 kg/m 2; 568, 30– < 35 kg/m 2; 353, ≥ 35 kg/m 2). The highest BMI subgroup had the greatest LS mean difference at all time points, including Year 3 (−0.39% [−0.52, −0.26]) and Year 5 (−0.36% [−0.60, −0.12]). Ertugliflozin versus placebo was consistently associated with a reduction in HbA1c across BMI subgroups.

### Ertugliflozin and hospitalization for heart failure across the spectrum of pre-trial ejection fraction: post-hoc analyses of the VERTIS CV trial [^69f2eb47]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors consistently reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) among those with heart failure (HF) with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF). However, less is known regarding the treatment efficacy at or above the normal EF range (> 60%). VERTIS CV (NCT01986881) was the cardiovascular (CV) outcome trial for ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerotic CV disease. In VERTIS CV, ertugliflozin met the non-inferiority criterion for the primary endpoint of major adverse CV events. Superiority for the secondary endpoints, including CV death or HHF, CV death (alone), and a kidney composite (doubling of serum creatine, dialysis/transplantation, renal death), were not met; however, pre-specified secondary analyses demonstrated a significant 30% risk reduction in first and total HHF. In the VERTIS CV trial, ∼24% of participants had a history of HF. In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated the effects of ertugliflozin on the risk of first and total HHF across the spectrum of pre-trial EF.

The VERTIS CV trial included participants (n = 8246) aged ≥ 40 years randomized (1:1:1) to receive once-daily ertugliflozin (5 mg, 15 mg), or placebo with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. The two ertugliflozin dose groups were combined for all analyses vs. placebo. Data on pre-trial EF were obtained from medical records with the EF closest to the randomization date recorded. Treatment effects of ertugliflozin vs. placebo on the risk of first and total HHF were analysed using adjusted Cox models for first HHF and Andersen–Gill models for total (i.e. first + recurrent) HHF events. Multiplicative interaction terms (P interaction-trend EF category × treatment) were used to determine if pre-trial EF modified the efficacy of ertugliflozin. Owing to the exploratory nature of these post hoc analyses, the P -values reported should be considered nominal.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: are they all the same? A narrative review of cardiovascular outcome trials [^6f8329cc]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinically important improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and adverse cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes have been observed in numerous cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) investigating the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors over the last 5 years. However, differences in study outcomes between the various SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs are often challenging to interpret because of differences in the study design, participant characteristics and primary outcomes of the various trials. In clinical practice, this frequently challenges the clinician when choosing between the different SGLT2 inhibitors for a patient with type 2 diabetes and various cardiovascular or renal comorbidities. Discussion around the choice of SGLT2 inhibitor has been again revived by the recent publication of results from the VERTIS-CV, EMPEROR-reduced and DAPA-CKD trials investigating cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes associated with various SGLT2 inhibitors. This narrative review gives an overview of the mechanism of action and differences in the underlying pharmacology of the various SGLT2 inhibitors and discusses the key cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes from completed CVOTs for SGLT2 inhibitors. Discussion highlights important differences in the study design and participant characteristics which limit the comparison of trials and medications within this drug class.

### Long-term weight loss and cardiorenal outcomes by baseline BMI in the VERTIS CV trial [^1e483324]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess weight loss and cardiorenal outcomes by baseline body mass index (BMI) in VERTIS CV.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease were randomized to ertugliflozin or placebo. These post hoc analyses evaluated cardiometabolic and cardiorenal outcomes (a composite of death from CV causes or hospitalization for heart failure [HHF], CV death, HHF and an exploratory composite kidney outcome including ≥ 40% estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] decrease) by baseline BMI, using conventional clinical categories and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

In total, 8246 adults were randomized (mean age 64.4years, diabetes duration 13.0years, BMI 32.0kg/m 2, 61% with BMI > 30kg/m 2). Absolute body weight reduction was greater with ertugliflozin versus placebo at 3 and 5years in the overall population (p < 0.001) and across BMI subgroups. Ertugliflozin increased the proportion of participants achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% body weight reduction (ertugliflozin 34.9% and 13.6%, placebo 19.4% and 4.1%; odds ratio [95% confident interval, CI], 2.21 [1.76–2.77] and 3.65 [2.39–5.57], respectively) at 5years. No significant difference was observed in the effect of ertugliflozin on HHF across BMI subgroups (P interaction = 0.61). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the effect of ertugliflozin on the kidney composite outcome across BMI subgroups (P interaction = 0.39). Results were similar for other CV outcomes, and safety was consistent with the known ertugliflozin profile.

Conclusion

Weight loss was observed across baseline BMI and was sustained over 5years of follow-up. The effects of ertugliflozin on HHF and kidney composite were consistent across baseline BMI.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by sulfonylurea monotherapy: a substudy of VERTIS CV [^5569db51]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

VERTIS (eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and Safety) CV, the CV outcome study (CVOT) for ertugliflozin, evaluated CV and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and established ASCVD. In VERTIS CV, approximately 40% of patients were taking a SU at baseline either as part of a combination therapy or as monotherapy, with similar proportions of patients on background SU therapy in CVOTs with other SGLT2 inhibitors (EMPA-REG, CANVAS program, and DECLARE-TIMI 58). This highlights the prevalent use of SUs for the treatment of patients with T2DM and ASCVD or those at high risk for ASCVD. Although a small proportion of the patients in VERTIS CV were on background SU monotherapy, the inclusion of these patients in the study provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the addition of ertugliflozin to SU therapy in the absence of other background AHAs such as metformin.

This report evaluates the glycemic and cardiometabolic efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with SU monotherapy. Patients in VERTIS CV were enrolled in two cohorts due to a protocol amendment that doubled the size of the trial to test additional CV and renal endpoints. The results reported here are from an 18-week substudy of patients on background SU monotherapy who were enrolled in Cohort 1 of VERTIS CV, and a post-hoc analysis combining data from patients on background SU monotherapy who were enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2. The assessment of cardiac endpoints and renal parameters in this subset of patients in VERTIS CV, which requires a longer duration of follow-up, was not an objective of the substudy.

### Glycemic efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease: an analysis from the VERTIS CV randomized trial [^55cecfa3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Although HbA1c efficacy was attenuated in this patient population, reductions in body weight and SBP with ertugliflozin in patients with CKD stage 3 were similar to those observed in patients with preserved kidney function in a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled VERTIS phase 3 studies. The similar body weight and SBP reductions in patients with varying degrees of kidney function suggest that the effects of ertugliflozin on body weight and SBP are independent from glucosuria.

In the present analyses of VERTIS CV patients with CKD stage 3, the safety of ertugliflozin was consistent with that observed in the overall population followed over the duration of the VERTIS CV study and consistent with the known safety profile of ertugliflozin from the VERTIS phase 3 development program. Incidences of summary AE measures, kidney-related AEs, and adjudicated kidney events were similar in the ertugliflozin and placebo groups within the CKD stage 3, stage 3A, and stage 3B subgroups of patients. Symptomatic hypoglycemia was also similar across treatment groups within each of the CKD categories. The incidence of GMIs was higher in both men and women in the ertugliflozin groups within each CKD category compared with placebo.

### Association of SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^c3cf8c95]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is commonly complicated by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. The proven efficacy of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class of medications has led to professional cardiology and endocrinology society consensus recommendations and guidelines, endorsing their use and supported by regulatory product labeling.

The objective of the present study is to update previous meta-analyses, adding data from the sixth completed placebo-controlled cardiovascular (CV) and kidney clinical outcomes trial of an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with T2D, the Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Ertugliflozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Participants With Vascular Disease (VERTIS CV) trial. The VERTIS CV trial assessed the effects of ertugliflozin vs placebo in patients with T2D and prevalent ASCVD. Our study results represent the totality of CV outcomes trial data for the 4 SGLT2 inhibitors available in the United States and many other countries. These trials were conducted in accordance with regulatory guidance requiring CV outcomes assessment of drugs for T2D; furthermore, our study refined estimates of drug outcomes in patients with T2D and explored the heterogeneity of outcomes assessed by individual drugs in the overall class and within selected subgroups.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by sulfonylurea monotherapy: a substudy of VERTIS CV [^670c226d]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sulfonylureas (SU) are commonly used antihyperglycemic agents. VERTIS CV was the cardiovascular outcome study for the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ertugliflozin. Enrollment of patients in VERTIS CV occurred in two sequential cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2).

Methods

This substudy assessed the efficacy and safety of adding ertugliflozin to SU monotherapy. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline at 18 weeks.

Results

Among the 8246 patients who were randomized in VERTIS CV, 157 patients in Cohort 1 and 135 patients in Cohort 2 were on SU monotherapy at baseline. In the prespecified analysis (Cohort 1 only), the least squares (LS) mean HbA1c change from baseline for placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg was - 0.56%, - 0.91%, and - 0.78%, respectively (placebo-adjusted LS mean [95% CI] change:- 0.35% [- 0.72%, 0.02%];- 0.22% [- 0.60%, 0.16%] for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg, respectively; p > 0.05 for both). In a post-hoc analysis that included Cohorts 1 and 2 (N = 292), the LS mean HbA1c change from baseline at week 18 for placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg was - 0.31%, - 0.77%, and - 0.68%, respectively (placebo-adjusted change: - 0.46% [- 0.73%, - 0.18%]; - 0.37% [- 0.66%, - 0.09%]; p = 0.001 and 0.01 for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg, respectively). In Cohort 1, adverse events were reported in 45.8%, 47.3%, and 25.9% of patients with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg. The incidence rates of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 0.0%, 5.5%, and 3.7%, respectively, with no cases of severe hypoglycemia. The safety profile was similar for Cohorts 1 and 2 combined.

Conclusion

The addition of ertugliflozin to SU monotherapy reduced HbA1c but did not result in significant placebo-adjusted reductions from baseline according to the prespecified primary analysis (n = 157); however, in a post-hoc analysis with a larger patient population (n = 292), significant and clinically relevant HbA1c reductions were observed. Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated.

### Sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors for prevention and treatment of cardiorenal complications of type 2 diabetes [^25f99fb3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Scenario of cardiorenal effects SGLT-2i in patients with T2D participating in CVOTs. MACE, major adverse cardiovascular events; DKD, diabetic kidney disease.: modest benefit (the hazard ratio -HR- for a given endpoint during treatment with a gliflozin is > 0.85 and < 1.0, as compared with placebo).: moderate benefit (HR ≤ 0.85 and > 0.75).: large benefit (HR ≤ 0.75)

For MACE, there seems to be no class effect, as both DECLARE and VERTIS-CV failed to reduce it significantly: on the other hand, a class effect is evident for hospitalization for HF, which at present remains the more striking therapeutic effect of SGLT-2i. Unfortunately, both VERTIS-CV and SCORED trials were unable to show any significant effect on DKD progression, a renal composite outcome of death from renal causes, kidney replacement therapy, or doubling of the serum creatinine level. Although comparison between trials should always be done with caution, the five trials are generally consistent with each other, showing reliable cardiorenal benefits (with the exception of VERTIS-CV and SCORED for DKD progression) and comparable expected adverse effects.

Introduction

Here we report the glycemic efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients in the VERTIS CV cardiovascular outcome trial with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3.

Research design and methods

Prespecified and post-hoc analyses were performed in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30– < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at screening. The primary endpoint was glycemic efficacy at week 18. Longer term glycemic efficacy and changes in body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and eGFR were also evaluated.

Results

Among 8246 patients in VERTIS CV, 1776 patients had CKD stage 3; 1319 patients had CKD stage 3A (eGFR 45– < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2); 457 patients had CKD stage 3B (eGFR 30– < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Week 18 least squares (LS)-mean (95% CI) placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin were −0.27% (−0.37% to –0.17%) and −0.28% (−0.38% to –0.17%), respectively, for CKD stage 3 overall and −0.27% (−0.38% to –0.15%) and −0.31% (−0.43% to –0.19%), respectively, for CKD stage 3A (all p < 0.001). For CKD stage 3B, the reduction in HbA1c for 5 mg ertugliflozin was −0.28% (−0.47% to –0.08%) (p = 0.006) and for 15 mg ertugliflozin was −0.19% (−0.39% to 0.01%) (p = 0.064). LS-mean placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight (range: −1.32 to −1.95 kg) and SBP (range: −2.42 to −3.41 mm Hg) were observed across CKD stage 3 categories with ertugliflozin. After an initial dip, eGFR remained above or near baseline with ertugliflozin treatment. The incidence of overall adverse events (AEs), symptomatic hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, and kidney-related AEs did not differ between ertugliflozin and placebo across CKD stage 3 subgroups.

Conclusions

In VERTIS CV patients with CKD stage 3A, ertugliflozin resulted in reductions in HbA1c, body weight and SBP, maintenance of eGFR, and was generally well tolerated. Results in the CKD stage 3B subgroup were generally similar except for an attenuated HbA1c response with the 15 mg dose.

### Are SGLT-2 inhibitors the future of heart failure treatment? The EMPEROR-preserved and EMPEROR-reduced trials [^55e746a0]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial investigated the use of dapagliflozin and demonstrated a non-significant reduction in the rate of 3-point MACE (HR 0.93) and a significantly lower rate of HHF (HR 0.73) in people with T2D and previous or a high-risk of cardiovascular disease. Subsequently, the DAPA-HF study explored the use of dapagliflozin in people with or without underlying T2D and a diagnosis of HFrEF. The study investigators observed a significant relative risk reduction versus placebo for cardiovascular death (9.6 vs. 11.5%) and worsening heart failure (10.0 vs. 13.7%) over 18 months in participants using dapagliflozin, with similar results in people with or without underlying diabetes. The outcomes of the DAPA-HF study resulted in the US Food and Drug Aministration (FDA) recently approving dapagliflozin for use in people with HFrEF.

Most recently, the VERTIS-CV study investigating ertugliflozin use did not demonstrate superiority for 3-point MACE for cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or stroke, although there was a significant reduction in the HHF rate compared with placebo (2.5 vs. 3.6%). In the absence of the forthcoming full publication and analysis of heart failure subtypes, one putative explanation for these different findings is variations in study populations between CVOTs. Indeed, 10% of the study population in the EMPA-REG trial had underlying heart failure compared with 23.1% of participants in the VERTIS-CV study. Additionally, more than 80% of the participants in the VERTIS-CV study had HFpEF and just 19.4% had HFrEF, although the proportion of participants with HFpEF in the EMPA-REG study was not reported. Whilst the analysis is currently unpublished, it may be that the high proportion of participants with heart failure and HFpEF in the VERTIS-CV study may have affected the cardiovascular outcome results. Full publication of these results is awaited with great interest.

### Glycemic efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease: an analysis from the VERTIS CV randomized trial [^c264eb1d]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The observed reductions from baseline at week 18 in FPG roughly paralleled those observed for HbA1c. The reduction in HbA1c in the CKD stage 3B group, despite the lack of a significant decrease in FPG levels, likely resulted from suppression of postprandial plasma glucose, a stronger contributor to HbA1c than FPG. Although the longer term assessment of HbA1c efficacy for CKD stage 3 overall is confounded by changes in background medication that were encouraged to meet individualized glycemic goals after 18 weeks, the data indicate that ertugliflozin treatment, compared with placebo, was associated with consistently better glycemic control over 4 years. In the VERTIS CV trial protocol, participating clinics were encouraged to optimize glycemic control after 18 weeks, using agents from all antihyperglycemic classes except SGLT2 inhibitors. Thus, the continued separation of the HbA1c curves between the placebo group and the ertugliflozin groups most likely reflects practice patterns by the study investigators. However, the durable efficacy observed in the ertugliflozin-treated groups could also be due to the weight loss (which improves glycemic control) and/or preservation of kidney function (which supports the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors) that was observed in these patients.

Although glycemic parameters following ertugliflozin treatment in the CKD stage 3 and stage 3A categories were statistically significantly different from placebo, as anticipated by the SGLT2 inhibitor mechanism of action within the kidney, the reductions in HbA1c in the CKD stage 3 categories were attenuated compared with the HbA1c reductions with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg observed in a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled VERTIS phase 3 glycemic efficacy studies that did not include VERTIS CV. In those studies, in which exclusion criteria required randomized patients to have an eGFR ≥ 55 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (average eGFR was ~89 mL/min/1.73 m 2), the changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 were −0.8% and −0.9% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively.

Inconsistencies and Similarities in Cardiovascular Outcomes: 3-P MACE, Mortality and HHF

Whilst these trials each explore similar cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitors with a similar trial design, there appears to be inconsistent cardiovascular benefit associated with these drugs. All SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs so far have demonstrated safety (non-inferiority) for 3-point MACE versus placebo. However, cardiovascular superiority for 3-point MACE has been demonstrated for empagliflozin (EMPA-REG) and canagliflozin (CANVAS and CREDENCE), but not for dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI) or ertugliflozin (VERTIS-CV). Further confusion arises when we compare cardiovascular outcomes from the heart failure outcome trials published to date; DAPA-HF (dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-reduced (empagliflozin). These trials only included participants with HFrEF. In contrast with the previous CVOTs for each of these drugs, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death versus placebo in DAPA-HF, whilst empagliflozin did not reduce cardiovascular death in EMPEROR-reduced.

With respect to hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) outcomes, all trials consistently showed superior outcomes versus placebo. Interestingly, the superior primary cardiovascular outcome of CV death or HHF was observed in participants with or without underlying T2D in the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-reduced trials. Indeed, superiority for the combined outcome of cardiovascular death or HHF in the DECLARE-TIMI trial was driven by the significant reduction in HHF. Similarly, in renal outcome trials SGLT2 inhibitors appear to reduce HHF as shown in CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD. In DAPA-CKD the composite risk of HHF or cardiovascular death was 29% lower than placebo (HR 0.71, CI 0.55–0.92), and we await the full publication of results. Across all the completed CVOTs there was no statistical difference compared with placebo for non-fatal MI or stroke. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in the EMPA-REG and DAPA-HF trials, though this was largely driven by the reduction in cardiovascular mortality already discussed.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes: In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin reduced the composite of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 14% (absolute rate 10.5% vs 12.1%; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74–0.99]; P = 0.04 for superiority) and reduced cardiovascular death by 38% (absolute rate 3.7% vs 5.9%; HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49–0.77]; P < 0.001). In CANVAS, canagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (26.9 vs 31.5 participants per 1,000 person-years; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75–0.97]) but was associated with increased lower limb amputation (6.3 vs 3.4 participants per 1,000 person-years; HR 1.97 [95% CI 1.41–2.75]); other trials did not show a significant increase in lower-limb amputations, fractures, AKI, or hyperkalemia relative to placebo. In DECLARE–TIMI 58, dapagliflozin met criteria for noninferiority for MACE and lowered hospitalization for heart failure (4.9% vs 5.8%; HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73–0.95; P = 0.005]; HR for hospitalization for heart failure 0.73 [95% CI 0.61–0.88]) without a difference in cardiovascular death. In VERTIS CV, ertugliflozin met prespecified noninferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events (11.9% vs 11.9%; HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85–1.11]; P < 0.001) but was not superior to placebo for key secondary outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by sulfonylurea monotherapy: a substudy of VERTIS CV [^7199dff6]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The numerically greater reduction in HbA1c observed with ertugliflozin 5 mg compared with ertugliflozin 15 mg observed in this substudy is likely explained by the relatively small number of patients who were studied and the influence of chance. Dose–response modeling of efficacy endpoints observed in ertugliflozin clinical studies, including the changes from baseline in HbA1c, FPG, BW, and the mechanistic biomarker 24-h UGE, indicates that the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg doses are associated with > 80% and > 90%, respectively, of the maximum response that is attainable with ertugliflozin. Although the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg doses are on a relatively flat portion of the dose–response curve, in six randomized placebo- and active-controlled clinical studies in the VERTIS phase 3 development program, ertugliflozin 15 mg consistently showed a numerically greater reduction in HbA1c from baseline than the 5 mg ertugliflozin dose. Additionally, a pooled analysis of three placebo-controlled VERTIS phase 3 ertugliflozin studies demonstrated an incremental HbA1c lowering of 0.15% with the ertugliflozin 15 mg dose relative to ertugliflozin 5 mg.

One of the major concerns with using SU as an AHA is its association with hypoglycemia. Insulin secretagogues such as SUs stimulate the release of insulin independent of the glucose level, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia increases the risk of CV events and mortality in patients with T2DM. Although this substudy was not designed to compare the incidence of hypoglycemia events associated with ertugliflozin with those of other AHAs, low rates of hypoglycemia were observed in this substudy when ertugliflozin was added to SU monotherapy in patients with T2DM. Although this substudy required a stable SU dose for at least 8 weeks prior to screening along with continuation of the same SU dose for the 18-week study duration, the addition of a SGLT2 inhibitor to SU therapy has the potential to enable the SU dose to be lowered, which could minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bc7269b3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, all eligible patients had established cardiovascular disease, and empagliflozin reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 32%, cardiovascular mortality by 38%, and HHF by 35% compared with the placebo. At the same time, the study confirmed that the dose of empagliflozin did not affect the hazard ratios of cardiovascular outcomes. In the CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials, treatment resulted in reductions of 49% for all-cause mortality, 47% for cardiovascular mortality, 30% for HHF, and 22% for major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients in the canagliflozin group had a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, HHF, and renal failure than those in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years in the CREDENCE trial. In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, dapagliflozin appeared to robustly reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality or HHF and MACEs in patients with T2DM and previous myocardial infarction. In the VERTIS-CV trial involving patients with T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ertugliflozin was shown to be noninferior to the placebo with MACEs. However, the incidence of cardiovascular mortality or HHF did not differ significantly between the two groups. Owing to the diverse properties of different drugs, we cannot exclude the possibility that differences among the agents in this class may result in real differences in clinical outcomes. It is also possible that the effects of individuals are similar because the confidence interval of VERTIS CV overlaps with that of previous trials. The main mechanisms of the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2i include reduced plasma volume and diuresis, reduced ventricular remodelling, myocardial metabolism, and adipokine dynamics. However, further basic research is required to elucidate the specific pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2i.

### Glycemic efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease: an analysis from the VERTIS CV randomized trial [^721a558d]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The inclusion criteria for the VERTIS CV study allowed the entry of patients with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, which resulted in the randomization of 21.5% (1776 of 8246) of patients with CKD stage 3 in the trial. Among those with CKD stage 3, ~74% had CKD stage 3A and ~26% had CKD stage 3B. The inclusion of these patients in the VERTIS CV trial allowed a comprehensive assessment of ertugliflozin glycemic efficacy and safety in patients with T2DM, ASCVD, and CKD stage 3.

The use of data from the initial 18 weeks of VERTIS CV was designed to allow a comparison with placebo as doses of background antihyperglycemic medications were held stable during this period; after week 18, investigators were encouraged to optimize glycemic therapy to achieve individualized treatment goals. The present analyses demonstrated that both doses of ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) resulted in statistically significant placebo-adjusted reductions in HbA1c from baseline at week 18 in the overall CKD stage 3 subgroup and in the CKD stage 3A subgroup. In the CKD stage 3B subgroup, the ertugliflozin 15 mg dose did not achieve statistical significance, compared with placebo, and may be due to the relatively small patient numbers in this subgroup. Another contributing factor to the apparent absence of dose–response in the CKD stage 3B subgroup could be the greater degree of diminished kidney function in this subgroup in the context of the dose–response curve of ertugliflozin (model-predicted HbA1c and 24-hour urinary glucose excretion responses for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg doses are > 80% and > 90%, respectively, of the maximum model-predicted response).

### Renoprotection with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes over a spectrum of cardiovascular and renal risk [^abea8953]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Unlike EMPA-REG OUTCOME and the CANVAS program, the recent VERTIS CV study investigating ertugliflozin in 8246 people with T2D and established CVD did not show a statistically significant reduction in the secondary composite renal outcome (death from renal causes, RRT, or doubling of serum creatinine levels) in the ertugliflozin group compared with placebo (HR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.63, 1.04). Mean baseline eGFR of the VERTIS CV population was similar to those of EMPA-REG OUTCOME and the CANVAS program (Table 1); however, owing to differences in outcome definition, renal efficacy outcomes should be compared with caution between trials, and further post-hoc analyses of the VERTIS CV data would be useful to provide a more direct comparison.

DECLARE-TIMI 58

DECLARE-TIMI 58 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with dapagliflozin, involving people with T2D and either atherosclerotic CVD (n = 6971) or multiple CV risk factors (n = 10,189). Patients had relatively good renal function, with a mean eGFR at baseline of 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a median UACR of 13 mg/g (Table 1). Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin was associated with significant decreases in both the renal composite endpoint (sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, new ESKD, or renal or CV death, HR: 0.76; 95% CI 0.67, 0.87) and the additional composite that excluded CV death (HR: 0.53; 95% CI 0.43, 0.66). Dapagliflozin also decreased the likelihood of new-onset macroalbuminuria (HR: 0.54; 95% CI 0.45, 0.65), new-onset albuminuria (HR: 0.79; 95% CI 0.72, 0.87), and albuminuria category deterioration (HR: 0.73; 95% CI 0.67, 0.79).

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease using insulin: a VERTIS CV substudy [^8a91bb2d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) inadequately controlled by insulin.

Materials and Methods

VERTIS CV was the cardiovascular outcome study for ertugliflozin. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo, or ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg once daily. We report the results of a substudy in patients on a stable dose of insulin ≥ 20units/d. The primary endpoint was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to 18weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight (BW), the proportion of patients with HbA1c < 53mmol/mol (< 7%), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure and insulin dose.

Results

Of 8246 patients randomized in VERTIS CV, 1065 were included in the substudy (68.2% men, mean [SD] age 64.8 [7.8] years, T2DM duration 16.7 [9.0] years, HbA1c 8.4 [1.0]%). At week 18, the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in HbA1c was significantly greater with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg versus placebo (placebo-adjusted LS mean change -0.58%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.71, -0.44 and -0.65%, 95% CI -0.78, -0.51, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Ertugliflozin significantly reduced FPG, BW and SBP. In women, the incidence of genital mycotic infections was higher with ertugliflozin (3.5%) versus placebo (0.0%). The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.

Conclusions

Ertugliflozin added to insulin improved glycaemic control, BW and SBP versus placebo at 18weeks in patients with T2DM and ASCVD.

### Safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pooled analysis of seven phase 3 randomized controlled trials [^0b023f4e]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

In clinical studies, the risk of UTI with SGLT2 inhibitors has been inconsistent. A population-based cohort study showed that SGLT2 inhibitor use was not associated with an increase in risk for serious or nonserious UTI. There was no increased risk of UTI (including pyelonephritis and urosepsis) with ertugliflozin treatment in the current pooled analysis.

Ketoacidosis emerged as a safety concern for the SGLT2 inhibitor class during the conduct of the ertugliflozin clinical studies, prompted by the identification of post-marketing cases with other SGLT2 inhibitors; cases often had atypical presentation. Ketoacidosis was identified in three ertugliflozin-treated patients in the current analysis.

An association of amputation with SGLT2 inhibitors is the subject of ongoing research. Canagliflozin was associated with an ~ twofold increased risk of amputation (mostly at the level of the toe or metatarsal) in the CANVAS program but not in the CREDENCE trial. No increased risk of amputation was found for dapagliflozin in a pooled analysis or in the DECLARE trial of patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Amputation was not prospectively evaluated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, but post hoc manual identification found no association between empagliflozin and amputation.

The current ertugliflozin pooled analysis identified a limited number of amputation events with confounding factors. Amputation risk is also being assessed in the ongoing blinded cardiovascular outcomes trial (VERTIS CV) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in approximately 8200 adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease (NCT01986881). Interim unblinded data on amputation events from this trial were included in the FDA medical review for ertugliflozin, with 0.6% (16/2744), 0.9% (26/2746), and 0.7% (19/2747) of patients with one or more amputations in the placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg groups, respectively, during the treatment period; exposure-adjusted incidence rates were 4.3, 6.8, and 5.0 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. Final data from VERTIS CV will provide more robust evidence to inform this potential safety concern. Based on currently available data, an association of amputation with ertugliflozin remains uncertain.

### Efficacy of ertugliflozin on heart failure-related events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: results of the VERTIS CV trial [^b61ee3b8]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Results of EF analyses, although suggestive of potentially greater benefit in patients with reduced EF, has potential limitations because EF was obtained from medical records abstraction instead of by measurement at trial entry, which might not reflect EF at the time of randomization, and data were not available on ≈40% of the trial cohort. The grouping of patients with EF > 45% with those with unknown EF also has potential limitations. In addition, because of the limited number of patients in each subgroup, the analyses are not powered to detect statistically significant differences. Finally, these analyses are not corrected for multiplicity.

Conclusions

Ertugliflozin reduced risk for first HHF, for total HHF, and for total HHF/CV death events in patients with T2DM in the VERTIS CV trial, findings consistent with those reported for other members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class, –, and provide additional supportive evidence for the use of SGLT2 inhibition in patients with T2DM to prevent HF-related outcomes.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular event protections: how applicable are clinical trials and observational studies to real-world patients? [^7842493a]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Eligibility of cardiovascular outcome trials

We used age, sex, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for the identification of comorbidity and laboratory data as the principal determinants in selecting patients from the CGRD who would meet the clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria. The major inclusion/exclusion criteria in the CANVAS program, DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and VERTIS-CV trial were derived primarily from the trial design with clarification sought from supplementary appendices and primary clinical trial result publications where required. Of note, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and VERTIS-CV trial required adult patients with type 2 diabetes to have existing CVD history, such as unstable angina, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and CANVAS program recruited patients with type 2 diabetes at broad CVD risk according to two categories: 1) existing CVD history and 2) CVD risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension and duration of diabetes over 10 years. The major exclusion criteria based on the laboratory data in these cardiovascular outcome trials included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (eg, CANVAS program: 7%–10.5%; DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial: 6.5%–12%; EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial/VERTIS-CV trial: 7%–10%) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (eg, CANVAS program/EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial/VERTIS-CV trial: < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2; DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial: < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) out of range.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular event protections: how applicable are clinical trials and observational studies to real-world patients? [^c8e8e228]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

To discover real-world CVD benefits and risks both in the individual SGLT2i and whole SGLT2i class, we need further studies that consider these confounders (eg, medical specialties, background ADD therapy and renal functions) in the analyses to address the built-in heterogeneity of the SGLT2i class that may provide more valid results to better inform real-world clinical decisions.

The major strength of this study is direct comparison of baseline characteristics among different SGLT2i new users from the largest multi-institutional cohort of outpatients with type 2 diabetes in Taiwan, which allowed us to explore the discrepancies between current evidence and real-world data. The limitation is the potentially missing data on inclusion/exclusion criteria from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, VERTIS-CV trial, DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and CANVAS program in our EMR records. A number of patients may have a condition of interest without documentation in our database, such as current tobacco use with at least five cigarettes/day. Second, we also lack the information on 'initial onset' of comorbidity because we only screened the 1-year baseline period prior to the first use of SGLT2i. However, most major inclusion/exclusion criteria have been included in our study, so this effect may be limited. Third, we did not directly compare patient characteristics associated with ertugliflozin between real-world practice in Taiwan and the VERTIS-CV trial, because ertugliflozin was not available in study hospitals during our study period. We conducted post hoc comparisons of patient characteristics with all SGLT2i new users in Taiwan versus participants in the VERTIS-CV trial, and found suboptimal data representativeness of the VERTIS-CV trial (online supplementary appendix table 3). Fourth, the study only included SGLT2i trials for cardiovascular outcomes. Other trials of SGLT2i such as the Ccanagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation were not evaluated in this study. Fifth, one notable difference between the data source used in this study and the patient populations of the RCT studied is that the RCT enrolled patients from a heterogeneous racial/ethnic background whereas this study was restricted to Taiwanese patients. Finally, we did not include clinical end point in the analysis so no inference can be made on the effect to clinical outcome in the study. Future study to ensure the impact on clinical outcome resulted from different baseline characteristics of patients could be considered.

### Ertugliflozin compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents as monotherapy and add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^8131e4a2]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the current NMA found that ertugliflozin may be more effective in lowering HbA1c than dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients uncontrolled on diet and exercise as well as those on therapy with metformin alone. The analysis did not find differences in the HbA1c reductions associated with ertugliflozin compared to canagliflozin across all populations evaluated. The degree to which the efficacy and safety found in short-term studies translate to effects on long-term complications of T2DM, most notably cardiovascular and renal events, is of considerable interest. Completed studies for empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have shown reductions in cardiovascular outcomes. VERTIS CV, an ongoing outcomes trial, will evaluate the effects of ertugliflozin versus standard of care for cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

### External applicability of SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^d45b6ac6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent treatment guidelines support the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease based on the results of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). Applicability of these trials to everyday patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is however unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the external applicability of SGLT2i CVOTs in daily clinical practice type 2 diabetes patients with established cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Trial in- and exclusion criteria from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58 and VERTIS-CV were applied to 1389 type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease in the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (UCC-SMART). To evaluate the difference in cardiovascular risk (MACE) and all-cause mortality between trial eligible and ineligible patients, age and sex-adjusted Cox-regression analyses were performed.

Results

After applying trial in- and exclusion criteria, 48% of UCC-SMART patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease would have been eligible for DECLARE-TIMI 58, 35% for CANVAS, 29% for EMPA-REG OUTCOME and 21% for VERTIS-CV. Without the eligibility criteria of HbA 1c, eligibility was 58–88%. For all trials the observed risk for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality was similar in eligible and ineligible patients after adjustment for age and gender.

Conclusion

A large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in daily clinical practice would have been eligible for participation in the SGLT2i CVOTs. Trial eligible and ineligible patients have the same risk for MACE and all-cause mortality.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials: a paradigm shift in the current management of type 2 diabetes [^47aa09bc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

A recently reported meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials demonstrated cardiorenal benefits across the SGLT2 inhibitor class versus placebo. CV benefits included a 12% reduction in 3P-MACE (without significant heterogeneity; I² = 21.2%, p = 0.19), based on six cardiorenal studies that reported this outcome, and a 16% reduction in CV death. However, these results should be caveated; there were differences in outcomes, study designs, patient populations, and medications across the cardiorenal studies included in the meta-analysis. The 12% reduction in 3P-MACE was based on data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, CREDENCE, DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin), VERTIS CV (ertugliflozin) and SCORED (sotagliflozin). Notably, sotagliflozin has both SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitory activity and is not a licensed treatment for T2D (but is licensed for type 1 diabetes in Europe), and SCORED was a cardiorenal study (patients had T2D and CKD) that used a different 3P-MACE outcome (CV death, HHF and urgent visits for HF) than the other studies (CV death, nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke). The dapagliflozin CVOT, DECLARE-TIMI 58, did not show a benefit in either 3P-MACE (HR [95% CI] 0.93 [0.84–1.03], p = 0.17) or CV deaths (0.98 [0.82–1.17]). However, DECLARE-TIMI 58 had a very different profile of baseline characteristics to EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, as a majority of patients had high CV risk but not established CVD, and there were fewer patients with CKD. Therefore, the different outcomes in DECLARE-TIMI 58, compared with EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, may be due to differences in study design and cohort composition rather than intrinsic differences between the study drugs. Two HF and renal outcomes studies, designed to assess the effect of dapagliflozin vs placebo in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; DAPA-HF) or CKD (DAPA-CKD) with or without T2D, both reported trends towards reductions in CV death in the T2D subgroups (HR [95% CI] 0.79 [0.63–1.01] and 0.85 [0.59–1.21], respectively). In the VERTIS CV study of ertugliflozin, all patients had established CVD at baseline, but no benefit was observed in 3P-MACE (HR [95% CI] 0.97 [0.85–1.11]) or CV death (HR [95% CI] 0.92 [0.77–1.11]). These findings suggest that significant improvements in CV outcomes, which were observed in CVOTs of empagliflozin and canagliflozin, may not apply to all SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Eligibility of patients with type 2 diabetes for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcomes trials: an assessment using the diabetes collaborative registry [^525e03eb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trials (CVOTs) are the standard approach to assessing CV safety and efficacy of type 2 diabetes (T2D) drugs, as mandated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance from 2008. 1 Three CVOTs showed significant CV benefits of the sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2is) empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in patients with T2D. 2, 3, 4 Real‐world data from CVD‐REAL studies suggest a class effect, 5 and one CVOT of ertugliflozin is ongoing. 6 However, in order to accrue a sufficient number of CV events in a timely manner, CVOTs generally enrol patients at higher CV risk than a patient with T2D seen in routine clinical practice. Therefore, the generalizability of CVOT findings to the broader population of patients with T2D is unknown.

The Diabetes Collaborative Registry (DCR) is the first US cross‐specialty outpatient practice database designed to track and improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes across primary and specialty care settings. 7 Initiated in 2014 as a collaboration between endocrinology, primary care and cardiology professional societies, the registry collects relevant data from electronic health records of patients within participating practices. Particular advantages of the DCR include the collection of patient‐level clinical and laboratory data, as well as the enrolment of patients across the adult age spectrum. As of 31 March 2016, the DCR comprised 1 029 807 patients across 374 sites and 5114 providers. At this time point, general practice (including internal medicine, primary care or family practices), cardiology, endocrinology and obstetrics/gynaecology practices accounted for 50.1%, 74.9%, 2.1% and 9.4% of sites, respectively (sites could comprise multiple types of practice).

Understanding the applicability of CVOT findings to patients with T2D in clinical practice will help physicians make more informed treatment decisions for their patients. In this study, we assessed the proportions of adults with T2D in the DCR who would have met enrolment criteria for CVOTs of the four US‐marketed SGLT‐2is, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin: EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, 2 CANVAS, 3 DECLARE 4 and VERTIS CV 6, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease using insulin: a VERTIS CV substudy [^9ceb62de]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This VERTIS CV substudy demonstrated that, in patients with T2DM and ASCVD receiving insulin ≥ 20 units/d, ertugliflozin provided clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c and FPG at week 18 compared with placebo. Additionally, more patients met the HbA1c target of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and a lower proportion of patients required glycaemic rescue medication with ertugliflozin compared with placebo. Other benefits of ertugliflozin compared with placebo were modest decreases in BW and SBP.

The SGLT2 inhibitors are attractive agents to use in combination with exogenous insulin because the two classes of agents have complementary mechanisms of action on reducing blood glucose. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose in peripheral tissues, especially fat and skeletal muscle, and decreases gluconeogenesis from the liver 20; whereas SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the reabsorption of glucose excreted from the kidney. 21 In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors counterbalance the undesirable effect of weight gain with insulin therapy.

The efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin reported here are similar to studies of other SGLT2 inhibitors added to background insulin. In a substudy of the CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), canagliflozin added to insulin therapy (≥ 20 IU/d) in patients with T2DM with prevalent ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD, improved glycaemic control and decreased BW and SBP at 18 weeks. 22 In that study, a greater incidence of hypoglycaemia was observed in the canagliflozin groups, compared with placebo. In two studies in patients with T2DM where empagliflozin was added‐on to multiple daily injections of insulin (basal or prandial ± metformin) or added‐on to basal insulin (≥ 20 IU/d ± metformin and/or sulphonylureas), empagliflozin improved glycaemic control and reduced BW with a similar incidence of hypoglycaemia to placebo at 18 weeks (episodes of hypoglycaemia were not reported). 23, 24 In a study in patients with T2DM with dapagliflozin added‐on to insulin (≥ 30 IU/d ± metformin ± another oral agent), dapagliflozin improved glycaemic control, stabilized insulin dosing and reduced BW with a higher incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes, compared with placebo, at 24 weeks. 25 A comparison of the reductions in daily insulin dose in this current substudy with dose reductions reported in studies of other SGLT2 inhibitors is confounded by the differences in study design and timepoints at which dose differences were assessed. 22, 23, 24, 26

Differences in baseline characteristics between trial eligible vs ineligible patients

Table 1 shows differences in baseline characteristics between trial eligible and ineligible patients from the UCC-SMART cohort. An overview of the crude baseline characteristics of eligible and ineligible patients for each trial is provided in Additional file 1: Table S3. Patients eligible for DECLARE-TIMI 58 were younger than ineligible patients (61.6 ± 8.7 years vs 64.0 ± 8.6 years). There were more male among ineligible patients compared to eligible patients for EMPA-REG OUTCOME (78% vs 72%) and VERTIS-CV (77% vs 72%). As expected, most differences in baseline characteristics between eligible and ineligible patients reflect the in- and exclusion criteria of the trials. For example, for each CVOT the mean HbA 1c was higher amongst eligible patients compared to ineligible patients [HbA 1c difference: 12.1 mmol/mol (95% CI 11.0, 13.2) or 1.1% (95% CI 1.0, 1.2) for EMPA-REG OUTCOME; 16.2 mmol/mol (95% CI 15.1, 17.3) or 1.5% (95% CI 1.4, 1.6) for CANVAS; 12.1 mmol/mol (95% CI 10.9, 13.3) or 1.1% (95% CI 1.0, 1.2) for DECLARE-TIMI 58; and 11.9 mmol/mol (95% CI 10.6, 13.1) or 1.1% (95% CI 1.0, 1.2) for VERTIS-CV). Further, the eGFR of patients eligible for DECLARE-TIMI 58 was 11.7 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (95% CI 9.7, 13.6) higher than the eGFR of ineligible patients. Finally, patients eligible for DECLARE-TIMI 58 and VERTIS-CV had a lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure than ineligible patients (DECLARE-TIMI 58 systolic − 5.8 mmHg (95% CI − 7.9, − 3.7), diastolic − 2.4 mmHg (95% CI − 3.6, − 1.4); VERTIS-CV systolic − 11.4 mmHg (95% CI − 13.5, − 9.4), diastolic − 5.9 mmHg (95% CI − 7.0, − 4.7)] (Table 1).

### Eligibility of patients with type 2 diabetes for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcomes trials: an assessment using the diabetes collaborative registry [^529c27cf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Our results are similar to findings from a large European observational study where the proportions of patients eligible for EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE and VERTIS CV were 21%, 34%, 59% and 17%, respectively. 10 A recent meta‐analysis of 34 322 patients from EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, the CANVAS programme and DECLARE concluded that the collective modest benefit of SGLT‐2is in the reduction of atherothrombotic CV events was primarily limited to patients with established CVD. 11 However, patients with T2D and a broad CV risk profile enrolled in DECLARE experienced significant reductions in the composite of CV death or heart failure hospitalizations when treated with dapagliflozin compared with placebo. 11 Further supporting these findings from CVOTs, the CVD‐REAL 1 and 2 studies, 5, 12, 13 as well as other real‐world studies, 14, 15 also found a significantly lower risk of CV events associated with initiation of an SGLT‐2i (vs other glucose‐lowering agents). Although large pharmacoepidemiologic studies such as CVD‐REAL have potential limitations (including a possibility of residual confounding), their findings are important and complementary to randomized controlled trials, as they include a population of patients with T2D that is much more representative of that seen in routine clinical practice, with a much broader CV risk profile (13‐25% of patients had prior CVD in CVD‐REAL). 5, 12, 13

### Generalizability of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcome trials to the type 2 diabetes population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7b2d9746]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

In a patient for whom the use of a SGLT2i is indicated, the evidence-based choice of the specific drug can be an issue. The efficacy and safety on cardiovascular outcomes of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin were assessed in CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, and VERTIS-CV, respectively. These large double-blind, multinational, placebo-controlled trials were performed to satisfy regulatory requirements of cardiovascular safety (non-inferiority) and to test efficacy (superiority) under similar glucose levels between treatment and placebo groups. A number of patients with type 2 diabetes ranging from 7020 in EMPA-REG OUTCOME to 17,160 in DECLARE-TIMI 58 were included; they were followed-up for a median period ranging from 2.4 years in CANVAS to 4.2 years in DECLARE-TIMI 58. To date, a report release only is available for VERTIS-CV. While the primary endpoint of non-inferiority was met, key secondary endpoints of superiority were not; detailed results are scheduled to be presented in June 2020. Concerning the other SGLT2i, similar overall trends in the relative risk reductions for hospitalization for heart failure, renal outcomes and cardiovascular events have been found among CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME. A class effect has been suggested, accordingly, and the use of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin has been recommended with a similar strength of evidence.

### Generalizability of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcome trials to the type 2 diabetes population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5a437b59]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Since the external validity of absolute measures is limited, we estimated the following relative parameters, which are assumed to be stable and potentially applicable across populations with different characteristics. In head-to-head comparisons of the prevalence of eligibility for each SGLT2i CVOT, DECLARE-TIMI 58 was associated with the highest odds of eligibility, followed by CANVAS and EMPA-REG OUTCOME/VERTIS-CV. The odds for eligibility for the enrollment criteria of DECLARE-TIMI 58 were 1.74 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.50; p = 0.003) versus CANVAS, 5.15 (95% CI 3.30 to 8.05; p < 0.001) versus EMPA-REG OUTCOME and 4.81 (95% CI 2.59 to 8.96; p < 0.001) versus VERTIS-CV. No difference was found between EMPA-REG OUTCOME and VERTIS-CV (p = 0.97) (Figs. 3 and 4). A high heterogeneity was found for all the outcomes. There was no evidence of publication bias (see Additional file 5). Results were generally confirmed in the sensitivity analyses; the only exception was a non-statistically significant odds ratio in the head-to-head comparison of eligibility for the enrollment criteria of DECLARE-TIMI 58 versus CANVAS after removing one study (see Additional file 6).

### How representative of a general type 2 diabetes population are patients included in cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors? A large European observational study [^6c43da14]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Enrollment criteria vary substantially among cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), which impacts the relationship between a trial population and the general type 2 diabetes (T2D) population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the representativeness of four SGLT-2i CVOTs of a general T2D population.

Methods

T2D patients from Germany, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden were included in the study. Given the available data per country, key inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined by diagnoses, procedures and drug treatments to facilitate comparability among countries. Representativeness was determined by dividing the number of patients fulfilling the key enrolment criteria of each CVOT (CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, VERTIS-CV) by the total T2D population.

Results

In 2015, a total T2D population of 803 836 patients was identified in Germany (n = 239 485), in The Netherlands (n = 36 213), in Norway (n = 149 782) and in Sweden (n = 378 356). These populations showed a 25% to 44% cardiovascular (CV) disease baseline prevalence and high CV-preventive drug use (> 80%). The general T2D population had less prevalent CV disease and patients were slightly older than those included in the CVOTs. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial had the highest representativeness, 59% compared to the general T2D population, and this representativeness was almost 2-, 3- and 4-fold higher compared to the CANVAS (34%), EMPA-REG OUTCOME (21%) and VERTIS-CV (17%) trials, respectively.

Conclusions

In large T2D populations within Europe, consistent patterns of representativeness of CVOTs were found when applying the main enrolment criteria. The DECLARE-TMI 58 trial had the highest representativeness, indicating that it included and examined patients who are most representative of the general T2D patients in the studied countries.

### Eligibility of patients with type 2 diabetes for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcomes trials: a global perspective from the DISCOVER study [^94d0fbdf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Objective

To assess the eligibility of patients participating in DISCOVER (a 3-year, prospective, observational study program of 15 992 patients with type 2 diabetes [T2D] initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy across 38 countries) for four cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study [CANVAS], Dapagliflozin effect on CardiovascuLAR Events trial [DECLARE-TIMI 58], EMPAgliflozin cardiovascular OUTCOME event trial [EMPA-REG OUTCOME], and eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and Safety CardioVascular outcomes trial [VERTIS-CV]).

Research design and methods

In this cross-sectional analysis, baseline characteristics of DISCOVER patients were compared with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the CVOTs to assess patient eligibility, overall and in four regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa).

Results

Overall, 11 385 patients (71.2%) had sufficient data for the analysis; 56.1% were men. The mean age and time since T2D diagnosis were 57.4 and 5.6 years, respectively. The mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.3%. DISCOVER patients were younger, and fewer had a history of cardiovascular disease, than those enrolled in the CVOTs. Eligibility varied across the CVOTs; the proportion of eligible DISCOVER patients was highest for DECLARE-TIMI 58 (40.5%), followed by CANVAS (19.9%), VERTIS-CV (7.2%), and EMPA-REG OUTCOME (7.1%); 54.6% of patients were not eligible for any CVOT. Eligibility for each CVOT varied across regions, which was explained by the differing proportions of patients with established cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

In a large, international population of patients with T2D initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy, DECLARE-TIMI 58 was the most inclusive CVOT, suggesting that its study population will be more representative of patients encountered in routine clinical practice than those of CANVAS, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, and VERTIS-CV.

### Eligibility of patients with type 2 diabetes for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcomes trials: an assessment using the diabetes collaborative registry [^4a828a85]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Generalizability of findings from cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) to patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in clinical practice is unknown. We assessed the proportions of patients in the Diabetes Collaborative Registry who would have met enrolment criteria for pivotal CVOTs of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is): EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE and VERTIS CV. In 172643 patients, mean [standard deviation (SD)] age and HbA1c were 68.1 (11.8) years and 7.8% (2.2), respectively; 56.8% of patients were men and SGLT-2i use was 4.4%. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevalence was 64.3% and mean 10-year ASCVD risk was 28.6% in patients without ASCVD. Proportions of patients eligible for CVOTs ranged from 26% (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) to 44% (DECLARE); 48% of patients were ineligible for all CVOTs. Mean (SD) ASCVD risk was 25.4% (22.6), 32.1% (20.6) and 37.7% (19.4) in patients eligible for no, one or two CVOTs, respectively. SGLT-2i use was low in patients eligible for no CVOTs (3.5%) and at least one CVOT (5.2%). In conclusion, applicability of CVOT results to patients with T2D in clinical practice varies based on trial eligibility criteria.

### Eligibility of patients with type 2 diabetes for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcomes trials: a global perspective from the DISCOVER study [^e2980cc3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional analysis, the eligibility of DISCOVER patients varied greatly across the four SGLT-2 inhibitor CVOTs. In line with the results of the previous assessment of the NHANES population, DECLARE-TIMI 58 was the most inclusive trial, with an estimated 40.5% of DISCOVER patients eligible, followed by CANVAS, with an estimated 19.9% of DISCOVER patients eligible. Relatively low estimates for the proportions of eligible DISCOVER patients for EMPA-REG OUTCOME (7.1%) and VERTIS-CV (7.2%) are largely explained by the fact that these trials only included patients with established CVD.

It is therefore unknown whether the results from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and VERTIS-CV are applicable to most patients encountered in routine clinical practice. Indeed, the observational CVD-REAL study suggests that, as a class, SGLT-2 inhibitors provide CV benefits in patients with and without established CVD, which indicates that CVOTs should not be conducted exclusively in patients with CVD and need to be complemented by other data. This is also illustrated by the observation that more than half of the DISCOVER patients were not eligible for any of the four CVOTs.

Like DECLARE-TIMI 58, CANVAS included both patients with established CVD and patients with CV risk factors but no established CVD. The difference in eligibility of DISCOVER patients for these two trials is a result of more stringent entry criteria for CANVAS than for DECLARE-TIMI 58. For example, the HbA 1c range for inclusion was narrower in CANVAS than in DECLARE-TIMI 58 (7.0%–10.5% vs 6.5%–12.0%). In addition, patients had to have at least two CV risk factors to be eligible for CANVAS, but only one to be eligible for DECLARE-TIMI 58. Conversely, patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 could be included in CANVAS, but not in DECLARE-TIMI 58.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular event protections: how applicable are clinical trials and observational studies to real-world patients? [^9330c7cf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the characteristics of new users of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in clinical practice to assess the applicability of the findings from clinical trials (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial, Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE)-TIMI 58 trial, Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) program and the Evaluation of Ertugliflozin Efficacy and Safety Cardiovascular Outcomes (VERTIS-CV) trial) and multinational observational studies (CVD-REAL Nordic study and CVD-REAL 2 study).

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the largest electronic medical records database from seven hospitals in Taiwan. We included adult patients with type 2 diabetes initiating canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin between 1 January 2018 and 31 August 2019. We compared the patient characteristics with SGLT2i to examine the data representativeness of clinical trials and to evaluate channeling uses between canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.

Results

We identified a cohort of 11650 patients newly initiating SGLT2i, 49.9% of whom received empagliflozin. However, only 18.7%, 19.2%, 50.4% and 57.3% of real-world SGLT2i new users were included in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, VERTIS-CV trial, DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and CANVAS program, respectively. Reasons for exclusion were largely reduced cardiovascular disease risks in real-world patients, namely 72.8%, 73.6% and 34.2% for EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, VERTIS-CV trial and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and CANVAS program, respectively. However, hemoglobin A1c out of range accounted for the most frequent reason (25.0%) for exclusion of real-world patients from the CANVAS program. We found channeling uses in different SGLT2i, for example, more patients receiving empagliflozin (15.3%) and canagliflozin (19.6%) had poorer renal functions (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/1.73m 2), compared with dapagliflozin (9.3%).

Conclusions

The findings provide clear evidence that results from current studies may be less applicable to real-world patients. Further studies are required to support the concept of real-world cardiovascular event protection through SGLT2i.

### Mediators of ertugliflozin effects on heart failure and kidney outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1716ec64]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and composite kidney outcomes, but the mediators underlying these benefits are unknown.

Materials and Methods

Among participants from VERTIS CV, a trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease randomized to ertugliflozin versus placebo, Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the percentage mediation of ertugliflozin efficacy on the first HHF and kidney composite outcome in 26 potential mediators. Time-dependent approaches were used to evaluate associations between early (change from baseline to the first post-baseline measurement) and average (weighted average of change from baseline using all post-baseline measurements) changes in covariates with clinical outcomes.

Results

For the HHF analyses, early changes in four biomarkers (haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum albumin and urate) and average changes in seven biomarkers (early biomarkers+weight, chloride and serum protein) were identified as fulfilling the criteria as mediators of ertugliflozin effects on the risk of HHF. Similar results were observed for the composite kidney outcome, with early changes in four biomarkers (glycated haemoglobin, haemoglobin, haematocrit and urate), and average changes in five biomarkers [early biomarkers (not glycated haemoglobin)+weight, serum albumin] mediating the effects of ertugliflozin on the kidney outcome.

Conclusions

In these analyses from the VERTIS CV trial, markers of volume status and haemoconcentration and/or haematopoiesis were the strongest mediators of the effect of ertugliflozin on reducing risk of HHF and composite kidney outcomes in the early and average change periods.

First Event Analyses

The outcome of risk for first HHF was lower in patients on ertugliflozin (pooled doses) versus placebo (139/5499 [2.5%] versus 99/2747 [3.6%]; HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54–0.90]; P = 0.006). For ertugliflozin 5 mg versus placebo (71/2752 [2.6%] versus 99/2747 [3.6%]), the HR was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52–0.97) and for ertugliflozin 15 mg versus placebo (68/2747 [2.5%] versus 99/2747 [3.6%]), the HR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50–0.93). Figure 1 depicts the HRs for time to first HHF for the pooled dose comparison of ertugliflozin versus placebo and by individual dose (Figure 1 A). The event rates per 100 patient-years were similar in the 2 ertugliflozin treatment groups (0.75 per 100 patient-years in ertugliflozin 5 mg and 0.72 per 100 patient-years in ertugliflozin 15 mg) contrasted with the placebo group (1.05 per 100 patient-years).

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor

SGLT2i blocks the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule, producing natriuresis and glucosuria. There is substantial evidence to support a reduced risk of ESKD, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure. The cardiovascular and kidney benefits of SGLT2i are independent of the antihyperglycemic effect, which attenuates with lower eGFR. SGLT2i may improve glomerular hemodynamics, reduce oxidative stress, and optimize tissue energetics.

Large cardiovascular safety trials of SGLT2i demonstrated favorable secondary kidney outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes and variable baseline kidney function (table 3). Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) enrolled patients with eGFR of ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and demonstrated a 46% risk reduction of the composite secondary kidney outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of kidney replacement therapy, or renal death. In a post hoc analysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin demonstrated improved kidney function regardless of the baseline eGFR or degree of albuminuria. Canagliflozin and Cardiovascular and Renal Events in Type 2 Diabetes (CANVAS) enrolled patients with eGFR of ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and reported a 40% reduction in the composite secondary kidney outcome. Dapagliflozin and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes (DECLARE-TIMI 58) enrolled patients with eGFR of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and reported a 47% risk reduction in the composite secondary kidney outcome. However, in the Cardiovascular Outcomes with Ertugliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes (VERTIS CV) study, the reduction in the secondary composite kidney outcome was not statistically significant. EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS both demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary cardiovascular safety outcome, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 and VERTIS CV reached cardiovascular non-inferiority. These data argued for dedicated SGLT2i trials in the DKD population.
