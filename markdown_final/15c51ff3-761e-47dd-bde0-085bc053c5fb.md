## Question

Differential diagnosis for cough and rash in pediatric patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of cough and rash in pediatric patients, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and immediate triage. Then, I should categorize the differential by pathophysiology. Next, I will prioritize high-risk and time-sensitive diagnoses. After that, I will outline a focused diagnostic approach. Finally, I will consider management principles and follow-up, while double-checking key pitfalls and exceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why cough plus rash matters. Cough is common in children and often viral, but when paired with rash, the spectrum widens and the risk of missing serious disease increases, so I need to check for red flags such as fever, mucosal involvement, systemic toxicity, immunocompromise, and medication exposures, and I should verify vaccination status and epidemiologic risks like travel, animal exposures, and sick contacts to anchor pretest probabilities [^1176aEnF] [^113vpQNh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize the differential by mechanism to avoid anchoring. Infectious etiologies are most common and include viral exanthems with respiratory features, atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma, and classic bacterial diseases such as pertussis and scarlet fever; drug-induced hypersensitivity syndromes like DRESS and SJS/TEN must be considered with new medications; immune-mediated vasculitides and autoinflammatory syndromes can present with cough and rash; and malignancy, while rare, should remain on the list when systemic features persist or evolve [^1176aEnF] [^1126YTbM] [^114orZ8Q] [^111DFf4p] [^112cSXw1].

> I will now examine viral causes with respiratory and cutaneous features. COVID-19 can present with cough and a variety of rashes, including morbilliform and urticarial patterns, and I should confirm exposure risk and consider testing when epidemiologically plausible; influenza often includes cough and fever, with rash less common but possible; measles classically has cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a morbilliform rash, and I need to check vaccination history; enteroviruses and adenoviruses can also produce cough with exanthems, so I should correlate with seasonality and contacts [^1176aEnF] [^115FqgNe] [^1176aEnF].

> Wait, let me verify atypical bacterial considerations, especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Mycoplasma can cause a lower respiratory tract infection with cough and, in children, may trigger reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME/MIRM) characterized by prominent mucositis and sometimes vesiculobullous or targetoid skin lesions; I should ask about oral, ocular, and genital mucosal involvement and consider azithromycin if suspected, while remembering that steroids may be needed for severe mucocutaneous disease after infection control is addressed [^116CvizP] [^116AmMHY] [^112JCMEH].

> Next, I should review classic bacterial differentials. Pertussis presents with paroxysmal cough and may include posttussive vomiting; in children, posttussive vomiting is only moderately sensitive and specific, so I need to integrate exposure and duration, and if suspected, I should test and treat without delay to reduce transmission; scarlet fever follows streptococcal pharyngitis with a sandpaper rash, circumoral pallor, and strawberry tongue, and I should confirm with rapid testing and treat with penicillin to prevent complications [^112QvZaw] [^111boNEJ] [^112hWkJg].

> But wait, what if the rash is drug related. I need to check for new medications in the prior 2–8 weeks and look for systemic features suggesting DRESS, which can include fever, rash, eosinophilia, and internal organ involvement, with pulmonary manifestations such as cough; immediate drug withdrawal is critical, and I should confirm with labs and targeted organ assessment; SJS/TEN requires urgent recognition and often mucosal involvement, and I should remember that infections, including mycoplasma, can trigger severe mucocutaneous reactions in children [^1126YTbM] [^114orZ8Q] [^112JCMEH].

> I will now consider immune-mediated and vasculitic etiologies. Henoch-Schönlein purpura typically shows palpable purpura on the lower extremities and buttocks and may involve the lungs with cough or nodules; Kawasaki disease can present with cough and rash and carries coronary risk, so I should check for mucocutaneous features and systemic signs; juvenile dermatomyositis may show heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, and proximal weakness with interstitial lung disease; and I should keep hypereosinophilic syndromes in mind when eosinophilia accompanies rash and cough, recognizing pediatric differences from adult disease [^111DFf4p] [^116yV2uX] [^114bBMhC] [^117JNSGq].

> Hold on, I should verify oncologic and other serious causes when red flags persist. Lymphoma or leukemia can present with chronic cough, rash, and systemic symptoms; a prolonged, unexplained fever and rash with cough warrants CBC, inflammatory markers, and imaging to exclude malignancy and opportunistic infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts or when lymphadenopathy and organomegaly are present [^112cSXw1].

> Let me first confirm the immediate diagnostic approach. I need a meticulous history of chronology, exposures, travel, animals, medications, and vaccination, plus a complete exam including vital signs, mucosae, lymph nodes, and organomegaly; basic labs should include CBC with differential, inflammatory markers, and targeted testing for suspected infections such as COVID-19, influenza, pertussis, and streptococcus; for chronic cough beyond 4 weeks, a chest radiograph and age-appropriate spirometry are recommended, and I should escalate to CT, bronchoscopy, or specialty referral if specific pointers emerge or the child deteriorates [^1176aEnF] [^115g2Tzt] [^111ADmWD].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to obtain a sputum culture for every wet cough; I should double-check that. Sputum culture is reasonable when a child can cooperate and wet cough persists, but in young children I may need to rely on nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage if disease is severe or atypical; I also need to ensure I do not over-order low-yield tests and instead tailor investigations to evolving clinical clues and guideline-based algorithms [^111ADmWD] [^114Jz5tR].

> Next, I should review management principles by etiology. Viral illnesses are generally supportive with reassurance and symptom control; pertussis warrants macrolide therapy for treatment and prophylaxis of close contacts; scarlet fever requires penicillin; Mycoplasma pneumonia is treated with azithromycin; DRESS mandates drug cessation and systemic steroids if severe; Kawasaki disease needs IVIG and aspirin; and for chronic wet cough without specific pointers, a time-limited antibiotic trial for protracted bacterial bronchitis is reasonable with reassessment of response [^112hWkJg] [^112JCMEH] [^1126YTbM] [^116yV2uX] [^112U5MLm].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety-netting. For acute cough under 4 weeks, I will advise return precautions for respiratory distress, dehydration, or worsening rash; for chronic cough, I should re-evaluate in 2–4 weeks if not improving to reassess for emerging specific pointers and pivot testing accordingly; I need to ensure return precautions explicitly include fever with rash or persistent headache, as these may signal serious disease and warrant urgent reassessment [^113nbx4p] [^114pJPVw].

> Hold on, I should verify key pitfalls and exceptions. I must not dismiss cough plus rash as "just viral" when mucosal involvement, systemic toxicity, or atypical features are present; I should remember that fully vaccinated children can still acquire pertussis, so clinical suspicion should not be discounted; and I need to keep an index of suspicion for drug reactions whenever new medications were started in the weeks preceding symptom onset, as early recognition changes outcomes [^114orZ8Q] [^114jsK6t] [^1126YTbM].

The most common causes of cough with rash in children are **viral infections** (measles, varicella, RSV, adenovirus, COVID-19) [^1176aEnF] and **bacterial infections** (pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, scarlet fever, meningococcemia) [^112CzxQE] [^112hWkJg]. Other important causes include **drug reactions** (DRESS, SJS/TEN) [^1126YTbM] [^114orZ8Q], **immune-mediated conditions** (Kawasaki disease, HSP, SLE) [^116yV2uX] [^111DFf4p], and **tick-borne diseases** (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease) [^1176aEnF]. Evaluation should be guided by **history, exam, and targeted labs** (CBC, CRP/ESR, throat/PCR, serologies, chest X-ray) [^115g2Tzt] [^111ADmWD] [^1117erMc]. Management is **etiology-specific**, with antivirals, antibiotics, immunomodulatory therapy, or supportive care as indicated [^115FqgNe] [^112U5MLm] [^114orZ8Q].

## Infectious etiologies

### Viral infections

- **Measles**: Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and morbilliform rash; Koplik spots precede the rash.
- **Varicella (chickenpox)**: Cough with pruritic vesicular rash in crops; URI symptoms common.
- **Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)**: Cough, wheeze, fever; rash may occur, especially in young children.
- **Adenovirus**: Cough, fever, pharyngitis; rash may be present.
- **COVID-19**: Cough, fever, and various rashes (maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain-like) [^111uBXvR] [^117AZwu7].

---

### Bacterial infections

- **Pertussis**: Paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whoop; rash is uncommon but may occur [^112AmyVT].
- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**: Cough with maculopapular or vesicular rash; mucosal involvement suggests MIRM [^116CvizP] [^116AmMHY].
- **Scarlet fever**: Group A streptococcal infection with sandpaper rash, fever, sore throat, and cough [^112hWkJg].
- **Meningococcemia**: Petechial or purpuric rash with cough, fever, and systemic toxicity [^117WjRbe].

---

### Tick-borne infections

Rocky Mountain spotted fever presents with cough, fever, headache, and a **progressive petechial rash** [^1176aEnF]; **Lyme disease** may cause cough with erythema migrans rash and systemic symptoms.

---

## Non-infectious etiologies

### Drug reactions

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (**DRESS**) presents with fever, rash, cough, and multi-organ involvement 2–8 weeks after drug exposure [^1126YTbM]; **Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN)** causes severe mucocutaneous reactions with cough due to respiratory involvement [^notfound].

---

### Immune-mediated conditions

Kawasaki disease presents with fever, rash, conjunctival injection, extremity changes, and occasional cough [^116yV2uX]; **Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)** causes palpable purpura, abdominal pain, joint pain, and occasional cough [^111DFf4p]; **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** may cause rash, cough, and systemic symptoms.

---

### Other non-infectious causes

In hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cough and rash follow environmental exposures; **vasculitis** may present with cough, rash, and systemic symptoms.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|
| History | - Onset <br/> - Duration <br/> - Cough characteristics <br/> - Rash morphology <br/> - Distribution <br/> - Evolution <br/> - Sick contacts <br/> - Travel <br/> - Vaccination <br/> - Medications <br/> - Environmental exposures [^113vpQNh] |
| Physical examination | - Vital signs <br/> - General appearance <br/> - Rash type <br/> - Distribution <br/> - Mucosal involvement <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly <br/> - Respiratory findings [^117WjRbe] |
| Laboratory tests | - CBC <br/> - CRP/ESR <br/> - Throat culture <br/> - Rapid strep test <br/> - PCR for viral/bacterial pathogens <br/> - Serologies (measles, Mycoplasma, Lyme, RMSF) <br/> - Chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms persist [^112hWkJg] [^111ADmWD] |
| Imaging | Chest X-ray for persistent cough or respiratory distress; consider CT if severe or complicated disease is suspected [^111ADmWD] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Viral infections**: Supportive care, antipyretics, hydration, and monitoring for complications [^notfound].
- **Bacterial infections**: Appropriate antibiotics (e.g. macrolides for pertussis/Mycoplasma, penicillin for streptococcal infections) [^112JCMEH] [^112hWkJg].
- **Drug reactions**: Immediate discontinuation of offending drug, supportive care, and systemic corticosteroids for severe reactions [^1126YTbM].
- **Immune-mediated conditions**: Immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. IVIG for Kawasaki disease, corticosteroids for HSP/SLE) [^116yV2uX] [^111DFf4p].

---

Cough with rash in children has a broad differential, but a structured history, exam, and targeted testing enable accurate diagnosis and management. Prioritize **infectious causes** and **drug reactions**, and tailor therapy to the specific etiology.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

Cough and fever in infants and children are frequent but nonspecific symptoms. Several usual differential diagnoses are under consideration and imaging is often necessary to help arrive at an accurate diagnosis and ensure proper management. A broad spectrum of underlying disorders may be present. Radiologists must remain cognizant of the potential for immune dysfunction and underlying structural abnormalities. A clear understanding of up-to-date imaging evaluation recommendations and characteristic imaging features can assist radiologists and clinicians in arriving at the most accurate diagnosis in a timely manner and help ensure proper management and necessary follow-up imaging assessment.

Treatment of chronic cough

The management of specific chronic pediatric cough should be based on the etiology of the cough, as symptoms will resolve if the underlying condition is successfully managed. For example, children with PBB should receive antibiotics, and children with asthma may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

For non-specific chronic pediatric dry cough, a treatment attempt with inhaled corticosteroids may be appropriate; for non-specific chronic wet/productive cough, antibiotics may be trialed. While antibiotics are considered efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough, the indication for antibiotics should be checked to avoid unnecessary exposure to possible side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, and antibiotic resistance. For children exposed to airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke, allergens, or home pollutants, attempts should be made to remove the child from this environment (i.e. stopping the child and/or their parents from smoking).

Numerous algorithms are available to assist in the treatment of chronic pediatric cough, and the use of such algorithms improves clinical outcomes.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^112cSXw1]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) for acute respiratory distress in the setting of 5 months of recurrent and worsening rash with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. At the onset of his rash, he and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the patient's rash recurred, prompting his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened, so amoxicillin was stopped; a prednisone course was prescribed which alleviated the rash. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely with associated symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Because of these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC, where his vitals were notable for tachypnea and tachycardia. His initial EC imaging workup was remarkable for an echocardiogram with a mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, chest x-ray (CXR) with a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography significant for prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results were notable for elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. Differential diagnosis remained broad, including infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

Conclusions

The presenting features of COVID-19 differ in children from adults, with lower rates of fever and cough and more prominence of vomiting and diarrhoea. Currently, haematological, biochemical and radiological findings in children infected with COVID-19 are not diagnostic and do not consistently predict severe disease.

Prospective research is required to help identify any patient groups who are at risk of developing severe infection and features which may be used to identify these children early in the disease course.

Regarding specific circumstances for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (differential diagnosis), BAD 2019 guidelines recommend to assess for potential infectious etiology in all patients and identify pediatric/young patients with specific clinical phenotypes more likely to be caused by respiratory infections (such as clinically predominant mucositis with limited skin involvement: respiratory infection-induced rash and mucositis).

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113dD3d4]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Cough [^117H4Xxr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that 'relentlessly progressive' cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between 'specific' cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and 'non-specific' cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found.

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution.

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Pertussis: what the pediatric infectious disease specialist should know [^114CbpV3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Pertussis is a bacterial disease that is transmitted very efficiently from human to human by droplets. It occurs at any age, is endemic in any population, and can cause outbreaks in highly variable frequencies. Hallmark of the disease is cough with or without paroxysms, whoop, and vomiting. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion followed by laboratory confirmation (PCR, Serology) and should be followed by prompt antibiotic treatment to stop spread of the bacteria to contact persons. Control of pertussis by acellular vaccines is possible to some extent if immunization coverage is high and booster doses are given lifelong. However new vaccines with higher efficacy rates are warranted.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

Mycoplasma -induced rash and mucositis (MIRM), also referred to as "reactive infectious mucosal-predominant eruption", is a relatively newly described entity. Differential diagnosis includes erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis. It is characterized by clinical symptoms of pneumonia, including fever and cough, and by mucosal lesions that usually affect 2 or more sites. In about half of the reported cases, it is also accompanied by a cutaneous eruption that is often vesiculobullous and sometimes presents with typical and atypical target lesions. It has been mostly reported in children and young adolescents with a mean age of 12 years, and it affected males in two-thirds of the reported cases.

Here, we report an unusual case of MIRM occurring in a middle-aged female.

### Pediatrician! Do you know the symptoms of DRESS syndrome? A case report of a 4-year-old girl [^1126YTbM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and may be observed after administration of many drugs. Clinical symptoms usually occur 2 to 8 weeks after drug introduction. Because DRESS syndrome is potentially life threatening, it is especially important to diagnose it early. Withdrawal of the drug which induced symptoms is the most important therapeutic option. DRESS syndrome appears mostly in adults. There are relatively few articles on the DRESS syndrome in children. The article presents a case of a 4-year-old girl with a life-threatening clinical course of DRESS syndrome with massive pulmonary involvement. The knowledge of DRESS syndrome clinical symptoms is essential for doctors of various specialties. It is especially important that general practitioners, pediatricians, and pediatric neurologists should be able to take this life-threatening syndrome into consideration for differential diagnosis.

### Monkeypox in a young infant-Florida, 2022 [^117KVuFW]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

To date, 27 confirmed cases of monkeypox in pediatric patients aged 0–15 years have been reported in the United States during the 2022 outbreak. Clinical presentations in children with monkeypox have been similar to those in adults, although children might have a higher risk for severe disease. Timely laboratory identification and thorough epidemiologic investigation are critical for effective public health response to monkeypox infection. In this case, contact tracing and postexposure prophylaxis vaccination of close contacts of the affected infant might have prevented further transmission to household members. Clinicians should consider monkeypox infection as a differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with pustular or vesicular rashes and be aware of the possibility for household transmission to pediatric patients, particularly if the children meet epidemiologic exposure criteria for diagnosis of monkeypox.

### Incomplete Kawasaki disease presenting primarily with cough: a case report and brief literature review [^116yV2uX]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the literature, cough occurs in approximately 40.5% of KD patients, most commonly during the acute phase. Only a small subset experience cough as the presenting symptom, and it is more frequently seen in infants. Although rare, severe cough can mislead clinicians, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. To better understand the clinical characteristics of IKD with respiratory involvement, we reviewed six previously reported pediatric cases aged between 2 months and 9 years, with a predominance of female patients (Table 2). Maddi et al. described a 23-month-old girl with KD who presented with fever, bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection, red lips, a truncal rash, irritability, and cough. Chest radiography revealed consolidation in the right middle lobe. Although echocardiography showed no coronary artery involvement, the patient was diagnosed with IKD and responded well to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin therapy, with fever resolution and gradual improvement in pulmonary symptoms. The remaining five cases exhibited pulmonary involvement, but in these instances, cough developed during the disease course rather than as an initial symptom.

Table 2
Cases of respiratory manifestations of KD described in the literature

AB Abnormal, CAL Coronary artery lesions, F Female, N Normal, UN Unknown

Pulmonary complications in KD are rare and can include bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, parenchymal infiltrates, pulmonary atelectasis, pleural effusion, pleuritis, pulmonary aneurysms, and nodules. In our patient, initial radiologic findings indicated bronchitis and perihilar inflammation. Lung involvement in KD may result from systemic vasculitis leading to increased vascular permeability and perivascular edema.

In a study by Shibuya et al. autopsy findings in 20 of 34 KD patients (59%) demonstrated evidence of panvasculitis in the lungs. During the acute phase of KD, an intense inflammatory response occurs, characterized by abnormal activation of immune cells and the release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). These mediators damage vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, contributing to vasculitis. Additionally, elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide during the acute stage may increase vascular permeability. Given our patient's presentation, it is plausible that his cough was related to pulmonary vasculitis.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^116shMpx]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. This study had two aims: to identify therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients (internationally), and to consider the evidence required to address these unmet needs.

Methods

A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was performed to identify articles describing therapeutic principles in the treatment of pediatric cough. An online survey of international pediatric cough experts was conducted, with questions on the definitions, diagnosis, treatment, and unmet needs in pediatric cough management.

Results

Cough guidelines have differing definitions of pediatric patients (≤ 12–18 years), acute pediatric cough (< 2–3 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 4–8 weeks). Similarly, among 18 experts surveyed, definitions varied for pediatric patients (≤ 10–21 years), acute pediatric cough (< 3–5 days to < 6 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 2–8 weeks). Guidelines generally do not recommend over-the-counter or prescription cough medicines in acute pediatric cough, due to lack of evidence. In the expert survey, participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for treating acute pediatric cough, and noted that effective treatments are lacking for cough-related pain and sleep disruption. Overall, guidelines and experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires diagnostic investigations to identify the underlying cough-causing disease and thereby to guide treatment. There are unmet needs for new effective and safe treatments for acute pediatric cough, and for randomized controlled trials of existing treatments. Safety is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to its diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusions

Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. There is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine-preventable respiratory disease with rising incidence due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity. The most severe disease course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, accounting for the largest burden of hospitalization and death, but adolescents and adults play an important role in pertussis transmission and outbreaks. Prompt recognition and diagnosis remain critical for hospitalists in the management of pertussis disease and prevention.

2.6 Case Progression

Without any improvement of the clinical state, the patient still required oxygen and suffered from spiking fever throughout the day, with extensive sweating at night. Repeated CBCs showed persistent leukocytosis (23.0 × 10⁹/L) and eosinophilia, as well as a new increase in CRP (106 mg/L).

As part of a vasculitis work‐up, the tests for autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti‐ Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies) and serum calprotectin were normal, screening for renal involvement detected no proteinuria or hematuria. Due to the lymphadenopathy, the Mantoux test and the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) test were performed to exclude tuberculosis, both of which were negative. Furthermore, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and chitotriosidase levels for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis were normal for the age. Lung function tests uncovered a severe reduction of lung vital capacity at 30% of the predicted value. At this point, a bronchoscopy was scheduled to visualize the airways, obtain samples by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and to perform an endobronchial biopsy for detailed tissue analysis. Simultaneously, a skin biopsy from one of the lesions on the arm was carried out.

On bronchoscopy, the macroscopic airway anatomy was normal, with the airway mucosa showing signs of discrete inflammatory changes and viscous secretions throughout the bronchial tree (Figure 3a). The differential leukocyte count from the BAL showed 10% eosinophils (physiological value: < 1%), 6% lymphocytes (physiological value: < 10%), 76% macrophages (physiological value: > 90%) and 8% neutrophils (physiological value: < 3%). Importantly, microbiology investigations from the BAL revealed a high number of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) copies (38,000 IU/L).

Also, an elevated Candida species antigen (157 pg/mL, physiological values: < 62.4 pg/mL), yet normal value of the Aspergillus galactomannan (0.12, physiological index < 0.49) was found in the BAL. Later, fungal culture from the BAL was also found to be negative.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^117PNXse]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

When participants were asked under what circumstances they perform further diagnostic investigations concerning the cause of pediatric cough (beyond patient history and physical examination), the most common response was in patients with "chronic cough" (10/16 participants; 63%), particularly if not responding to usual treatments, for repeated episodes, or in the presence of other disease symptoms. Other conditions spontaneously mentioned by one or more participants that would warrant further diagnostic investigations were allergy, aspiration/inhaled foreign body, chronic pulmonary disease, cyanosis, newborns coughing during feeding, pertussis, respiratory distress, and severe infection/pneumonia. When asked to indicate the approximate percentage of their pediatric patients with cough in which specific investigations were instigated in the past 6 months, median percentages were 31–40% for spirometry, 21–30% for chest X-ray and allergy testing, 11–20% for sputum culture, 1–10% for serology and computerized tomography scan, and 0–10% for bronchoscopy. One participant noted that fewer children with cough were referred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no pulmonary function tests were carried out due to the potential for aerosol generation.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111ADmWD]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — initial investigations and targeted testing: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β2 agonist) be undertaken. For children aged > 6 years and ≤ 14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, we suggest that a test for airway hyper-responsiveness be considered. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance to the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected, and CHEST guidelines suggested clinicians consider pertussis if there is post-tussive vomiting, paroxysmal cough or inspiratory whoop.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115g2Tzt]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and general approach: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration. For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms, we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough, and we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough.

### Asthma history and presentation [^115sRRNd]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is suspected from a history of key symptoms, including cough, wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and increased mucus production. A positive family or personal history of atopic diseases and diseases that are comorbid with asthma, such as allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, is also important. The differential diagnosis of asthma is broad and includes potentially life-threatening diseases. Pediatric asthma and psychiatric mimics require special attention to prevent misdiagnosis. Differentiating asthma from these other disease states by history alone is not always possible. Because accurate diagnosis is critical to successful treatment, objective testing by spirometry and methacholine challenge should be employed.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^114QUpan]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is a highly prevalent symptom in children of all ages and in different regions of the world. Pediatric cough is most commonly caused by acute viral respiratory tract infection, though it can be triggered by numerous conditions including bacterial infection, allergic response, and asthma. Pediatric cough has a major impact on sleep, school performance, and the ability to play and, therefore, has a negative influence on children's quality of life. Pediatric cough is also a source of stress and anxiety for parents, due to its impact on children's behavior (e.g. refusing food) and sleep patterns, and the often unwarranted fear that it will escalate into a more serious health condition. Thus, pediatric cough is a major driver to seek medical attention, and is associated with high costs resulting from physician visits, diagnostic tests, and medications, thereby placing a high burden on healthcare systems.

Various local, national, and international organizations have developed clinical practice guidelines in order to standardize the treatment of cough in adults and/or children. However, these guidelines vary in quality, and recommendations are often based on low-quality evidence (observational studies or expert consensus, as opposed to randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Cough is a symptom of multiple diseases and, therefore, is managed by a variety of disciplines. Furthermore, while guidelines for adults outnumber those for children, adult guidelines do not translate well to children. Overall, there are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. The aims of this study were to identify and present therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients, at an international level, and to consider the clinical studies required to address these unmet needs. The aims are addressed through a review of current literature on pediatric cough, and expert opinion collected using a questionnaire.

### Deadly viral syndrome mimics [^115vBN8Q]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (ie, "the common cold") have several hundred causes, the most common of which include rhino-virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The clinical presentation varies with symptoms. Every emergency department, no matter what the demographics, cares for patients with this constellation of symptoms. Emergency physicians examine, diagnose, and treat these disorders frequently. With increasing burdens being placed on emergency physicians, it is possible to assume a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection without generating a complete differential diagnosis. The challenge is to identify and recognize the distinctions between an innocuous upper respiratory tract infection and a life-threatening disease "mimic" or entities. This article discusses some of these life-threatening mimics.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — hospitalized adults and pediatric predictors show variable accuracy and age-specific features. In hospitalized patients, fever with cough or sore throat had a sensitivity of 43% for patients without asthma and only 20% for asthmatic patients. Infants and young children with influenza may not always have fever and may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, may present with fever and suspected sepsis, and diarrhea can occur in up to 28% of infants and young children with influenza. In young children 1–5 years, fever > 38°C, chills, headache, malaise, and sore eyes were significantly associated with a positive RT-PCR test result. In pediatric patients, fever (≥ 38°C), headache, cough, and absence of abnormal breathing sounds had a positive predictive value of 57.1%. Among children aged ≤ 5 years, adding rhinorrhea to the fever and cough case definition achieved a better balance between sensitivity (83%) and specificity (47%), and among pediatric outpatients aged ≤ 13 years with respiratory infections, fever was the only reliable predictor of culture-confirmed influenza virus infection.

A 9-year-old girl presented to her primary care pediatrician via telemedicine during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of 4 days of warmth perceived by her mother, decreased energy, and a new rash on her upper extremities. After 10 additional days of documented fever > 38°C, worsening fatigue, and 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU. After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter. The specialists who assisted with identification of the underlying etiology of her symptoms were able to work together to manage the subsequent complications.

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Zika virus disease comparing children and adults in a dengue-endemic setting [^112VTiw3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Zika virus infection can cause a clinical illness that mimics mild DENV infection. The eligibility criteria in our study reflect real clinical practices in resource-limited settings where molecular testing is not routinely performed to confirm DENV infection, and most suspected DENV cases are diagnosed by clinically compatible symptoms plus positive DENV RDTs testing. All ZIKV cases in our study presented with rash, most commonly maculopapular rash. Compared with non-ZIKV cases, ZIKV cases were more likely to have rash, arthralgia, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and milder fever and were less likely to have cough. These findings were compatible with previous studies. – The long median duration of rash (5 days) and arthralgia (4 days) among ZIKV cases in our study was also similar to a previous report. Around 50–70% of our ZIKV cases had pruritus, which suggests that pruritus should be added to the ZIKV case definitions.

Previous studies found that rash and fever were the two most common symptoms in pediatric ZIKV cases. However, rash was the only symptom that was significantly more common in children with ZIKV than those without ZIKV in our study. All pediatric ZIKV cases in our study had lower peak temperature than pediatric non-ZIKV cases. We found a lower proportion of conjunctivitis than those reported in another study (10% versus 58%). We also observed significantly older age among pediatric ZIKV cases than pediatric non-ZIKV cases, which may reflect the higher chance of exposure to ZIKV-infected mosquitoes among the older children possibly through increased frequency of outdoor activities.

Comparing ZIKV cases with non-ZIKV cases in adults, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis were significantly more common, whereas fever, headache, myalgia, and cough were less common. These findings were also compatible with previous studies, of which majority were adults. – Conjunctivitis was found in about half of the adult ZIKV cases in our study similar to some previous studies, and this suggests that conjunctivitis should be included in the definition of ZIKV disease in adults.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^114zDAK6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

If a patient meets 1 or more of the criteria for pertussis diagnosis, the physician should treat the patient and report the case to the appropriate health agencies. General comments on the clinical presentation of pertussis and its laboratory diagnosis are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

Table 4.
General Comments on Clinical Presentation of Pertussis

Table 5.
General Comments on Laboratory Diagnostics of Pertussis

There are a number of strong indicators of pertussis that differ by age group. In young infants, the occurrence of coryza and cough in an afebrile child is usually not alarming. When these young infants are seen by physicians, they are thought to have a viral respiratory infection, and the parents are reassured. However, over the next day or two, the parents recognize the worsening of symptoms, but more often than not, the physicians do not (based on author experience in California in 2010 [J. D. C.]). The key indicators of pertussis in these young infant cases are the afebrile nature of the illness combined with a cough that is increasing in frequency and severity and a coryza that remains watery. Therefore, the presence of this triad would be expected to have high sensitivity and good specificity. The addition of apnea, seizures, cyanosis, emesis, or pneumonia would result in both high sensitivity and specificity. In these young infant cases, an elevated white blood cell count (≥ 20 000 cells/µL) with absolute lymphocytosis is virtually diagnostic.

In older children (4 months to 9 years), the presence of a worsening paroxysmal, nonproductive cough of ≥ 7 days' duration in an afebrile child with coryza that has not become purulent also would indicate high sensitivity and good specificity for pertussis. As noted with current case definitions, the addition of whoop, apnea, and posttussive emesis will each increase specificity. In those persons ≥ 10 years of age, the same triad listed above for those 4 months to 9 years would also result in high sensitivity with good specificity. In addition, the notation of sweating episodes between paroxysms will significantly increase specificity. In dealing with adult patients, it is important to ask specific questions about productive cough. Adults will often say that the cough is productive, but on further questioning, it is apparent that they actually do not produce purulent sputum.

### Contemporary topics in pediatric pulmonology for the primary care clinician [^112bjtg6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the respiratory system are commonly encountered in the primary care setting. The presentations are myriad and this review will discuss some of the more intriguing or vexing disorders that the clinician must evaluate and treat. Among these are dyspnea, chronic cough, chest pain, wheezing, and asthma. Dyspnea and chest pain have a spectrum ranging from benign to serious, and the ability to effectively form a differential diagnosis is critical for reassurance and treatment, along with decisions on when to refer for specialist evaluation. Chronic cough is one of the more common reasons for primary care office visits, and once again, a proper differential diagnosis is necessary to assist the clinician in formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Infant wheezing creates much anxiety for parents and accounts for a large number of office visits and hospital admissions. Common diagnoses and evaluation strategies of early childhood wheezing are reviewed. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of children and adults. The epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and the patient/parent education process will be reviewed. A relatively new topic for primary care clinicians is cystic fibrosis newborn screening. The rationale, methods, outcomes, and implications will be reviewed. This screening program may present some challenges for clinicians caring for newborns, and an understanding of the screening process will help the clinician communicate effectively with parents of the patient.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^113v68ZT]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Some viral infections are known to cause post-acute infection syndromes, and may represent a considerable healthcare burden, with social and economic consequences for children, adolescents, and their families. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and includes both physical and psychological symptoms, usually without any specific clinical findings or laboratory abnormalities. The features may vary according to the etiology of the viral infection, individual patient response (complete recovery, relapse, or remitting pattern), and age (younger children being more prone to respiratory symptoms and older children often presenting with chronic fatigue). It can be argued that post-viral syndromes often share a similar symptom profile, irrespective of the involved pathogen. This suggests the potential existence of a common etiopathogenesis. Post-viral fatigue syndrome, also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, presents symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and variable neurological abnormalities. Many viruses have been thought to be associated with post-acute infection syndromes, most commonly Coxsackie viruses, but also Influenza, Varicella, Epstein–Barr, Ebola, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be followed by a comparable post-acute, long-lasting multi-organ syndrome. The most commonly reported symptoms of Long/post COVID conditions include fatigue, headache, attention disorder, hair loss, cough, chest pain and dyspnea; however, with a lower prevalence in children to young adults as compared to adults. Fatigue is a dominant feature of Long/post COVID, potentially lasting for weeks to months. According to adult data, prolonged illness duration and persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection will generally resolve within six months or less, except for severe fatigue or post-exertional malaise.

Post COVID-19 conditions became a global concern after the initial acute phase of the pandemic, however little is known about the pathogenesis and long-term clinical course both in adults as well as in children, adolescents and young adults. The overlap between the clinical presentation and course of post COVID and other post-viral conditions highlights the need to review the clinical characteristics, duration of symptoms, and possible healthcare burden in the pediatric population of both entities.

This review aims to systematically describe the available evidence on symptoms persisting beyond acute COVID infection, as compared to other viral infections; to evaluate clinical characteristics, duration, and healthcare burden.

### Multiple unusual lung etiologies in a child with acute lymphocytic leukemia [^111PmHWE]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Granulomatous lung disease is a rare and perplexing differential in pediatrics. Pulmonary Cryptococcus falls into the differential but is not high on the list, particularly in a non-AIDS patient. Methotrexate (MTX) is a commonly used agent for chemotherapy in oncology and has been documented to cause lung injury in both patients with rheumatologic and oncologic diseases. Our patient had chronic cough and then developed an opportunistic infection resulting in respiratory failure. Lung biopsy showed two underlying unusual diagnoses: MTX lung injury and cryptococcal pneumonia. His case is presented with particular attention to his prolonged road to diagnosis.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zU7JA]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis-associated cough in adults — clinical feature-based diagnosis: For adult patients with acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever to help rule in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis; paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity and low specificity, whereas inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity but high specificity, and for adult patients with acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature, with fever defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### Life-threatening and non-life-threatening complications associated with coughing: a scoping review [^115ygkq4]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the section on complications that are associated with coughing in the 2006 CHEST cough guidelines that addresses two aims: (1) to systematically identify and thematically categorize the diverse complications of cough by providing a guide for future studies and (2) to identify gaps in the literature for future research.

Research Question

What are the potential complications that are associated with the act of coughing that have been reported in infants, children, adolescents, and adults?

Study Design and Methods

A scoping review was performed with the use of PubMed and SCOPUS databases that were searched from their beginning until September 6, 2019.

Results

Two hundred forty-seven publications met our inclusion criteria. To these, we added 38 articles from the 2006 complications paper that were not identified in the literature search plus the paper itself for a final total of 286 publications that formed the basis of this review. Since 2006, three new categories of complications have been reported: ear, nose and throat; disease transmission; and laboratory testing. Multiple additional complications that fall outside of these three categories have also been identified and included in the following categories: cardiovascular, constitutional symptoms, dermatologic, GI, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, neurologic, ophthalmologic, psychosocial/quality of life, and respiratory. Not previously highlighted is that some of the complications led to serious morbidity that included death, especially in patients with comorbid conditions, and potentially resulted in harm to others when cough resulted in a motor vehicle accident.

Interpretation

Our work identified a large number of cough complications that we thematically categorized primarily by organ system so that future studies of each system or each complication can be conducted. The gap in the literature that future studies should address is to identify the frequency of the complications and the strength of their association with cough. Only then will one be able to describe the findings in a manner that allows specific recommendations for avoiding these complications. In the meantime, patients with cough should be evaluated and treated according to evidence-based guidelines to mitigate or prevent the myriad of potential complications that are associated with coughing.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113tU3PA]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis — children with HIV with a suspicion of a bacterial infection: pediatric infectious diseases should be consulted, and non-bacterial pathogens must also be considered as possible diagnoses in immunocompromised children with HIV. Attempted isolation of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid) is strongly recommended, as identification and antimicrobial resistance testing will guide effective treatment, and, depending on availability and pretest probability, molecular diagnostic testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, stool samples, or cerebrospinal fluid can be considered to aid diagnosis; these panels also aid in the detection of antibiotic resistance markers. In children presenting with respiratory symptoms, the diagnosis of pneumonia is often based on clinical symptoms and can be supported by an abnormal chest radiograph, and the use of molecular diagnostic testing can aid in differentiating viral from bacterial pneumonia and has the potential to decrease hospitalizations and empiric antibiotic use. Even after diagnosis with a viral infection, the clinician must consider that a secondary bacterial pneumonia can occur following the initial phase of a viral respiratory infection or during the recovery phase, blood and fluid from pleural effusion (if present) should be cultured, and the differential for children with HIV and pneumonia must include Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) even if they are receiving ART, and must include PCP if they are not receiving combination ART. Presence of wheezing makes acute bacterial pneumonia less likely than other causes, such as viral infections, asthma exacerbation, atypical bacterial infections, or aspiration; children with LIP often have recurrent episodes of bacterial respiratory infection superimposed on chronic respiratory symptoms of cough and mild tachypnea. In children with bacteremia, a source should be sought, in addition to routine chest radiographs other diagnostic imaging may be necessary in children with HIV with compromised immune systems to identify less apparent foci of infection, and in children with suspected bacteremia and central venous catheters, blood culture should be obtained through the catheter and (if possible) peripherally.

### Recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura with bullous rash and pulmonary nodules [^111DFf4p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood. It has a characteristic rash described as palpable purpura that most frequently affects the distal lower extremities and buttocks. HSP rarely presents with bullous rash nor pulmonary nodules.

Case presentation

We present a novel case of a 12-years-old female with recurrent pediatric HSP with a combination of the rare manifestations of bullous rash and pulmonary nodules. She initially presented with the bullous rash, chest pain, cough, and abdominal pain. Patient was successfully treated with intravenous pulse corticosteroids followed by a high dose oral corticosteroid taper, with resolution of the bullous rash and pulmonary nodules.

Conclusion

The rare manifestations of scarring bullous rash and pulmonary nodules can be presenting features of pediatric HSP, the combination of which has not been previously reported. The treatment of intravenous corticosteroid resolved patient's abdominal symptoms, rash and pulmonary nodules.

### 14-month-old female with anti-MDA5 juvenile dermatomyositis complicated by liver disease: a case report [^114bBMhC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A previously healthy 14-month-old Hispanic female presented with eight months of worsening rash, weakness, periorbital edema, intermittent fevers, and weight loss. Symptoms started with cough, congestion, and fever at approximately six months of age. She was treated by her primary care provider (PCP) with a five-day course of prednisolone. After completing the course of steroids, she developed a rash on her left arm. The rash persisted despite treatment with moisturizers. The patient then received her one-year-old vaccines (six months following her initial presentation) with subsequent spreading of her rash. Her rash was described as "bruise-like" and spread to include all four extremities along with truncal involvement. Her activity level declined, and she appeared weaker to family members. Six weeks after vaccines (and two weeks prior to presentation for admission to hospital) she began to have daily fevers. She was evaluated again by her PCP four days prior to hospital presentation with lab work obtained showing elevated transaminases, creatine kinase (CK), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a positive antinuclear antibody and ribonucleoprotein antibody. She was subsequently referred to pediatric rheumatology for urgent evaluation.

On the day of presentation to the rheumatology clinic, the patient was noted to be thin with her weight in the fifth percentile at 7.9 kg. Her exam was notable for thinning of hair, heliotrope rash, periorbital edema, and violaceous macules on her bilateral elbows, forearms, arms, and knees (Fig. 1). Many of the violaceous macules were also ulcerative, progressing throughout admission. The upper extremity exam was notable for bilateral and symmetric Gottron's sign and nail fold erythema (Fig. 2). She also had arthritis along with an ulcerative lesion on her left ankle (Fig. 3). The abdominal exam was notable for hepatosplenomegaly. Nail fold capillaroscopy was moderately abnormal. The patient was admitted to expedite her work up with a broad differential including juvenile dermatomyositis, an overlap syndrome, and autoinflammatory syndromes.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114jsK6t]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-infectious and other infections causing chronic cough in children: Post-viral cough refers to cough after the acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and in the community cough post viral URTIs is likely the most common cause of chronic cough in children. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory illness per person per year ranges from 5.0 to 7.95 in children aged < 4 years to 2.4 to 5.02 in children aged 10 to 14 years. Following URTIs, acute cough typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks but 10% may cough for ≥ 20 to 25 days. In the follow-up of 839 children, 627 (75%) coughed for < 7 days and 171 (20%) for > 28 days, and of those with chronic cough (> 28 days), a new and serious illness was found in the 36 of the 117 children who were clinically reviewed. Other infections such as pertussis and mycoplasma can cause chronic cough, and pertussis should be suspected, especially with known contact even if the child is fully immunized.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114SmMQs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — clinical manifestations in people with HIV include four syndromes: focal pneumonia; diffuse pneumonia; extrathoracic involvement, including meningitis and osteoarticular infection; and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection, and lack of viral suppression with CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3 is associated with increased severity. Focal pneumonia is most common when CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, presenting with cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, while hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, upper lobe infiltrates, nodules, peripheral blood eosinophilia, or rash may point towards coccidioidomycosis, particularly with residence, prior residence, or travel to a known endemic area. Diffuse pneumonia and extrathoracic disease usually occur in more apparently immunocompromised patients; diffuse pulmonary disease presents with fever and dyspnea with a diffuse reticulonodular pattern on chest imaging and may be difficult to distinguish clinically from Pneumocystis pneumonia, and hypoxemia may be severe with serological tests possibly negative early. In meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid profile demonstrates low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and eosinophils may also be present on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

### Not too sick, not too well: reducing the diagnostic void in pediatric emergency medicine [^115qTqWE]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The Phoenix score, with its focus on evidence of organ dysfunction is an important progression in our approach to recognising true sepsis. However to achieve this the Phoenix score requires extensive blood work. In pediatrics the ideal is to avoid the trauma of venepunture wherever possible. We therefore need a way of deciding when organ dysfunction is very unlikely. One model that works well for recognition of the well child is to focus on activity and behaviour. In paediatric practice these features give valuable clinical information about the current metabolic status and end organ function of the child being assessed. While non-specific features such as cough and fever support a process of differential diagnosis (upper or lower respiratory tract infection) the behaviour and actions of the child give important information about the clinical effects of the infection regardless of what the diagnosis is. A child with fever and a cough who is seen to be running around, eating, drinking, playing and chatting is demonstrating metabolic and cardiorespiratory sufficiency. Arguably this supersedes the distinction between upper and lower respiratory infection as a lower respiratory tract infection with minimal clinical effect can be managed conservatively in a similar way to upper respiratory tract infection.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: a pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^112JBmmE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Second podcast:

Radiologist: There is an extensive image of diffuse nodular opacities throughout the parenchyma on chest CT with apparent bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. When considering the potential differential diagnosis of this finding, we must include an inflammatory process with granuloma formation, such as sarcoidosis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; however, a similar interstitial process can also be seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis or in other diffuse lung diseases.
Pulmonologist: Exactly, this is an acute diffuse parenchymal lung disease image. Importantly, the patient worsens clinically and requires constant oxygen therapy. To ascertain the diagnosis, we should perform lung function tests and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. These examinations can provide additional important diagnostic clues, help assess the extent and character of tissue damage, as well as find the infectious agent.
Dermatologists: These skin lesions are not typical and have a broad differential diagnosis, may be a sign of contact allergy, which would also explain blood eosinophilia, but could resemble some skin manifestation of TB or sarcoidosis. To verify this, we should perform a skin biopsy of one of the lesions.
Rheumatologists: From a rheumatological point of view, most of the combined symptoms would suggest vasculitis, the skin biopsy proposed by the dermatology team will help us confirm if this is the case. We would like to exclude EGPA, which although very rare in this age group, could explain the description of the symptoms the patient presents. In case of EGPA, the biopsy should revealing granulomas and ANCA autoantibodies should be positive.

### Suspected pediatric influenza risk-stratification algorithm: a clinical decision tool [^113i66Mp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Influenza causes significant annual burden among children. Current guidelines recommend empiric treatment for a broadly defined group of children at high risk for influenza complications, resulting in overtreatment or costly viral testing. This study creates an algorithm for clinicians to risk stratify children with influenza-like illness (ILI) according to likelihood of influenza infection.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed on 818 children seen in the emergency department from November 2012 to April 2013 for ILI. We reviewed medical records for symptoms, influenza risk factors, and viral assay results. Classification and regression tree analyses were performed separately for children older and younger than 2 years.

Results

In children younger than 2 years, populations likely to test positive were those with an influenza-positive contact, unimmunized children, and those presenting in high-incidence influenza periods. In this subgroup, immunized patients in low-incidence seasons and those with absence of cough are low risk for influenza infection. For children 2 years and older, high-risk populations were unimmunized children, those presenting in high-incidence influenza periods and those with myalgia or absence of diarrhea.

Conclusions

These risk-stratification analyses were summarized into Suspected Pediatric Influenza Risk-Stratification Algorithm (SPIRA). For those in whom influenza infection is likely, clinicians may consider empiric treatment. Conversely, patients whom SPIRA identifies as unlikely to be infected with influenza are candidates for viral testing and targeted treatment. In assessing children with ILI, SPIRA aids clinicians in determining who to test versus treat empirically, saving children from costly viral testing or unnecessary antiviral exposure.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^112sTJrs]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions and diagnosis of pediatric cough

Participants suggested a range of ages to define 'pediatric' cough, most commonly ≤ 18 years (9/18; 50%) or ≤ 16 years (3/18; 17%), with ≤ 10, ≤ 12, ≤ 15, ≤ 17, and ≤ 21 years suggested by 1 participant each (and 1 participant preferred not to say). Definitions provided for acute cough in children ranged from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks (or no specified duration), most commonly < 2 weeks (Fig. 1 a). Definitions for chronic cough in children ranged from > 2 weeks to > 8 weeks, most commonly > 4 weeks/ > 30 days (Fig. 1 b).

Fig. 1
Definitions of acute and chronic pediatric cough according to international experts (n = 18). a Or > 30 days. Questions were open-ended

Almost all participants (17/18; 94%) said that they distinguish between wet/productive and dry cough, for reasons including to help determine the cause and diagnosis, and to inform cough management. One participant said that they do not make this differentiation, since "it is not associated with the cause" of cough.

Regarding clinical guidelines, 11/18 participants (61%) said that their country had national clinical guidelines for the treatment of cough in adults, 12 (67%) said that their country had national clinical guidelines for the treatment of cough in pediatrics, 4 (22%) had no national guidelines, and 1 (6%) did not know if their country had guidelines. Ten of 17 participants (59%) said that they used a guideline for the diagnosis of pediatric cough, and 12 (71%) said that they used a guideline for the treatment of pediatric cough. Specific guidelines were named from the following organizations and countries: American Academy of Pediatrics; American Thoracic Society; Australia's guideline; Austria's guideline; BTS; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; ERS (cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis); Germany's national guideline; Indian Academy of Pediatrics; Malaysia's guideline; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; Serbia's national guideline; Slovenia's "cough in children" guideline; and two reviews from the United States.

He was an avid biker and skier who had noticed a significant decrease in high-level physical activity over the past 3 years. He reported dyspnea, desaturations at altitudes higher than 9,000 feet, dry cough, tachycardia, and palpitations with exercise. Review of systems was also notable for gluten-intolerance, Raynaud's phenomenon, recurrent skin lesions and joint swelling, pain, and stiffness in the areas overlying the jaw, wrists, knees, and ankles (after capsaicin exposure). He denied fever, chills, anorexia, weight loss, hair loss, ocular symptoms, jaw claudication, chest pain, or lower extremity swelling. He had a five pack-year smoking history, no history of prematurity, childhood asthma, recurrent infections, or environmental and occupational exposure. Based on pulmonary function tests from an outside provider, he had received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma and had been prescribed an albuterol inhaler to use on an as-needed basis, which failed to improve his symptoms. He was later prescribed a mometasone-formoterol inhaler, still with no symptomatic improvement.

### Aerodigestive approach to pediatric chronic cough [^117643PU]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined as cough lasting more than 4 weeks in children aged 14 years or older. Normal children, without pathophysiology, can cough up to more than 30 times a day. When cough occurs pathologically, it is often more often and can be divided into specific and nonspecific cough types. Inputs from otolaryngology, pulmonary medicine, and gastroenterology, along with other specialties in an aerodigestive team setting, allow a team approach to consider a wide variety of causes of cough and coordinate diagnostic procedures with treatment.

### Acute urticaria as the initial presentation of COVID-19 in a pediatric patient [^117AZwu7]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous manifestations have been commonly identified with a variety of viral infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial, and adenoviruses. Although uncommonly the presenting symptom, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed multiple associated dermatologic findings, including macular and papular, urticarial, chilblain-like acral, vesicular, livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa-like, and purpuric patterns. The typical presenting symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, headache, ageusia, and anosmia. We report a pediatric patient whose initial presenting symptom of COVID-19 was acute urticaria.

Clinical presentation of tuberculosis in children and adolescents with IBD includes fever, fatigue, weight loss, poor weight gain, night sweats, and persistent, unremitting cough (> 2 weeks), with chest radiographs demonstrating extensive pneumonia and evidence of miliary disease; cavitary lesions and pleural effusions are more likely to occur in teenagers, and receipt of anti-TNFα may also lead to atypical disease manifestations. Pediatric and adult patients with IBD may be more likely to present with disseminated or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary disease may present with lymph node, spleen, CNS, or skeletal involvement.

### Recurrent-associated reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption responsive to systemic steroids: a case series [^116AmMHY]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance has worked toward creating pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of severe mucocutaneous eruptions, as case definitions are taken from the adult literature without widely accepted pediatric criteria. The proposed reclassification categories are: epidermal necrolysis, which includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis due to their similar etiology and management; erythema multiforme, without major or minor forms; and a new term, reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME), to encompass diverse parainfectious eruptions, including Mycoplasma -induced rash and mucositis. Cases that are considered RIME under this categorization are usually characterized by a severe mucositis of 2 or more mucous membranes, with a prodrome that usually includes a cough.

Cases that fall within the RIME category tend to be single occurrences in most patients. However, there is a subset of patients with recurrent episodes estimated to be about 8% in a systematic review of cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae –associated mucocutaneous disease. However, recurrent episodes have not been well-characterized, especially among pediatric patients. In this case series, to raise awareness of this unique subset of cases, we describe recurrent cases of RIME due to M. pneumoniae in 3 adolescent patients. In the setting of no standard therapy for RIME, we were able to successfully treat the episodes in all 3 cases with systemic steroids.

### Guidelines for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of dengue, chikungunya, and zika [^1133pgtw]. PAHO (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dengue, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis (arbovirus infections), PAHO/WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize clinical manifestations of different arbovirus infections to help differentiate them:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Dengue|- Findings that help in differentiation - thrombocytopenia, progressive increase in hematocrit, leukopenia <br/> - Findings that probably help in differentiation - anorexia or hyporexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills, hemorrhages, including bleeding on the skin, mucous membranes, or both <br/> - Findings that may help in differentiation - retro-ocular pain, hepatomegaly, headache, diarrhea, dysgeusia, cough, elevated transaminases, positive tourniquet test|
|Chikungunya|- Findings that help in differentiation - arthralgias <br/> - Findings that probably help in differentiation - eruption, conjunctivitis, arthritis, myalgias, bone pain <br/> - Findings that may help in differentiation - hemorrhages, including bleeding on the skin, mucous membranes, or both|
|Zika|- Findings that help in differentiation - pruritus <br/> - Findings that probably help in differentiation - eruption, conjunctivitis <br/> - Findings that may help in differentiation - lymphadenopathies, pharyngitis, odynophagia|

### Chronic cough in children [^113uXYCn]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic cough is a common complaint among pediatric patients, but little information exists on the types of diagnoses in these patients and therapeutic outcomes.

Objective

To characterize pediatric patients with chronic cough presenting to otolaryngology clinics, identify common causes and treatments, and evaluate therapeutic outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective analysis, all medical records for pediatric patients seen at 2 otolaryngology clinics at a single tertiary care academic medical center from January 2009 through June 2013 were searched for relevant diagnostic codes. Patients younger than 18 years presenting with chronic cough (cough of > 4 weeks' duration) were selected for study; 58 patients met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis.

Interventions

Each patient was evaluated by the clinician via history, physical examination, and various tests and procedures, depending on the individual case, including flexible laryngoscopy, imaging tests, and/or airway evaluations. Each patient underwent treatment based on the working diagnosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included final diagnosis, response to treatment (as indicated by resolution of cough after initial therapy), and diagnostic workup undergone.

Results

Among the 58 included patients, the 3 most common diagnoses were related to infection (n = 23; 34%), airway hyperreactivity (n = 14; 24%), or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 14; 24%). Initial response to treatment was observed in 83% of patients (n = 48), while the remaining 17% (n = 10) required further evaluation. All 10 patients for whom initial treatment failed (100%) had a diagnosis involving airway hyperreactivity (P < .001). In addition, chest radiography was more likely to be ordered (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% CI, 1.91–140.8; p = 0.002) and to contain pertinent positive findings (OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 1.15–142.6; p = 0.04) in patients for whom treatment failed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic cough in the pediatric otolaryngology setting differs from the typical presentation in the primary care setting. The top 3 causes encountered by the practicing otolaryngologist in a pediatric patient are infection, airway hyperreactivity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. If initial otolaryngologic treatment fails, chest radiography and early pulmonary consult are recommended.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^112hWkJg]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Scarlet Fever Scarlet fever is diagnosed in 10% of children presenting with streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. 8 It is caused by certain strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci that release a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. Patients who have a hypersensitivity to the toxin may develop the characteristic rash associated with scarlet fever. Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. Red strawberry tongue occurs after desquamation of the white coating.

After several weeks, the rash fades and is followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the face, in skin-folds, and on the hands and feet, potentially lasting four to six weeks. 9 With a sensitivity of 90% to 95%, throat culture is the first-choice method for diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection, but this is not always practical. 8 Rapid antigen tests are routinely used in clinicians' offices and have a sensitivity of approximately 86%. 10 Cultures may be ordered when the suspicion for group A streptococcal infection is high, but the rapid antigen test result is negative. 11 Penicillin is the therapy of choice for streptococcal infection. Those allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins may be treated with oral macrolides or clindamycin.
10. The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is made clinically.

The condition is self-limited, but clinicians should advise parents to use gentle skin care products on the patient and that lesions may last for months or up to two to four years. Treatment options, including cryotherapy, imiquimod, and intralesional immunotherapy, are available if physical appearance is a concern. Dermatitis requires treatment to resolve pruritus and limit spread of the molluscum. 14.

### Diffuse erythema with… [^117WjRbe]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Evaluating the patient who presents with fever and a rash can be challenging because the differential diagnosis is extensive and includes minor and life-threatening illnesses. In addition, the clinical picture can vary considerably, and the family physician may need to quickly decide about initiating empiric therapy or isolation. This article reviews common diagnoses for fever and a rash and suggests a logical approach to obtaining the correct diagnosis. 1–3. Physical Examination The physician should identify the primary lesion but also note the presence of secondary lesions. Important features include the distribution, configuration and arrangement of the lesions. 2 In addition to evaluating the patient's vital signs and general appearance, the physician should look for the following: signs of toxicity, adenopathy, oral, genital or conjunctival lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, evidence of excoriations or tenderness, and signs of nuchal rigidity or neurologic dysfunction.

In some patients, the typical prodrome of cough, headache, sore throat, nausea and vomiting may be of short duration. Patients with acute meningococcemia appear ill and usually present with a characteristic petechial rash, a high, spiking fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and mild hypotension. In the early stages of disease, the rash may be maculopapular. 14 Signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation may be helpful, given that up to 88 percent 1 of patients with meningococcemia develop meningitis. 1, 13–15. 4 Included in the differential diagnosis of petechial rash are disseminated gonococcal infections, bacteremia, staphylococcemia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Diffuse Erythema with Desquamation SCARLET FEVER Scarlet fever provides the classic example of an erythematous rash with subsequent desquamation.

Most common between one and 10 years of age, 18 scarlet fever usually follows an acute infection of the tonsils or skin by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci that produce an erythrogenic exotoxin. 2 Patients may appear acutely ill and have fever, sore throat, headache, chills, nausea and vomiting. 1, 18. Complications are unusual in immunocompetent patients. In children, the most common complication is secondary bacterial infection of excoriated lesions. 7.
