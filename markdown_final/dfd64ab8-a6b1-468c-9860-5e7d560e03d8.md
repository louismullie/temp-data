## Question

Can you explain what a choroid cyst is?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of what a "choroid cyst" is, with clarification of terminology and a stepwise review of definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical significance in prenatal and symptomatic settings, diagnostic approach, management, and a brief ocular note as appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology because "choroid cyst" can mean different things. Then, I should define choroid plexus cysts precisely and distinguish them from tumors. Next, I will review prevalence and natural history, followed by mechanisms and when they matter clinically. After that, I should appraise prenatal counseling and aneuploidy risk, then symptomatic cases and neurosurgical management. Finally, I will cover diagnostic workflows, summarize management principles, and briefly note ocular choroidal cysts so we don't conflate entities [^111iisVz] [^116f6cwL] [^114oncTW] [^116eE7Xn].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we don't talk past each other. The phrase "choroid cyst" is ambiguous and can refer either to a choroid plexus cyst within the cerebral ventricles or, much less commonly in general medical conversation, to an ocular choroidal lesion in the eye's choroid layer, which is a completely different compartment and problem set; given the neurologic emphasis of the evidence base here, I will focus on choroid plexus cysts and only briefly note ocular lesions to avoid conflation, since management and implications differ substantially [^111iisVz] [^112QViiR] [^1155QzEs].

> Definition next: a choroid plexus cyst is a CSF-like fluid collection arising from abnormal folding or invagination of choroid plexus epithelium within the ventricular system, distinct from neoplasms such as choroid plexus papilloma or carcinoma, which are true tumors with different histopathology, clinical behavior, and treatment paradigms; I need to ensure I state clearly that CPCs are typically benign variants unless they obstruct CSF flow, whereas tumors show proliferative pathology and can drive CSF overproduction or seeding [^111iisVz] [^116x2XAe] [^114uywGi] [^116umhvQ].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I generalize: on second-trimester obstetric ultrasound, CPCs are identified in roughly 1.0–1.2% of pregnancies overall, with about 1.0% in women under 35, and most resolve or remain clinically insignificant; in adults, improved detection on ultra–high-field MRI has highlighted that small CPCs are not rare incidental findings, especially as 7T MRI delineates choroid plexus microstructure more clearly [^117UhmQY] [^116f6cwL] [^115q6Caf] [^111FcDuk].

> I will now examine plausible mechanisms and why they usually do not matter clinically but sometimes do: most CPCs represent benign invaginations or degenerative microcysts within the choroid plexus stroma, but when a cyst enlarges or migrates near a critical foramen, it can obstruct CSF pathways such as the foramen of Monro or aqueduct, causing acute or intermittent hydrocephalus; emerging 7T MRI data also suggest CPCs may be a morphological signature of broader choroid plexus degeneration with aging and neurodegeneration, which I should discuss cautiously as hypothesis-generating rather than deterministic [^111iisVz] [^112MoLdb] [^115q6Caf].

> Next, I should review the prenatal context carefully because counseling hinges on whether the CPC is isolated: isolated CPCs, in the absence of other sonographic anomalies or abnormal screening, are associated with normal fetal neurobehavior and normal child developmental outcomes, with high spontaneous resolution rates, so reassurance is appropriate; however, if additional ultrasound markers or abnormal serum screens are present, aneuploidy risk rises and genetic counseling with possible diagnostic testing is warranted [^114atrxB] [^113RLEFW] [^114RAv6c] [^115Cmyaz] [^113DbRv1].

> Hold on, I should verify the aneuploidy risk framing and not jump to conclusions: while some referral cohorts report nonzero likelihood ratios for trisomy 18 with isolated CPCs, in low-risk women under 35 the observed incidence of trisomy 18 with isolated CPC is effectively 0% in meta-analyses, supporting avoidance of routine amniocentesis when CPCs are truly isolated; individualized risk counseling using prior risk multiplied by the likelihood ratio is superior to applying a crude average risk, which helps align decisions with a patient's baseline [^117UhmQY] [^116f6cwL] [^114oncTW].

> For symptomatic CPCs postnatally, I need to ensure I outline presentation and management precisely: when a CPC obstructs CSF outflow, patients can present with headache, vomiting, papilledema, memory impairment, or altered mental status, often due to blockage at the foramen of Monro or third ventricle, and minimally invasive endoscopic fenestration or cauterization is typically preferred to restore CSF flow, with excellent outcomes and low need for permanent diversion; I should also remember that intermittent obstruction can occur in infants and that targeted MRI sequences can reveal mobile cysts [^111iisVz] [^112MoLdb] [^113hFhtf] [^116eE7Xn] [^1174FWhW].

> But wait, what about broader brain health associations in aging and Alzheimer's disease; let me reconsider how strong these links are: 7T MRI studies report a higher number and size of CPCs and larger choroid plexus volume in Alzheimer's disease compared with controls and other neurodegenerative conditions, with a multicystic "grape-sign" proposed as an auxiliary imaging marker; mechanistically, the choroid plexus is central to Aβ clearance and shows Aβ and tau deposition, yet these observations are associative and should not be over-interpreted as causal at the individual patient level [^115q6Caf] [^111FcDuk] [^117FjwNL].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach across scenarios: in prenatal care, CPCs are usually detected on routine mid-trimester ultrasound, followed by a careful anatomic survey to confirm isolation and, when indicated, individualized risk counseling or fetal MRI for characterization; in symptomatic or incidental postnatal settings, CT or MRI establishes size and location, with ultra–high-field MRI providing fine structural detail, and in select fetal posterior fossa differentials, the position of choroid plexus and the taenia–tela choroidea complex can help distinguish Dandy–Walker malformation from Blake's pouch cyst on MRI [^114oncTW] [^115q6Caf] [^1163KoPN].

> Management principles next, and I need to ensure I do not over-treat: for isolated prenatal CPCs in low-risk patients, provide reassurance, avoid routine invasive testing, and consider serial ultrasounds to document resolution; for non-isolated CPCs or elevated baseline risk, offer genetic counseling and diagnostic testing; for symptomatic intraventricular CPCs, obtain neurosurgical input and favor endoscopic fenestration or ablation to re-establish CSF flow, reserving shunting for refractory cases, with postoperative imaging to confirm decompression [^116f6cwL] [^113DbRv1] [^114oncTW] [^116eE7Xn] [^112MoLdb] [^113hFhtf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated entities near the choroidal fissure with true choroid plexus cysts; I should clarify that choroidal fissure cysts are separate, generally incidental lesions that only rarely enlarge to cause symptoms and, when they do, fenestration yields good outcomes, which underscores the importance of precise neuroanatomical localization on imaging before assigning causality for symptoms [^111DnhrR].

> Finally, a brief ocular note so I don't leave ambiguity: ocular choroidal lesions, including atypical choroidal nevi with secondary vascular activity, are managed by ophthalmology with observation or intravitreal therapies when indicated, and their pathophysiology and implications are completely distinct from intraventricular choroid plexus cysts, so counseling and referrals should follow the appropriate specialty pathway [^112QViiR] [^1155QzEs].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that choroid plexus cysts are common, usually benign developmental variants detected prenatally or incidentally, with excellent outcomes when isolated and a low aneuploidy risk that warrants individualized counseling rather than reflexive invasive testing, while the rare symptomatic cases cause obstructive hydrocephalus that respond well to endoscopic decompression; emerging 7T MRI data link CPC burden with choroid plexus changes in aging and Alzheimer's disease, but clinical application remains adjunctive rather than determinative at this time [^116f6cwL] [^114oncTW] [^116eE7Xn] [^115q6Caf].

A choroid cyst, more accurately a **choroid plexus cyst (CPC)**, is a benign, fluid-filled cyst within the choroid plexus of the brain's ventricles [^116eE7Xn]. CPCs are most often detected incidentally on prenatal ultrasound or MRI [^115Cmyaz], typically in the lateral ventricles [^116eE7Xn], and are usually **asymptomatic and self-resolving** [^114atrxB]. Isolated CPCs in fetuses with normal karyotypes are not associated with neurodevelopmental impairment [^113RLEFW] or increased risk of aneuploidy [^116f6cwL], so **no intervention is needed** [^113DbRv1]. Rarely, large or obstructive cysts can cause hydrocephalus [^111iisVz] or neurological symptoms, in which case endoscopic fenestration or cyst removal is considered [^113hFhtf] [^112MoLdb]. The **prognosis is excellent** for isolated CPCs, and routine follow-up is generally unnecessary [^114RAv6c].

---

## Anatomical location and structure

Choroid plexus cysts are most commonly located in the **lateral ventricles**, particularly in the atrium or trigone region, and can also occur in the third and fourth ventricles, though less frequently [^116eE7Xn]. Histologically, CPCs are lined by a **single layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells**, similar to normal choroid plexus epithelium; the cyst wall contains fibrovascular tissue, and the cystic cavity is filled with clear, proteinaceous fluid [^111iisVz].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Most CPCs are **asymptomatic**, discovered incidentally on prenatal ultrasound or MRI, and typically resolve spontaneously without causing symptoms [^114RAv6c]. Rarely, they enlarge or **obstruct cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow**, leading to hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure; symptoms may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological deficits [^1174FWhW] [^111iisVz] [^113hFhtf].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Prenatal ultrasound**: CPCs are commonly detected during routine second-trimester prenatal ultrasounds. They appear as hypoechoic (dark) lesions within the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles [^116f6cwL].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: MRI provides detailed imaging of CPCs, confirming their location, size, and relationship to surrounding brain structures [^115Cmyaz]. MRI is particularly useful in symptomatic cases or when additional anomalies are suspected [^116eE7Xn].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: CT scans can also identify CPCs, especially in acute settings where rapid imaging is required [^113hFhtf].

---

## Associated conditions and complications

CPCs have been associated with chromosomal abnormalities, particularly **trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)** [^117UhmQY]; however, isolated CPCs (without other anomalies) are generally considered benign and not indicative of chromosomal abnormalities [^113DbRv1] [^114oncTW]. Rarely, large CPCs can obstruct CSF flow, leading to **hydrocephalus** and increased intracranial pressure [^111iisVz] [^113hFhtf].

---

## Treatment and management

Most CPCs are **managed conservatively** with observation and follow-up imaging, as they typically resolve spontaneously without intervention [^116eE7Xn]. When hydrocephalus or significant neurological symptoms are present, **endoscopic fenestration or cyst removal** is the preferred approach, effectively relieving symptoms and restoring normal CSF flow [^113hFhtf] [^112MoLdb].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** [^114RAv6c]. Isolated CPCs typically resolve spontaneously without causing long-term neurological or developmental issues [^113RLEFW]. Even in symptomatic cases requiring surgical intervention, outcomes are generally favorable, with successful resolution of symptoms and minimal risk of recurrence [^116eE7Xn].

Choroid plexus cysts are benign, fluid-filled structures within the brain's ventricles, typically asymptomatic and resolving spontaneously. They are usually detected incidentally during prenatal imaging, and isolated CPCs do not indicate chromosomal abnormalities or developmental issues [^116f6cwL] [^113RLEFW]. Rare symptomatic cases may require surgical intervention, but the **overall prognosis is excellent** [^113hFhtf] [^114RAv6c].

### Choroid plexus cysts do not affect fetal neurodevelopment [^114atrxB]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether an isolated finding of a choroid plexus cyst (CPC) during routine ultrasound is associated with altered fetal growth or development.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective, case-control study comparing 35 CPC cases to 67 controls. Neurobehavioral development assessment included 50-minute long serial recordings of heart rate, motor activity, and their interrelation at 24, 28, 32, and 36 weeks of gestation. Growth measurement was based on three ultrasound evaluations of femur length, biparietal diameter, head circumference, and abdominal circumference at the initial exam, 28 weeks, and 36 weeks.

- **Results**: Longitudinal analyses revealed no differences in fetal heart rate, variability, or accelerations; the number or duration of fetal movements; or total motor activity; nor fetal movement-fetal heart rate coupling. CPC cases had slightly smaller head and abdominal circumferences at 28 weeks, but these differences had disappeared by 36 weeks. CPC detection was more common when routine exams were conducted earlier (18.8 versus 19.5 weeks; P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Despite the presumption that CPCs with normal karyotypes are benign variants, little empirical support exists. These results indicate that CPCs detected by prenatal ultrasound do not pose or reveal a threat to fetal development.

### Isolated prenatal choroid plexus cysts do not affect child development [^113RLEFW]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

To examine the effect of isolated prenatal choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) on child cognitive, behavioral, motor, and autonomic development at 18 months of age, a prospective design was implemented to identify CPC cases and controls in mid-pregnancy. Cases (n = 25) and controls (n = 45) participated in a follow-up visit when children were 18 months of age.

Child mental and motor development was assessed using standard developmental assessments. Socioemotional and behavioral functioning during testing was rated by examiners, and accelerometers provided measures of motor activity and energy expenditure. Cardiac patterns were collected using a three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and quantified as indicators of autonomic control of the heart, including vagal tone.

No significant differences were found in any outcome measure between children with prenatal CPC detection and those without. Findings should provide reassurance to practitioners and parents that isolated CPCs in fetuses with normal karyotypes do not affect child development after birth.

### Acute hydrocephalus secondary to obstruction of the foramen of Monro and cerebral aqueduct caused by a choroid plexus cyst in the lateral ventricle. Case report [^111iisVz]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus cysts are common and typically asymptomatic abnormal folds of the epithelial lining of the choroid plexus. Rarely, these cysts may gradually enlarge and cause outflow obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid. The authors present a case of a large choroid plexus cyst causing acute hydrocephalus in a previously healthy 2-year-old boy. The patient presented with markedly declining mental status, vomiting, and bradycardia over the course of several hours. Computed tomography scans demonstrated enlarged lateral and third ventricles with sulcal effacement, but no obvious mass lesions or hemorrhage. There was no antecedent illness or trauma. A right frontal external ventricular drain was placed in the patient, resulting in decompression of only the right lateral ventricle. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a lobulated cyst arising from the choroid plexus of the left lateral ventricle and herniating through the foramen of Monro into the third ventricle, occluding both the foramen of Monro and the cerebral aqueduct. The patient underwent an endoscopic fenestration of the cyst, and histological results confirmed that it was a choroid plexus cyst. Postoperative MR imaging showed a marked reduction in the cyst size. The cyst was no longer in the third ventricle, the foramen of Monro and the aqueduct were patent, and the ventricles were decompressed. The patient was discharged home with no deficits. To the authors' knowledge, there are no previous reports of a choroid plexus cyst causing acute hydrocephalus due to herniation into the third ventricle.

### Isolated choroid plexus cyst or echogenic cardiac focus on prenatal ultrasound: Is genetic amniocentesis indicated [^113DbRv1]? American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic amniocentesis is warranted when isolated choroid plexus cysts (CPC) or echogenic cardiac foci (EF) are noted on prenatal ultrasound.

- **Study design**: We performed a retrospective analysis on patients from our perinatal database. All obstetric patients with CPC or EF noted on second-trimester perinatology ultrasound from April 1998 to November 2004 were included. Information regarding ultrasound findings and neonatal outcome were analyzed.

- **Results**: During the study period, 515 patients with CPC or EF were evaluated. Of these, 429 (83.3%) had isolated CPC or EF, and 86 (16.7%) had additional risk factors. The incidence of abnormal karyotype was 0% versus 2.3%, respectively (P = 0.03). The additional risk factors considered were advanced maternal age, abnormal serum triple marker screening, and/or other abnormal ultrasound findings. Furthermore, during the study period there were 20,122 live births and 27 (0.1%) cases of aneuploidy diagnosed postnatally. Of these, none had isolated CPC or EF on prenatal ultrasound.

- **Conclusion**: CPC or EF noted on prenatal ultrasound warrants referral for careful consultative ultrasound evaluation. In the absence of other risk factors, however, genetic amniocentesis for isolated CPC or EF does not appear to be necessary.

### Endoscopic treatment of a third ventricle choroid plexus cyst [^113hFhtf]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus cysts are common benign intraventricular lesions that infrequently cause symptoms, typically manifesting as obstructive hydrocephalus. Symptomatic cases are even less prevalent in the adult population. When treatment is necessary, the goal is to reestablish cerebrospinal fluid flow without the need for cyst resection. Endoscopic exploration of the ventricles followed by cyst ablation is the preferred treatment for these lesions.

Herein, we present the case of a 25-year-old female patient with a 3-week history of intermittent headaches. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head detected supratentorial hydrocephalus and enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a homogeneous cystic lesion in the third ventricle. A right-sided, pre-coronal burr hole was performed, followed by endoscopic exploration of the ventricular system. A third-ventriculostomy was conducted. With the aid of a 30-degree endoscope, a cyst arising from the choroid plexus was visualized along the posterior portion of the third ventricle, obstructing the aqueduct opening. The cyst was cauterized until significant reduction in size was achieved, liberating the aqueduct opening.

Postoperative recovery proceeded without incident, and resolution of the hydrocephalus was confirmed by CT imaging. The patient reports complete relief of headaches and has been followed uneventfully since surgery. The video can be found here: http://youtu.be/XBtj_SqY07Q.

### Choroid plexus cysts on 7T MRI: Relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases [^115q6Caf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In the present study, we analyzed the relationships between choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) and neurodegeneration using 7T MRI. The presence and number of CPCs were higher in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group than in the older control (OC), unmatched elderly (UE), and Parkinson's disease (PD) groups. Furthermore, CPC number and diameter were associated with choroid plexus volume (CPV). We termed the multicystic presentation of the CPCs as the "grape-sign of the choroid plexus", which may serve as an auxiliary marker of AD.

The OC group had a higher prevalence of CPCs than the young control (YC) group, although the statistical significance was only marginal. As mentioned above, the choroid plexus undergoes significant microstructural changes during aging, affected by various factors such as vascular damage, inflammation, and pathological substances. Of interest, vacuole formation is a typical response of the choroid plexus to toxicants, which is a possible reason for cyst formation. Some researchers inferred that desquamation of epithelial cells may fall into the stroma of the choroid plexus, leading to the formation of cysts. Therefore, CPCs may be a morphological feature of overall choroid plexus degeneration.

Patients with AD had significantly more CPCs than OCs, as well as patients with PD and UE. This discovery likely reflects a unique connection between AD pathology and CPC formation. It is well known that the choroid plexus is involved in the production and clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain. Several Aβ transporter proteins are localized in the choroid plexus epithelium, leading to a 10-fold increase in Aβ transport efficiency compared to transport across the blood–brain barrier. In pathology studies, both Aβ and tau deposited in the choroid plexus, triggering a series of pathological responses.

### Human intrinsic choroidal neurons do not alter the expression of intrinsic markers in response to pressure [^116a1bMt]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

The choroid is densely innervated by all parts of the autonomic nervous system and further harbors a network of local nerve cells, the intrinsic choroidal neurons (ICN). Their function in ocular control is currently unknown. While morphological data assume a role in intraocular pressure regulation, this study tests whether increased pressure on isolated choroids may activate ICN.

- **Methods**: Donor tissue was transferred into a pressurisable tissue culture chamber, and nasal and temporal choroid halves were incubated for 1 or 4 hours, with pressures set to 15 or 50 mm Hg. This was followed by qRT-PCR expression analysis of the ICN-specific markers VIP, UCN, NOS1, and UCH-L1. POL2-normalized data in the different pressure settings, incubation times, and localizations were statistically analyzed.

- **Results**: The presence of the ICN-specific markers VIP, UCN, NOS1, and UCH-L1 was confirmed using immunohistochemistry, and mRNA of all markers was detected in all experimental conditions. Marker analysis revealed no significant changes in mRNA expression levels between 15 and 50 mm Hg across different incubation times. When comparing all samples over all experimental conditions, a significant increase of VIP and NOS1 mRNA was detected in temporal versus nasal choroids.

- **Conclusion**: In this functional analysis of human ICN in vitro, higher amounts of VIP and NOS1 mRNA were detected in the temporal choroid, which is the choroidal site with ICN accumulation. Further, the data indicate that elevated pressure is apparently not able to trigger ICN responses via the investigated markers.

### Women's response to fetal choroid plexus cysts detected by prenatal ultrasound [^112J7g61]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

To determine maternal responses to the detection of a minor structural variant, the choroid plexus cyst (CPC), in their fetus on prenatal ultrasound, a study was conducted where 34 pregnant women with an isolated CPC identified during a mid-pregnancy ultrasound were interviewed. The interviews focused on their objective experience at diagnosis, emotional response, and subsequent reactions. Audiotaped and transcribed responses were evaluated by two independent raters and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively.

All participants reported negative emotional responses such as shock, distress, fear, and decreased attachment, despite 82% of providers counseling that the CPC was probably benign. Three women underwent amniocentesis purely for reassurance after CPC detection. Notably, 79% of the women sought additional information beyond what their physician provided, frequently turning to the internet. Half of the women noted that their intense negative responses were temporary; however, weeks after diagnosis, 62% continued to believe that the CPC posed some danger to their baby.

Detection of CPC prenatally can evoke profound and negative maternal emotional responses despite accurate provider counseling. Practitioners should consider these responses when counseling parents about these and other structural variants of unclear functional significance.

### Rapidly growing, multifocal, benign choroid plexus tumor in an infant: Case report [^116x2XAe]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are rare, benign tumors that can arise in young children. Most pediatric patients present with signs of hydrocephalus and require immediate treatment. The natural history of choroid plexus tumors in children without hydrocephalus is poorly defined. In this report, the authors present the very rare case of a child without hydrocephalus but with two intraventricular choroid plexus tumors discovered shortly after birth. Initial imaging had been performed for seizures and showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and enhancing tumors in the third and left lateral ventricles. Sequential imaging demonstrated rapid growth of both tumors.

The lateral tumor was removed when the child was 3 months of age. A histological examination of the specimen showed benign features with an elevated mitotic rate. Given the patient's age of under 3 years, the diagnosis was WHO grade I CPP. The third ventricle tumor grew rapidly. A second surgery was performed, and this tumor was resected. Again, the pathological diagnosis was WHO grade I CPP. The authors present this rare case and discuss the relevant literature.

### Progressive symptomatic increase in the size of choroidal fissure cysts [^111DnhrR]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Cysts of the choroidal fissure are often incidentally identified, with symptoms appearing to be exceedingly rare. Herein, the authors report a case series of symptomatic enlargement of choroidal fissure cysts that were surgically treated. Although cysts of the choroidal fissure do not normally become symptomatic, neurosurgeons should be aware of such a complication. Based on the authors' experience, surgical fenestration of such cysts yields good long-term results.

### Epigenetics impacts upon prognosis and clinical management of choroid plexus tumors [^114TM9nP]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus tumors comprise choroid plexus papilloma (CPP, WHO grade I), atypical choroid plexus papilloma (aCPP, WHO grade II), and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC, WHO grade III). Molecular events driving the majority of choroid plexus tumors remain poorly understood; however, recent DNA methylation profiling has revealed different epigenetic subgroups.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of epigenetic profiles of choroid plexus tumors was conducted in the context of histopathological, genetic, and clinical features. DNA methylation profiling segregates these tumors into three distinct epigenetic subgroups: supratentorial pediatric low-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP), infratentorial adult low-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP), and supratentorial pediatric high-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP, aCPP, and CPC). Epigenetic subgrouping provides additional prognostic information in comparison to histopathological grading.

- **Conclusions**: Epigenetic profiling of choroid plexus tumors can be used for the identification of patients at risk of recurrence and is expected to play a role in treatment stratification and patient management in the context of future clinical trials.

### Subventricular zone microstructure in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis [^115fVAAq]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

To better explore the possible mechanisms occurring in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the thalamus, we evaluated their association with choroid plexus volume. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whose composition is mainly determined by the choroid plexus secretome, is a major source of proteins and smaller molecules that signal the SVZ. Notably, inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide injection, have been demonstrated to determine acute and transient changes in the choroid plexus transcriptome, affecting CSF composition. Such alterations may transiently impact the SVZ niche population, as observed in developmental studies where maternal peripheral inflammation influenced fetal ventricular zone proliferation and cortical layer formation.

Interestingly, while we observed a significant association between choroid plexus volume and thalamic fractional anisotropy (FA) both in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and adults with pediatric-onset MS, an association with SVZ FA was found only in the pediatric MS cohort. It is tempting to speculate that heterogeneous pathophysiological processes may occur in these two regions. In the thalamus, the chronic pro-inflammatory state associated with choroid plexus enlargement and CSF may be associated with gradual and progressive thalamic demyelination and neuro-axonal damage. At the level of the SVZ, the bout of inflammation observed in the first phases of the disease and characterized by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CSF may initially trigger proliferation and migration of progenitor cells. This is supported by the evidence of a significant association between higher SVZ FA and higher choroid plexus volume.

### Choroid plexus cysts on 7T MRI: Relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases [^111FcDuk]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

The choroid plexus (CP) may play a crucial role in brain degeneration as we aim to assess whether CP cysts (CPCs), defined using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relate to aging and neurodegeneration.

- **Methods**: We used multi-sequence 7T MRI to observe CPCs, characterizing their presence and characteristics in healthy younger controls, healthy older controls (OCs), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and uremic encephalopathy. CP volume (CPV) and CPC characteristics were compared across groups, and associations between CPV and CPC features were analyzed across all subjects.

- **Results**: The AD group showed a significantly higher presence and number of CPCs compared to other groups, and also had a significantly larger CPV than healthy OCs. The number and size of CPCs were associated with CPV.

- **Discussion**: 7T MRI offers a distinct advantage in observing CPCs, and the high prevalence of CPCs in patients with AD warrants further investigation.

- **Highlights**: 7T MRI enables visualization of the fine structures of the choroid plexus. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a higher number of choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) compared to healthy older adults and other patient groups. CPCs may serve as an auxiliary marker for AD.

### Seizures and disturbed brain potassium dynamics in the leukodystrophy megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts [^115VRanF]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

To check whether intrinsic neuronal properties in other brain regions are similarly unaffected in MLC mice, we performed an additional set of patch-clamp recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1). Similar to the hippocampus, we observed no differences in passive and active neuronal properties, nor in responses to prolonged injections that could explain hyperexcitability in MLC mice (data not shown).

Taken together, these results show that the intrinsic excitability of principal neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex is largely unchanged in MLC mice and cannot account for the observed interictal activity and decreased seizure threshold.

### Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals transcriptional changes of human choroidal and retinal pigment epithelium cells during fetal development, in healthy adult and intermediate age-related macular degeneration [^1149RnN7]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023).

Human choroidal melanocytes are responsible for choroidal pigmentation: they absorb light, regulate free radical production, and modulate inflammation. It was long believed that melanocytes migrate to the choroid in the third trimester during primate development. However, research conducted in mice has indicated that melanocytes arise from melanoblasts, which differentiate within the developing neural crest-derived mesenchyme that envelops the optic cup and invade the choroid much earlier in development than previously thought. Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor (MITF), a master regulator of melanocyte development, is expressed at high levels in melanoblasts as they differentiate into melanocytes. The high expression of this transcription factor, alongside other pigmentation markers such as PMEL and TYRP1, demonstrates the presence of differentiating melanoblasts as early as 12 PCW of human choroid development. The expression of these markers increases significantly and gradually in the melanocyte clusters from 12 to 21 PCW, suggesting a continuous process of terminal differentiation.

Pericytes are a heterogeneous population of cells located in the blood vessel wall. While in the retina the ratio of CECs to pericytes is 1:1, in the choroid the ratio of CECs to pericytes is approximately 50% of that observed in the other eye microcirculations. Importantly, the retinal pericytes are highly immunosuppressive, and they protect CECs from inflammation-mediated apoptosis.

### Is choroid plexus growth altered in isolated ventriculomegaly on fetal neuro-ultrasound [^116KEbpq]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The study included 224 normal fetuses, with an equal number of left and right choroid plexus (CP) cases (224 each). However, 58 CP cases were excluded due to poor image quality. Ultimately, the control group consisted of 390 CP cases (199 left CP and 191 right CP) from 218 normal fetuses. The study group consisted of 114 fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly (VM), all exhibiting high image quality. This included 89 fetuses with unilateral isolated VM (58 left CP, 31 right CP) and 25 fetuses with bilateral isolated VM (25 left CP, 25 right CP). Ultimately, the study group consisted of a total of 139 CP cases.

The choroid plexus volume (CPV) and atrial width measurements showed excellent agreement between the two sonographers. The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for CPV measurements was 0.84 (p = 0.05). All fetuses were delivered without any complications, and their Apgar scores fell within the normal range.

- **Maternal and fetal characteristics**: The study involved 139 CP cases from the study group and 390 CP cases from the control group.

### Treatment of vascular activity secondary to atypical choroidal nevus using intravitreal bevacizumab [^112QViiR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

To report the optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of 27 eyes treated with intravitreal bevacizumab for intraretinal and subretinal vascular activity associated with atypical choroidal nevi, a study was conducted. This was an Internal Review Board-approved retrospective review of 27 eyes of 27 patients with choroidal nevus treated for secondary vascular activity with intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, performed by a single surgeon (TGM) at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. All patients were rigorously evaluated before the procedure and followed thereafter with ophthalmic examinations, refractive analysis, fundus photos, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and ocular echography. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, dates of bevacizumab injections, and spectral-domain (SD)-OCT findings at each injection were recorded. Macular edema was graded as per SD-OCT findings for the initial and final visit.

The mean age was 66.6 years (range, 40–86 years), including ten males and 17 females. The mean, median, and range baseline best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were 20/53, 20/40, and 20/20–4/200, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 29 months, the final BCVA mean, median, and range were 20/50, 20/40, and 20/20–20/400, respectively. The final BCVA ranged from 20/20 to 20/25 in nine eyes, while only six eyes had an initial BCVA within the same range. All patients demonstrated OCT findings of vascular activity suggestive of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Initial SD-OCT findings included intraretinal cysts in eleven eyes and intraretinal fluid in six eyes.

### Choroidal melanoma metastatic to the contralateral choroid [^116yF9Kh]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to report a case of metastasis of choroidal melanoma to the contralateral choroid.

- **Methods**: An interventional case report was conducted on a 49-year-old Caucasian female. A primary choroidal melanoma in the left eye was diagnosed and treated with Ruthenium-106 plaque radiotherapy. The choroidal melanoma displayed excellent regression, with the flattening of the mass and adjacent chorioretinal atrophy.

- **Results**: Fifteen years following brachytherapy for the choroidal melanoma in the left eye, the patient developed a metastatic melanoma in the contralateral choroid, marking the first sign of metastasis. There was no history of oculo(dermal) melanocytosis or cutaneous melanoma. Systemic evaluation revealed multiple metastases confined to the liver.

- **Conclusion**: Metastasis to the contralateral choroid can be the initial sign of metastasis from choroidal melanoma.

### Histopathological examination of Acanthamoeba sclerokeratitis [^116Q3GpQ]. Clinical ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Several cases of Acanthamoeba sclerokeratitis (ASK) have been reported, with enucleation occurring in 5 out of 11 cases. Histopathological evaluations indicated that cysts of Acanthamoeba were observed in the scleral region in only two eyes. Dougherty et al. reported that these cysts were associated with inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes deep in the anterior sclera. These findings suggest that it may be challenging to treat ASK using topical antiamoebic drugs. Ebrahimi et al. also detected cysts in the limbal area and proposed a direct invasion of Acanthamoeba from the cornea.

The eye from our case study exhibited histopathological features of acute and chronic inflammation in the anterior segment. The cornea was heavily infiltrated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and cysts of Acanthamoeba over a large area, indicating highly active Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) even six months following the onset of AK and ongoing treatment with antiamoebic drugs. An abscess was present in the limbal area, and granulation tissue with diffuse invasion of monocytes was observed in the deep sclera, near the ciliary body.

Despite these severe inflammatory findings in the anterior part of the eye, no evidence of inflammation or tissue destruction was found in the sclera posterior to the insertion of the rectus muscle, or in the retina or choroid. We hypothesized that the lack of vessels in the cornea and the differing blood supply to the anterior and posterior parts of the sclera accounted for these histopathological differences. However, no cysts or trophozoites of Acanthamoeba were found in the scleral area.

### Is choroid plexus growth altered in isolated ventriculomegaly on fetal neuro-ultrasound [^1153cQ8q]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The changes in choroid plexus volume (CPV) among fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly (VM) were assessed using fetal neuro-ultrasound, and these alterations were found to be correlated with the progression of lateral ventricle enlargement. This discovery holds potential implications for prenatal counseling and clinical management strategies in cases involving fetuses with isolated VM. The forthcoming investigation will encompass an exploration of the clinical implications associated with altered CPV in fetuses, specifically focusing on its impact on the neurodevelopment of newborns.

### Morphological characteristics of ocular toxoplasmosis and its regression pattern on swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography: A case report [^115fp57i]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Ocular toxoplasmosis is one of the most common causes of posterior uveitis due to an intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. The infection may be acquired by consumption of raw meat containing cysts or ingestion of water or food contaminated by oocytes. Following invasion of the parasite into the eye, the tachyzoite remains latent in the cyst under the control of the host's immune response. In the event of a trigger causing rupture, the tachyzoite converts to bradyzoite, activating the inflammatory response. The retina is most frequently affected, but the choroid, vitreous, and anterior chamber can also be involved. Active inflammation tends to regress over a few months with scar formation, and reactivation adjacent to old scar lesions is commonly observed in ocular toxoplasmosis. The diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is based on clinical findings; however, various imaging modalities can aid in arriving at an accurate diagnosis and developing a successful treatment plan.

The introduction of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has allowed for layer-by-layer evaluation of the retina, including good visualization of the photoreceptor microstructures. Furthermore, with the introduction of enhanced depth imaging and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT), visualization of the choroid has become possible. More recently, a new imaging modality, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A), was developed, which provides a clear visualization of the retinal and choroidal microvasculature even without injection of contrast dye.

### Endoscopic cauterization of a symptomatic choroid plexus cyst at the foramen of Monro: Case report [^112MoLdb]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus cysts are common in the developing fetus, and although they often persist into adulthood, they rarely represent the underlying cause of symptomatic unilateral ventriculomegaly. This case demonstrates both the diagnostic obscurity and endoscopic management of a choroid plexus cyst in a symptomatic patient.

- **Clinical presentation**: The patient is a 47-year-old white woman who presented with acute exacerbation of debilitating, diffuse, and postural headache, nausea, vomiting, early papilledema, and short-term memory loss. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraventricular mass obstructing the foramen of Monro on the left, along with ventriculomegaly. Cranial computed tomographic imaging demonstrated unilateral ventricular enlargement.

- **Intervention**: During stereotactic endoscopic exploration, a choroid plexus cyst was evident at the foramen of Monro. Endoscopic cauterization of the cyst resulted in a decrease in the size of the left lateral ventricle, with complete relief of the patient's headaches and resolution of her memory loss. She remained headache free at the time of a 3-year follow-up evaluation after surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Choroid plexus cysts remain a diagnostic challenge; their presence should be sought out in the face of ventricular asymmetry and symptomatic hydrocephalus. Endoscopic ablation offers a minimally invasive treatment for the management of these lesions.

### Second trimester choroid plexus cysts and trisomy 18 [^117UhmQY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, the aims were to reveal the incidence of isolated choroid plexus cysts in our population and to discuss the accuracy of distinguishing either an isolated or non-isolated choroid plexus cyst.

- **Methods**:
	- The study population consisted of 10,594 pregnant women. Patients with choroid plexus cysts were classified into two groups: isolated and non-isolated. Detailed ultrasonographic examination and genetic counseling were performed, and a triple screening test was ordered. The incidence, sensitivity, specificity, false-positive rate, and likelihood ratio of cases with isolated choroid plexus cysts for trisomy 18 were determined.

- **Results**:
	- Choroid plexus cysts were identified in 109 patients (109/10,594; 1.02%). In 102 patients, isolated choroid plexus cysts were detected, and in seven patients, additional fetal anomalies supporting trisomy 18 were identified. Trisomy 18 was detected in four patients, with one case involving an isolated choroid plexus cyst. The likelihood ratio in cases of isolated choroid plexus cysts for trisomy 18 was 9.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.2–41).

- **Conclusions**:
	- According to the study, the individual risk for trisomy 18 in isolated choroid plexus cysts should be calculated using the likelihood ratio. These data allow the physician to express the individual risk of trisomy 18 and permit more accurate genetic counseling.

### Prenatal assessment of brain malformations on neuroimaging: an expert panel review [^116oM7BU]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

- **Posterior fossa anomalies**: Sagittal (A) and axial (F) T2-weighted (T2-w) images of the fetal brain at 23 gestational weeks (GW) demonstrate a retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst (star). This is associated with a mass effect manifested by failed descent of the torcular (A), flattening of the posterior margin of the left cerebellar hemisphere (F), and a rightward deviation of the falx cerebelli (arrow, F). Diffuse ventriculomegaly suggests extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus; however, supratentorial ventriculomegaly may, in part, relate to aqueductal stenosis caused by a congenitally dysgenetic/thickened lower tectum (arrow, A). Despite fourth ventriculomegaly, the tegmento-vermian angle is within normal limits, a finding that militates against Blake's pouch cyst.

- **Isolated enlargement**: Sagittal (B) and axial (G) T2-w images of the fetal brain at 33 GW show isolated enlargement of the cisterna magna (star, B) without focal mass effect, hydrocephalus, or abnormality of the brain parenchyma, consistent with a 'mega cisterna magna'. Elongation and duplication of the falx cerebelli (arrows, G) is a supportive feature.

- **Tegmento-vermian angle observations**: Sagittal T2-w image (C) of the fetal brain at 22 GW depicts a mildly enlarged tegmento-vermian angle and mild fourth ventriculomegaly (C); the brain is otherwise forming normally. Coronal T2-w image (H) reveals only minimal displacement of the choroid plexus which remains located at the central undersurface of the cerebellum rather than being displaced inferolaterally as seen in the Dandy-Walker phenotype. Together, these findings are consistent with a Blake's pouch cyst.

### Scleral Thickness in Steroid-Induced Central Serous Chorioretinopathy [^111Ymv2C]. Ophthalmology science (2022). Low credibility.

Considering the fact that mean scleral thickness values of eyes with sCSC were thinner than those of eyes with iCSC, a mechanism other than choroidal vascular congestion likely plays an important role in the pathophysiologic characteristics of sCSC. Previous studies provide insights into the pathophysiologic characteristics of sCSC. Saito et aldemonstrated an association between increased sympathetic activity and the development of acute CSC using laser speckle flowgraphy. The same authors also showed that increased sympathetic activity may lead to increases in vascular resistance, which causes imbalanced choroidal blood flow distributions in eyes with acute CSC. Curiously, Valamanesh et alshowed that structural changes such as choriocapillary rarefaction result from intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection in mice. Systemic or local effects of steroids may affect the choroid via sympathetic activity or choroidal vasculature homeostasis directly, even if scleral factor involvement and resultant pachychoroid status in sCSC do not exert as much impact as they do in iCSC. In fact, steroids reportedly inhibit norepinephrine uptake by nonneuronal cells, thereby increasing norepinephrine concentration at the sympathetic nerve ending and leading to sympathetic nervous system dominance. Exogenous steroid use may have an additive effect on the choroid in sCSC. However, the precise mechanism involved remains undetermined.

The Study has several limitations that mainly owe to its retrospective nature and small sample size. First, the duration of steroid use varied. Second…

### Solitary free-floating iris cyst associated with bilateral pigment dispersion syndrome: Report of a case [^115tFcVK]. Journal of Glaucoma (2020). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old white man with a 5-year history of pigment dispersion syndrome presented for evaluation. His past ocular history was significant for bilateral intraocular pressure elevation that had required intraocular pressure-lowering medication (beta-blocker-prostaglandin analogue fixed combination). On ophthalmic examination, the visual acuity was 20/20 without correction in both eyes. Anterior chamber slit-lamp examination revealed a pigmented round mass with modest transillumination at the 6-o'clock position of the right eye. When asked, the patient reported that he had first noticed a shadow in his right eye during childhood when he was flexing his neck and keeping a face-down position for a few seconds. During a head-flexing test, the mass freely floated in the anterior chamber. When the patient extended the neck, the round mass could be seen in front of the pupil. After a few moments, the mass would slowly fall to the iridocorneal angle at the 6-o'clock position. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography confirmed that the lesion was a pigmented cyst without internal reflectivity. Specular microscopy examinations, performed to exclude cyst-induced corneal endothelium compromise, revealed a cell density of approximately 3000 cells/mm² in both eyes. Gonioscopy showed an open angle with trabecular pigmentation and funduscopy a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.5 bilaterally. Visual fields and optical coherence tomography tests were within normal limits.

The etiology of free-floating iris cysts is unclear, but it is generally agreed that they…

### Taenia-tela choroidea complex and choroid plexus location help distinguish Dandy-Walker malformation and Blake pouch cysts [^1163KoPN]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Dandy-Walker malformation and Blake pouch cysts can have overlapping imaging features. The choroid plexus and associated taenia-tela choroidea complex are displaced inferolaterally in Dandy-Walker malformation and below the vermis in Blake pouch cysts.

- **Objective**: To determine the normal fetal and postnatal MR appearance of the choroid plexus and taenia-tela choroidea complex, and whether their location can help distinguish Dandy-Walker malformation from Blake pouch cysts.

- **Materials and Methods**: In this retrospective study, we evaluated brain MR exams from normal-appearing fetuses (gestational age 19–38 weeks) and infants, as well as fetal and postnatal exams in Blake pouch cysts and Dandy-Walker malformation, including ambiguous cases equivocal for mild Dandy-Walker malformation and Blake pouch cysts. We documented choroid plexus and the taenia-tela choroidea complex location and axial and sagittal angles in each case, then contrasted and compared the original and updated fetal diagnoses based on taenia-tela choroidea complex and choroid plexus positions.

- **Results**: The choroid plexus location and the taenia-tela choroidea complex location and angles varied significantly among normal exams, Blake pouch cyst exams, and Dandy-Walker malformation exams (P < 0.01). Dandy-Walker malformation showed inferolateral displacement of the taenia-tela choroidea complex and choroid plexus distant from the vermis. Adding the taenia-tela choroidea complex and choroid plexus into the assessment improved diagnostic accuracy, especially in ambiguous cases.

- **Conclusion**: The location of the taenia-tela choroidea complex and choroid plexus is crucial in differentiating between Dandy-Walker malformation and Blake pouch cysts, enhancing diagnostic precision.

### Prenatal diagnosis of complete sole trisomy 1q [^1117zdbY]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2001). Low credibility.

The prenatal diagnosis of a complete trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 1 is reported. Major ultrasound findings included nuchal thickening, bi-temporal narrowing, a single choroid plexus cyst, and mild ventriculomegaly. There was a mass in the chest and abdomen, pleural effusion, ascites, and a hyperechoic bowel. Skin edema was present. The fetus died at 26 weeks' gestation.

A literature review is presented of 17 de novo and two inherited cases with only trisomy 1q. Of note is the fact that 3/5 prenatally detected 1q trisomies have teratomas. A review of the literature reveals a dismal outcome for trisomy 1q cases if the duplication involves bands 1q25→q32.

### Metastatic choroid plexus papilloma: a case report [^114RLE8x]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are generally regarded as benign tumors, with a favorable long-term prognosis. Complete resection should result in a cure. We present a case of diffuse craniospinal seeding from an apparently completely resected fourth ventricular primary tumor. A 51-year-old male is discussed, who presented 5 years following the complete resection of a CPP from the fourth ventricle. He had a progressive history of left-sided tinnitus, hearing loss, impotence, and recent low back pain. Imaging demonstrated multiple craniospinal lesions explaining his symptomatology. The differential diagnosis lay between long-standing CSF seeding, malignant transformation in the primary tumor, or metastatic spread from an undefined source. He underwent a whole-body FDG-PET scan, which demonstrated a single metabolically active lesion in the sacral canal. A subtotal excision biopsy of this sacral lesion was performed, which was indistinguishable histologically from the primary tumor resected from the fourth ventricle. Histological and functional imaging characteristics of the primary tumor have been unhelpful in predicting its subsequent behavior. The present case illustrates the extremely rare consequences of metastases from this histologically benign tumor and adds to the literature on metastatic craniospinal disease.

### Extracerebral choroid plexus papilloma in the pharynx with airway obstruction in a newborn: A case report [^116VmUM1]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are rare tumors originating from the central nervous system. Almost all CPPs are histologically benign neoplasms. Their prevalence rates in adults and children are 0.5–1% and 3–4% of primary intracranial neoplasms, respectively. The papillae consist of cores of fibrovascular tissue; the choroid plexus is a neuroepithelial-lined papillary projection of the ventricle ependymal. Therefore, most CPPs occur in the ventricular system. In the majority of cases, increased intracranial pressure is the most common presentation, and other symptoms depend upon the site of the lesion. The cerebellopontine (CP) angle, third ventricle, and cerebral parenchyma are rare locations. In this report, we present the first case of a giant extracerebral CPP in the pharynx with airway obstruction in a newborn.

### Heart-rate variability correlates to choroidal thickness in central serous chorioretinopathy [^116VE9Ra]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a common retinopathy affecting middle-aged individuals, especially men. The early stage of CSC is marked by thickened choroid, serous retinal detachment, and the absence of drusen. Patients commonly experience metamorphopsia and blurred vision. Without treatment, 90% of patients undergo spontaneous remission within 1.5 months. If serous detachment prevails, intervention is needed to prevent subsequent neovascularization.

The cause of CSC is unknown, but risk factors include genetic disposition, use of corticosteroids, elevated cortisol, type A personality, emotional distress, sleep disorders, and medications such as MEK inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and adrenergic receptor agonists. The most accepted pathogenesis involves alterations in the mineralocorticoid pathway and receptors, leading to dilation of the choroidal vessels. This causes mechanical flux gradients over Bruch's membrane, further leading to serous detachment.

Heart failure patients are known to have an affected mineralocorticoid pathway via an abnormal sympatric-parasympathetic ratio. This abnormal ratio causes a decrease in the parasympathetic inhibition of cortisol and aldosterone. Furthermore, patients with heart failure have an increased risk of CSC, suggesting that the abnormal mineralocorticoid pathway may play a role in the development of CSC. However, abnormal parasympathetic activity is not easily measured. One way to indirectly determine parasympathetic activity is to evaluate vagal activity. The vagal nerve is part of the parasympathetic system.

### Choroid plexus cysts in the mid-trimester fetus — practical application suggests superiority of an individualized risk method of counseling for trisomy 18 [^114oncTW]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2002). Low credibility.

Analysis of a referral population of patients with choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) was performed to compare an average risk method of counseling to an individualized risk method.

- **Methods**: A total of 395 patients referred to a Prenatal Diagnosis Center were included, of whom 341 had isolated CPCs and 54 had associated ultrasound abnormalities. For isolated CPCs, an average risk of 1/150 for aneuploidy was compared to an individualized risk assessment [prior risk as determined by maternal age or serum screening multiplied by the likelihood ratio established by Gupta et al. (1997)]. Accuracy, cost, and procedure-related losses were assessed.

- **Results**: Both methods resulted in 100% sensitivity. The individualized method resulted in greater specificity, decreased costs, and (theoretically) fewer procedure-related pregnancy losses.

Conclusion: An individualized risk method of counseling utilizing the likelihood ratios established by Gupta et al. (1997) was superior to an average risk method for assessing trisomy 18 risk in the setting of CPC detected in mid-trimester.

### Molecular characterization of choroid plexus tumors reveals novel clinically relevant subgroups [^114uywGi]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

To investigate molecular alterations in choroid plexus tumors (CPT), a genome-wide high-throughput approach was used to identify diagnostic and prognostic signatures that could refine tumor stratification and guide therapeutic options.

- **Experimental design**: One hundred CPTs were obtained from a multi-institutional tissue and clinical database. Copy-number (CN), DNA methylation, and gene expression signatures were assessed for 74, 36, and 40 samples, respectively. Molecular subgroups were correlated with clinical parameters and outcomes.

- **Results**: Unique molecular signatures distinguished choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) from choroid plexus papillomas (CPP) and atypical choroid plexus papillomas (aCPP); however, no significantly distinct molecular alterations between CPPs and aCPPs were observed. Allele-specific CN analysis of CPCs revealed two novel subgroups according to DNA content: hypodiploid and hyperdiploid CPCs. Hyperdiploid CPCs exhibited reacquired uniparental disomy events. Somatic mutations in TP53 were observed in 60% of CPCs. Investigation into the number of mutated copies of p53 per sample revealed a high-risk group of patients with CPC carrying two copies of mutant p53, who exhibited poor 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with patients with CPC carrying one copy of mutant p53. OS was 14.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.71%-46.5%) versus 66.7% (28.2%-87.8%), with P = 0.04; EFS was 0% versus 44.4% (13.6%-71.9%), with P = 0.03. CPPs and aCPPs exhibited favorable survival.

Our data demonstrate differences in CN.

### Microsurgical resection of tumors of the lateral and third ventricles: Operative corridors for difficult-to-reach lesions [^117E48jZ]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Tumors of the third ventricle, like those of the lateral ventricle, can be categorized into primary and secondary tumors. Primary tumors include colloid cysts, choroid plexus (CP) papillomas, ependymomas, subependymomas, and central neurocytomas. The secondary group comprises tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, pituitary tumors, hypothalamic gliomas, optic pathway gliomas, meningiomas, and pineal region tumors.

- **Surgical approach**: To access these masses, surgeons must navigate around critical structures such as the hypothalamus, pituitary infundibulum, optic pathways, limbic system, and associated vascular structures. Possible complications of this surgery include hemiparesis, seizures, visual loss, memory loss, and dysfunction of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Poorly planned surgery may result in inadequate exposure, preventing gross total resection and risking significant neurological deficits.

- **Anatomical illustration**:
	- In Fig. 4, the surgical approaches to the third ventricle are shown on the lateral view of a cadaveric brain dissection. The lateral ventricle (LV) and third ventricle (TV) are depicted in blue, with parts of the TV highlighted by gray circles. Red arrows indicate the direction of approaches and the parts of the TV accessible through those approaches.
	- Fig. 5a illustrates the removal of the posterior part of the corpus callosum (CC), along with the posterior and superior walls of the LV, exposing the TV. The thalamus (T) forms the lateral walls of the posterior third ventricle (III). The proximity to the pineal gland (Pi), superior colliculus (SC), and inferior colliculus (IC) is visible. The red arrow indicates the route leading to the foramen of Monro (FM) and the third ventricle through the CC.

### Circumscribed choroidal haemangioma: Clinical and topographical features [^1155QzEs]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Circumscribed choroidal haemangioma (CCH) typically presents as a solitary, unilateral tumour in the posterior pole of the eye without any other ocular or systemic anomalies. Its true incidence is unknown, as most CCH cases are diagnosed if the patient becomes symptomatic or incidentally during routine examination. Jarrett et al. discovered one CCH for every 15 cases of choroidal melanoma, which is broadly in line with clinical experience and expectations.

Ophthalmoscopically, CCH is seen as a round or oval, dome-shaped, orange-red mass. Over time, secondary changes may occur, such as overlying drusen, fibrous metaplasia, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy or hyperplasia. On ultrasonography, CCH appears as an acoustically solid mass with high internal reflectivity. Fluorescein angiography shows gradually increasing fluorescence, while indocyanine green (ICG) angiography is characterised by rapid hyperfluorescence followed by relative hypofluorescence, the so-called 'washout' phenomenon, in the very late phase. During early adulthood, CCH may cause visual loss and metamorphopsia due to subretinal fluid (SRF) exudation, macular oedema, or macular elevation or tilting. Since the beginning of this century, photodynamic therapy has been considered the treatment of choice for symptomatic CCH.

Despite its characteristic clinical appearance, it is vitally important to distinguish CCH from more serious conditions like choroidal melanoma and metastasis, which can be particularly challenging in chronic lesions with metaplastic changes.

### Transient choroid plexus cysts and benign asymmetrical ventricles: a case suggesting a possible link: case report [^116W6SKc]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans sometimes reveal asymmetrical ventricles without an identifiable cause. This case highlights a potential connection between transient choroid plexus cysts and benign asymmetrical ventricles.

- **Clinical presentation**: The patient was a 2.5-week-old asymptomatic boy. Transcranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the infant had a left frontal horn choroid plexus cyst and a mildly dilated left lateral ventricle. Head circumference was at the 90th percentile for his age. The neurological examination was unremarkable. Four months later, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed complete resolution of the cyst, although ventricular asymmetry persisted.

- **Intervention**: No surgical intervention was performed. The lesion was assessed via x-ray.

- **Conclusion**: Spontaneously resolving choroid plexus cysts of infancy, which cause outflow obstruction of the lateral ventricle, may be one of the underlying causes of benign asymmetrical ventricles.

### Anterior extension of the choroid plexus into the frontal horns of the fetal lateral cerebral ventricles: Prenatal findings and postnatal outcome [^115Cmyaz]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of fetuses with evidence of an extension of the choroid plexus into the frontal horns.

- **Methods**:
	This is a retrospective cohort study of fetuses diagnosed with isolated choroid plexi extending into the frontal horns. Fetuses with major central nervous system anomalies were excluded. Ultrasound and fetal/postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were evaluated, and postnatal outcomes, including developmental assessments, were obtained.

- **Results**:
	Twenty-nine fetuses were diagnosed with choroid plexus extension: 22 unilateral and 7 bilateral. The gestational age at diagnosis was 19.3 weeks. Three cases (10.3%) presented with nonspecific extra-CNS findings. At presentation, 8 out of 29 cases (28%) had single or multiple choroid plexus cysts (CPC). Twenty-six (89.6%) cases underwent antenatal MRI. On MRI, four cases showed punctate susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) foci suggesting trace hemosiderin, and two cases had ventriculomegaly. Antenatal follow-up demonstrated resolution of the choroid plexus extension in 90% (18 out of 20 cases). The gestational age at delivery was 39.6 weeks. All had normal neurological examinations within 24 hours of life. Postnatal MRI studies were notable for deep venous differences in seven cases. Long-term clinical outcomes were assessed in 14 cases with a median follow-up of 1.75 years, with normal neurodevelopment reported in 13 out of 14 (92.8%).

- **Conclusions**:
	Most fetuses with an anterior extension of the choroid plexus as the sole sonographic finding had favorable outcomes.

### Sympathetic ophthalmia: Where do we currently stand on treatment strategies [^113DKL45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

ICGA (Indocyanine Green Angiography) is the modality of choice specifically to assess the choroid and to search for the presence of choroidal infiltrates. Multiple hypocyanescent spots are the common findings on ICGA in patients with sympathetic ophthalmia. These spots occur due to the presence of cellular infiltration of the choroid, DF nodules, or overlying edema. Casella et al. showed that these hypocyanescent spots persist throughout the phases of ICGA. These spots are noted to lessen or vanish once the treatment with corticosteroids is started and are consistent with clinical improvement.

### Symptomatic intraventricular choroid plexus cysts. Illustrative case and systematic review [^116eE7Xn]. Neurosurgical review (2023). High credibility.

Although choroid plexus cysts are frequent incidental neuroimaging findings, symptomatic ones are rare and finding a series of more than five cases is challenging. In the absence of high-volume studies, generally accepted algorithms for diagnosis and treatment of this pathology do not exist. Proposed surgical techniques include microsurgical excision or fenestration, and endoscopic excision or fenestration with or without additional shunting. No definitive conclusions exist about the superiority of a certain technique.

Here, we introduce an illustrative case of a patient with a symptomatic choroid plexus cyst in the trigone of the lateral ventricle, alongside a systematic review of 65 additional published cases. The aim is to identify epidemiological features, variants of localization of the cysts, their symptoms, persistence of concomitant obstructive hydrocephalus, and treatment modalities. A PRISMA-based literature search was performed on the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases. We included case reports and case series of symptomatic choroid plexus cysts with full texts or valuable abstracts available online in English, published by April 2023. All abstracts of retrieved studies were assessed by two independent researchers to avoid bias. Only descriptive statistics were used for the presentation of the results.

A total of 48 studies (39 case reports and 9 case series) with 65 depicted cases met the eligibility criteria. The review showed a slight predominance of choroid plexus cysts in men. The most common localizations of cysts were the trigone.

### Developmental outcome of children who had choroid plexus cysts detected prenatally [^114RAv6c]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate cognitive, motor, language, and adaptive behavior development in children who had isolated choroid plexus cysts (CPC) detected prenatally. A retrospective double cohort design and standardized psychometric measures were used to compare the development of children with isolated CPCs identified prenatally with a control group of children who had normal prenatal ultrasounds.

Our study cohort (n = 37) had a mean age of 3.88 years (SD = 0.83), while the control cohort (n = 48) had a mean age of 4.62 years (SD = 1.03). There was a significant age difference between the cohorts. However, there were no differences in socioeconomic status, sex, birth weight, or gestational age. Cognitive data showed no clinically significant difference in Full Scale IQ using the WISC-III or WPPSI-R (CPC = 113.97, control = 116.69). Scores on standardized measures of motor and adaptive functioning also did not show any significant group differences. Children with CPCs scored significantly lower than controls on some measures of verbal functioning; however, this difference was not associated with clinically significant delays.

We conclude that the presence of isolated CPCs on midtrimester ultrasound is unlikely to be associated with significant neurocognitive delays in early childhood.

### Single-stage bilateral choroid plexectomy for choroid plexus papilloma in a patient presenting with high cerebrospinal fluid output [^115LaK8i]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid overproduction resulting in communicating hydrocephalus is observed in patients with choroid plexus papilloma or choroid plexus carcinoma. Less frequently, patients with these conditions exhibit diffuse villous hyperplasia. Previous studies report cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production exceeding 3 liters per day in such patients. Treatment options include CSF shunting, unilateral choroid plexectomy, or staged bilateral choroid plexectomy. This report presents a patient with several congenital anomalies and a karyotype revealing balanced translocations, specifically between chromosomes 5 and 7, and 9 and 11. The patient presented with hydrocephalus and produced 5 liters of CSF per day, exceeding previously reported outputs. A single-stage bilateral choroid plexectomy was performed as treatment. Histopathological analysis confirmed a bilateral choroid plexus papilloma. Postoperative outcomes indicated the patient responded well clinically and showed radiographic improvement in hydrocephalus. Bilateral choroid plexus papilloma has been cited in the literature as a cause of neonatal and congenital hydrocephalus, leading to excessive CSF output, which can be effectively managed with a single-stage bilateral choroid plexectomy. Further research is being conducted to identify genes involved in the embryogenesis of the choroid plexus.

### Axons in human choroidal melanoma suggest the participation of nerves in the control of these tumors [^1157MJGP]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to furnish morphologic evidence of autonomic nervous system influence on choroidal melanoma. This report uses a histopathologic case design.

In the methods, the enucleated eye of a 72-year-old woman was evaluated. Portions of a mixed-cell choroidal melanoma were processed for electron microscopy, and ultrathin sections were meticulously screened under magnifications of 13,000x and 23,000x.

The results showed that the connective tissue of the melanoma contained macrophages, blood vessels, and profiles of several nonmyelinated nerve fiber bundles with a maximum of six axons.

The conclusion drawn was that the existence of axons in neoplastic tissue indicates nervous input and/or output, leading to the understanding that the reaction of the melanoma is subjected to vegetative influences, though the extent remains unknown.

### Treatment of vascular activity secondary to atypical choroidal nevus using intravitreal bevacizumab [^114SwnyD]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

To report the optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of 27 eyes treated with intravitreal bevacizumab for intraretinal and subretinal vascular activity associated with atypical choroidal nevi, a study was conducted.

This was an Internal Review Board-approved retrospective review of 27 eyes from 27 patients with choroidal nevus treated for secondary vascular activity using intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, performed by a single surgeon (TGM) at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. All patients were rigorously evaluated before the procedure and followed thereafter with ophthalmic examinations, refractive analysis, fundus photos, OCT, and ocular echography. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, dates of bevacizumab injections, and spectral-domain (SD)-OCT findings at each injection were recorded. Macular edema was graded according to SD-OCT findings at the initial and final visits.

The mean age of participants was 66.6 years (range, 40–86 years), including ten males and 17 females. Mean, median, and range baseline best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were 20/53, 20/40, and 20/20–4/200, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 29 months, the final BCVA mean, median, and range were 20/50, 20/40, and 20/20–20/400, respectively. The final BCVA ranged from 20/20 to 20/25 in nine eyes, while only six eyes had an initial BCVA within the same range. All patients demonstrated OCT findings of vascular activity suggestive of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Initial SD-OCT findings included intraretinal cysts in eleven eyes and intraretinal fluid in six eyes.

### Epigenetics impacts upon prognosis and clinical management of choroid plexus tumors [^116umhvQ]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

In contrast, CPC is a highly malignant neoplasm most commonly occurring in the lateral ventricles. At least four of the following five histological features are required for a diagnosis of CPC: brisk mitotic activity (> 5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields), nuclear pleomorphism, high cellularity, blurring of the papillary growth pattern, and areas of necrosis. Despite aggressive treatment protocols, including surgical resection and a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the clinical behavior of CPC is variable, with 5-year OS rates between 56% and 64%. Many long-term survivors suffer from neurocognitive deficits. While metastatic disease is rare in CPP, 21% of patients with CPC present with metastatic disease at diagnosis.

For decades, choroid plexus tumors have been classified as either CPP or CPC. However, such a binary distinction was difficult, as some CPP display one or even several atypical histological features. On multivariate analysis of a large cohort comprising 124 CPPs affecting children and adult patients, increased mitotic activity, defined as ≥ 2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (area of view 0.23 mm²), was the only clinicopathological feature associated with a higher probability of recurrence. This observation was then introduced in the 2007 WHO definition of aCPP, i.e. CPP with increased mitotic activity as an intermediate risk group. However, in a subsequent multi-institutional study conducted by SIOP, aCPP did not have significantly worse PFS when compared with CPP, raising the possibility that increased mitotic activity might not have an adverse impact.

### Choroid plexus volume in multiple sclerosis vs neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis [^1179AxHb]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

A reason for the discrepancy between our study and the aforementioned study could be the relatively higher sample size in our study. Low sample sizes are prone to type II errors, which is the risk of concluding that there is no significant difference between the groups when such a difference actually exists. The aforementioned study included 51 patients with MS, 32 patients with NMOSD, and 26 HCs, whereas our study included more than 2–3× more study participants (180 patients with MS, 98 patients with NMOSD, and 94 HCs). Moreover, we segmented the choroid plexus on high-resolution 3D images (slice thickness 1 mm). They used linear measures on axial and coronal planes with a slice thickness of 5 mm. On the other hand, and this is certainly an advantage, they also measured the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle but analyzed these results separately from the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles. In contrast, we only included the infratentorial parts of the choroid plexus in a sensitivity analysis in a subgroup of our patients and found results comparable to our main analysis. A further advantage of our study is that we included study subjects from four different MS centers and various regions of the world, in contrast to the recent single-center work, which might make our results more generalizable. We also included not only healthy individuals as a control group but also patients with migraine as an example of a non-autoimmune inflammatory CNS disease, which might strengthen our results.

### Treatment of intermittent obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a choroid plexus cyst [^1174FWhW]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

This paper presents the case of an 11-week-old girl in whom hydrocephalus developed due to intermittent obstruction of the third ventricle by a choroid plexus cyst. The patient arrived at the emergency department with a one-day history of projectile vomiting, lethargy, and dysconjugate gaze. Hydrocephalus was confirmed via a head CT scan. During hospitalization, the symptoms resolved as the ventricular size decreased.

One week later, the patient presented again with similar symptoms. MR imaging using 3D-constructive interference in steady state sequences revealed a cyst blocking the third ventricle. The patient underwent endoscopic fenestration of the cyst, leading to the resolution of hydrocephalus and symptoms. This case provides a unique description of diagnosing intermittent obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a choroid plexus cyst in the third ventricular region in an infant.

### A rare case of congenital choroid plexus carcinoma [^111yeeWA]. Pediatric hematology and oncology (2012). Low credibility.

We report a 1-year-old child with the prenatal (week 29 + 5) diagnosis of a brain tumor. The parents were informed about all aspects of prognosis and options concerning termination of pregnancy. After extensive and informative case conferences and counseling, the parents opted for an aggressive therapeutic approach. The histopathological diagnosis after partial tumor resection was choroid plexus carcinoma; two weeks thereafter, the tumor size was progressive. At this stage, the parents opted for palliative treatment. The patient died at the age of one year.

Ethical aspects must be actively considered and addressed when caring for children with choroid plexus carcinoma.

### Intrinsic brainstem choroid plexus papilloma. Case report [^115bDs7c]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

The authors report an intrinsic brainstem lesion that was initially diagnosed as a pontine cavernoma, but ultimately proved to be a choroid plexus papilloma. Choroid plexus papillomas are rare tumors of the central nervous system and are usually intraventricular in location. The occurrence of this tumor in an intraparenchymal location is extremely rare, and its appearance within the brainstem is previously unreported. The authors also describe a trial of chemotherapy using lomustine in managing the residual tumor.

### Extracerebral choroid plexus papilloma in the pharynx with airway obstruction in a newborn: a case report [^111HV8Qj]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

An elective surgery was performed at 16 days of age by otorhinolaryngologists. Under general anesthesia, removal of the pharyngeal mass through a transoral approach was performed in the Rose position. A whitish, protruding mass adhered to the prevertebral fascia and nasal septum but was easily dissected to complete extirpation. The mass was 1.6 × 1.1 × 0.4 cm in size and 0.3 g in weight (Fig. 3). Histological examination at low magnification revealed that the mass was a cystic lesion with complex papillary proliferation of epithelial cells. The wall of the cyst was composed of glial and fibrovascular tissues (Fig. 4a).

At high magnification, the papillary components of the cyst comprised a single layer of epithelial cells and fibrovascular cores. Epithelial cells were cuboidal-to-columnar in shape and had round-to-oval, basally located nuclei with an eosinophilic cytoplasm, resembling epithelial cells of the choroid plexus tissue. Cytologic atypia or mitotic activity was not identified (Fig. 4b). The histologic features of the tumor were consistent with those of a CPP, arising from glial heterotopia. The choroid plexus-like cells showed focal positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostain (Fig. 4c). Pathology analysis was consistent with WHO grade I CPP.

Extubation was performed 2 days after surgery, and the respiration rate and peripheral saturation were stable. Seven months post-surgery, a non-enhanced CT of the pharynx was performed, and the resection site was clear. Chromosome analysis revealed a normal female karyotype with 46, XX at 7 months of age.

### Role of the superior salivatory nucleus in parasympathetic control of choroidal blood flow and in maintenance of retinal health [^115iqP7M]. Experimental Eye Research (2021). Low credibility.

**Implications of findings**: As reviewed in our prior papers, many diseases affecting the retina have impaired choroidal blood flow (ChBF) and/or diminished choroidal innervation as concomitants, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), chronic hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes, glaucoma, ischemic outer retinal disease, and central serous chorioretinopathy. Additionally, impaired ChBF regulation and diminished sympathetic and parasympathetic choroidal innervation are observed in aging. Thus, the available data are consistent with the view that disturbances in maintenance of basal neurogenic choroidal tone and/or adaptive neural control of ChBF could be contributing factors to the retinal declines seen in humans and other species in hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, ischemic retinal disease, central serous chorioretinopathy, and with aging. Clearly, other mechanisms also contribute to retinal damage in these conditions, such as edema, retinal detachment, and/or neovascularization. It is also possible that in some cases the altered ChBF control is secondary to the disease. Moreover, loss and narrowing of submacular choroidal vessels, as seen in normal aged eyes, may also contribute to ChBF abnormalities. Nonetheless, the possibility that impaired neurogenic regulation of ChBF directly promotes degeneration in these diseases and in aging needs to be considered.

### Choroid plexus cysts on 7T MRI: Relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases [^117FjwNL]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

The choroid plexus (CP) may play a crucial role in brain degeneration. We aim to assess whether CP cysts (CPCs), defined using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relate to aging and neurodegeneration.

We used multi-sequence 7T MRI to observe CPCs, characterizing their presence and characteristics in healthy younger controls, healthy older controls (OCs), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and patients with uremic encephalopathy. CP volume (CPV) and CPC characteristics were compared across groups, and associations between CPV and CPC features were analyzed across all subjects.

The AD group showed a significantly higher presence and number of CPCs compared to other groups and also had a significantly larger CPV than healthy OCs. The number and size of CPCs were associated with CPV.

7T MRI offers a distinct advantage in observing CPCs, and the high prevalence of CPCs in patients with AD warrants further investigation.

- **Highlights**:
	- 7T MRI enables visualization of the fine structures of the choroid plexus.
	- Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a higher number of choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) compared to healthy older adults and other patient groups.
	- CPCs may serve as an auxiliary marker for AD.

### Guideline no. 408: Management of gestational trophoblastic diseases [^1135M2h2]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gestational trophoblastic disease, particularly in the context of diagnostic imaging, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend the following evaluations during the initial workup for suspected choriocarcinoma, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia following a non-molar pregnancy, and/or post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia with lung metastases visible on chest X-ray:

- **Pelvic ultrasound**: A critical tool for initial assessment.
- **Chest and abdomen CT**: Conducted with arterial phase through the liver for comprehensive evaluation.
- **Brain MRI**: Essential for detecting possible cerebral involvement.

### Is choroid plexus growth altered in isolated ventriculomegaly on fetal neuro-ultrasound [^117XDaeZ]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The choroid plexus (CP) is a network of blood vessels, connective tissue, and cells in the cerebral ventricular system. The CP generates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and regulates brain homeostasis. It also participates in neuronal growth, day-night rhythm modulation, neuroimmunomodulation, and neurocognition. CP abnormalities may affect brain homeostasis, and the impact of CP on central nervous system disorders in adults and children has been studied recently. An increased CP volume on MRI in adults and children may be associated with psychosis spectrum disorder phenomenology and may be a specific contributor to these psychiatric conditions.

Ventriculomegaly (VM) occurs in fetuses when the atrial width is equal to or greater than 10 mm on the trans-ventricular plane of the fetal head measured using two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound. It is the most common disease of the fetal central nervous system. Isolated VM is defined as VM that is not complicated by other structural abnormalities or associated with markers of aneuploidy. The diameter, length, area, and circumference of the fetal CP were measured to evaluate the separation between the CP and medial wall of the lateral ventricle in fetuses with isolated VM, and the "CP separating" more than 3 mm may predict a poor prognosis. However, the relationship between the CP itself and fetuses with isolated VM remains unknown.

A study on 330 fetuses with isolated mild ventriculomegaly (IMVM) demonstrated that 7.9% of the cases had a neurodevelopmental delay after birth.

### Factors influencing tissue cyst yield in a murine model of chronic toxoplasmosis [^113WRwN1]. Infection and Immunity (2023). High credibility.

The recovery of tissue cysts following infection with either tachyzoites or encysted bradyzoites exhibited no sex-specific differences, suggesting that the differences seen following tachyzoite versus cyst infection were likely due to differences in the host response as opposed to factors intrinsic to the parasite. The more aggressive host response in tachyzoites paradoxically resulted in significantly higher tissue cyst recovery in surviving mice compared to cumulative recovery following cyst infection, where lower symptomology and mortality were observed. This finding suggests that maintenance of the infection by serial passage of brain-derived ex vivo tissue cysts would effectively circumvent the issue of tachyzoite infection-associated mortality, which precludes cyst recovery.

Unfortunately, our data establish that serial passage of tissue cysts results in a progressive trend toward reduced overall recovery of cysts. This trend of decreasing cyst yields was not observed in a ME49 line maintained in the Wilson laboratory by serial passage over multiple years in mice. One key difference in this maintenance protocol is the "recharging" of that line in outbred Swiss Webster animals, where presumed epigenetic changes are reinstituted to permit the restoration of high cyst yields upon return to infections in inbred mice.

Our prior and ongoing analysis of bradyzoite replication within tissue cysts points to largely asynchronous growth that broadly follows a cyclical pattern, at least during the first 8 weeks of infection.

### Retinal microvascular abnormalities overlying choroidal nodules in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113A4Ge7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

This study describes "spiral" or "corkscrew" retinal microvascular alterations overlying choroidal nodules in patients with NF1. These alterations can be considered a distinctive retinal feature of NF1. Furthermore, as NF1 involves aberrant proliferation of multiple tissues of neural crest origin, these retinal alterations could possibly be related to functional disorders of vasomotor nerve cells.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: a single center experiences [^112BEYrc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The arachnoid cyst was first described in 1831 in Bright's Medical Case Reports and was further supported by Krawchenko and Collins in 1979 on postmortem examination. In 1935, Barlow published the first case of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst. Arachnoid cysts are congenital lesions that occur when the arachnoid membrane breaks during development. The mechanism by which these cysts form is still unknown. It is suggested that poor development of the cortical layers of the arachnoid membrane may happen during fetal migration. Some researchers propose that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infiltration causes the cyst to expand, whereas others suggest that vibrations through one-way valve mechanisms in arterial communication could be another potential mechanism.

The intracystic fluid may be produced by cells secreted by the arachnoid directly into the cyst or by ectopic choroid-like structures. Martinez-Lage et al. suggested that the origin of intraventricular arachnoid cysts could be due to the replacement of arachnoid cells by vascular mesenchyme during choroid plexus development. Others have argued that arachnoid cells may have an active secretion in the cyst wall.

While most arachnoid cysts remain stable throughout a patient's life, some may enlarge and cause complications such as spontaneous rupture or hemorrhage; however, most usually become symptomatic and are diagnosed early in childhood.

The most common intracranial arachnoid cysts include temporal cysts (30.2%), suprasellar cysts (14.3%), quadrigeminal cysts (12.7%), cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cysts (11.1% each), and hemispheric cysts (7.9%). Rengachary and Watanabe detected the local distribution of these cysts.

### Isolated choroid plexus cyst in low-risk women less than 35 years old [^116f6cwL]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of trisomy 18 in women who are < 35 years old and who have a sonographically detected isolated choroid plexus cyst.

- **Study design**: A meta-analysis of prospective trials that were published in the English language between 1990 and 2000 was performed. Each trial met the following inclusion criteria: (1) prospective trial, (2) total population screened during the study period reported, (3) maternal age (either numeric or descriptive) reported, and (4) pregnancy/neonatal outcomes reported. An isolated choroid plexus cyst for the purpose of this study was defined as the absence of sonographically detected structural abnormalities and normal serum analyte screens, if reported.

- **Results**: Eight trials met the criteria and were used for analysis. A total of 106,732 women were screened through articles that were published between 1990 and 2000. The total number of fetuses with choroid plexus cysts identified in second-trimester scans was 1,235 (incidence, 1.2%). The incidence of isolated choroid plexus cysts in women who were < 35 years old was 1.0% (n = 1,017 women). There were no cases of trisomy 18 in women with isolated choroid plexus cyst who were < 35 years old. Four structural abnormalities were noted on postnatal examination; all four neonates had normal karyotypes.

- **Conclusion**: There is no evidence that detection of an isolated choroid plexus cyst in women who are < 35 years of age increases the risk of trisomy 18. Therefore, amniocentesis is not warranted because of the inherent risk of pregnancy loss.
