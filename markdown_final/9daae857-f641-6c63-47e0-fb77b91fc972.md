## Question

What is the treatment of otitis in children? What dosis of medication to use?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of otitis in children and the appropriate medication dosages. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the type of otitis because acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and otitis externa have different management pathways. Then, I should verify age-based treatment thresholds and when to observe versus treat immediately. Next, I will confirm first-line antibiotic choices and exact pediatric dosing, including high-dose amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate ratios. After that, I need to check duration of therapy by age and severity, and what to do if there is treatment failure. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like tympanostomy tubes, otitis externa, and pain control, and I will reconcile any conflicting dosing sources along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities because treatment hinges on this distinction. Acute otitis media is an acute bacterial infection of the middle ear, otitis media with effusion is fluid in the middle ear without acute inflammatory signs, and otitis externa is an external ear canal infection; management and medications differ substantially across these entities, so I need to ensure I am addressing the right condition before discussing dosing.

> Next, I should review when to treat versus observe for AOM. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guidelines support observation in selected children with nonsevere, unilateral AOM who are older than 2 years, whereas children 6 to 23 months with bilateral AOM, those with severe symptoms such as moderate to severe otalgia or fever 39°C or higher, or those with otorrhea should receive antibiotics promptly; I should double-check that these thresholds align with AAP/AAFP guidance, which they do [^111eTJjM] [^116na4A4] [^115Draen].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for uncomplicated AOM. High-dose amoxicillin at 80 to 90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily is recommended as first-line in most children to overcome pneumococcal resistance; wait, let me verify the exact ratio and whether this applies universally. The AAP/AAFP guideline specifies 80–90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component in 2 divided doses, and this is supported by pharmacodynamic data showing improved middle ear concentrations against resistant pneumococci, so I should confirm that this remains the standard, which it does [^112PEiiR] [^1138jF4i].

> But wait, what if there are risk factors for beta-lactamase producers or recent amoxicillin exposure. In that case, I should switch to high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate using a 14:1 ratio to minimize clavulanate-related GI adverse effects; the guideline specifies 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses, and I need to ensure I state the ratio correctly, which is 14:1, not 7:1 as some older formulations used [^112PEiiR] [^113XcijU].

> Let me consider duration of therapy because it varies by age and severity. For children under 2 years or with severe symptoms, a 10-day course is recommended; for ages 2 to 5 with mild to moderate disease, 7 days is acceptable; and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate disease, 5 to 7 days suffices; I should confirm these ranges, and yes, they match the AAP/AAFP guidance [^1135fz6j].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if symptoms persist after 48 to 72 hours. If there is no improvement, I should reassess the diagnosis and consider changing therapy; recommended options include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate as above or ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM or IV for 1 to 3 days, with clindamycin as an alternative when beta-lactams are not suitable; I need to ensure I include the ceftriaxone dosing and the caveat about clindamycin, which the guideline supports [^114HRxCA] [^113y75pc].

> Next, I should review otitis media with effusion because it is often conflated with AOM. For OME, I need to emphasize that routine antibiotics, intranasal or systemic steroids, antihistamines, and decongestants are not recommended; observation with hearing surveillance is preferred, and I should double-check that this is a strong recommendation against antibiotics, which it is in the AAO-HNSF update [^111eJxRX] [^113ame9A] [^115cw4ZV].

> I will now examine otitis externa, since the user might be asking about topical therapy. For pediatric otitis externa, ofloxacin otic 5 drops once daily for 7 days is recommended for ages 6 months to 13 years, with warming the bottle and maintaining position for 5 minutes; for tympanostomy tubes with acute otitis media, ofloxacin 5 drops twice daily for 10 days is indicated, and I should confirm those drop counts and durations, which match FDA labeling [^115wkSsV] [^113wLmkB].

> Let me think about pain control because it is a core management element regardless of antibiotic use. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen should be offered for analgesia, and topical analgesics may be considered in older children without a perforated tympanic membrane; I should confirm that guidelines prioritize pain assessment and treatment, which they do [^114pQr6t] [^117JTqVo].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the FDA amoxicillin dose for AOM in children older than 3 months was uniformly 20 to 25 mg/kg/day divided every 8 to 12 hours, but that conflicts with AAP/AAFP high-dose recommendations; let me verify and reconcile this. The FDA labeling includes multiple amoxicillin regimens for AOM, including 20–25 mg/kg/day in divided doses for mild to moderate disease and higher regimens up to 40–45 mg/kg/day in divided doses for severe disease, yet the AAP/AAFP guideline explicitly recommends 80–90 mg/kg/day for AOM to address resistance, so I should prioritize the guideline-based high-dose regimen for empiric therapy while acknowledging that FDA labeling reflects a range of approved dosing and older standards [^116xCqCn] [^11641pg4] [^116ouRb4] [^112PEiiR].

> I should double-check a few practical details. For amoxicillin-clavulanate, the 14:1 ratio formulation is preferred to reduce clavulanate-related diarrhea; for children weighing 40 kg or more, adult dosing applies; and for recurrent AOM, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended given minimal benefit and resistance concerns, so I need to ensure I state that clearly [^113XcijU] [^114dCz5f].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable summary is as follows: for acute otitis media, use high-dose amoxicillin 80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for most children, choose high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses when there are risk factors for beta-lactamase producers or recent amoxicillin exposure, treat for 10 days if under 2 years or severe, 7 days if 2–5 years with mild to moderate disease, and 5–7 days if 6 years or older with mild to moderate disease; observe rather than treat in selected older children with nonsevere, unilateral disease and ensure close follow-up; for otitis media with effusion, avoid antibiotics and steroids and observe with hearing surveillance; for otitis externa, use ofloxacin otic 5 drops once daily for 7 days in children 6 months to 13 years; and treat pain proactively with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in all scenarios [^112PEiiR] [^1135fz6j] [^111eTJjM] [^111eJxRX] [^115wkSsV] [^114pQr6t].

---

Treatment of pediatric otitis depends on the type: **AOM** is managed with high-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily) [^112PEiiR] for most children, with amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate, divided twice daily) [^112PEiiR] if there is recent amoxicillin use, concurrent conjunctivitis, or beta-lactamase risk [^114FpdgU]. For **OME**, observation is first-line [^111eJxRX] and antibiotics are not recommended unless AOM features are present [^111eJxRX]. For **otitis externa**, topical ofloxacin 0.3% drops are used: 5 drops once daily for 7 days in children 6 months–13 years, or 10 drops once daily if ≥ 13 years [^115wkSsV]. Always treat pain [^114pQr6t] and reassess in 48–72 hours if symptoms persist [^113y75pc].

## Acute otitis media (AOM)

### First-line antibiotic therapy

- **High-dose amoxicillin**: 80–90 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours (maximum 3 g/day) [^112PEiiR] for most children ≥ 6 months without recent amoxicillin use or beta-lactamase risk [^116ujukL].

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate (14:1 ratio) [^112PEiiR] divided every 12 hours for recent amoxicillin use, concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or beta-lactamase risk [^114FpdgU].

- **Duration**: 10 days for children < 2 years or with severe symptoms; 7 days for ages 2–5 with mild/moderate symptoms; 5–7 days for ≥ 6 years with mild/moderate symptoms [^1135fz6j].

---

### Alternative antibiotics (if allergic or intolerant)

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|
| Cefdinir | 14 mg/kg/day once daily or divided every 12 hours (max 600 mg/day) |
| Cefuroxime | 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours (max 1 g/day) |
| Ceftriaxone | 50 mg/kg IM/IV once daily (max 1 g/day) for 1–3 days |
| Azithromycin | 10 mg/kg/day on day 1, then 5 mg/kg/day on days 2–5 (max 500 mg/day) [^114eGiuy] |

---

### Observation strategy

Observation is appropriate for **children ≥ 6 months** with nonsevere unilateral AOM and reliable follow-up, with antibiotics if no improvement in 48–72 hours [^1162orWZ] [^112KSmBB].

---

## Otitis media with effusion (OME)

Observation is first-line because most cases resolve spontaneously; **routine antibiotics are not recommended** [^111eJxRX] [^115cw4ZV]. Reserve antibiotics for cases with documented AOM features or persistent effusion with hearing loss and functional impact after 3 months [^notfound].

---

## Otitis externa (swimmer's ear)

Topical ofloxacin 0.3% drops are first-line: **5 drops once daily for 7 days** in children 6 months–13 years, or 10 drops once daily if ≥ 13 years [^115wkSsV]. Warm the bottle and maintain the position for 5 minutes to enhance penetration [^115wkSsV].

---

## General principles and follow-up

Pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen is essential [^117JTqVo], and **reassess in 48–72 hours** if symptoms persist or worsen [^113y75pc]. Avoid topical analgesics if the tympanic membrane is perforated [^117JTqVo].

---

Treatment of pediatric otitis is tailored to type: **AOM** uses high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate with age-based duration, **OME** is observed without routine antibiotics, and **otitis externa** is treated with topical ofloxacin. Always address pain and reassess if symptoms persist.

### Current approaches to otitis media [^111qtShY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children, and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria that are implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, particularly the following: improvement in diagnostic accuracy; reduction in antibiotic use; selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage; reduction in duration of treatment, when possible; and implementation of new vaccines.

### Otitis media: review of the 2004 treatment guidelines [^114T49UA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the 2004 treatment guidelines provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) regarding the treatment of otitis media in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, restricted to English-language articles about pediatric patients, was conducted (1966-May 2005) using the key words acute otitis media (AOM), guideline, observation therapy, and vaccination. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of cited articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies related to the fundamental basis of the updated guidelines and articles addressing current issues related to otitis media infection were included.

Data Synthesis

Otitis media affects many children in the US. Concerns have been raised about the proper treatment of AOM in the face of increasing drug resistance among primary pathogens responsible for infection. Some countries have chosen to observe patients for a designated period of time prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. The AAP and AAFP have updated the treatment guidelines for otitis media to include the option of observation therapy, recommendations for dosing of various antibiotic regimens and their place in therapy, and the importance of initial pain management.

Conclusions

Updated treatment guidelines for otitis media have been developed in an effort to properly treat children while decreasing current resistance rates for common organisms that cause AOM. In the future, the therapeutic outcomes of observation therapy related to both the incidence of drug resistance and the possibility of increased complications related to otitis media will need to be evaluated in the US.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Antibiotic dosing for acute otitis media in children: a weighty issue [^113aRtzh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 guidelines on diagnosis and management of acute otitis media (OM) recommends use of high-dose amoxicillin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated OM. With rising childhood obesity, recommended amoxicillin dose of 80 to 90 mg/kg per day often exceed standard adult dose of 1500 mg/d.

Objective

To study prescribing patterns of primary care physicians for amoxicillin in the treatment of OM. To assess opinions of American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee members who participated in guideline formulation.

Methods

This study had 2 parts. Part 1: Retrospective review of medical records of children visiting the hospital between April and June 2008 and with a diagnosis of OM and were prescribed amoxicillin. Part 2: Web-based survey of 14 members of the OM guidelines subcommittee.

Results

Part 1: Three hundred fifty-nine children were eligible, with a mean (SD) age of 3.2 (4.0) years and 185 (51.5%) of whom were males. Children weighing 20 kg or less received higher mean daily dose of amoxicillin (74.2 vs 40.4 mg/kg per day, P < 0.00). Part 2: Nine (64.3%) subcommittee members responded to the survey. Most (77.8%) affirmed that the impact of obesity on high-dose amoxicillin recommendation was not discussed during guideline formulation. If a patient's estimated amoxicillin dose exceeded the standard adult dose (1500 mg/d), 66.7% members would prescribe the standard adult dose whereas 33.3% would prescribe the recommended dose of 80 to 90 mg/kg per day.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians prescribe a significantly lower-than-recommended amoxicillin dose in older children and those in the higher weight category. The opinion among subcommittee members regarding maximum dose specification of amoxicillin is varied.

### Ofloxacin otic (ofloxacin) [^115wkSsV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Otitis Externa: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of otitis externa is:

For pediatric patients (from 6 months to 13 years old): Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.

For patients 13 years and older: Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.

The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for five minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Acute Otitis Media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients (from 1 to 12 years old) with tympanostomy tubes is:

Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for ten days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness that may result from the instillation of a cold solution.

The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media with perforated tympanic membranes: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membranes in patients 12 years and older is:

Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for fourteen days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, before instilling the drops. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^115EmKpe]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: evaluating the evidence [^111MDeQS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

---

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115vFj9E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Otitis Externa

The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of otitis externa is:

For pediatric patients (from 6 months to 13 years old): Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.
For patients 13 years and older: Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.
The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for five minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Acute Otitis Media in Pediatric Patients with Tympanostomy Tubes

The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients (from one to 12 years old) with tympanostomy tubes is:

Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for ten days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness that may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media with Perforated Tympanic Membranes

The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membranes in patients 12 years and older is:

Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for fourteen days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness that may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, before instilling the drops. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Introduction

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common reason for primary care visits in children. Yet, there is considerable debate on the most effective treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments (analgesics, antibiotics, and myringotomy) in children with AOM? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, immediate antibiotics, longer courses of antibiotics, and myringotomy.

### Pediatric acute otitis media: the case for delayed antibiotic treatment [^113CsUn7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.

### Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [^1134yM7r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed as a treatment of choice. The conventional recommendation is either three or four daily doses. However, nowadays it is frequently prescribed as once or twice daily doses. If once or twice daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is as effective for acute otitis media as three or four times a day, it may be more convenient to give the medication once or twice a day to children and hence improve compliance.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children; and to compare complication rates and adverse reactions.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1950 to March week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013) and the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials and assessed trial quality based on selection bias, performance bias and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We defined the quality grading as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. We summarised the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five studies with 1601 children in the review. Pooled analysis demonstrated that the following outcomes were comparable between the two groups: clinical cure at the end of therapy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07); during therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.33) and at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09); recurrent AOM (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81); compliance rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10) and overall adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.63). When we performed subgroup analysis separately for trials with amoxicillin only and amoxicillin/clavulanate only, it showed that all important outcomes were comparable between once or twice daily groups and the three times daily group. The risk of bias amongst the five included studies was as follows: for random sequence generation we graded two studies as low and three unclear risk of bias; for allocation concealment all studies were at unclear risk of bias; for blinding (performance and detection bias) we graded four as high and one as unclear risk of bias; for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) we graded two low, two high and one as unclear risk of bias; for reporting bias four were at low and one at high risk; and for 'other' bias four were at low and one at unclear risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review showed that the results of using once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three doses for the treatment of AOM.

### Pediatric ear, nose, and throat emergencies [^1144gKTe]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most common infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in children, resulting in more than 20 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. New practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated acute otitis media. This article reviews those guidelines, several other common ear, nose, and throat entities, including sinusitis and dental emergencies, and current strategies in diagnosis and treatment.

### Large dosage amoxicillin / clavulanate, compared with azithromycin, for the treatment of bacterial acute otitis media in children [^116avFi8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A large dosage pediatric formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate with an improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile was developed to eradicate many penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains).

Methods

This randomized, investigator-blinded, multicenter trial examined treatment of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) in children 6–30 months of age with amoxicillin/clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 10 days) versus azithromycin (10 mg/kg for 1 day followed by 5 mg/kg/d for 4 days). Tympanocentesis was performed at entry for bacteriologic assessment, at the on-therapy visit (day 4–6) to determine bacterial eradication and at any time before the end-of-therapy visit (day 12–14) if the child was categorized as experiencing clinical failure. Clinical assessments were performed at the on-therapy, end-of-therapy and follow-up (day 21–25) visits.

Results

We enrolled 730 children; AOM pathogens were isolated at baseline for 249 of the amoxicillin/clavulanate group and 245 of the azithromycin group. For children with AOM pathogens at baseline, clinical success rates at the end-of-therapy visit were 90.5% for amoxicillin/clavulanate versus 80.9% for azithromycin (P < 0.01), and those at the on-therapy and follow-up visits were 94.9% versus 88.0% and 80.3% versus 71.1%, respectively (all P < 0.05). At the on-therapy visit, pretherapy pathogens were eradicated for 94.2% of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate versus 70.3% of those receiving azithromycin (P < 0.001). Amoxicillin/clavulanate eradicated 96.0% of S. pneumoniae (92.0% of fully penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae) and 89.7% of H. influenzae (85.7% [6 of 7 cases] of beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae). Corresponding rates for azithromycin were 80.4% (54.5%) for S. pneumoniae and 49.1% (100% [1 of 1 case]) for H. influenzae (all P < 0.01 for between-drug comparisons).

Conclusion

Amoxicillin/clavulanate was clinically and bacteriologically more effective than azithromycin among children with bacterial AOM, including cases caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1138jF4i]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and dosing: Early studies show that 19% of children with S pneumoniae and 48% with H influenzae cultured on initial tympanocentesis who were not treated with antibiotic cleared the bacteria at the time of a second tympanocentesis 2 to 7 days later, and approximately 75% of children infected with M catarrhalis experienced bacteriologic cure even after treatment with amoxicillin, an antibiotic to which it is not susceptible. Current US data indicate that approximately 83% and 87% of isolates of S pneumoniae from all age groups are susceptible to regular (40 mg/kg/day) and high-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily), respectively. High-dose amoxicillin will yield middle ear fluid levels that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of all S pneumoniae serotypes that are intermediately resistant to penicillin (penicillin MICs, 0.12–1.0 μg/mL), and may not hit all highly resistant serotypes (penicillin MICs, ≥ 2 μg/mL) for a longer period of the dosing interval and has been shown to improve bacteriologic and clinical efficacy.

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^113tSKY3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.

### Rational prescribing is important in all settings [^113Yg46J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Legislation has been introduced in both Europe and the USA to facilitate clinical trials in paediatric patients of all ages. The legislation is to be welcomed if it results in increased scientific evidence to enable health professionals to use medicines more effectively and safely. This was certainly the aim of the health professionals who highlighted the extent of off-label prescribing in children. It is important to recognise, however, that health professionals have a responsibility to use the scientific evidence that is generated to prescribe medicines in a rational manner.

The evaluation of whether medicines are prescribed rationally unfortunately is difficult. There has been insufficient research on developing validated tools to assess prescribing, especially in children. Quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing have been developed by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption project. The majority of the quality indicators relate to adults, but three relate specifically to children. These three quality indicators suggest that no more than 20% of children seen in a clinic with an acute upper respiratory tract infection, acute tonsillitis or acute otitis media should be prescribed oral (systemic) antibiotics. It is only through the development of drug-specific and disease-specific quality indicators for other medicines that one will be able to ensure children receive the appropriate medicine whenever they see a health professional.

Before prescribing any medicine, doctors should always ask themselves the following questions. First, is there evidence that the medicine is effective in treating the disease that the patient presents with and, additionally, is it effective in the age group of the patient with the disease? Second, do the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks associated with the treatment? We all have a responsibility to our patients to ensure that we use medicines that are both safe and effective, but also that they are used in a rational manner.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115PKrFc]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic choice and comparative trial design — notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

### Otitis media with effusion: our national practice [^115PqCey]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the focus of an updated multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline published by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Based on data from clinical trials, the guideline recommends against using antihistamines, antibiotics, oral steroids, and intranasal steroids for OME. To understand practice patterns related to these guidelines, we assessed nationally representative data. Despite controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other potential confounders individualized for each medication class, an increased risk of antihistamine (odds ratio [OR], 3.53), antibiotic (OR, 4.31), and intranasal steroid administration (OR, 3.58) was seen when OME was diagnosed. These analyses have demonstrated opportunities for quality improvement in the care of patients with OME, quantifying gaps in practice relevant to proposed quality measures. Education targeted according to practice setting may facilitate appropriate therapy and/or referral for definitive intervention in children with OME.

### Medical and surgical management of otitis media in children [^112uyzwf]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

### High-dose versus standard-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media [^114j6VD5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has led to a recommendation to use high-dose (HD) amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/d) rather than standard-dose (SD) amoxicillin (40–45 mg/kg/d) to treat children with acute otitis media (AOM).

Objective

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of HD versus SD amoxicillin among children with AOM who were considered at low risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, 3-year clinical trial was conducted using participants who met the following criteria: age > 3 mo, weight ≤ 18 kg, diagnosed with AOM, and candidates for treatment with amoxicillin. The primary endpoint was treatment success at a 3- to 4-day follow-up visit based on the clinical decision to continue the prescribed antibiotic therapy for AOM. Other endpoints included duration of illness, number of office visits and telephone calls related to illness, total number of subsequent AOM episodes, and number of adverse effects.

Results

The absolute difference in antibiotic failure rate with SD versus HD amoxicillin at the follow-up visit was nonsignificant (95% CI -1.5% to 3.4%; p = 0.78). The mean duration of illness was similar for both doses of amoxicillin (3 ± 2 d). The number of office visits and telephone calls related to illness and the number of subsequent AOM episodes did not differ between the 2 treatment groups. HD amoxicillin did not result in a greater incidence of adverse effects than SD amoxicillin.

Conclusions

HD amoxicillin had neither benefit nor detriment compared with SD for AOM in children at low risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^113XAvco]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We found evidence that adherence to the Finnish Current Care guidelines on the treatment of OM in children was rather good. Less than half received antibiotics, and the great majority received amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which were the first-choice recommendations in the guidelines. To further increase concordance, active interventions should especially be targeted to tackle the identified challenges (eg, specialty or age group). Existing EHR systems could be armed with automated guideline-specific algorithms tailored according to diagnosis, patient group and physician's specialty. Combining such systems with real-time monitoring and systematic feedback for physicians could facilitate the adaptation of various guidelines to day-to-day practice.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1146Yxup]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) — magnitude and limits — Long-term, low-dose antibiotic use, referred to as antibiotic prophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis, has been used to treat children with recurrent AOM to prevent subsequent episodes. A 2006 Cochrane review analyzed 16 studies and found such use prevented 1.5 episodes of AOM per year and reduced by half the number of episodes during treatment; randomized placebo-controlled trials reported a decrease of 0.09 episodes per month, approximately 0.5 to 1.5 AOM episodes per year for 95% of children, with an estimated 5 children needing treatment for 1 year to prevent 1 episode of OM, and the effect may be more substantial for children with 6 or more AOM episodes in the preceding year. This decrease occurred only while prophylactic antibiotic was being given and a 6-month course does not have longer-lasting benefit after cessation; Teele showed no differences versus placebo in AOM recurrences or persistence of OME. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not appropriate for children with long-term MEE or infrequent episodes of AOM, and any small reduction must be weighed against cost, potential adverse effects such as allergic reaction and gastrointestinal consequences like diarrhea, and contribution to bacterial resistance.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute otitis media (AOM) pain management states Key Action Statement 2: "The management of AOM should include an assessment of pain. If pain is present, the clinician should recommend treatment to reduce pain" with "Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Strong Recommendation". Pain is the major symptom of AOM. Antibiotic therapy "does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours and even after 3 to 7 days, there may be persistent pain, fever, or both in 30% of children younger than 2 years", whereas "analgesics do relieve pain associated with AOM within 24 hours and should be used whether antibiotic therapy is or is not prescribed; they should be continued as long as needed". The management of pain "should be addressed regardless of the use of antibiotics", and "Treating pain is essential whether or not antibiotics are prescribed". Choice of analgesic is intentionally unspecified, and clinicians should select therapy on "the basis of a consideration of benefits and risks" and "incorporate parent/caregiver and patient preference". Topical analgesics are excluded "in the presence of a perforated TM".

### Otitis media in children (acute) [^111Dzxuh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, about 30% of children under 3 years of age visit their GPs each year with acute otitis media (AOM), and 97% of these receive antibiotics. In the USA, AOM is the most common reason for outpatient antibiotic treatment. Without antibiotics, AOM resolves within 24 hours in about 60% of children, and within 3 days in about 80% of children.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for AOM in children; and what are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, immediate antibiotics, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, longer courses of antibiotics, myringotomy, pneumococcal vaccination, tympanostomy with ventilation tubes.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^117RDWL8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common complication of respiratory tract infections in children. Over 130,000 acute OM cases were diagnosed and treated in Finnish children in public health care centers in 2014. Nearly half of the infants have suffered from acute OM during their first living year and 70% before the age of 2 years. Among 17 European evidence-based guidelines, all recommend analgesics, and 15 recommend the wait-and-see practice in selected cases, and when treated, 14 recommend amoxicillin as the first-choice antibiotics: 7 with the dose of 40–50 mg/kg/day and 7 with the dose of 90 mg/kg/day.

The Finnish Current Care Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of OM, which were published in 2011 and updated in 2017, are in line with the European guidelines. The Finnish guidelines recommend that children younger than 24 months of age, and children with bulging eardrum, draining middle ear or purulent OM in both ears should be treated immediately, and the first-line antibiotics are amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. High amoxicillin dosing is not needed due to the low frequency of pneumococcal penicillin resistance in the country. Second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfa and macrolides are the second-line drugs recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Children 2 years of age and upward with less prominent clinical findings can be left without antibiotics, but they must be reexamined after 2 to 3 days if the symptoms continue.

A task force set up by the European Paediatric Association concluded that the overconsumption of antibiotics in children with spontaneously recovering respiratory tract infections is 1 of the 4 most important health care problems in children in Europe. Indeed, many children with signs and symptoms of OM during acute respiratory infection recover spontaneously, and a wait-and-see practice with delayed introduction of antibiotics, if needed, is justified in appropriate cases and eventually reduces the consumption of antibiotics at the population level.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate antibiotic prescriptions for children with OM in a nationwide private network of outpatient clinics in Finland. Special focus was paid to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions, which have been the first-choice recommendations since 2017, according to Finnish guidelines. A nationwide dataset allowed an estimation of variations by age, time, region and the specialty of the physicians. Further, we were interested in identifying potential needs and specific areas for future active interventions antibiotic use among children with OM.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1167djHn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed; a systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of 85.6% in high-income countries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in 1997 and updated in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL, LILACS and two trial registers. The date of the search was 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo, and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: 1) pain at various time points (24 hours, two to three days, four to seven days, 10 to 14 days), and 2) adverse effects likely to be related to the use of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were: 1) abnormal tympanometry findings, 2) tympanic membrane perforation, 3) contralateral otitis (in unilateral cases), 4) AOM recurrences, 5) serious complications related to AOM and 6) long-term effects (including the number of parent-reported AOM symptom episodes, antibiotic prescriptions and health care utilisation as assessed at least one year after randomisation). We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest.

Main Results

Antibiotics versus placebo We included 13 trials (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries, which we assessed at generally low risk of bias. Antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01; 5 trials, 1394 children; high-certainty evidence), or at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 7 trials, 1264 children), but result in almost a third fewer children having pain at two to three days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20; 7 trials, 2320 children; high-certainty evidence), and likely result in two-thirds fewer having pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7; 1 trial, 278 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics increase the risk of adverse events such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14; 8 trials, 2107 children; high-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduce the risk of children having abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; NNTB 11; 7 trials, 2138 children), slightly reduce the risk of experiencing tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89; NNTB 33; 5 trials, 1075 children) and halve the risk of contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11; 4 trials, 906 children). However, antibiotics do not reduce the risk of abnormal tympanometry findings at six to eight weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13; 3 trials, 953 children) and at three months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 3 trials, 809 children) or late AOM recurrences (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; 6 trials, 2200 children). Severe complications were rare, and the evidence suggests that serious complications do not differ between children treated with either antibiotics or placebo. Immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation We included six trials (1556 children) from high-income countries. The evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may result in a reduction of pain at two to three days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; NNTB 8; 1 trial, 396 children; low-certainty evidence), but probably do not reduce the risk of pain at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12; 4 trials, 959 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the risk of pain at 11 to 14 days (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 1 trial, 247 children; low-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics increase the risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.51; NNTH 10; 3 trials, 946 children; high-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce the proportion of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks and evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may not reduce the risk of tympanic membrane perforation and AOM recurrences. No serious complications occurred in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics probably have no effect on pain at 24 hours, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. For most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. Therefore, clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: an assessment [^115xj3BT]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evidence-based guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobials in children with acute otitis media (AOM).

Methods

Compliance with CDC's recommended diagnostic criteria and antimicrobial treatments for management of AOM was assessed by chart review and self-report for 29 community pediatricians in St. Louis, Missouri. For each physician, a simple random sample of AOM visits was selected and reviewed by trained reviewers. In addition, each physician completed a questionnaire.

Results

Compliance with recommended diagnostic criteria was 38% (95% confidence interval: 34%-42%; n = 573) by chart audit and 41% (95% confidence interval: 24%-61%; n = 29) by self-report. Antimicrobial selection assessed by chart audit was consistent with CDC guidelines in 68% (95% confidence interval: 64%-72%) of visits for a new infection, 63% (95% confidence interval: 47%-78%) of visits for treatment failure, and 50% (95% confidence interval: 33%-67%) for recurrent disease. Self-reported compliance with treatment guidelines for new infection was 100% (95% confidence interval: 88%-100%) and 83% (95% confidence interval: 64%-94%) for treatment failure. Noncompliance was most frequently attributable to overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Most patients treated with amoxicillin received a 10-day course (98%). Subtherapeutic dosing occurred in 26% of patients treated with amoxicillin.

Conclusions

Overdiagnosis of AOM is common. Efforts to improve the judicious use of antimicrobials for AOM should focus on improving diagnostic accuracy, limiting the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials to cases where they offer clinical benefit, and ensuring that amoxicillin dosing regimens are optimal.

### Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [^112NXyrP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which the antibiotic amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 1), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialized Register; MEDLINE (January 1950 to March 2008); EMBASE (1974 to March 2008); the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2008); and NLM Gateway (HSRProj) (March 2008).

Selection Criteria

We included studies if they met the following criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by the following explicit criteria: acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials. We assessed quality based on selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and sample size calculation. The quality grading was defined as low risk of bias, moderate risk of bias or high risk of bias. The results were summarized as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included six studies with 1601 children in the review. Although the clinical cure rates at the end of therapy and at the follow-up periods of each study were shown to be comparable between the two groups, we did not perform pooled data analysis because of moderate to high risk of biases in the included studies. Most of the children were aged 2 months to 12 years. None of the studies had any consistently significant results either for benefit or harm. The outcomes were assessed at the end of therapy (often 10 days) and this may have been too late to measure any differences.

Authors' Conclusions

This review showed insufficient evidence to judge whether once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three or four daily doses for the treatment of AOM. The evidence appears to be biased and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^113XcijU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Pediatric Patients

Based on the amoxicillin component, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be dosed as follows:

Neonates and Infants Aged < 12 weeks (< 3 months): The recommended dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, based on the amoxicillin component. Experience with the 200 mg/5 mL formulation in this age group is limited, and thus, use of the 125 mg/5 mL oral suspension is recommended.

Patients Aged 12 weeks (3 months) and Older: See dosing regimens provided in Table 1. The every 12 hour regimen is recommended as it is associated with significantly less diarrhea [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Table 1: Dosing in Patients Aged 12 weeks (3 months) and Older

aEach strength of suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is available as a chewable tablet for use by older children.

bDuration of therapy studied and recommended for acute otitis media is 10 days.

Patients Weighing 40 kg or More: Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations.

The 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg, due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (250/125) versus the 250 mg/62.5 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (Chewable).

2.3 Patients with Renal Impairment

Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe. Renal impairment patients with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min should not receive the 875 mg/125 mg dose. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.

Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.

### Otitis media [^117N8kDP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is diagnosed based on visualization of a full or bulging tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion. The distribution of bacteria causing AOM in North America under the influence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and antibiotic selection pressure has resulted in a predominance of β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae followed by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although guidelines continue to endorse amoxicillin as the preferred treatment, amoxicillin/clavulanate in high dosage would be the preferred treatment based on the otopathogen mix currently. Antibiotic prophylaxis has fallen into disfavor as a preventative strategy for AOM recurrences.

### AOM in children [^1132AEjn]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, about 30% of children under 3 years of age visit their GP each year with acute otitis media (AOM), and 97% of these receive antibiotics. In the US, AOM is the most common reason for outpatient antibiotic treatment. Without antibiotics, AOM resolves within 24 hours in about 60% of children, and within 3 days in about 80% of children.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for AOM in children; and what are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 29 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, immediate antibiotics, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, longer courses of antibiotics, myringotomy, pneumococcal vaccination, tympanostomy with ventilation tubes, xylitol syrup or gum, and influenza vaccination.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1137FsEi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the USA, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9). Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3).

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.

### Otitis media and its consequences: beyond the earache [^114CgyV2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and paediatric infections met to explore where consensus exists on the management of acute otitis media. After informal discussions among several specialists of paediatric infectious disease, the group was expanded to include a larger spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease. Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in children in most countries and to a substantial burden of deafness and suppurative complications in developing countries. The group attempted to move beyond the existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media, and to propose to clinicians and public health officials their views on the actions needed to be taken to reduce the disease burden caused by acute otitis media and the microbial antibiotic resistance from the resulting use of antibiotics. Definition of acute otitis media and diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who will potentially benefit from treatment with antibiotics and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. Although the group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children who do not seem to have the disease, no consensus could be reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children, reflecting the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies. The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics to prevent further increases in antibiotic resistance. Prevention of acute otitis media with existing and future viral and bacterial vaccines seems the most promising approach to affect disease burden and consequences, both in developed and developing countries.
