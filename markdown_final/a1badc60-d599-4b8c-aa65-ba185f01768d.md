## Question

What are the diagnostic criteria for mm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma, incorporating SLiM-CRAB, the distinction from smoldering myeloma, required investigations, and key nuances such as special entities and evolving evidence on risk of progression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core requirement of clonal plasma cell proliferation that underpins any diagnosis. Then, I should confirm the traditional CRAB end-organ damage thresholds. Next, I will integrate the SLiM biomarkers added by IMWG in 2014 and map them into a coherent diagnostic algorithm. After that, I need to delineate smoldering multiple myeloma criteria and the baseline workup across labs, marrow, cytogenetics, and imaging. Finally, I should address special considerations like non-secretory disease, plasma cell leukemia, and amyloidosis screening, and close with the evolutionary rationale, including the recent reappraisal of SLiM risks and a succinct diagnostic summary [^114RUPwy] [^114qKbBM].

> Let me first confirm the core requirement, because if I miss this the downstream criteria can be misapplied. Diagnosis of active myeloma or its precursor states demands evidence of a clonal plasma cell process, typically demonstrated by at least 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells on aspirate or trephine with immunophenotypic confirmation, or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma when marrow is not definitive, which distinguishes neoplasia from reactive plasmacytosis [^114RUPwy] [^112KpbYx].

> Next, I should review the CRAB criteria, but I need to ensure I use the updated thresholds. End-organ damage attributable to the plasma cell disorder includes hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, or bone lesions detected on modern imaging such as low-dose whole-body CT, PET-CT, or MRI; meeting at least one CRAB feature in the context of clonal plasma cells defines active disease requiring therapy, and IMWG 2014 clarified laboratory cutoffs and permitted advanced imaging beyond plain radiographs for bone disease [^114RUPwy].

> Now, I will incorporate the SLiM biomarkers that allow earlier diagnosis before overt CRAB develops, but I should be precise about each component. The IMWG added three biomarkers: at least 60% clonal bone marrow plasma cells on a single evaluation, an involved-to-uninvolved serum free light chain ratio of at least 100 with the involved chain concentration at least 100 mg/L, and more than one focal lesion of at least 5 mm on MRI or PET-CT, because patients meeting any of these have a near-inevitable risk of progression in early cohorts warranting treatment initiation as active myeloma [^114RUPwy].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging component so we do not overextend the "M" criterion. The "M" in SLiM specifically refers to more than one focal lesion on MRI of at least 5 mm, whereas PET-CT is validated for detecting lytic lesions as a CRAB bone disease criterion rather than as the SLiM "M" biomarker; advanced imaging choices for baseline evaluation include whole-body MRI, PET-CT, or low-dose whole-body CT, but only MRI supports the "M" biomarker per IMWG 2014, so I should correct the earlier parenthetical to MRI alone for SLiM while keeping PET-CT under CRAB bone disease and staging imaging recommendations [^114RUPwy] [^117EXSGP].

> Hold on, I should assemble the full algorithm in one place to avoid ambiguity. Active multiple myeloma is diagnosed when clonal plasma cells are present at 10% or more in the marrow or there is a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma, together with at least one CRAB feature or at least one SLiM biomarker, whereas patients with clonal plasma cells who do not meet any CRAB or SLiM criteria are classified as having smoldering myeloma and should not start therapy based on current disease-defining events alone [^114RUPwy].

> I will now examine the definition of smoldering multiple myeloma, and I should double-check the quantitative thresholds. SMM is defined by serum monoclonal protein of at least 30 g/L or urinary monoclonal protein of at least 500 mg per 24 hours and or clonal bone marrow plasma cells between 10% and 59%, with the absence of all myeloma-defining events per SLiM-CRAB and no amyloidosis or other plasma cell–mediated organ damage, reflecting an asymptomatic but higher-burden precursor state that requires close surveillance rather than immediate therapy [^112AcYDX] [^113FBrPb].

> Next, I should review the mandatory diagnostic investigations so the criteria can be applied and prognosis assessed, and I need to ensure I align with high-grade guidelines. Recommended laboratory assessment includes complete blood count, creatinine and eGFR, calcium, albumin, total immunoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chain assay, and confirmatory serum and urine immunofixation for typing, along with β2-microglobulin and LDH for tumor burden and prognosis; in cases with suspected amyloid, consider urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, troponin, and NT-proBNP to screen for organ involvement, recognizing that discordant results may require a 24-hour urine collection for protein electrophoresis and immunofixation to quantify light chain excretion [^114qKbBM] [^117E6CoQ] [^112GuWu2].

> I need to ensure the bone marrow evaluation captures both diagnosis and risk, so let me confirm the cytogenetic panel. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine with plasma cell immunophenotyping should be performed, and interphase FISH on CD138-selected cells is recommended in all patients at diagnosis, at minimum assessing t(4;14), t(14;16), t(11;14), del(17p), 1q gain, and 1p loss, with consideration of t(14;20) and hyperdiploidy as part of risk stratification that informs prognosis and initial therapeutic planning [^112KpbYx] [^1178VB3t] [^1139aQ2T].

> Let me consider imaging strategy carefully, because sensitivity differences can change classification. Whole-body MRI, preferably diffusion-weighted, provides the highest sensitivity for marrow infiltration and SLiM "M" lesions, PET-CT identifies metabolically active and extramedullary disease and contributes to CRAB bone disease assessment, and low-dose whole-body CT is superior to skeletal survey for lytic lesions; interval imaging is advised when a single indeterminate or solitary focal marrow lesion is present on MRI to clarify evolution and avoid premature labeling of active disease [^117EXSGP] [^115Vni84].

> But wait, what about special entities that can confound the standard criteria. Non-secretory myeloma requires marrow proof of clonality with light chain restriction by immunohistochemistry and often relies on PET-CT positive lesions for disease burden assessment, plasma cell leukemia is now recognized with at least 5% circulating plasma cells on peripheral smear given similar poor outcomes to the historical 20% threshold, and in patients with renal dysfunction where myeloma kidney is suspected but serum free light chains are lower than 500 mg/L, a renal biopsy should be considered to determine etiology and guide urgent management, while amyloidosis must be actively excluded in those with nephrotic-range proteinuria, cardiac dysfunction, or neuropathy due to therapeutic and prognostic implications [^117LXC85] [^1119FbJv] [^115gmYMB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about minimal residual disease in the diagnostic phase. MRD testing by next-generation flow or next-generation sequencing at sensitivities of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁶ is not required for diagnosis but is essential for response assessment and prognostication in contemporary practice and trials, and should be interpreted alongside advanced imaging to exclude extramedullary activity when declaring deep remission [^116V3urG] [^113bvGyn].

> I should double-check the evolutionary rationale and whether the original high progression risk that justified SLiM has held up over time. Early studies showed approximately 80% two-year progression for patients meeting a SLiM biomarker, which drove the 2014 redefinition to allow proactive therapy, but more recent meta-analytic data suggest stage migration with improved time to progression and lower two-year progression risk in post-2014 cohorts, especially for those with 60% marrow plasma cells or free light chain ratio at least 100, reinforcing the need for rigorous imaging to exclude occult CRAB disease and careful, guideline-concordant confirmation before initiating therapy under SLiM alone [^114RUPwy] [^116XqNRS] [^113AiZbk].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the final diagnostic formulation to ensure internal consistency. Active multiple myeloma is present when there are clonal plasma cells of at least 10% in bone marrow or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma along with at least one myeloma-defining event, which can be any CRAB feature attributable to the plasma cell disorder or any one SLiM biomarker consisting of 60% or greater clonal marrow plasma cells, an involved to uninvolved serum free light chain ratio of at least 100 with the involved chain at least 100 mg/L, or more than one MRI focal lesion of at least 5 mm, whereas the absence of any CRAB or SLiM event in a patient with 10% to 59% clonal plasma cells or an M-protein of at least 30 g/L defines smoldering myeloma and prompts close surveillance rather than immediate therapy [^114RUPwy] [^112AcYDX].

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) requires **≥ 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma**, plus at least one myeloma-defining event (MDE) [^114RUPwy] [^112KpbYx]. MDEs comprise **CRAB features** (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone lesions) or **SLiM biomarkers** (≥ 60% clonal plasma cells; involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio ≥ 100 with involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/L; or > 1 focal lesion ≥ 5 mm on MRI) [^114RUPwy] [^112KpbYx]. Essential diagnostics include bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics, serum and urine protein studies, and advanced imaging (PET-CT, whole-body MRI, or low-dose whole-body CT) [^112KpbYx] [^114qKbBM] [^117EXSGP]. These criteria distinguish MM from MGUS and SMM and guide timely treatment initiation.

## Diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma

IMWG 2014 criteria define MM as clonal plasma cell proliferation with **end-organ damage** or with **specific biomarkers indicating a high risk of progression** [^114RUPwy].

---

### Essential diagnostic components

Essential diagnostic components include **bone marrow examination** — ≥ 10% clonal plasma cells or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma — and **myeloma-defining events (MDEs)** — at least one CRAB feature or SLiM biomarker [^114RUPwy].

---

### CRAB criteria (end-organ damage)

| **Feature** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Hypercalcemia | Serum calcium > 0.25 mmol/L (> 1 mg/dL) above ULN or > 2.75 mmol/L (> 11 mg/dL) |
| Renal impairment | Creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine > 177 μmol/L (> 2 mg/dL) |
| Anemia | Hemoglobin > 2 g/dL below normal or < 10 g/dL |
| Bone lesions | - ≥ 1 osteolytic lesion on skeletal radiography <br/> - CT <br/> - Or PET-CT |

---

### SLiM biomarkers (myeloma-defining biomarkers)

| **Biomarker** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 60% clonal plasma cells | Bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60% [^114RUPwy] |
| Involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio ≥ 100 | Ratio ≥ 100 with involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/L [^114RUPwy] |
| > 1 focal lesion on MRI | > 1 focal lesion ≥ 5 mm on MRI [^114RUPwy] |

---

## Laboratory and imaging investigations

Accurate diagnosis and staging require **targeted laboratory and imaging studies**.

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate anemia and cytopenias [^114qKbBM].
- **Serum chemistry**: Calcium, creatinine, urea, immunoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum free light chain (SFLC) assay [^114qKbBM].
- **Immunofixation**: Confirm monoclonal protein [^114qKbBM].
- **Tumor burden and prognosis**: β-2 microglobulin, LDH, albumin [^114qKbBM].

---

### Bone marrow examination

Bone marrow examination entails an **aspirate and biopsy** to quantify plasma cells and perform phenotyping [^112KpbYx], plus **cytogenetic analysis** using interphase FISH on CD138-selected cells to assess t(4;14), t(14;16), t(11;14), del(17p), 1q+, 1p-, t(14;20), and hyperdiploidy [^1139aQ2T] [^1178VB3t].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging studies should include **PET-CT, whole-body MRI, or low-dose whole-body CT** to detect bone lesions and extramedullary disease [^117EXSGP]. Interval imaging is recommended for **solitary focal deposits on MRI** [^115Vni84].

---

## Differentiation from related plasma cell disorders

MM must be **distinguished from MGUS and SMM** based on plasma cell burden, monoclonal protein levels, and end-organ damage.

| **Criteria** | **MGUS** | **SMM** | **MM** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Plasma cells | < 10% | 10–59% | ≥ 10% |
| Monoclonal protein | Low | ≥ 30 g/L or urinary ≥ 500 mg/24h | Variable |
| End-organ damage | Absent | Absent | Present (CRAB or SLiM) |

---

## Clinical significance of early diagnosis

Early diagnosis using **SLiM-CRAB criteria** enables timely therapy to prevent irreversible organ damage and improve outcomes [^114RUPwy]. Early intervention in high-risk SMM reduces progression to symptomatic MM [^1162FHXe].

---

## Recent updates and controversies

- **SLiM-CRAB criteria**: Expanded MM definition to include high-risk biomarkers [^114RUPwy].
- **Imaging advances**: PET-CT and MRI improve detection of bone and extramedullary disease [^117EXSGP].
- **Controversies**: Early treatment in high-risk SMM and evolving definitions of high-risk MM remain debated.

---

The diagnosis of MM requires **≥ 10% clonal plasma cells or a plasmacytoma**, plus at least one MDE (CRAB or SLiM). Comprehensive laboratory and imaging assessments are essential to confirm the diagnosis, guide therapy, and distinguish MM from MGUS and SMM.

### International myeloma working group updated criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma [^114RUPwy]. The Lancet Oncology (2014). High credibility.

This International Myeloma Working Group consensus updates the disease definition of multiple myeloma to include validated biomarkers in addition to existing requirements of attributable CRAB features (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions). These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with the near-inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smoldering multiple myeloma. A delay in the application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients.

In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfill the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials and recommends that future studies analyze any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.

### Slim CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma' - A systematic review with meta-analysis [^113AiZbk]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

This analysis revealed significant heterogeneity between earlier and later studies, highlighting an approximately three times longer time to progression (TTP) and a 50% lower 2-year progression risk in patients with biomarker-defined multiple myeloma (MM) with ≥ 60% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) or a free light chain ratio (FLCratio) ≥ 100 reported in studies published after 2014, compared to earlier findings. For patients with more than one MRI-defined focal lesion, no comparison between time periods was possible, as no additional data were published after the initial reports dating from 2010 to 2014.

A similar trend, as seen in patients with an FLCratio ≥ 100, was noted for patients with an FLCratio below the threshold of 100. The TTP and 2-year risk of progression showed a more insidious course in patients enrolled in studies reported after the consensus, indicating a shift in patient characteristics towards more favorable prognostic factors in recent publications. This notion is supported by the meta-analysis, which showed a significant reduction in the odds ratios between patients meeting the thresholds for high-risk and those below the threshold for the respective markers in the later time period (p = 0.009 and p = 0.005 for BMPCs and FLCratio, respectively). The observed improvement in the prognosis of biomarker-defined MM patients in recent compared to early studies is probably due to a phenomenon called stage migration. Patients classified today as 'biomarker-defined' myeloma have undergone skeletal imaging studies that were not available in the early period.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^111d8KLL]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be challenging, even for experienced physicians, and requires close collaboration between numerous disciplines including orthopedics, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, hematology, and oncology before the final diagnosis of myeloma is made. The definition of multiple myeloma is based on the presence of clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and radiological markers of disease. Specific tests are needed both at presentation and during follow-up in order to reach the correct diagnosis and characterize the disease precisely; these tests can also serve prognostic purposes and are useful for follow-up of myeloma patients. Molecular analyses remain pivotal for defining high-risk myeloma and are used in updated patient stratifications, while minimal residual disease assessment via flow cytometry, molecular techniques, and radiological approaches provides additional prognostic information on patients' long-term outcome. This pivotal information will guide our future treatment decisions in forthcoming clinical trials. The European Myeloma Network group updated their guidelines on different diagnostic recommendations, which should be of value to enable appropriate use of the recommendations both at diagnosis and during follow-up.

### 2021 European myeloma network review and consensus statement on smoldering multiple myeloma: How to distinguish (and manage) Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde [^113VgCXq]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

"Asymptomatic", smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is situated in the middle of the continuum of monoclonal gammopathies. SMM is more advanced and carries a higher disease burden than monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). However, it does not exhibit the clinical features of end-organ damage or any other myeloma-defining events associated with active multiple myeloma (MM).

Among all patients with MM, 8–14% have SMM. These patients typically have a median age of onset of 67 years, an annual incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000 persons, and a higher prevalence among Americans of African descent. The median time to progression to active MM is approximately five years, with a variable annual progression rate of about 10% during the first five years, 3% for the next five years, and 1% thereafter. SMM, thus, represents a heterogeneous entity, ranging from 'MGUS-like' to 'early MM', in which malignant plasma cells can rapidly proliferate, leading to active MM. Notably, nearly one-third of SMM cases never progress, revealing an intriguing and challenging "split personality" of the condition.

For decades, the conventional approach to SMM has involved close observation, postponing treatment until the progression to active MM. Significant advances in disease biology, improved risk stratification, and novel therapies with better efficacy and lower toxicity have led to deeper responses and longer survival for patients with active MM. These advances have also prompted a reevaluation of SMM management, raising questions about whether earlier treatment could: (i) avoid or delay the progression to MM; (ii) prevent.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^111Di1jq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple myeloma, specifically concerning the assessment of treatment response for transplant-eligible patients, the ASCO/CCO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining whole-body low-dose CT over skeletal X-ray for baseline and routine bone surveillance. Consider obtaining FDG-PET/CT and/or MRI as alternatives at baseline or in selected situations, such as risk-stratifying smoldering myeloma, for monitoring the response of nonsecretory and oligosecretory myeloma, and if CT or skeletal survey is inconclusive.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when [^113bvGyn]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional flow-MRD approaches, based on multiple institutional non-standardized protocols, can reliably identify malignant plasma cells and discriminate aberrantly expressed cell surface markers in approximately 90% of patients, with a sensitivity of detecting 10⁻⁴ atypical plasma cells in normal bone marrow. Recent studies conducted by Spanish and UK groups have shown that negative MRD by multiparameter flow cytometry is predictive for both progression-free survival and overall survival, even in patients who achieved a complete response. Recent technical advances have increased the sensitivity of next-generation flow cytometry protocols down to the 10⁻⁶ range.

MRD analysis by PCR detects persistent residual tumor cells through the amplification of a tumor-specific molecular marker. The IGH rearrangement is used as a marker of clonality in various B-cell malignancies. Allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR with primers complementary to the heavy chain variable sequence remains one of the most sensitive approaches to detect residual malignant plasma cells, reaching a sensitivity of 10^−5. Unfortunately, it is a laborious, time-consuming approach that is not widely available because of its dependence on patient-specific primers and probes for quantitative PCR.

Next-generation sequencing of the IGH rearrangement segments provides insights into the architecture of the B-lineage repertoire with consensus primers. Since the B-lineage repertoire includes the malignant plasma cell clone in bone marrow, next-generation sequencing of IGH enables a quantitative determination of MRD without per-patient customization, provided that the ma… (content ends)

In 2014, strides were made in the care of haematological malignancies. In particular, the heterogeneity of multiple myeloma was unraveled, and new diagnostic criteria and frontline standards of care were proposed. New therapeutic approaches have been validated and approved in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and in chronic myeloid leukaemia, complete cytogenetic response was confirmed as the primary therapeutic endpoint.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^112GuWu2]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

In line with the IMWG guidelines, we recommend the SFLC assay for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with oligosecretory disease (Grade 2B). However, for patients with measurable urinary M-proteins, MM should be monitored by 24-hour urine collections. When albumin is the dominant protein found in the urine, a glomerulopathy (such as AL-amyloidosis or light-chain deposition disease) should be excluded. The 24-hour urine collection remains important when results are discordant.

### Shall we treat smoldering multiple myeloma in the near future [^112zaPgH]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, several new drugs have been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Many of these newer drugs are highly efficacious and less toxic than older chemotherapy drugs. In 2014, the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma were revised. The intent with the new criteria was to identify patients who require therapy at an earlier stage than at the manifestation of organ complications. A subset of patients who were previously defined as having high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma was redefined as having multiple myeloma.

In this context, it is logical to raise questions regarding the optimal clinical management of patients diagnosed with smoldering multiple myeloma. When is the optimal time to start therapy? Do the clinical trajectories for patients suggest there are distinct sub-entities hidden in the category of smoldering multiple myeloma? How can we move the field forward from here?

This paper reviews and dissects data and models on the topics of clinical features, underlying biology, and early treatment trials in smoldering multiple myeloma. The text highlights assumptions, facts, and gaps in the literature. As indicated in the title of the paper, the theme of the text is this: shall we treat smoldering multiple myeloma in the near future?

### Revised diagnostic criteria for plasma cell leukemia: Results of a Mayo Clinic study with comparison of outcomes to multiple myeloma [^114aWxcJ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this analysis includes the largest cohort of MM patients with CPCs present at the time of diagnosis and has the longest follow-up. Nevertheless, there are limitations that may hamper the generalizability of our results. First, the data are from a single tertiary center, which may introduce selection or referral bias; however, the proportion of patients with any CPCs (~2%) and with ≥ 20% CPCs (0.6%) is similar to that seen in population-based data, where 0.6% of MM patients had traditionally defined PCL (i.e. ≥ 20% CPCs), suggesting that our cohort is fairly representative of the typical myeloma population as a whole.

In addition, only ~40% of patients were diagnosed in the era of novel therapy (2001 onwards), which contributed to 75% who did not receive a hematopoietic cell transplant, an approach that has been shown to lead to encouraging outcomes with a 3-year OS of > 60% in pPCL. We also did not have cytogenetic information available in the majority of our PCL cohort and therefore could not assess the interaction between adverse cytogenetics and percentage of CPCs. We did not study the impact of using different cut-offs for absolute plasma cell count (e.g. 0.5 × 10⁹/L) as we feel that using the percentage of CPCs on a peripheral smear is simpler and easier for the practicing clinician. Finally, assessment of CPCs on a conventional cell count and differential is less sensitive than other techniques, such as slide-based immunofluorescence.

### Evolving diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma [^115J1Wps]. Hematology American Society of Hematology Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy historically defined by the presence of end-organ damage, specifically hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions (CRAB features) that can be attributed to the neoplastic process. In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) updated the diagnostic criteria for MM to add specific biomarkers that can be used to diagnose the disease in patients who did not have CRAB features. Additionally, the update allows modern imaging methods, including computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT, to diagnose MM bone disease. These changes enable early diagnosis and allow the initiation of effective therapy to prevent the development of end-organ damage in patients who are at the highest risk.

This article reviews these and several other clarifications and revisions that were made to the diagnostic criteria for MM and related disorders. The updated disease definition for MM also resulted in a revision of the diagnostic criteria for the asymptomatic phase of the disease, termed smoldering MM (SMM). Thus, the diagnosis and risk stratification of SMM are also reviewed in this article. Using specific prognostic factors, it is possible to identify a subset of patients with SMM who have a risk of progression to MM of 25% per year (high-risk SMM). An approach to the management of patients with low- and high-risk SMM is discussed.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^113SfDCX]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be challenging, even for experienced physicians, and requires close collaboration between numerous disciplines (orthopedics, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, hematology, and oncology) before the final diagnosis of myeloma is made. The definition of multiple myeloma is based on the presence of clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and radiological markers of disease. Specific tests are needed both at presentation and during follow-up in order to reach the correct diagnosis and characterize the disease precisely. These tests can also serve prognostic purposes and are useful for follow-up of myeloma patients.

Molecular analyses remain pivotal for defining high-risk myeloma and are used in updated patient stratifications, while minimal residual disease assessment via flow cytometry, molecular techniques, and radiological approaches provides additional prognostic information on patients' long-term outcomes. This pivotal information will guide our future treatment decisions in forthcoming clinical trials. The European Myeloma Network group updated their guidelines on different diagnostic recommendations, which should be of value to enable appropriate use of the recommendations both at diagnosis and during follow-up.

- **Time to progression data**:

The figure illustrates the time to progression (TTP) based on data from early versus recent publications. Specifically:

- **Patients with ≥ 60% BMPCs**: The median TTP increased from 9.2 months in earlier studies to 30.3 months in later studies, corresponding with a significant decrease in the 2-year risk of progression from 86.2% to 45.5%.

- **Patients with an FLC ratio ≥ 100**: A notable increase in median TTP from 15.3 to 48.1 months was observed, along with a decrease in the 2-year risk of progression from 73.0% to 31.6%.

- **Patients with > 1 focal lesion**: All relevant studies (published between 2010 and 2014) reported a median TTP of 15.1 months and a 2-year risk of progression of 67.3%; no later reports were available.

These outcomes were corroborated by a sensitivity analysis which excluded the five lowest-ranked quality assessments. The analysis indicated significant prolongation of TTP and a reduction in the 2-year risk of progression. Furthermore, a funnel plot analysis did not suggest any publication bias, as supported by a trim-and-fill analysis (see Supplementary File, Fig. S1).

### International staging system for multiple myeloma [^111aRPiv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma (ISS)" is a prognostic tool used specifically for patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. The ISS is designed to predict the survival outcome of these patients based on two laboratory values: serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum albumin levels. The ISS stratifies patients into three stages, with higher stages indicating a poorer prognosis. This calculator is crucial in guiding treatment decisions and informing discussions about prognosis with patients. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may be less accurate in patients with renal impairment as beta-2 microglobulin levels can be elevated in this condition.

The ISS evaluates disease severity and prognosis based on serum β₂ microglobulin and serum albumin levels. Understanding and defining the stage is essential for determining appropriate treatment and estimating median survival.

- **Input parameters**:
	- **Serum β₂ microglobulin**: 5.4 mg/L
	- **Serum albumin**: 3.5 g/dL

The process identifies the stage of multiple myeloma by checking these conditions:

1. **Stage I multiple myeloma**: Occurs when serum β₂ microglobulin is less than 3.5 mg/L and serum albumin is 3.5 g/dL or higher. This stage implies a generally favorable prognosis, with a median survival time of 62 months.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^114T5mNA]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies is based on clinical, biological, and radiological criteria but remains challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients.

The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria. These include bone marrow (BM) infiltration > 60%, an involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio > 100, or more than one focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur.

- **Diagnostic criteria**: Both the SLIM biomarker and CRAB criteria are essential for diagnosis.

Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and care of patients.

- **Differential diagnosis**: The differentiation between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma is based on:
	1. Plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow
	2. The presence of clinical symptoms

### SLiM CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^114GWQmb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

To obtain the best possible proxy for individual patient data, we digitized (using WebPlotDigitizer™) the published time to progression (TTP) curves of patients enrolled in the respective studies and then applied the algorithm described by Guyot et al. in R to obtain individual patient outcomes (see Supplementary File, Table S3 for a comparison of the digitized data and published estimates, where available). From these digitized data, we constructed TTP curves according to Kaplan-Meier for the combined data of the SLiM CRAB multiple myeloma groups available before and after the consensus was published using SPSS Statistics 27.

Hazard ratios and log-rank test p-values were calculated to compare curves from earlier publications with those from later publications. We calculated the median TTP as well as the 2-year progression risk for each group, as these are common endpoints reported in clinical studies. In particular, a high risk for progression within two years may be an indicator for considering early treatment. We further conducted a meta-analysis of the odds ratios comparing the 2-year progression risks, using published instead of digitized data wherever available.

The meta-analytic procedures were performed using the software ReviewManager (RevMan V. 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014): forest plots (random effects models) were constructed to show the pooled odds ratios for the risk of progression at 2 years of patients with high-risk criteria compared to those with criteria not meeting the threshold. Between-study and between-subgroup heterogeneity (I²) was tested. Of note, our methodology does not compensate for other variations.

### Gaps and opportunities in the treatment of relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma: Consensus recommendations of the NCI Multiple Myeloma Steering Committee [^114kcJ2t]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory disease is crucial as patients with multiple myeloma (MM) will experience their first relapse at variable intervals after diagnosis. Several important determinants of subsequent therapy include whether patients are on maintenance therapy at the time of relapse and whether they are refractory to maintenance therapies such as lenalidomide or bortezomib, or possibly both. It is important to ascertain whether an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody was part of the initial therapy, as maintenance or as continued treatment (e.g. in the setting of a clinical trial, a likely scenario with the wider adoption of this agent in upfront treatment).

Other significant factors include disease-intrinsic characteristics at relapse, such as biochemical relapse versus clinical relapse, duration of initial response (with shorter responses identifying high-risk disease), high-risk cytogenetic features, and clinical features at the time of relapse (e.g. anemia, renal dysfunction, bone lesions). Additionally, goals of therapy, including quality of life, and host factors such as associated comorbidities, prior toxicities, and frailty and its assessment, are important considerations.

### Slim CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma' - A systematic review with meta-analysis [^115iiUBv]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Early reports on the impact of single risk factors indicated a high risk of progression in patients with specific markers. The study by Rajkumar et al. published in 2011 included 655 patients with smoldering MM (SMM); 21 (3.2%) of those patients presented with ≥ 60% clonal BMPCs, and their median TTP was only 7 months, with a 2-year risk for progression of 95%. Kastritis et al. reported similar results with a median TTP of 15 months. A high risk for progression was also noted in patients with an FLC ratio ≥ 100 by Larsen et al. in a Mayo patient cohort in 2013, with a 2-year risk of progression of 72% and a median TTP of 15 months. Kastritis et al. reported even more alarming results in the same year, with a median TTP of 8 months.

Another high-risk factor for rapid progression was reported by Hillengass et al. in 2010. These authors noted a median TTP of 13 months in patients with > 1 MRI-defined focal lesions (FL) of 5 mm or greater diameter. Two additional reports confirmed the impact of > 1 MRI-defined focal lesion on rapid progression to MM with very similar findings. Kastritis et al. reported a median TTP of 15 months, while in the publication by Merz et al, the exact median TTP was not reported but can be inferred from the graph shown in their publication to a median of approximately 22 months. These studies, published between 2010 and 2014, prompted the International Myeloma Working Group to update the diagnostic criteria for MM and to include patients meeting the above-cited criteria (plus an involved FLC level of ≥ 100 mg/dl for patients with an FLC ratio ≥ 100) in the definition.

### Current state of evidence on definitions and management of high-risk multiple myeloma [^112aiDvQ]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

This review aims to address the subgroup of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have high-risk multiple myeloma (HRMM) and continue to experience poor outcomes despite recent therapeutic advances. We will explore various clinical, biochemical, imaging, genetic, and dynamic features associated with high-risk status, along with the different risk stratification tools developed to identify HRMM patients.

Although numerous parameters for defining HRMM have been proposed, a universally accepted definition remains absent. Studies have shown diverse treatment responses and varying outcomes in HRMM patients, prompting the development of tailored therapeutic approaches. Emerging evidence supports the need for refined definitions and more targeted strategies to improve HRMM management. HRMM patients represent an unmet need in NDMM treatment, and a standardized definition for HRMM is crucial for advancing research and clinical care. This review discusses future treatment options, the necessity for a consistent HRMM definition, and the importance of clinical trials focused on this high-risk group to bridge existing treatment gaps.

### International myeloma society/international myeloma working group consensus recommendations on the definition of high-risk multiple myeloma [^112nGvPz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Despite significant improvements in the survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), outcomes remain heterogeneous, and a significant proportion of patients experience suboptimal outcomes. Importantly, traditional prognostic factors based on data from patients treated with older therapies no longer capture prognosis accurately in the contemporary era of novel triplet or quadruplet therapies. Therefore, risk stratification requires refinement in the context of available and investigational treatment options in routine practice and clinical trials, respectively.

The identification of high-risk MM (HRMM) in routine practice is based on the Revised International Staging System, which stratifies patients using a combination of widely available serum biomarkers and chromosomal abnormalities assessed via fluorescence in situ hybridization. In recent years, a substantial body of evidence concerning additional clinical, biological, and molecular/genomic prognostic factors has accumulated, along with new MM risk stratification tools and consensus reports.

The International Myeloma Society, along with the International Myeloma Working Group, convened an expert panel with the primary aim of revisiting the definition of HRMM and formulating a practical and data-driven consensus definition based on new evidence from molecular/genomic assays, updated clinical data, and contemporary risk stratification concepts. The panel proposes the following consensus genomic staging (CGS) of HRMM, which relies upon the presence of at least one of these abnormalities: (1) del(17p), with a cutoff.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for plasma cell leukemia: Results of a Mayo Clinic study with comparison of outcomes to multiple myeloma [^117LXC85]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The definition of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) — ≥ 20% circulating plasma cells (CPCs) on peripheral smear and plasma cell count ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L — may be too stringent. We reviewed outcomes of 176 multiple myeloma (MM) patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2016, and who had CPCs detectable at diagnosis, to determine whether a lower threshold could be used to diagnose PCL. Median overall survival (mOS) was 1.1 years (95% CI 0.8–1.4) and was similar between patients with < 5% (n = 54, mOS = 1.4 years [0.7–2.0]), 5–19% (n = 63, mOS = 1.1 years [0.7–1.4]), and ≥ 20% CPCs (n = 59, mOS = 1.1 years [0.7–1.5], p = 0.349). As survival was similar between those with 5–19% and ≥ 20% CPCs, we stratified patients by < 5% (mOS = 1.4 years [0.7–2.0]) and ≥ 5% CPCs (mOS = 1.1 years [0.8–1.4], p = 0.154).

Outcomes of those with ≥ 5% CPCs were much poorer when compared with a cohort of MM patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2016, who did not have CPCs at diagnosis (n = 9724, mOS = 4.4 years [4.3–4.5], p < 0.001); survival was also lower in patients diagnosed after 2001 with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 62, mOS = 1.4 years [0.8–2.5]) compared with patients with standard risk (n = 1326, mOS = 7.5 years [7.0–8.7]) and high-risk MM (n = 381, mOS = 4.3 years [3.5–4.9], p < 0.001). We therefore propose that the definition of PCL be revised to patients with ≥ 5% CPCs on peripheral blood smear, who otherwise meet diagnostic criteria for MM.

### Functional cure and long-term survival in multiple myeloma: How to challenge the previously impossible [^115mVsef]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease with survival ranging from months to decades. The goal of a 'cure' remains elusive for most patients but has been shown to be possible, with durable remission and a transition to a plateau phase, analogous to monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or smoldering myeloma. In this review, two representative cases are presented to illustrate how this might be possible and what still needs to be determined to achieve functional disease control over a prolonged period.

Several developments have emerged, such as improved diagnostics, including the definitions and use of SLiM-CRAB criteria and measurable residual disease (MRD) with whole-genome or single-cell sequencing, as well as other correlates to better understand disease biology. These advances enable earlier detection, more accurate risk stratification, and improved personalized treatment strategies by facilitating analysis of genetic alterations and clonal heterogeneity. Whole-genome sequencing may also identify driver mutations and modes of resistance to immunotherapies and other targeted therapies.

Today, induction with a CD38 antibody, proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, and dexamethasone, potentially followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide maintenance, can be considered standard of care for transplant-eligible (TE) patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM). The possibility that prolonged disease control and functional cure can be achieved in non-transplant-eligible (NTE) patients is currently emerging as a distinct possibility: data from phase III trials are contributing to this evolving understanding.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^115r8diq]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

While novel agents have certainly improved the outcomes of patients with myeloma, prompt diagnosis and close follow-up of multiple myeloma (MM) patients remain highly relevant and contribute to better survival. In most cases, the diagnosis of MM is straightforward, based on biological and radiological evidence when evocative clinical signs are present. During response assessment, the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) will become increasingly important and, within the next few years, will guide treatment choices in clinical trials and possibly also outside trial scenarios. International efforts are needed to standardize the different techniques that can be used to evaluate MRD. Guidelines on appropriate follow-up and patient-tailored monitoring have been updated in this European Myeloma Network (EMN) consensus paper and should help to improve the outcome and prognosis of our patients.

### SLiM CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma' - a systematic review with meta-analysis [^116XqNRS]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Biomarker-defined patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) were included in the diagnostic category of multiple myeloma (MM) by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) in 2014. This includes ≥ 60% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), a free light chain ratio (FLCratio) ≥ 100, and more than one MRI-defined focal lesion ≥ 5 mm, also called SLiM CRAB MM. We examined whether the risk of progression of SLiM CRAB MM patients to CRAB positive MM in recent studies differs from those described in earlier reports published before the introduction of the new diagnostic criteria.

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and included studies from Embase and PubMed (01/01/2010–01/11/2022), selecting studies with digitizable progression curves. Inconsistent studies were excluded. We created forest plots using random effects models from digitized and published data and Kaplan-Meier curves. The main outcomes were median time to progression (TTP), 2-year progression risk, and odds ratios (ORs) comparing 2-year progression risks.

Our meta-analysis, including 11 studies with 3482 patients, found an approximately 3-fold longer TTP and a 50% lower 2-year progression risk of SLiM CRAB MM patients in recent publications (post-2014) compared with earlier studies. The median TTP in patients with ≥ 60% BMPCs was 30.31 months [18.71–62.93] in recent studies compared with 9.20 months [6.02–15.56] in earlier studies; the 2-year progression risk was 45.45% [20.12–62.75] compared with 86.21% [65.74–94.45] in the respective time periods. In patients with a FLCratio ≥ 100, th

- **Diagnosis and monitoring**: SMM is currently diagnosed according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, based on the amount of M-component, percentage of clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) infiltration, and the absence of end-organ damage (CRAB) or amyloidosis. Updated IMWG criteria re-classified 10–15% of patients previously diagnosed with SMM as "ultra-high-risk" SMM based on new myeloma-defining events (biomarkers of malignancy: > 60% BMPC, free light chains [FLC] ratio > 100, and > 1 focal lesion with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), known as the "SLIM CRAB" criteria. These patients are considered eligible for full MM treatments, with a risk of progression of about 80% at 2 years.

- **Imaging and risk stratification**: The new IMWG criteria emphasize the role of imaging in risk stratifying SMM, with patients having two or more focal lesions > 5 mm detected by MRI qualifying for active treatments. Particularly, the IMWG recommends sensitive low-dose whole-body CT for staging monoclonal gammopathies. This imaging technique was recently validated in a prospective study of 100 patients with SMM at different time points to identify early bone lesions related to MM evolution. If low-dose whole-body CT is negative, whole-body or spine and pelvis MRI, where possible, should be pursued, although the latter MRI protocol can miss around 10% of non-axial lesions. Given the spatial distribution of focal bone lesions, it has been recently suggested that the cutoff for the number of focal lesions should be adapted according to the MRI protocol used.

### Slim CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111rw7Si]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

For this systematic review with meta-analysis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and searched PubMed and EMBASE databases from January 1, 2010, to November 1, 2022. The search terms used are shown in Supplementary File, Table S1. Two authors (HL and SK) independently conducted hand-searching of the citation lists of the selected papers and abstracts recently presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) conference. Articles not including Kaplan–Meier curves on time to progression (TTP) and those using thresholds other than ≥ 60% BMPCs, FLC ratio ≥ 100, or > 1 focal lesion were excluded [see Supplementary File, Table S1]. In three cases of discrepant assessments, the authors discussed each argument and finally agreed upon inclusion or not.

The quality of the selected papers was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH), but we excluded questions 3, 5, 10, and 13 due to inapplicability [see Supplementary File, Table S2]. The Quality Assessment Tool was applied by two independent reviewers, and discrepancies in judgment were resolved through discussion. Although the quality of the publications varied [refer to Supplementary File, Table S3], we chose to use all available studies due to the good quality of the graphs and underlying data. The relevance of the research question was discussed during a scientific meeting in Würzburg organized by Prof. Einsele, with Prof. Gareth Morgan and Prof. Martin Kaiser co-chairing.

These recommendations were developed by a panel of clinical experts on multiple myeloma (MM) based on evidence from published data through August 2017. Where sufficient data were lacking, expert consensus was used to suggest recommendations. The final recommendations were classified based on the GRADE criteria, which incorporate the strength and quality of evidence (see online supplementary Table S1).

Guidelines were prepared based on discussions at the 2017 EMN Trialist meeting in Baveno, Italy, and circulated among all panel members. The manuscript underwent three rounds of revision until consensus was reached among the EMN experts. In line with the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, authorship was based on active contribution during the discussion, writing, and revision of the guidelines.

### How we approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^112sbHLG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) are precursor conditions for multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a malignancy of plasma cells traditionally defined by the presence of hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone lesions (the CRAB criteria). MGUS nearly always precedes the onset of MM.

SMM, initially described in 1980, occupies the middle space between MGUS and MM, with higher disease burden but without the clinical sequelae of the CRAB criteria or "myeloma" defining biomarkers. SMM is less common than MGUS, representing an estimated 13.7% of patients with MM, with 4,100 new patients per year. The rate of progression to active MM is 10% per year for the first 5 years, declines to 3% per year for the next 5 years, and is then 1% per year for the following 10 years. The cumulative probability of progression from SMM to MM is 73% at 15 years.

There is debate as to whether SMM is a condition to be treated as an early stage of MM or simply observed, as with MGUS. At the time of writing, neither genomic sequencing nor expression profiling have identified a molecular predictor for patients with SMM who progress to MM. It is possible that factors independent of the myeloma cell, but related to the microenvironment, play a more important role in disease progression.

### Slim CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma' — a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113Tt4eW]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The increasing awareness of monoclonal gammopathies and referral to hematologists likely has led to more frequent work-ups to exclude CRAB-positive multiple myeloma (MM) and thus to the inclusion of more patients with an insidious course of the disease in recent studies. The uptake of newer diagnostic measures also seems to explain the shift in the control groups with a lower free light chain (FLC) ratio (< 100) toward a more favorable prognosis in recent reports.

The small number of eligible studies available for comparing patients with bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) ≥ 60% and < 60%, with only one recent publication, as well as the small number of studies on focal lesions, is a limitation of this analysis. Another important limitation of this meta-analysis was the unavailability of accurate censored data for digitized individual patient data. Even though estimates for median time to progression (TTP) and 2-year progression risks obtained from the digitized data are very similar to the published values, the exact number of progressions or censorings, as well as their timing, could not be accurately obtained from the published figures. This was, inter alia, due to a lack of censoring ticks. Nevertheless, our estimates of median TTP and 2-year progression risk should be quite accurate (assuming a low proportion of early censorings), while confidence intervals, significance tests, and hazard ratios may deviate slightly from the original data. We must also mention that some studies used in this meta-analysis received a low-quality ranking according to the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.

### MRI in multiple myeloma: A pictorial review of diagnostic and post-treatment findings [^116jcnYp]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used in the diagnostic work-up of patients with multiple myeloma. Since 2014, MRI findings have been included in the new diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group. Patients with smouldering myeloma presenting with more than one unequivocal focal lesion in the bone marrow on MRI are considered to have symptomatic myeloma requiring treatment, regardless of the presence of lytic bone lesions.

However, bone marrow evaluation with MRI offers more than only morphological information regarding the detection of focal lesions in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The overall performance of MRI is enhanced by applying dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, which provide additional functional information on bone marrow vascularization and cellularity.

This pictorial review provides an overview of the most important imaging findings in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smouldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma, by performing a 'total' MRI investigation with implications for the diagnosis, staging, and response assessment.

### The role of diagnosis and clinical follow-up of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance on survival in multiple myeloma [^113hET62]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Multiple myeloma (MM) is consistently preceded by the precursor state, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The average annual risk of progression from MGUS to MM is 0.5% to 1.0%. Guidelines suggest lifelong clinical follow-up of individuals diagnosed with MGUS depending on risk stratification. The impact of diagnosing and conducting clinical follow-up of MGUS on MM survival is unclear.

- **Objective**: To estimate the impact of prior knowledge of MGUS diagnosis and comorbidities on MM survival.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We conducted a population-based study including all patients with MM diagnosed in Sweden (n = 14,798) from 1976 to 2005 (with follow-up until 2007); 394 (2.7%) had previously been diagnosed with MGUS. Information on comorbidities was gathered for all patients. We calculated survival rates from the time of MM diagnosis, comparing patients with vs. those without prior knowledge of MGUS. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors for death. χ² tests were used to evaluate differences in comorbidities.

- **Exposures**: Prior knowledge of MGUS among MM patients. In a subanalysis, monoclonal (M)-protein concentration and type were used as exposure.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Risk of death and comorbidities.

- **Results**: Patients with MM with prior knowledge of MGUS had significantly (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.96; p < 0.01) better overall survival (median survival, 2.8 years) than MM patients without prior knowledge of MGUS.

### Time to redefine myeloma [^111yJ9ac]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In November 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) revised the definition of multiple myeloma. The revision now includes asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who do not meet the traditional 'CRAB' criteria (hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, anaemia, bone disease) for end organ damage but meet one of three new criteria. These patients are now recommended for treatment initiation. Previously, expectant management was the standard care for such patients.

The three new criteria are as follows:

- **Clonal plasma cells**: Greater than 60% on bone marrow biopsy.
- **Serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio**: A ratio of > 100, with the involved sFLC being > 100 mg/l.
- **Unequivocal focal lesion**: Greater than one on advanced imaging, including low-dose whole-body computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or (18) F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.

Although these changes might initially appear to affect a small number of patients, their impact is extensive. This revision leads to increased use of advanced imaging and stimulates debate around the management of patients previously diagnosed with smouldering myeloma. It also results in changes to terminology, clinical trial design, and biomarker use.

For the first time, the philosophy of treatment in myeloma is transitioning from being triggered solely by overt end organ damage to also considering subclinical risk factors.

### Autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma patients whose myeloma-defining event was SLiM [^114rXD6x]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) updated the criteria for diagnosing myeloma, incorporating three additional criteria to the traditional calcium elevation, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease (CRAB) indicators, known as the Sixty % marrow plasma cells, Light chain ratio > 60, MRI demonstrates lytic lesions (SLiM) criteria. These include clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, an involved to uninvolved free light chain ratio (FLCr) ≥ 100, and more than one focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

We report on the outcomes of 30 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), where therapy was initiated solely based on SLiM criteria, and compare them to a matched cohort of 60 patients whose myeloma-defining event was CRAB. The SLiM cohort experienced a shorter median time to neutrophil (15 vs. 16 days, p = 0.049) and platelet (15 vs. 17 days, p = 0.0004) engraftment. The 36-month overall survival (OS) was 100% in the SLiM group and 93.27% in the control group (95% CI 83.06%–97.42%), with a trend towards longer OS in the SLiM cohort (p = 0.065). The 36-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 91.61% in the SLiM group (95% CI 69.93%–97.87%) and 65.95% in the control group (95% CI 52.31%–76.53%). There was no significant difference in PFS between the cohorts (p = 0.414).

ASCT is efficacious and safe in MM patients transplanted only due to SLiM criteria. Early intervention in this asymptomatic cohort did not appear to result in deeper responses or better PFS compared to outcomes in symptomatic patients.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma current treatment algorithms [^115y7pUb]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The current treatment algorithms for smoldering multiple myeloma are influenced by risk stratification models incorporating the revised International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria. Lakshman and others have detailed a model that relies on these criteria to assess risk accurately. Similarly, Mateos and colleagues proposed a stratification model to enhance the understanding of smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM).

- **Risk stratification models**: These models play a crucial role in the management of smoldering multiple myeloma. They incorporate various patient-specific factors and biomarker levels to stratify patients into different risk categories. This helps in tailoring treatment strategies to individual patients, potentially improving outcomes.

The algorithms continue to evolve as more robust data emerge, highlighting the importance of ongoing research in this area.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^1142dEz6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of multiple myeloma to practicing physicians and others, ASCO and Cancer Care Ontario convened an Expert Panel comprising medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, and advocacy experts. The panel conducted a literature search that included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and some phase II studies published from 2005 through 2018. Important outcomes considered were survival, progression-free survival, response rate, and quality of life. Using the available evidence and informal consensus, the Expert Panel developed evidence-based guideline recommendations.

The literature search identified 124 relevant studies to inform the guideline's evidence base. Evidence-based recommendations were developed for patients with multiple myeloma who are eligible for transplantation and those who are not, as well as for patients with relapsed or refractory disease.

### SLiM CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^116Pd3zn]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

A flowchart demonstrating the study selection for meta-analysis is presented, categorizing studies as early (until 2014) and later (after 2014). A detailed description of the nine publications without suitable graphs can be found in Appendix 1, pages 1–3.

The analysis includes data on median time to progression and risk for progression at 2 years (+95% CI) for patients with MRI-defined focal lesions greater than 5 mm, separated by risk group and individual study. Estimates were used only where a 95% confidence interval was available. If data was not reached, it is denoted as n.r.

Kaplan–Meier curves illustrate the time to progression (TTP) to multiple myeloma (MM) in different patient cohorts. For patients with ≥ 60% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), early studies showed a significantly shorter TTP compared to later studies (HR: 0.27, 95% CI 0.14–0.51, logrank p < 0.0001). Conversely, a weak trend in the opposite direction was observed in patients with < 60% BMPCs (HR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.47, logrank p = 0.0421).

Similar results were noted for patients with a free light chain (FLC) ratio ≥ 100, whose TTP significantly improved in later publications compared to earlier ones (HR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.21–0.37, logrank p < 0.0001). Importantly, this difference was also observed for patients with an FLC ratio < 100, where a significant improvement in TTP was noted in later years (HR: 0.56, 95% CI 0.49–0.64, logrank p < 0.0001).

### Autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma patients whose myeloma-defining event was SLiM [^115dC4w8]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) updated the criteria for diagnosing myeloma by adding three additional criteria to the traditional calcium elevation, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease (CRAB) criteria. These new criteria are known as the sixty percent marrow plasma cells, light chain ratio > 60, MRI demonstrates lytic lesions (SLiM) criteria, including clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, an involved to uninvolved free light chain ratio (FLCr) ≥ 100, and more than one focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

We report on the outcomes of 30 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) initiated solely based on SLiM criteria. These were compared to a matched cohort of 60 patients whose myeloma-defining event was CRAB. The SLiM cohort demonstrated a shorter median time to neutrophil (15 vs. 16 days, p = 0.049) and platelet (15 vs. 17 days, p = 0.0004) engraftment. The 36-month overall survival (OS) was 100% for the SLiM group and 93.27% for the control group (95% CI 83.06%-97.42%), with a trend towards longer OS observed in the SLiM cohort (p = 0.065).

The 36-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 91.61% in the SLiM group (95% CI 69.93%-97.87%) and 65.95% in the control group (95% CI 52.31%-76.53%). There was no significant difference in PFS between the cohorts (p = 0.414). ASCT is both efficacious and safe for multiple myeloma (MM) patients transplanted solely due to SLiM criteria. Early intervention in this asymptomatic cohort did not seem to result in deeper responses or better PFS compared to outcomes in symptomatic patients.

### Slim CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^116t5C7Y]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Our literature search revealed 3159 records by searching databases and 27 abstracts by hand searching (Fig. 1). After eliminating duplicates, publications not addressing biomarker-defined multiple myeloma (MM) or smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), and publications without graphs suitable for data digitization, we ended up with 11 studies (non-randomized observational cohort studies) that were included in the meta-analysis.

In addition to the six studies published up until the end of 2014, which formed the basis of the treatment guidelines, we identified five recent studies containing data and diagrams that were viable for the meta-analysis. One of these studies contained novel data both on patients with increased bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) and on high free light chain (FLC) ratio, while four focused only on high FLC ratio. None of the studies addressed focal lesions. The data by Rago et al. on the impact of BMPCs, although containing a suitable graph, were not used for the 2014 consensus, and we also did not include them in our analysis due to inconsistencies in the publication. Data from individual studies are shown in Fig. 2. In total, the studies included 3482 patients, none of whom received treatment for myeloma during the duration considered.

### MRI in multiple myeloma: A pictorial review of diagnostic and post-treatment findings [^112M2Jbt]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used in the diagnostic work-up of patients with multiple myeloma. Since 2014, MRI findings have been included in the new diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group. Patients with smouldering myeloma presenting with more than one unequivocal focal lesion in the bone marrow on MRI are considered to have symptomatic myeloma requiring treatment, regardless of the presence of lytic bone lesions. However, bone marrow evaluation with MRI offers more than only morphological information regarding the detection of focal lesions in patients with multiple myeloma.

The overall performance of MRI is enhanced by applying dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, providing additional functional information on bone marrow vascularization and cellularity. This pictorial review provides an overview of the most important imaging findings in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smouldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma by performing a 'total' MRI investigation with implications for diagnosis, staging, and response assessment.

### Gaps and opportunities in the treatment of relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma: Consensus recommendations of the NCI multiple myeloma steering committee [^111MN8Aq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The disease course can be heterogeneous in patients with multiple myeloma, ranging from aggressive relapse with hypercalcemia, new lytic bone lesions, extramedullary disease, or plasma cell leukemia at one extreme to a slow increase in the monoclonal protein over a prolonged period with no evidence of end organ damage at the other. Given this diversity, there is significant variation in the standard practice and approach of therapy initiation for relapsed myeloma, with some patients being initiated on therapy with any increase in monoclonal protein and others not starting therapy until clear evidence of end organ damage due to disease.

While this may appear to be similar to the management strategy for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, relapsed patients have already demonstrated symptomatic disease requiring therapy and hence may have a different disease course than typically observed in the precursor phase. Although early intervention in smoldering myeloma has shown benefit in terms of progression-free survival, there is currently no prospective data to guide treatment for the relapsed patient.

In routine practice, many physicians would initiate therapy at the earliest evidence of progression in patients with high-risk disease as well as in those patients initially presenting with significant end organ damage, like neurological complications from bone involvement or renal failure. There are many patients, especially after stem cell transplant, who have either become immunofixation positive after achieving a complete response or…

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma: IMWG consensus perspectives risk factors for progression and guidelines for monitoring and management [^114B4W1v]. Leukemia (2010). High credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was identified in 3.2% of 21,463 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 50 years or older. The risk of progression to multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, or a lymphoproliferative disorder is approximately 1% per year. Low-risk MGUS is characterized by having an M protein level of less than 15 g/L, IgG type, and a normal free light chain (FLC) ratio. Patients should be followed with serum protein electrophoresis at six months and, if stable, can be monitored every 2–3 years or when symptoms suggestive of a plasma cell malignancy arise. Patients with intermediate and high-risk MGUS should be followed in six months and then annually for life.

The risk of smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma (SMM) progressing to multiple myeloma or a related disorder is 10% per year for the first 5 years, 3% per year for the next 5 years, and 1–2% per year for the following 10 years. Testing should be conducted 2–3 months after the initial recognition of SMM. If the results are stable, the patient should be followed every 4–6 months for 1 year and, if stable, every 6–12 months.

Consequently, interest in surrogate endpoints predictive for true clinical benefit has intensified. It should be emphasized that to be clinically relevant, a surrogate endpoint must be a proper trial-level surrogate that has been validated for a specific type of therapy (e.g. a class of drugs with a certain mechanism of action) in a specific clinical setting (e.g. induction versus maintenance) and in a specific salvage-therapy context. Other endpoints such as PFS2, time to approach failure (TAF), and time to treatment failure (TTF) have been considered acceptable for establishing meaningful clinical benefit in some settings. Regulatory authorities have also developed pathways for provisional drug approvals based on early endpoints as randomized clinical trials with clinically meaningful endpoints are completed for final and full new drug approval.

As durations of treatment responses continue to improve, even progression-free survival may become less feasible as an endpoint in terms of developing and introducing new therapies for myeloma. Therefore, ongoing efforts are directed at evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. MRD negativity, although shown to be a good prognosticator of survival (especially progression-free survival), may have to be combined with other measurements, especially in the relapsed refractory disease setting. This may include assessment of the immune repertoire in the context of excellent disease control and imaging to rule out extramedullary disease. In addition, quality of life assessment will be considered essential.

### Criteria for diagnosis, staging, risk stratification and response assessment of multiple myeloma [^117QV6EA]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

New systems have emerged for the diagnosis, staging, and response assessment in multiple myeloma (MM). The diagnostic and response criteria recommended are primarily derived from the International Myeloma Working Group, with certain updates and clarifications. The International Staging System is the standard for staging of myeloma. A new risk stratification model is provided to specifically define high-risk patients who may benefit from novel therapeutic strategies. This paper provides the criteria for diagnosis, staging, risk stratification, and response assessment of MM.

### Slim CRAB criteria revisited: Temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of 'biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^114EcUi6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Biomarker-defined patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) were included in the diagnostic category of multiple myeloma (MM) by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) in 2014. This includes ≥ 60% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), free light chain ratio (FLCratio) ≥ 100, and > 1 MRI-defined ≥ 5 mm focal lesion, also called SLiM CRAB MM. We examined whether the risk of progression of SLiM CRAB MM patients to CRAB positive MM described in recent studies differs from that reported in earlier studies published before the introduction of the new diagnostic criteria.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, including studies on Embase and PubMed (01/01/2010–01/11/2022). We selected studies with digitizable progression curves, excluding inconsistent studies. We created forest plots using random effects models from digitized and published data and Kaplan-Meier curves. The main outcomes were median time to progression (TTP), 2-year progression risk, and odds ratios (ORs) comparing 2-year progression risks.

- **Findings**: Our meta-analysis, including 11 studies with 3482 patients, found an approximately 3-fold longer TTP and 50% lower 2-year progression risk of SLiM CRAB MM patients in recent studies (published after 2014) compared to earlier studies. The median TTP in patients with ≥ 60% BMPCs was 30.31 months [18.71–62.93] in recent versus 9.20 months [6.02–15.56] in earlier studies. The 2-year progression risk was 45.45% [20.12–62.75] compared to 86.21% [65.74–94.45] in the respective time periods.

### International myeloma working group consensus criteria for response and minimal residual disease assessment in multiple myeloma [^116V3urG]. The Lancet Oncology (2016). High credibility.

The treatment of multiple myeloma has substantially changed over the past decade with the introduction of several classes of new effective drugs that have greatly improved the rates and depth of response. Response criteria in multiple myeloma were developed to use serum and urine assessment of monoclonal proteins and bone marrow assessment, which is relatively insensitive. Given the high rates of complete response seen in patients with multiple myeloma with new treatment approaches, new response categories need to be defined that can identify responses that are deeper than those conventionally defined as complete response.

Recent attempts have focused on the identification of residual tumor cells in the bone marrow using flow cytometry or gene sequencing. Furthermore, sensitive imaging techniques can be used to detect the presence of residual disease outside of the bone marrow. Combining these new methods, the International Myeloma Working Group has defined new response categories of minimal residual disease negativity, with or without imaging-based absence of extramedullary disease, to allow uniform reporting within and outside clinical trials.

In this review, we clarify several aspects of disease response assessment, along with endpoints for clinical trials, and highlight future directions for disease response assessments.

### Daratumumab monotherapy for patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma: a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study (CENTAURUS) [^116oNWLK]. Leukemia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Progression-free survival (PFS)**: PFS was assessed in the intent-to-treat population. Progression was defined based on diagnostic criteria and biochemical or diagnostic criteria. Diagnostic progression was defined per the 2014 IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) criteria for multiple myeloma and additional IMWG free light chain (FLC) progression criteria. This included a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, with an absolute increase required to be > 10 mg/dl.

	- Biochemical progression was defined as a measurable increase of ≥ 25% from nadir value in any of the following during follow-up: serum M-component, with an absolute increase required to be ≥ 0.5 g/dl; urine M-component, with an absolute increase required to be ≥ 200 mg/24 h; and, in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein, the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, with an absolute increase required to be > 10 mg/dl. The clinical cutoff date was June 29, 2018.

### Observation or treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^1162FHXe]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that early therapeutic intervention in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM), who are at elevated risk of progression to symptomatic disease, is beneficial. The pooled analysis revealed a 60% reduction in the risk of disease progression to active myeloma or mortality in patients who received treatment versus those on observation. A more robust effect was observed in studies assessing contemporary anti-myeloma therapeutic regimens, such as daratumumab and lenalidomide. These findings strengthen the accumulating body of evidence that supports a risk-adapted approach in the management of sMM, thereby transitioning the paradigm from passive surveillance to proactive intervention in those with high-risk characteristics.

Although there is a clear signal for progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in the majority of the included studies, with progression defined as time to active myeloma, it should be noted that PFS represents a key surrogate measure for patient-centered outcomes. The therapeutic importance of postponing progression from an asymptomatic state to symptomatic disease may be challenged, especially when considering the lack of evidence for an overall survival (OS) advantage. Our pooled analysis indicated a 45% reduction in the risk of mortality among treated patients; nevertheless, OS was not a primary study endpoint, and the limited number of studies providing mature OS data points to the need for additional investigations with extended follow-up. Furthermore, our study also indicated that therapy substantially prolonged the time to progression to symptomatic disease.
