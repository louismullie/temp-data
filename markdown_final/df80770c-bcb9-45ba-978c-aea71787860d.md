## Question

When do you start second line therapy for ITP

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to start second-line therapy for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease phase and duration thresholds that define when second-line therapy becomes appropriate. Then, I should verify the clinical triggers that push earlier transition, including steroid dependence, intolerance, and bleeding or quality-of-life impact. Next, I will review guideline-based timing and practical operational criteria used by clinicians. After that, I need to consider special populations such as children and pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with caveats about shared decision-making and cost or access considerations.

> Let me first confirm the disease-phase framework, because timing hinges on it. ITP is categorized as newly diagnosed (0–3 months), persistent (3–12 months), and chronic (> 12 months), and second-line therapy is generally considered once the disease is persistent or chronic and the patient is steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory, with the ASH 2019 guideline explicitly addressing adults with ITP lasting 3 months or more who are corticosteroid-dependent or have no response to corticosteroids [^116uRCBq] [^1163M3EX].

> Wait, let me verify the minimum duration threshold before moving to second-line therapy. The ASH guideline anchors second-line decisions at or beyond 3 months of disease duration, so persistent ITP is the earliest phase in which second-line therapy is typically appropriate, provided there is steroid dependence or inadequate response to steroids; this avoids premature escalation while recognizing that prolonged steroid exposure is harmful [^116uRCBq] [^1163M3EX].

> I need to check the clinical triggers that justify earlier transition despite the 3-month anchor. Steroid dependence requiring more than about 5–10 mg prednisone daily to maintain a safe platelet count, steroid intolerance with significant adverse effects, or loss of response during taper are common reasons to move sooner. Importantly, continued steroid use beyond about 6 weeks is discouraged, and some clinicians operationalize a 2–4 week window to assess steroid response and pivot if inadequate, which aligns with best-practice transition frameworks and ASH's emphasis on avoiding prolonged corticosteroids [^115hdFPa] [^117Qvw6E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about platelet thresholds alone. I should confirm that absolute platelet counts are not the sole determinant; instead, bleeding phenotype, patient-specific bleeding risk, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can drive earlier second-line therapy even with modest thrombocytopenia, particularly in children where HRQoL and activities like sports participation frequently justify treatment escalation, and in adults whose occupations or comorbidities amplify bleeding risk or treatment burden [^116EER2h] [^112rVA9g].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with children. I should double-check that pediatric guidance prioritizes TPO receptor agonists over rituximab and splenectomy for non–life-threatening bleeding or diminished HRQoL after first-line failure, and that splenectomy is generally deferred and reserved as a last option. This shapes earlier use of TPO-RAs in persistent pediatric ITP when symptoms or quality of life are impacted [^11751gt9] [^115rpAVv] [^116KSSbx].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, because timing and choice differ. In pregnancy, second-line therapy is typically considered after first-line corticosteroids or IVIG fail or are contraindicated, with TPO-RAs favored over rituximab or splenectomy due to fetal safety considerations; rituximab is generally avoided in the first trimester and splenectomy is rarely pursued during pregnancy, so escalation to a TPO-RA is reasonable when treatment beyond first-line is needed [^notfound].

> I will now examine practical operational criteria that many clinicians use to operationalize "when". If there is no response to an adequate steroid trial within 2–4 weeks, if the response is lost within 6 months including inability to taper below about 5 mg prednisone, or if adverse effects are unacceptable, these are reasonable inflection points to initiate second-line therapy; this approach prevents prolonged steroid toxicity while balancing the possibility of early spontaneous remission in some patients [^117Qvw6E].

> But wait, what about cost and access, which can shift timing and choice. I should confirm that TPO-RAs are effective but expensive and often require continuous therapy, whereas rituximab is less costly upfront but has variable durability, and splenectomy, though potentially curative, carries operative and long-term infectious risks; cost-effectiveness analyses suggest early splenectomy may be cost-effective in some settings, but guidelines still recommend delaying splenectomy when possible and individualizing based on values and feasibility [^113nSxXt] [^116LMLcK] [^1163M3EX].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Second-line therapy for ITP should be initiated when disease is persistent (≥ 3 months) or chronic (> 12 months) and the patient is steroid-dependent, steroid-refractory, or cannot tolerate steroids, with earlier transition justified by significant bleeding, diminished HRQoL, or unacceptable steroid toxicity. In children, prioritize TPO-RAs for persistent disease with symptoms or HRQoL impact, and in pregnancy, favor TPO-RAs if escalation is needed beyond first-line options, all within a shared decision-making framework that incorporates patient preferences, comorbidities, and access constraints [^116uRCBq] [^1163M3EX] [^11751gt9].

---

Start second-line therapy in ITP when patients are **corticosteroid-dependent** or have an **inadequate response after 4–6 weeks** of first-line therapy [^111TT4vg] [^117Qvw6E], especially if platelets remain below 30 × 10⁹/L or bleeding persists [^113mhdD2] [^111eGF6X]. Early transition is also indicated for **steroid intolerance** or when **quality of life is impaired** by ongoing thrombocytopenia or treatment side effects [^117Qvw6E] [^116EER2h]. ASH 2019 recommends TPO receptor agonists as preferred second-line agents, with rituximab or splenectomy considered based on patient preference and clinical context [^116uRCBq] [^1163M3EX]. For children, prioritize TPO-RAs over rituximab or splenectomy, and reserve splenectomy for refractory cases after 12 months [^11751gt9] [^115rpAVv].

---

## Indications for initiating second-line therapy

Second-line therapy is indicated when any of the following occur:

- **Corticosteroid dependence**: Need for prednisone > 5 mg/day to maintain a safe platelet count [^117Qvw6E].

- **Inadequate response to first-line therapy**: Platelets remain < 30 × 10⁹/L after 4–6 weeks of corticosteroids or IVIG [^notfound].

- **Steroid intolerance**: Significant adverse effects (e.g. osteoporosis, diabetes, psychiatric effects) [^115GTiyH].

- **Persistent thrombocytopenia and bleeding**: Ongoing bleeding or impaired quality of life despite first-line therapy [^116EER2h].

---

## Timing of second-line therapy initiation

The timing of second-line therapy is guided by response to first-line therapy and patient-specific factors:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing for second-line therapy** |
|-|-|
| Corticosteroid dependence | Immediately after dependence is established |
| Inadequate response to first-line therapy | After 4–6 weeks of corticosteroids or IVIG |
| Steroid intolerance | Immediately upon development of significant adverse effects |
| Persistent thrombocytopenia with bleeding | Immediately if bleeding risk is significant |

---

ASH 2019 recommends initiating second-line therapy in adults with ITP lasting ≥ 3 months who are corticosteroid-dependent or have no response to corticosteroids [^116uRCBq] [^1163M3EX].

---

## Recommended second-line therapies

ASH 2019 provides conditional recommendations for second-line therapies:

- **Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs)**: Preferred second-line agents (eltrombopag, romiplostim) due to high efficacy and favorable safety profile [^111D26Sr] [^117MXzwT].

- **Rituximab**: Considered when TPO-RAs are contraindicated or not preferred; generally less effective than TPO-RAs [^113nSxXt] [^112zQG2W].

- **Splenectomy**: Reserved for refractory cases or when medical therapies fail; should be delayed ≥ 12 months after diagnosis when possible [^116uRCBq] [^115Ffz1X].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric patients

In pediatric ITP, **TPO-RAs are preferred** over rituximab or splenectomy for second-line therapy [^11751gt9] [^115rpAVv]. Splenectomy is generally avoided and reserved for refractory cases after 12 months [^112dLu55].

---

## Factors influencing the choice of second-line therapy

The choice of second-line therapy is individualized based on:

- **Patient preferences**: Route of administration, dosing frequency, and tolerance to therapy [^113nSxXt].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, thrombotic risk, and infection risk [^113S2bKz].

- **Cost and accessibility**: Financial considerations and availability of therapies [^116LMLcK].

- **Efficacy and safety profiles**: Balancing bleeding risk with potential adverse effects [^116A7exJ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **platelet counts**, bleeding symptoms, and **adverse effects** is essential after initiating second-line therapy. Adjustments should be made based on response and tolerability [^113vXV3M].

---

Second-line therapy in ITP is indicated for corticosteroid dependence, inadequate response, or intolerance, with timing individualized to patient factors. TPO-RAs are the **preferred second-line agents**, with rituximab and splenectomy reserved for specific scenarios [^116uRCBq].

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) second-line therapy efficacy — splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), and rituximab — shows that response rates were 86.7%, 65.7%, and 62.1%, respectively; TPO-RAs were associated with higher platelet response (53.0% vs 39.4%) and higher rate of remission (68.8% vs 23.5%); and no difference in major bleeding was observed across splenectomy, TPO-RAs, and rituximab (4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.2% respectively). Based on durability, the panel determined that splenectomy and TPO-RAs had moderate desirable effects compared with rituximab, and noted that the certainty of these estimated effects is very low.

2 SECOND‐LINE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Second‐line or maintenance therapy in persistent or chronic ITP (hereafter referred to as ITP) aims to establish a durable platelet response and to minimize bleeding events with a treatment that is safe, tolerable, and convenient for long‐term management. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs), and rituximab are the standard second‐line treatment options in current use. 3, 4 Before initiation of a second‐line therapy, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP by excluding potential non‐immune causes of thrombocytopenia as well as causes of secondary ITP if these have not been previously ruled out.

4.2 Selection of second‐line therapy and beyond

The risks and benefits of all second‐line management options should be discussed with the patient before making a treatment decision. My approach to selecting optimal second and subsequent lines of treatment for patients with ITP is shown in Figure 2.

Clinicians should make individualized treatment decisions that take into account the patient's comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal values and preferences. ITP, immune thrombocytopenia; TPO‐RA, thrombopoietin receptor agonist

For most patients who have had ITP for > 1 year, TPO‐RAs should be considered in the second‐line setting. Splenectomy is also an important option for eligible patients who prefer surgical treatment. Before making a treatment decision, the patient should be informed of the long‐term risks of splenectomy that might require lifelong medical attention, including delayed relapse, infection, thromboembolism, and possibly cancer. The possibility of long‐term remission or treatment holidays with TPO‐RAs or rituximab should be discussed with the patient. However, it is important to clarify that these medications are neither intended nor confirmed to cure the disease, and that the possibility of long‐term platelet response after discontinuation of therapy is much higher with splenectomy.

For patients who have had ITP for < 1 year, TPO‐RAs remain a viable option regardless of age and gender. For adult women who have had ITP for < 1 year, rituximab with high‐dose dexamethasone could also be considered in the second line. In that case, TPO‐RAs may be used as bridge therapy to compensate for the variable time to response with rituximab. In a trial of rituximab combined with recombinant TPO or placebo, recombinant TPO significantly reduced the median time to response (7 days vs. 28 days, respectively; P < .01). 20

In patients who have an inadequate response with TPO‐RA monotherapy, combination therapy with an immunosuppressive agent (eg, low‐dose corticosteroids, danazol, mycophenolate mofetil, etc.) that reduces platelet destruction may allow for synergistic outcomes. 4 In a small study of patients with multi‐refractory ITP who had not achieved a stable response to first‐ or second‐line treatments, only 1 of 14 patients responded to immunosuppressive therapy alone, whereas 7 of 10 patients responded to a combination of a TPO‐RA and an immunosuppressive agent. 63

Abstract

Major options for second‐line therapy in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) include splenectomy, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TRAs). The American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend rituximab over splenectomy, TRAs over rituximab, and splenectomy or TRAs while noting a lack of evidence on the cost‐effectiveness of these therapies. Using prospective, observational, and meta‐analytic data, we performed the first cost‐effectiveness analysis of second‐line therapies in chronic ITP, from the perspective of the U.S. health system. Over a 20‐year time‐horizon, our six‐strategy Markov model shows that a strategy incorporating early splenectomy, an approach at odds with current guidelines and clinical practice, is the cost‐effective strategy. All four strategies utilizing TRAs in the first or second position cost over $1 million per quality‐adjusted life‐year, as compared to strategies involving early use of splenectomy and rituximab. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, early use of splenectomy and rituximab in either order was favored in 100% of 10 000 iterations. The annual cost of TRAs would have to decrease over 80% to begin to become cost‐effective in any early TRA strategy. Our data indicate that effectiveness of early TRA and late TRA strategies is similar with the cost significantly greater with early TRA strategies. Contrary to current practice trends and guidelines, early use of splenectomy and rituximab, rather than TRAs, constitutes cost‐effective treatment in adults with chronic ITP.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — panel, scope, and key emphases: In 2016, ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel including 9 clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with evidence-to-decision frameworks to appraise evidence up to May 2017, and agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non–life-threatening bleeding; management approaches included observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

Regarding medical management for immune thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy (pediatric patients), ASH 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using corticosteroids in preference to IVIG in children with newly diagnosed ITP who have non-life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health-related QoL.

### Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^11127yjk]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations of our study include the varying quality of evidence with splenectomy response rates largely based on observational data, which we addressed in sensitivity analyses; assumption of equal probability of hemorrhagic complications across the six strategies, and applicability to patients who have had ITP for 1 year (i.e. chronic ITP) while noting that second‐line therapy is often initiated prior to 1 year. We did not include other treatments not recommended as second‐line therapy by the ASH guidelines, but that may still be used in clinical practice, such as mycophenolate mofetil and fostamatinib. For drug cost we did not consider the cost of an infusion chair for rituximab or romiplostim by design to further favor medical therapy. We examined cost‐effectiveness of second‐line therapy at the population level. By no means should our findings be interpreted to suggest that early splenectomy is appropriate for all individual patients because our model does not account for individual risk factors nor for patient preference. In a future study, individual risk factors can be built into a microsimulation model to examine effectiveness of treatment strategies across different cohorts of patients with chronic ITP. In addition, patient and physician preference is not captured in a cost‐effectiveness analysis and may benefit from the development of a decision aid in this space.

In summary, we performed the first cost‐effectiveness analysis evaluating second‐line therapies for chronic ITP. We found that a strategy not recommended by the current ASH guidelines, that of splenectomy followed by rituximab and then TRA, represents the cost‐effective strategy. Patients and clinicians have multiple options for second‐line treatment of ITP including splenectomy, rituximab, and TRAs. These options vary in their response rates, side effect profile, and cost. The optimal treatment may be different for different patients depending on age, comorbidities, prior history, and patient values and preferences. Our cost‐effectiveness analysis suggests that, for many patients, early use of splenectomy, rather than TRA, provides the best value.

### How I treat primary ITP in adult patients who are unresponsive to or dependent on corticosteroid treatment [^114vSJ7M]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 80% of adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have treatment failure with corticosteroids or become dependent on them and require second-line therapy. Several new and effective therapies have been introduced during the past decade and our understanding of disease burden and its effect on quality of life has expanded. It is now recommended that splenectomy, the standard second-line therapy for decades, be delayed for at least 12 to 24 months, allowing for more patients to achieve remission on medical therapies before considering surgery. It is highly recommended that medical therapies be used that have abundant clinical trial evidence, such as the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) rituximab and fostamatinib. Unfortunately, there are no reliable biomarkers that help in treatment selection. These therapeutic medical options have variable efficacy, safety profiles, mechanisms of action, and modes of administration. This enables and mandates an individualized approach to treatment, where patient involvement, preferences and values have become central to the process of choosing the appropriate therapy. Both TPO-RAs and fostamatinib are maintenance therapies, whereas rituximab is given for a limited number of doses. Although the response is usually maintained while receiving a TPO-RA or fostamatinib therapy, half of rituximab responders will no longer respond 1 to 2 years after administration and require retreatment or other therapy.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^112rVA9g]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the publication of this systematic review, the management of ITP has evolved. Treatment decisions are less likely to be guided solely by platelet counts and more likely to rely on a combination of platelet levels; shared decision making between the physician and the patient; and patient factors, such as insurance coverage, lifestyle, history of bleeding, occupation, comorbidities, and expectations. 9 Thrombopoietin‐receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs), including eltrombopag and romiplostim, have also entered the market after undergoing rigorous randomized trials in splenectomized and non‐splenectomized patients with persistent or chronic ITP. 14, 15, 16 Additionally, the incidence of splenectomy has declined in recent years. 17, 18 Despite these developments and trends, the International Consensus Report on the management of primary ITP (released in 2010) lists medical treatment options in the second‐line setting in alphabetical order to avoid indicating a preference for a specific treatment, highlighting the lack of sufficient data to rank the treatments according to efficacy. 1 Similarly, shortly after the publication of this report, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) published practice guidelines for ITP, concluding that there is no evidence to guide a sequence of treatment for patients who have recurrent or persistent thrombocytopenia with bleeding after first‐line treatment with corticosteroids, IVIg, or anti‐D. 19

Indeed, clinical decision‐making on optimal second‐line ITP treatment is challenging and has been described as controversial. 20, 21 The lack of prescriptive clinical guidance in this setting highlights a gap in the scientific literature regarding comparisons of safety and efficacy across available treatments. 2, 22 Given this and the changing treatment landscape over the past decade, we sought to systematically review published reports and provide an up‐to‐date summary of studies evaluating the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of therapies used to treat primary ITP in adults in the second‐line setting, with a particular focus on RCTs that have been conducted.

No studies represented prospective RCTs with splenectomy and a placebo or SOC arm, but surgical splenectomy has been well‐studied and still represents an important treatment option for ITP patients in the second‐line setting. Among the 83 studies evaluating splenectomy, the reported rates of complete response rates ranged from 37.3% 42 to 100% 43 with a median complete response rate of 70.5% across studies. The median partial response rate was 13.5% (range 0% 43 to 88% 44) and the overall response rates ranged from 63.4% 45 to 100% 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, with a median of 86.5%. The median duration of response was reported in five studies, ranging from 29.5 months 50 to 120 months 51 with a median of 81 months. The rate of relapse ranged from 0% 52 to 81.8% 53 with a median rate of 20%, and the median rate of significant bleeding was 4.76% (range 0% 54 to 28.1% 55). Mortality rates ranged from 0% among multiple studies to 28.8% 56 (over a median follow‐up time of 18 years) (median 2% across studies).

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^114ffMQp]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is commonly encountered in clinical practice. In 1996 the American Society of Hematology published a landmark guidance paper designed to assist clinicians in the management of this disorder. Since 1996 there have been numerous advances in the management of both adult and pediatric ITP. These changes mandated an update in the guidelines. This guideline uses a rigorous, evidence-based approach to the location, interpretation, and presentation of the available evidence. We have endeavored to identify, abstract, and present all available methodologically rigorous data informing the treatment of ITP. We provide evidence-based treatment recommendations using the GRADE system in those areas in which such evidence exists. We do not provide evidence in those areas in which evidence is lacking, or is of lower quality — interested readers are referred to a number of recent, consensus-based recommendations for expert opinion in these clinical areas. Our review identified the need for additional studies in many key areas of the therapy of ITP such as comparative studies of "front-line" therapy for ITP, the management of serious bleeding in patients with ITP, and studies that will provide guidance about which therapy should be used as salvage therapy for patients after failure of a first-line intervention.

4 BEST PRACTICES

4.1 Transitioning to second‐line therapy

My approach to selecting patients for second‐line therapy is depicted in Figure 1. If a first‐line therapy has produced a response that lasted for > 6 months and was tolerable, the patient could be re‐treated with it. However, I generally discontinue first‐line therapy and switch to second‐line therapy if any of the following criteria are met: (1) the patient cannot tolerate first‐line treatment; (2) the patient does not respond to first‐line treatment within 2–4 weeks; (3) the patient's response to the last course of therapy is lost within 6 months, including a failure to taper corticosteroids to a low dose (ie, prednisone ≤ 5 mg/day) due to loss of response. In addition to these criteria, patient preferences and treatment burden should also be incorporated in decision making.

Clinicians should make individualized treatment decisions that take into account the patient's comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal values and preferences. ITP, immune thrombocytopenia; QOL, quality of life. a Corticosteroids are standard first‐line therapy. They may be combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) when a more rapid response is required. Either IVIg or anti‐D may be used as first‐line treatment if corticosteroids are contraindicated. Anti‐D should be considered only in nonsplenectomized, Rh+ patients who have a negative direct antiglobulin test 3

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia that can lead to an increased tendency to bleed. 1, 2 Although it typically presents as a subtle‐onset, chronic syndrome in adults, with no forewarning symptoms or illness, clinical manifestations can range from minor bruising to severe hemorrhaging. 3, 4, 5 The primary goal of treatment is to achieve a safe platelet count (above which, a patient does not experience bleeding episodes), and this is determined on a case‐by‐case basis. 3 Common first‐line therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti‐D (Rho[D] immune globulin intravenous). 6, 7, 8 Relapse or failure to respond to these may necessitate second‐line treatment, which can include splenectomy or a variety of medical therapies, most of which have not been approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of ITP but have been used because of efficacy demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases or as immune suppressants. 9

Splenectomy has historically been considered the second‐line therapy of choice in adult ITP. 10, 11 A systematic review was previously conducted to examine studies (published from 1966 to 2003) that assessed the efficacy/effectiveness of medical treatments for adult patients with ITP who have not responded to splenectomy. The review covered a total of 90 studies representing 656 patients who were splenectomized, aged > 16 years, had ITP for > 3 months, and a platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L. 12 Only one study 13 was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) but the randomization was by dose of the same therapy; the remaining were cohort studies or uncontrolled case series. A complete response (as defined in each respective original report) was achieved in 14% of patients across the 22 treatment types, with the largest numbers of responders reported with cyclophosphamide (27% of 83 patients), rituximab (24% of 41 patients), and azathioprine (17% of 109 patients). Although partial response was achieved in 40% of patients across these three therapies, 36% to 42% had no response. This review focused on the third‐line setting and beyond, but it demonstrated that at least at that time, there was minimal evidence for the effectiveness of any medical treatment for ITP patients with persistent, severe thrombocytopenia, highlighting the need for RCTs to properly evaluate potentially effective treatments in this setting.

### How I treat refractory immune thrombocytopenia [^116iGLHN]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the management of children and adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who do not respond to, cannot tolerate, or are unwilling to undergo splenectomy. We begin with a critical reassessment of the diagnosis and a deliberate attempt to exclude nonautoimmune causes of thrombocytopenia and secondary ITP. For patients in whom the diagnosis is affirmed, we consider observation without treatment. Observation is appropriate for most asymptomatic patients with a platelet count of 20 to 30 × 10(9)/L or higher. We use a tiered approach to treat patients who require therapy to increase the platelet count. Tier 1 options (rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, low-dose corticosteroids) have a relatively favorable therapeutic index. We exhaust all Tier 1 options before proceeding to Tier 2, which comprises a host of immunosuppressive agents with relatively lower response rates and/or greater toxicity. We often prescribe Tier 2 drugs not alone but in combination with a Tier 1 or a second Tier 2 drug with a different mechanism of action. We reserve Tier 3 strategies, which are of uncertain benefit and/or high toxicity with little supporting evidence, for the rare patient with serious bleeding who does not respond to Tier 1 and Tier 2 therapies.

### Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^116b6XjP]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Major options for second-line therapy in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) include splenectomy, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TRAs). The American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend rituximab over splenectomy, TRAs over rituximab, and splenectomy or TRAs while noting a lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these therapies. Using prospective, observational, and meta-analytic data, we performed the first cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line therapies in chronic ITP, from the perspective of the U.S. health system. Over a 20-year time-horizon, our six-strategy Markov model shows that a strategy incorporating early splenectomy, an approach at odds with current guidelines and clinical practice, is the cost-effective strategy. All four strategies utilizing TRAs in the first or second position cost over $1 million per quality-adjusted life-year, as compared to strategies involving early use of splenectomy and rituximab. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, early use of splenectomy and rituximab in either order was favored in 100% of 10 000 iterations. The annual cost of TRAs would have to decrease over 80% to begin to become cost-effective in any early TRA strategy. Our data indicate that effectiveness of early TRA and late TRA strategies is similar with the cost significantly greater with early TRA strategies. Contrary to current practice trends and guidelines, early use of splenectomy and rituximab, rather than TRAs, constitutes cost-effective treatment in adults with chronic ITP.

ASH 2019 guidelines for ITP — Adult second-line therapy algorithm: Adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) > 3 months who are dependent on or unresponsive to corticosteroids are triaged by duration (3–12 months vs > 12 months), and selection of second-line therapy should be individualized based on duration of disease and patient values and preferences. For 3–12 months, primary treatment options are rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) (Recommendation 9); for > 12 months, primary treatment options are rituximab, splenectomy, and TPO-RA. The algorithm incorporates preferences, providing treatment options that include splenectomy and TPO-RA (Recommendation 7), rituximab and splenectomy (Recommendation 8), and rituximab and TPO-RA (Recommendation 9).

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^114Zx88e]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are conventionally considered to be lifelong therapies that need to be used continuously to maintain response. However, accumulating data suggest that some patients who use TPO‐RAs may achieve long‐term remissions that are sustained off treatment. Although randomized, placebo‐controlled, long‐term studies that would directly demonstrate the remission‐inducing potential of TPO‐RAs are not available, it appears unlikely that remissions observed in the TPO‐RA discontinuation studies are purely spontaneous. Earlier studies showed that the rate of spontaneous remissions in adult patients is only about 9%, 9 while the overall rate of long‐term (≥ 6 months) remission in TPO‐RA studies is nearly 30%. 34, 35, 36, 37 Second, spontaneous remissions are less frequent following the first year after diagnosis, but most patients who achieved remission in TPO‐RA studies had ITP for > 1 year, and some had been living with ITP for much longer (up to 54 years). 1, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39 The authors speculated that this putative disease‐modifying activity of TPO‐RAs could be linked to the TPO‐RA–mediated restoration of impaired regulatory T‐cell function and immune tolerance that was observed in patients with ITP. 37, 39, 40

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^116H2Awq]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

In a single‐arm study of 53 adults with chronic ITP treated with azathioprine, 45% of patients had a "complete remission" after receiving azathioprine (defined as platelet counts ≥ 150 × 10 9 /L for at least 3 months); median time to response was 4 months. 28 In an open‐label study of dapsone among 66 adults with chronic ITP, 30.3% showed a partial response (platelet count > 50 × 10 9 /L and at least twice the initial platelet count) and 19.7% demonstrated a complete response (platelet count > 150 × 10 9 /L); median time to obtain the maximal platelet count response was 130 days. 29 Similarly, in a single‐arm study of mycophenolate mofetil administered among just 21 adults with chronic ITP, 28.6% demonstrated a partial response (platelet count 50 to < 100 × 10 9 /L) and 23.8% demonstrated a complete response (platelet count ≥ 100 × 10 9 /L) after 12 weeks of treatment. 30 Vinblastine has been studied in a single interventional study in which 42 patients with ITP, including 17 with chronic ITP, were randomized to either receive vinblastine by IV slow infusions or vinblastine by IV bolus injections, 8 of whom had failed at least one prior therapy and thus were being treated in the second‐line setting. 13 Of these, 37.5% showed a complete response (platelet count > 150 × 10 9 /L), 12.5% a partial response (platelet count 100 to 150 × 10 9 /L), and 0 of 8 patients had a minor response (platelet count > 50 × 10 9 /L and at least a doubling of platelet counts from initial levels), which was evaluated at 6 weeks after IV vinblastine administered either through continuous infusion or bolus injection. Lastly, and most recently, a multicenter, randomized trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of a recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) in patients with persistent ITP who had failed glucocorticosteroid treatment. 31 A total of 140 eligible patients were randomized to receive rhTPO + danazol or danazol alone, but only short‐term (2 weeks) response with danazol alone was assessed. At 2 weeks, 36.5% of 67 patients in the danazol‐alone group had their platelet count restored to normal (≥ 100 × 10 9 /L) and/or had a platelet count rise to at least 50 × 10 9 /L or increase by 30 × 10 9 /L above baseline with no bleeding symptoms.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^116A7exJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

In terms of efficacy, the most compelling evidence stems from the trials of eltrombopag 14, 32, 33, 34, 35 and romiplostim. 15, 38, 39, 40 Without exception, across the 10 studies, patients treated with one of these therapies tended to have higher rates of overall and complete platelet responses compared with patients receiving placebo or SOC. Bleeding and use of rescue therapies were also generally lower in patients receiving one of these TPO‐RA agents. Importantly, longer‐term, open‐label studies of these treatments have demonstrated that efficacy is maintained and that the treatments are safe and well‐tolerated over longer periods of exposure. 57, 58 In a study of patients treated with eltrombopag for up to 3 years, platelet counts of ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and a doubling of platelet counts from baseline were maintained for a median of 73 weeks over 104 weeks of treatment (n = 147) and 109 weeks over 156 weeks of treatment (n = 32) with no new or increased risk of safety issues. 58 In a study of 291 patients treated with romiplostim for up to 5 years (representing 614 patient‐years of exposure), the median percentage of time on study with a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L was 92% (IQR: 62‐100), with a low rate of bleeding and infrequent need for rescue therapy. 57 Most patients (63%) responded after just one dose of romiplostim, and the proportion of patients with a platelet ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L remained between 62% and 78% through week 212. Eltrombopag and romiplostim are both agents that interact with the TPO receptor to trigger platelet production and are indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in the second‐line setting and beyond in patients with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. 59, 60, 61, 62

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — 2018 European joint working group (JWG) guidance and second-line differences: The JWG recommended corticosteroids for adults with ITP who have no or mild bleeding (World Health Organization [WHO] 0-II) and platelet counts below 20 × 10^9/L to 30 × 10^9/L, with observation for patients with platelet count values above 20 × 10^9/L to 30 × 10^9/L; prolonged corticosteroid use is discouraged, and the JWG guidelines did not discuss the addition of rituximab to corticosteroid treatment in newly diagnosed adults. For second-line management, the JWG guidelines place a priority on thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as second-line treatment with rituximab being considered a third-line agent reserved for patients who have failed a TPO-RA, and splenectomy is primarily reserved for patients with ITP for > 12 months' duration or major bleeding (WHO III, IV); the ASH guidelines herein also include a remark that splenectomy should be delayed until 12 months when possible. In children, the JWG advises that a low platelet count alone is not sufficient to start treatment in newly diagnosed ITP and that the majority with no or only mild bleeding do not require treatment; they acknowledge no standard treatment of chronic ITP with referral to a specialist center recommended, and suggest that splenectomy be avoided in children and reserved as a last option in those that are refractory.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^111TE1pw]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with ITP experience a high burden of disease, and it is important to offer management options that will improve quality of life. When possible, treatment options that are compatible with the personal preferences and lifestyle of the patient should be offered. Oral treatments taken once a day may be preferred by some patients, but others may favor injections that are administered less frequently. For patients who want to minimize their medication and monitoring needs, splenectomy may be the most desirable option.

An in‐depth understanding of second‐line treatment options will help optimize management of ITP and patient outcomes by ensuring the best use of available therapeutic options.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^115ETtqN]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

The scope of this review included both interventional and observational studies that evaluated the safety, efficacy (from interventional designs), and/or effectiveness (from observational designs) of therapies used to treat primary ITP in adults in the second‐line setting. We excluded studies in which the therapy of interest was used in the first‐line setting, case series with less than 20 patients, studies published in languages other than English, and studies conducted in children, pregnant women, or patients with secondary thrombocytopenia. The therapies of interest were: splenectomy, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, danazol, dapsone, eltrombopag, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, romiplostim, and vinca alkaloids, as these are the second‐line treatment options provided in the International Consensus Report and the most recent ASH guidelines on the management of primary ITP. 1, 19 The outcomes of interest covered several efficacy endpoints, including any platelet‐related change (eg, platelet response, duration of platelet response, etc), rate of and/or time to splenectomy (in studies where splenectomy was not the treatment of interest), rate of rescue medication and/or other ITP therapy use, and rate of bleeding. In terms of safety endpoints, we searched for data on the rates of clinically significant bleeding, thrombotic/thromboembolic events, pulmonary hypertension, infections, respiratory tract infections, neuropathy, leukopenia, hemorrhagic cystitis, fever, and other serious adverse drug reactions. We also obtained data on mortality.

### Reemergence of splenectomy for ITP second-line treatment? [^114wVvsR]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids are still the standard first-line treatment for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). As second-line therapy, splenectomy and Rituximab are both recommended. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of Rituximab to splenectomy in persistent or chronic ITP patients.

Methods

Between January 1999 and March 2015, we retrospectively selected all consecutive patients who underwent an ITP second-line treatment: Rituximab or splenectomy. The distinction between open (OS) and laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was analyzed. Primary outcome was composite: hospitalization for bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia and death from hemorrhage or infection. Secondary outcomes were based on response (R) and complete response (CR) rates as defined by the American Society of Hematology.

Results

Ninety-six patients were included: 30 patients received Rituximab, 37 underwent OS, and 29 underwent LS. The follow-up was 30, 60, and 120 months in Rituximab, LS, and OS groups, respectively. At 30 month, the primary outcome-free survival rate was higher in splenectomy groups (84% for OS, 86% for LS) than Rituximab group (47%) (P = 0.0002). Similarly, at 30 month, R and CR rates were higher for OS (86.5% and 75.7%, respectively) and LS groups (93.1% and 89.7%) than Rituximab (46.7% and 30%) (P = 0.0001). Moreover, R rates remained elevated at 60 month for OS and LS groups (83.7% and 89.6% respectively) and 78.4% at 120 month for OS group.

Conclusion

We observed that splenectomy for ITP second-line treatment was more effective than Rituximab regarding maintenance of R, CR, and overall response rates. OS and LS had similar efficacy.

### Insights on treatment of adult ITP: algorithm for management and role of multimodal therapy [^114dntzB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is continuously evolving with the development and introduction of newer therapies and a better understanding of the disease. Corticosteroids still represent the cornerstone of first-line treatment. Patients who fail to achieve remission with a short course of corticosteroids require subsequent therapy. Most guidelines recommend starting with either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), rituximab, or fostamatinib since these agents have been investigated in randomized trials and have well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles. Patients' involvement to reach a shared decision regarding choice of therapy is essential as these treatments have different modes of administration and mechanisms of action. Less than 10% will fail to respond to and/or be intolerant of multiple second-line therapeutic options and thus be considered to have refractory ITP and require a third-line therapeutic option. Such patients may require drugs with different targets or a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Combining a TPO-RA and an immunomodulatory agent may be an appropriate approach at this stage. Many studies have been conducted during the last 2 decades investigating the efficacy and safety of combinations strategies for first and later lines of therapies. Yet none of these are recommended by current guidelines or have gained wide acceptance and consensus.

### Physician decision making in selection of second-line treatments in immune thrombocytopenia in children [^1176CV2n]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune bleeding disorder which presents with isolated thrombocytopenia and risk of hemorrhage. While most children with ITP promptly recover with or without drug therapy, ITP is persistent or chronic in others. When needed, how to select second-line therapies is not clear. ICON1, conducted within the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America (ICON), is a prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of 120 children from 21 centers starting second-line treatments for ITP which examined treatment decisions. Treating physicians reported reasons for selecting therapies, ranking the top three. In a propensity weighted model, the most important factors were patient/parental preference (53%) and treatment-related factors: side effect profile (58%), long-term toxicity (54%), ease of administration (46%), possibility of remission (45%), and perceived efficacy (30%). Physician, health system, and clinical factors rarely influenced decision-making. Patient/parent preferences were selected as reasons more often in chronic ITP (85.7%) than in newly diagnosed (0%) or persistent ITP (14.3%, P = 0.003). Splenectomy and rituximab were chosen for the possibility of inducing long-term remission (P < .001). Oral agents, such as eltrombopag and immunosuppressants, were chosen for ease of administration and expected adherence (P < .001). Physicians chose rituximab in patients with lower expected adherence (P = 0.017). Treatment choice showed some physician and treatment center bias. This study illustrates the complexity and many factors involved in decision-making in selecting second-line ITP treatments, given the absence of comparative trials. It highlights shared decision-making and the need for well-conducted, comparative effectiveness studies to allow for informed discussion between patients and clinicians.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^114jkywA]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The 2019 ASH guidelines on the management of ITP continue to be relevant and important, including recommendations related to second-line therapy for adults. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to justify a revision of the entire guideline at this time. We also recognize, however, that the 2019 recommendations on second-line therapy for adults were the result of paired comparisons of splenectomy, rituximab, and the TPO-RAs, and were based on a heterogeneous patient population. This resulted in discordant recommendations. Therefore, we recommend that a focused revision on second-line therapy for adults be conducted. We appreciate that due to the absence of comparative randomized trials and the lack of reporting on prioritized patient–related outcomes, recommendations on second-line therapy will likely remain highly dependent on patient values and preferences even with additional clinical trials. Preference for agents may also change with the prioritization of different outcomes and clinical contexts, such as the desire to avoid immunosuppression in the era of COVID-19. The updated search conducted here also identified alternate methodological approaches that would allow comparisons across several treatment strategies. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach also outlines a methodology for multiple comparisons that applies the evidence to the decision framework. Use of these methods and refinement of the population of interest may clarify the existing recommendations. This would also provide the opportunity to be inclusive of avatrombopag and fostamatinib, discussed above, as well as novel agents currently in clinical trial development. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. This update will involve the selection of a guideline panel, determination of appropriate questions, conduct of relevant literature searches, application of GRADE methodology, and publication of final recommendations. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^1171MDNA]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review identified published reports of interventional and observational studies that have evaluated the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of therapies used to treat adults with primary ITP in the second‐line setting. All therapies of interest were represented in the studies identified, and the majority of studies were observational (and primarily retrospective) in nature.

For the majority of non‐surgical treatments, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, danazol, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, vinblastine, and vincristine, there were limited published reports of any kind. Just over 11% of all 186 reports meeting our inclusion criteria focused on at least one of these agents, and only 5 studies (< 3% of total) investigated one of these agents as a monotherapy in a prospective, interventional manner. Of note, four of these studies were conducted over two decades ago. Therefore, it is not surprising that although these agents may have promise in treating ITP and are therefore listed as potential second‐line treatments in the International Consensus Report on the management of primary ITP, 1 the 2011 ASH practice guidelines for ITP do not specify these agents in their formal recommendations, stating that research on these therapies is "inadequate to allow evidence‐based recommendations on appropriate indications or timing". 19 Our recent review of the literature suggests that this is still the case.

Although no head‐to‐head RCTs directly comparing one second‐line therapy of interest to another were found, we identified 12 prospective RCTs with a placebo or SOC arm evaluating the safety and efficacy of either eltrombopag (5 studies), rituximab (2 studies), or romiplostim (5 studies). Among endpoints/outcomes of interest, at least two of these studies measured and reported some form of overall platelet response (all 12 studies), complete platelet response (7 studies), use of rescue therapies (4 studies), and occurrence of bleeding symptoms or events (10 studies). There are an insufficient number of studies for each outcome to conduct a meta‐analysis. The rate or risk ratios calculated from each trial provide important information on the safety and efficacy of the treatment studied and offer insights on how these therapies compare with one another in treating adult ITP in the second‐line setting.

### Contemporary management of primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults [^113mhdD2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a syndrome of diverse disorders that have in common immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but that differ with respect to pathogenesis, natural history and response to therapy. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or as a sequela of a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP). Primary ITP remains a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from non-autoimmune etiologies of thrombocytopenia and secondary causes of ITP. The traditional objective of management is to provide a hemostatic platelet count (> 20–30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ in most cases) while minimizing treatment-related toxicity, although treatment goals should be tailored to the individual patient and clinical setting. Corticosteroids, supplemented with either intravenous immune globulin G or anti-Rh(D) as needed, are used as upfront therapy to stop bleeding and raise the platelet count acutely in patients with newly diagnosed or newly relapsed disease. Although most adults with primary ITP respond to first-line therapy, the majority relapse after treatment is tapered and require a second-line approach to maintain a hemostatic platelet count. Standard second-line options include splenectomy, rituximab and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, romiplostim and eltrombopag. Studies that directly compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of these approaches are lacking. In the absence of such data, we do not favor a single second-line approach for all patients. Rather, we consider the pros and cons of each option with our patients and engage them in the decision-making process.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^113ur9V5]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^114dx3d8]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

In patients with immune thrombocytopenia who do not adequately respond to first‐line therapy, there is no clear consensus on which second‐line therapy to initiate and when. This situation leads to suboptimal approaches, including prolonged exposure to treatments that are not intended for long‐term use (eg, corticosteroids) and overuse of off‐label therapies (eg, rituximab) while approved, more efficacious options exist. These approaches may not only fail to address symptoms and burden of disease, but may also worsen health‐related quality of life. A better understanding of available second‐line treatments may ensure best use of therapeutic options and thereby optimize patient outcomes.

Section I. A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: second-line treatment options

The patient's history

A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist sees that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5 × 10⁹/L The internist sends her urgently to the emergency room concerned that she might possibly have leukemia. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

Review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL) and several of her very few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she has typical steroid-related side effects: feeling "a little crazy", insomnia and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147 × 10⁹/L and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure, and also thalassemia trait or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Similarly, the normal hemoglobin and neutrophil count do not suggest Evans syndrome. Her platelet counts remain in the normal range and her hemoglobin improves to the normal range. At her next visit, her platelet count has decreased to 80 × 10⁹/L. One month later, her platelet count is 28 × 10⁹/L with continued normal hemoglobin and infrequent small bruises. With her platelets trending downward, second-line treatment for her ITP is considered.

There is less urgency to consider secondary ITP or a missed diagnosis since she is doing well but at any change of management, it is good practice to re-evaluate. Below we consider some of the " what if " clinical scenarios for this young female.

### Second-line treatments in children with immune thrombocytopenia: effect on platelet count and patient-centered outcomes [^112N3q2k]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder with isolated thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic risk. While many children with ITP can be safely observed, treatments are often needed for various reasons, including to decrease bleeding, or to improve health related quality of life (HRQoL). There are a number of available second-line treatments, including rituximab, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists, oral immunosuppressive agents, and splenectomy, but data comparing treatment outcomes are lacking. ICON1 is a prospective, multi-center, observational study of 120 children starting second-line treatments for ITP designed to compare treatment outcomes including platelet count, bleeding, and HRQoL utilizing the Kids ITP Tool (KIT). While all treatments resulted in increased platelet counts, romiplostim had the most pronounced effect at 6 months (P = 0.04). Only patients on romiplostim and rituximab had a significant reduction in both skin-related (84% to 48%, P = 0.01 and 81% to 43%, P = 0.004) and non-skin-related bleeding symptoms (58% to 14%, P = 0.0001 and 54% to 17%, P = 0.0006) after 1 month of treatment. HRQoL significantly improved on all treatments. However, only patients treated with eltrombopag had a median improvement in KIT scores at 1 month that met the minimal important difference (MID). Bleeding, platelet count, and HRQoL improved in each treatment group, but the extent and timing of the effect varied among treatments. These results are hypothesis generating and help to improve our understanding of the effect of each treatment on specific patient outcomes. Combined with future randomized trials, these findings will help clinicians select the optimal second-line treatment for an individual child with ITP.

### Second-line treatment trends and long-term outcomes of 392 children with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura: the French experience over the past 25 years [^117TUaAx]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Childhood chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (cITP) is a rare disease. In severe cases, there is no evidence for the optimal therapeutic strategy. Our aim was to describe the real-life management of non-selected children with cITP at diagnosis. Since 2004, patients less than 18 years old with cITP have been enrolled in the national prospective cohort, OBS'CEREVANCE. From 1990 to 2014, in 29 centres, 392 children were diagnosed with cITP. With a median follow-up of six years (2·0–25), 45% did not need second-line therapy, and 55% (n = 217) received one or more second lines, mainly splenectomy (n = 108), hydroxychloroquine (n = 61), rituximab (n = 61) or azathioprine (n = 40). The overall five-year further second-line treatment-free survival was 56% [95% CI 49·5–64.1]. The use of splenectomy significantly decreased over time. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to children with positive antinuclear antibodies, more frequently older and girls, and reached 55% efficacy. None of the patients died. Ten years after the initial diagnosis, 55% of the 56 followed children had achieved complete remission. Children with cITP do not need second-line treatments in 45% of cases. Basing the treatment decision on the pathophysiological pathways is challenging, as illustrated by ITP patients with positive antinuclear antibodies treated with hydroxychloroquine.

Refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a challenging disease that can be defined by refractoriness to second-line treatments. In this review, we list and comment available evidence about clinical and biological factors associated with refractoriness to splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), rituximab and fostamatinib, as well as those associated with multirefractory ITP (active disease with failure of rituximab, TPO-RAs and splenectomy).

### Sequence of treatments for adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia [^114sGAk9]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Management of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has changed dramatically in the past 10 years. New regimens of corticosteroids for first-line treatment have been introduced and are currently being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Many patients may not have durable remissions with initial corticosteroid regimens and may require additional, second-line, treatment. For these patients, rituximab has been increasingly used, as it has for other autoimmune disorders, and new thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor agonists have been developed. Although splenectomy was the first effective and remains the most effective treatment for ITP, inducing durable complete remissions in 66% of patients, rituximab and TPO-receptor agonists are now additional options for second-line treatment. For patients who continue to have severe and symptomatic thrombocytopenia following failure of multiple treatments, including splenectomy and rituximab, the TPO-receptor agonists are effective as third-line treatment for maintaining safe platelets counts to prevent bleeding symptoms in most patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by a reduction in platelet count that may be associated with severe bleeding in some patients. 1 The disease may have a substantial impact on the patient's quality of life, resulting, at least in part, from significant treatment burden. Indeed, health‐related quality of life for patients with ITP may be worse than that of patients with many other chronic conditions, including hypertension and arthritis. 2

First‐line treatments for ITP include corticosteroids (prednisone, dexamethasone), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti‐D (Rh0) immunoglobulin. 3 These therapies are used as upfront treatment in newly diagnosed patients and also as rescue therapies in patients with established ITP, with the goal of rapidly elevating platelet counts and preventing or controlling bleeding events. 4 While corticosteroids and immunoglobulins produce an initial response in most patients (60%‐70% and 90%, respectively), the response is usually transient (< 6 months and 2–4 weeks, respectively) and the medications must be readministered if the patient's platelet count does not stabilize. 5 Repeated or prolonged administration of first‐line therapies is typically not suitable due to significant adverse effects (eg, osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, weight gain, infections) with corticosteroids and high cost, inconvenience of frequent infusions, and debilitating post‐infusion headache with immunoglobulins. 4, 6, 7

Spontaneous remissions in patients who have never received treatment are uncommon in adults with ITP (9%). In many patients, the disease becomes persistent (3–12 months duration) or chronic (> 12 months duration), and second‐line treatment may be needed. 3, 8, 9

Comparing second-line treatment options in non-pregnant premenopausal females.

It is prudent to check immunoglobulin levels to rule out CVID and a hepatitis B panel prior to starting rituximab. The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) and delayed vaccination are in addition to other potential side effects such as first-infusion reactions, serum sickness, and even the very rare possibility of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. If dexamethasone and rituximab are combined, there is a 10–20% possibility of developing hypogammaglobulinemia which may necessitate IVIG for a few months even in patients who start out with normal immunoglobulin levels. Combining this problem with the issue of the patient being unable to undergo vaccination for COVID reduces the benefit/risk ratio of rituximab treatment substantially, despite its curative potential. If the coronavirus pandemic wanes, this may be less of a consideration.

If treatment with rituximab is delayed too long in this woman, the chance of "cure" may be reduced. Her immunoglobulin levels are normal and she does not have hepatitis B surface antigen, so the risks of aggravated hepatitis B and hypogammaglobulinemia are less substantial. Lucchini et al. provide more information on the place of rituximab treatment in ITP.

Whether because of vaccination and/or infection, the current COVID pandemic is affecting ITP management and may have an impact on patients who are on second-line ITP treatment options. Guidelines on post-infection or vaccination ITP treatment are summarized in Table 2. Our patient should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at least 5–8 weeks before initiating rituximab in order to have time to receive and fully respond to both doses of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. It might be optimal to wait a little longer afterwards to sustain the vaccine effect. If the patient is not vaccinated prior to rituximab treatment, she will not be able to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 for at least 6 if not 12 months; this would also apply to a booster vaccination (Table 2). The vaccination might affect her platelet count although she is not in a high-risk group which includes those who have had a prior splenectomy and/or five or more lines of previous ITP treatment. There is limited information on the risk of developing severe COVID in ITP patients undergoing rituximab therapy. In CVID and especially agammaglobulinemia patients, the ability to clear the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be limited, and a patient may remain polymerase chain reaction-positive for weeks or even months.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^116THFqQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although not formally studied as a treatment arm in any prospective RCT, splenectomy is widely covered in the literature. Importantly, it is still generally recommended as the standard therapy for patients with chronic ITP, given the high probability of durable platelet response. 1, 11, 19 However, this invasive surgical procedure is not without risk; perioperative and short‐term and long‐term postoperative complications, such as infections, thromboembolic events, and increased risk of certain malignancies including buccal, esophageal, colon, liver, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and hematopoietic cancers have been observed. 64, 65 Additionally, there is currently no ability to reliably predict who will respond, and there is evidence that a portion of non‐splenectomized patients will experience late remissions either spontaneously or with continuing medical treatment. 22, 66, 67 Due to these issues and because of the availability of medical alternatives, splenectomy may not be the "go‐to" treatment it once was for patients requiring second‐line therapy, 21 as evidenced by recent temporal trends in the uptake of splenectomy. 17, 18 For example, in a study conducted in Denmark, the 1‐year cumulative incidence of splenectomy among patients with ITP for a duration of at least 6 months decreased in recent years, from 10% for those diagnosed in 1996 through 2001 to 3% for those diagnosed in 2008 through 2012. 18 With fewer patients undergoing splenectomy in the second‐line setting, there is a need to further investigate the potential for medical treatments to delay or obviate the need for splenectomy.

### How I treat immune thrombocytopenia: the choice between splenectomy or a medical therapy as a second-line treatment [^113DJ5eS]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The paradigm for managing primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults has changed with the advent of rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as options for second-line therapy. Splenectomy continues to provide the highest cure rate (60%-70% at 5+ years). Nonetheless, splenectomy is invasive, irreversible, associated with postoperative complications, and its outcome is currently unpredictable, leading some physicians and patients toward postponement and use of alternative approaches. An important predicament is the lack of studies comparing second-line options to splenectomy and to each other. Furthermore, some adults will improve spontaneously within 1–2 years. Rituximab has been given to more than 1 million patients worldwide, is generally well tolerated, and its short-term toxicity is acceptable. In adults with ITP, 40% of patients are complete responders at one year and 20% remain responders at 3–5 years. Newer approaches to using rituximab are under study. TPO-RAs induce platelet counts > 50 000/μL in 60%-90% of adults with ITP, are well-tolerated, and show relatively little short-term toxicity. The fraction of TPO-RA-treated patients who will be treatment-free after 12–24 months of therapy is unknown but likely to be low. As each approach has advantages and disadvantages, treatment needs to be individualized, and patient participation in decision-making is paramount.

On the one hand, rituximab with dexamethasone seems a good treatment option because, if she responds well to the four weekly infusions, she can be checked relatively infrequently afterward. On the other hand, the effects on response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are clinically significant. There appears to have been a marked decrease in rituximab use in ITP since the onset of the COVID pandemic.

### Fostamatinib is an effective second-line therapy in patients with immune thrombocytopenia [^113vaxYR]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Fostamatinib demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 trials of adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Post hoc analysis compared patients who received fostamatinib as second‐line therapy (after steroids ± immunoglobulins) versus third‐or‐later‐line therapy (after ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy including a second‐line agent). Platelet responses ≥ 50 000/µl were observed in 25/32 (78%) second‐line and 54/113 (48%) third‐or‐later‐line patients. Bleeding events were less frequent in second‐line (28%) versus third‐or‐later‐line (45%) patients. Responses once achieved tended to be durable in both groups. The safety profile was similar in both groups. In this post hoc analysis, fostamatinib was more effective as second‐line than third‐or‐later‐line therapy for ITP.

### Immune thrombocytopenia guidelines get an annual checkup [^113Wo5F1]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Blood Advances, Neunert et alreport on their systematic review of the literature performed to determine the need to revise or update the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In this field with multiple novel therapies on the horizon and many new publications reporting on potential important mechanisms of disease and targets for therapy, the group looked to reassess the validity of the provided guidance. The findings indicate that although new evidence has emerged, it is insufficient to dramatically change the current guidelines or justify a full guideline revision. This article discusses the results of the literature review and the recommendations for changes to the guideline, especially suggesting clarification of second-line therapies in adults with ITP and updates to several other recommendations.

One of the major criticisms of the 2019 guidelines has been that clinicians are rarely in the position of deciding only between 2 treatments that is thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist (RA) or splenectomy/rituximab or TPO RA, but the available methodology at the time did not have viable way to compare more treatment options. Since then, new methodologies have been developed, and a focused update to allow for updated guidance is proposed in this review, based on the available literature. Most of the other updates, based on a total of 54 studies, are not going to change the take home points of the original 2019 guidelines.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^112XACYQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, this systematic review of the literature provides a comprehensive and updated view of the evidence around the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of second‐line treatments for adult primary ITP based on nearly 200 studies conducted in several populations worldwide. It confirms that a gap remains: outside of the TPO‐RAs eltrombopag and romiplostim, the majority of treatment options for managing recurrent or persistent thrombocytopenia are still without rigorous evidence from RCTs to demonstrate safety and efficacy in this setting, and many treatments have limited supportive evidence of any kind. These findings are echoed in a recent review, although not systematic in nature but based on extensive clinical experience, where Lambert and Gernsheimer 10 conclude that for the second‐line treatment of adult ITP patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding, evidence to date supports medical alternatives to splenectomy, specifically in the context of both TPO‐RAs, which are now backed by long‐term follow‐up data on efficacy and safety. 69, 70

### Immune thrombocytopenia guidelines get an annual checkup [^111VnzLi]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the authors give the pediatric guidelines a clean bill of health. The authors acknowledge newly published work investigating intravenous immunoglobulin vs observation in children with newly diagnosed ITP and note small trials of sirolimus, cyclosporine, and hydroxychloroquine in children with non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health–related quality of life. The updated guidelines are not likely to be very different but will have further support for observation of patients without bleeding symptoms based on the results of the randomized clinical trial for intravenous immunoglobulin.

Underlying this report is an important question: how often should guidelines be reviewed or revised? Benchmarks developed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines include regular "updating" as a criterion by which clinical practice guidelines may be judged. But the interval at which guidelines should be reviewed is intentionally left vague, because the benefits of review must be weighed against the time, effort, and resources needed to enact them. Timing of review is also dependent on the speed of research in a given field. By committing to yearly reviews, the authors underscore the pace at which new evidence is being generated in the field of ITP.

In conclusion, Neunert et al demonstrate that although progress has been made in ITP, the 2019 guidelines remain pertinent. We look forward to a focused update or clarification on second-line therapy for adults, particulary because of discordant recommendations in the last guideline. However, this literature review demonstrated that despite a large body of work in ITP since the publication of the last guidelines, all the prior recommendations remain relevant, and a complete guideline revision is not necessary. As research moves apace and medical literature ever expands, it becomes critical for guidelines to remain dynamic. An annual and focused approach to updating the ITP guidelines will create a flexible resource that all practitioners can trust.

### Fostamatinib is an effective second-line therapy in patients with immune thrombocytopenia [^117FGjNp]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoantibody‐mediated, heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased platelet counts and increased risk of bleeding. 1, 2 The goals of ITP treatment are to increase platelet counts to haemostatic levels to reduce and prevent bleeding. The American Society of Hematology 2019 Guidelines and Updated International Consensus Report for management of ITP recommend a minimum platelet count of 20 000–30 000/µl but to individualize treatment. 1, 2, 3 Initial treatment is generally with corticosteroids with intravenous immunoglobulin if needed. 1, 2, 3, 4 Approved second‐line treatments include the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor fostamatinib and thrombopoietic receptor agonists (TPO‐RA): eltrombopag, avatrombopag, and romiplostim. 2, 5, 6 Anti‐CD20 antibody (rituximab) and splenectomy are also widely used options, as are immunosuppressants and alternative medicines. 2, 7, 8 There is very limited evidence to guide sequencing of treatments since only single‐arm or placebo‐controlled trials exist. 2, 5, 9, 10, 11

Fostamatinib demonstrated efficacy in 8/16 patients in a phase 2 study. 12 In two phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials in heavily pretreated patients (median 3 and up to 14 prior treatments) with long‐standing ITP (median 8·4 years), responses were observed within 12 weeks in 43% of 101 patients receiving fostamatinib and 14% of 49 patients receiving placebo (P = 0.0006). 13 Most had previously failed treatment with rituximab, TPO‐RA, and/or splenectomy and some subsequently responded to fostamatinib. However, those who were earlier in their ITP appeared to have a higher response rate to fostamatinib. 13, 14

To evaluate fostamatinib earlier in the disease course, post hoc analysis of the phase 3 and open‐label extension studies compared patient subgroups by line of therapy (second‐line versus third‐or‐later‐line) and stage of disease (persistent versus early or late chronic ITP).

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^1172mBD5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^113JNGRX]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting that since the publication of the most recent International Consensus Report and ASH guidelines on the management of primary ITP, 1, 19 fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, was approved in April 2018 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults who have had an insufficient response to prior therapy. This was based on two parallel phase 3 placebo‐controlled RCTs conducted in Australia, Europe, and North America that studied a total of 150 patients with persistent or chronic ITP, of whom 101 received fostamatinib. 71 In the pooled analysis of the two studies, 18% of patients who received fostamatinib achieved a stable response by week 24 (vs 2% in the placebo group, P = 0.0003), defined as platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L without rescue medication on at least 4 of the 6 clinic visits occurring every 2 weeks during weeks 14 through 24. Overall response, defined as at least one platelet count ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L within the first 12 weeks, was assessed as a post hoc endpoint and was achieved in 43% of fostamatinib patients (vs 14% in the placebo group, P = 0.0006). Of note, these studies included patients with long‐standing ITP (median duration of 8.5 years), a median of 3 unique prior ITP treatments, and an average baseline platelet count < 20 × 10 9 /L. This may represent a promising new treatment for ITP with a unique mechanism of action, but additional research is needed to further assess its long‐term clinical efficacy and safety and identify those most likely to respond. It remains to be seen if and how this therapy will be incorporated into future ITP management guidelines.

Ideally, more randomized and controlled clinical studies would be conducted to properly assess the risk: benefit profile of any existing or new treatment by itself or against other options in this setting. Alternatively, given the rarity of both ITP and any potential adverse events associated with a given therapy, well‐designed non‐interventional studies using large population‐based sources of data, such as those from administrative claims databases, electronic health record databases, or disease‐specific or treatment‐specific registries, could offer valuable evidence on the real‐world effectiveness and safety and comparative effectiveness and safety of available treatments. 72 In the absence of such studies, clinical expertise, patient preference and shared decision making will continue to be the primary drivers of treatment decisions rather than high‐quality clinical trial evidence or robust observational studies.

### Rituximab in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia: what is the role of this agent in 2019? [^114pv8Bk]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Rituximab in immune thrombocytopenia

In 2001, Stasi et al. reported the results of the first prospective study in which 25 patients with chronic ITP were treated with four weekly infusions of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m². The overall response rate (ORR) was 52%, with 28% sustained responses. No clinical or laboratory parameters were found to predict treatment response, but they noticed that women and younger patients had a better chance of response, and that, in some patients who relapsed, retreatment was effective.

Subsequent studies showed that the overall initial response to rituximab used as second- or further-line of therapy ranges between 52% and 73%, with the complete response (CR) rate ranging between 20% and 54% –, (Table 1). In a systematic review including 313 adult patients with chronic ITP, a response rate of 62.5% and a CR rate of 46.3% were found, with a median duration of response of 10.5 months.

Table 1.
Most relevant studies with rituximab administered at a standard dose of 375 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.

Three different patterns of response can be distinguished: a first group of patients respond rapidly, within the first month; in the second group, the platelet count starts increasing after 3–4 weeks, and a CR is achieved within 8 weeks after treatment; in the third group of patients, the platelet count increases very slowly, only reaching normal values 3 months after therapy.

Only two randomized, placebo-controlled studies have been performed. One very small pilot randomized trial compared rituximab with placebo as second-line therapy. No difference in terms of treatment failure (65.6% vs. 80.8%)was found between the two groups. Overall platelet count response (i.e. platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L) was achieved by 62.5% of the patients in the rituximab group and 73.1% in the placebo group at 6 months.

In the much larger RITP trial, the rate of treatment failure was not significantly different between patients given rituximab or placebo (58% vs. 69%), and the ORR was 81% in the rituximab group compared to 73% in the placebo group. Improvements in platelet counts were seen up to week 72 in the rituximab arm.

### Rituximab before splenectomy in adults with primary idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a meta-analysis [^116SrDHB]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired immune-mediated disorder with absence of any underlying cause. Corticosteroids are the standard initial treatment. Splenectomy is the main second-line treatment. A trend to delay or avoid splenectomy has developed thanks to new agents like rituximab. Few studies have assessed the response rate to rituximab in chronic ITP. We performed the first meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials and observational studies on rituximab as an effective splenectomy-avoiding option in adult chronic ITP. Overall methods were adapted from published guidelines for meta-analysis (meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). Two haematologist investigators carried out study selection and data extraction independently, recording overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) as primary assessment criteria. Of 364 records were identified through electronic databases. Of 19 retrospective or prospective observational studies were retained after removing duplicate studies and full-text analyses. The ORR was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48–65), for 368 non-splenectomized patients after rituximab; CR was 41% (95% CI: 0·33–0·51) for 346 patients. Results were stable for ORR and CR in all sub-analyses. In univariate or multivariate mixed-effect meta-regression, age was the most relevant effect. According to our results, rituximab should be used in earlier in non-splenectomized patients.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^1119essR]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Quality of life is an important indication for second-line treatment in children with immune thrombocytopenia [^116EER2h]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to initiate second-line treatment in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is complex and involves many different factors.

Methods

In this prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of 120 children from 21 centers, the factors contributing to the decision to start second-line treatments for ITP were captured. At study entry, clinicians were given a curated list of 12 potential reasons the patient required a second-line treatment. Clinicians selected all that applied and ranked the top three reasons.

Results

Quality of life (QOL) was the most frequently cited reason for starting a second-line therapy. Clinicians chose it as a reason to treat in 88/120 (73%) patients, as among the top three reasons in 68/120 (57%), and as the top reason in 32/120 (27%). Additional factors ranked as the top reason to start second-line treatment included severity of bleeding (22/120, 18%), frequency of bleeding (19/120, 16%), and severity of thrombocytopenia (18/120, 15%). Patients for whom QOL (p = .006) or sports participation (p = .02) were ranked reasons were more likely to have chronic ITP, whereas those for whom severity (p = .003) or frequency (p = .005) of bleeding were ranked reasons were more likely to have newly diagnosed or persistent ITP. Parental anxiety, though rarely the primary impetus for treatment, was frequently cited (70/120, 58%) as a contributing factor.

Conclusion

Perceived QOL is the most frequently selected reason pediatric patients start second-line therapies for ITP. It is critical that studies of treatments for childhood ITP include assessments of their effects on QOL.

3.5 Use of other off‐label agents

The agents listed above as "other treatments" have been utilized in ITP as alternative treatments due to cost and availability considerations. However, these agents may produce highly variable responses in individual patients and may require weeks or months to be effective. 3 Thus, they may potentially be of use as adjunct therapy in patients with insufficient response to second‐line therapy, but they are not recommended for most patients unless available second‐line options have been exhausted. An important exception is patients in countries where access to TPO‐RAs and rituximab may be limited.

### Fostamatinib is an effective second-line therapy in patients with immune thrombocytopenia [^116w661q]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fostamatinib demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 trials of adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Post hoc analysis compared patients who received fostamatinib as second-line therapy (after steroids ± immunoglobulins) versus third-or-later-line therapy (after ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy including a second-line agent). Platelet responses ≥ 50 000/µl were observed in 25/32 (78%) second-line and 54/113 (48%) third-or-later-line patients. Bleeding events were less frequent in second-line (28%) versus third-or-later-line (45%) patients. Responses once achieved tended to be durable in both groups. The safety profile was similar in both groups. In this post hoc analysis, fostamatinib was more effective as second-line than third-or-later-line therapy for ITP.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^113Nketi]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare platelet disorder that is often persistent or chronic in adults. Patient management is dependent upon physician judgment and patient preference, given both the rarity of the condition and a paucity of high-quality clinical trial evidence to inform practice guidelines. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide an up-to-date summary of studies evaluating the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of therapies used to treat adults with primary ITP in the second-line setting. Using comprehensive search strings, several medical research databases were queried. Final abstraction was performed on 186 articles. Most (75%) studies were observational in nature; nearly half were conducted in Europe. Splenectomy was the most commonly studied (n = 83, 47%), followed by rituximab (n = 49, 26%) and the thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) romiplostim (n = 34, 18%) and eltrombopag (n = 24, 13%). Twelve prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a placebo or standard-of-care arm evaluating the safety and efficacy of either rituximab or a TPO-RA were identified and described in detail. These trials provide important information on the safety and efficacy of these treatments, and in the absence of head-to-head data, offer insights on how these therapies compare with one another in treating adult ITP in the second-line setting. This review confirms that for most second-line ITP treatment options, there remains a lack of rigorous evidence derived from RCTs, and for many treatments, there is limited evidence of any kind. The need for additional research to guide treatment choices in this setting and greater use of standardized ITP terminology are highlighted.

### Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^116LMLcK]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by accelerated platelet clearance and impaired platelet production. ITP is termed "chronic" when it has been present for at least 12 months. Relative to the pediatric population, spontaneous remission of ITP in adults is less common, with over half of affected adults developing chronic ITP.

First‐line treatments for ITP include corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. However, these treatments are not suitable for long‐term use. Therefore, adults with chronic ITP often require second‐line therapy to maintain a hemostatic platelet count. The three major second‐line therapies for ITP include the anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab; the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TRAs), romiplostim, eltrombopag, and avatrombopag; and splenectomy. The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines recommend (1) TRA over rituximab (recommendation #9) and (2) rituximab over splenectomy (recommendation #8), with splenectomy being the least favored treatment. As a reflection of the ASH guidelines, the use of splenectomy in adult patients with chronic ITP is often reserved for patients who fail TRA or rituximab therapy. The guidelines note that these three treatments are often considered simultaneously and that treatment should be selected on an individual basis based on patient values and preferences, availability of therapies, and cost.

Despite their vastly different durable response rates, toxicity profiles, and costs, cost‐effectiveness of second‐line therapies for chronic ITP has not yet been examined. This is notable given the impact of rare diseases on the healthcare system, where costs are disproportionate to disease prevalence. We sought to address this knowledge gap by conducting the first cost‐effectiveness analysis of second‐line treatment strategies in chronic ITP.

### Immune thrombocytopenia guidelines get an annual checkup [^112gBhbC]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

For example, although 2 new systematic reviews and 1 new randomized clinical trial looked at corticosteroids, the results of these studies did not provide sufficient difference to change the strength or direction of the 2019 guideline recommendation of a single course of either prednisone or dexamethasone as first-line therapy. In addition, although the authors found no new trials addressing the addition of rituximab to first-line therapy, they did identify trials of combination therapy of corticosteroids paired with other treatments: TPO-RAs, all-trans retinoic acid, and mycophenolate mofetil, which make up a new category of therapeutic options but do not overall change recommendations for preferred therapeutic options.

One of the most exciting parts of the ITP therapeutic landscape is the emergence of novel therapies, and the review acknowledges these developments. The novel TPO-RA (avatrombopag approved by the Food and Drug Administration and hetrombopag approved in China) are already addressed in current guideline language, and the additional literature for new drugs in this class did not alter recommendations for safety or efficacy in adults with persistent or chronic ITP. Meanwhile, the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib has mainly been studied in patients who are highly refractory, making generalizability difficult, but there has been new literature to support this therapeutic option in a more general ITP population. We can expect a focused update to help clarify second-line therapies and also using new methodologies to potentially examine multiple treatment types limiting analysis to pairwise comparisons.

Abstract

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare platelet disorder that is often persistent or chronic in adults. Patient management is dependent upon physician judgment and patient preference, given both the rarity of the condition and a paucity of high‐quality clinical trial evidence to inform practice guidelines. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide an up‐to‐date summary of studies evaluating the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of therapies used to treat adults with primary ITP in the second‐line setting. Using comprehensive search strings, several medical research databases were queried. Final abstraction was performed on 186 articles. Most (75%) studies were observational in nature; nearly half were conducted in Europe. Splenectomy was the most commonly studied (n = 83, 47%), followed by rituximab (n = 49, 26%) and the thrombopoietin‐receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs) romiplostim (n = 34, 18%) and eltrombopag (n = 24, 13%). Twelve prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a placebo or standard‐of‐care arm evaluating the safety and efficacy of either rituximab or a TPO‐RA were identified and described in detail. These trials provide important information on the safety and efficacy of these treatments, and in the absence of head‐to‐head data, offer insights on how these therapies compare with one another in treating adult ITP in the second‐line setting. This review confirms that for most second‐line ITP treatment options, there remains a lack of rigorous evidence derived from RCTs, and for many treatments, there is limited evidence of any kind. The need for additional research to guide treatment choices in this setting and greater use of standardized ITP terminology are highlighted.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^113vXV3M]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate one second‐line therapy may be considered for another second‐line option. In patients with chronic ITP who do not sufficiently benefit from TPO‐RAs, rituximab remains an option. If all second‐line pharmaceutical agents and their combinations fail to achieve a response, splenectomy should be considered in patients who have had ITP for > 1 year.

4.3 Optimal use of TPO‐RAs in the second line

The minimum TPO‐RA dose necessary to maintain a target platelet count and prevent bleeding should be used. If a patient achieves a platelet count within or above the target range at the lowest recommended dose of TPO‐RA (ie, eltrombopag 12.5 mg/day or romiplostim 1 mcg/kg/week), I hold the TPO‐RA and follow the platelet count closely off therapy to monitor for potential remissions.

Patients who do not respond to or do not tolerate a TPO‐RA may switch to the alternate TPO‐RA. The majority of patients who switch TPO‐RA treatment respond to the alternate TPO‐RA, even if the reason for switching was lack of efficacy with the initial TPO‐RA. 32, 64, 65

Abrupt interruptions of TPO‐RAs or excessive dose adjustments may cause platelet fluctuations and should be avoided. Platelet fluctuations are more common with romiplostim and in that case could be resolved by switching to eltrombopag. 64, 65 Platelet fluctuations may also be more common in splenectomized patients, potentially due to the absence of normal splenic functions, including platelet sequestration. 64, 66

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111TT4vg]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a complicated disease because of its heterogeneity and lack of diagnostic markers making selection of treatment difficult. Perhaps the most straightforward part of management is at presentation of ITP. If the platelet count is very low and no other findings are present, the worldwide consensus treatment is steroids. Whether dexamethasone, prednisone/prednisolone (prednis[ol]one), or intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone is used, the response rate and side effects are relatively predictable. IV methylprednisolone or dexamethasone increases the platelet counts faster and may have fewer side effects than have weeks of prednis(ol)one treatment. Questions revolve around whether to add IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or platelet transfusion. While the latter is rarely appropriate if there is serious bleeding and/or the diagnosis is unclear, an analysis based on medical records in the USA identified that as many as 25% of ITP patients receive platelet transfusion, which is far too many.

The management of ITP becomes more complicated if other findings arise, if patients do not respond to steroids, or if patients continue to require treatment. Both the American Society of Hematology guidelines and an international consensus report emphasize that continued steroid use beyond 6 weeks is to be avoided. Compliance with this strong recommendation entails earlier use of "second-line" therapy in patients with ITP, a practice already gaining traction. However, the definition of "early" remains fluid; "early" can be at 1 month of steroid treatment to allow discontinuation of steroids. "Early" can also be in the first 3 months when ITP is "newly diagnosed. These ill-defined distinctions are one reason for substantial variation in the management of ITP. Another is the uncertainty of diagnosis. A third, the focus of this discussion, is how to select second-line treatment.

This review focuses on the initiation of second-line treatment reviewing the pros and cons of different agents utilizing a case-based approach by first exploring ITP in a young female and continuing throughout her pregnancy. The review then outlines diagnostic considerations and management in an older male with particular attention to secondary ITP in both patients.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia: down but not out [^115Ffz1X]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Splenectomy is an effective therapy for steroid-refractory or dependent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). With the advent of medical alternatives such as rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor antagonists, the use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients that fail multiple medical therapies. Splenectomy removes the primary site of platelet clearance and autoantibody production and offers the highest rate of durable response (50% to 70%) compared with other ITP therapies. However, there are no reliable predictors of splenectomy response, and long-term risks of infection and cardiovascular complications must be considered. Because the long-term efficacy of different second-line medical therapies for ITP have not been directly compared, treatment decisions must be made without supportive evidence. Splenectomy continues to be a reasonable treatment option for many patients, including those with an active lifestyle who desire freedom from medication and monitoring, and patients with fulminant ITP that does not respond well to medical therapy. We try to avoid splenectomy within the first 12 months after ITP diagnosis for most patients to allow for spontaneous or therapy-induced remissions, particularly in older patients who have increased surgical morbidity and lower rates of response, and in young children. Treatment decisions must be individualized based on patients' comorbidities, lifestyles, and preferences. Future research should focus on comparing long-term outcomes of patients treated with different second-line therapies and on developing personalized medicine approaches to identify subsets of patients most likely to respond to splenectomy or other therapeutic approaches.

### Autoimmune thrombocytopenia [^113mUeG8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder in which platelets coated with mainly antibodies against platelet GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX are destroyed in the spleen. Recent evidence suggests that platelets are also destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. The diagnosis is made by exclusion for other causes of thrombocytopenia. As routine blood counts are becoming more available, many mild cases of ITP (platelets > 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹) are being diagnosed and they usually do not require treatment. In patients with platelet counts persistently < 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹, treatment with corticosteroids, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or anti-D may be required. The primary goal of treatment is to maintain the platelet count at a safe level with minimal side effects. After 3–6 months, if spontaneous remission has not occurred and if the side effects are significant, splenectomy is recommended. This is the single most effective treatment of ITP. The refractory patients who fails splenectomy and subsequently first- and second-line therapies, is a management dilemma. Therapeutic options are limited, available treatments potentially toxic and the chances of sustained response low. Observation with no active treatment is a reasonable option. With the increased availability of the thrombopoietic agents in the future, there may be a good prospect of keeping the platelet counts of these refractory patients at a safe long-term level with one of these drugs.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^114XbV2H]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), its secondary forms, and choice of second-line treatment options. We very briefly summarize first-line treatment and then utilize a case-based approach. We first explore persistent, chronic ITP in a younger female. We consider many possibilities beyond primary ITP e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic infection, and anemia, and how to approach their diagnosis and management. The journey continues throughout pregnancy and the post-partum period and eventually includes fourth-line treatment after a late relapse. We then consider an older male, emphasizing differences in diagnostic considerations and management. The focus is on initiation and continuation of second-line treatment, the pros and cons of each option, and briefly the impact of treatment choices related to the endemic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. During the review of potential second-line treatment options, we also briefly touch upon novel treatments. Finally, there is a short section on refractory disease drawn from our previous extensive review published in February 2020.1 The clinical nature of the discussions, replete with figures and tables and with the interspersion of pearls regarding efficacy and toxicity at different ages and genders, will serve the reader in the management of "typical" adult patients who develop persistent and chronic ITP.

### The immune thrombocytopenia paradox: should we be concerned about thrombosis in ITP? [^113S2bKz]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the predisposition to bleeding, patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may also have an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, which can contribute to significant morbidity. The risk of thrombosis increases with age and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. This narrative review explores the multifactorial nature of thrombosis in ITP, focusing on new pathological mechanisms, emerging evidence on the association between established treatments and thrombotic risk, the role of novel treatment approaches, and the challenges in assessing the balance between bleeding and thrombosis in ITP. The review also explores the challenges in managing acute thrombotic events in ITP, since the platelet count does not always reliably predict either the risk of bleeding or thrombosis and antithrombotic strategies lack specific guidelines for ITP. Notably, second-line therapeutic options, such as splenectomy and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), exhibit an increased risk of thrombosis especially in older individuals or those with multiple thrombotic risk factors or previous thrombosis, emphasizing the importance of careful risk assessment before treatment selection. In this context, it is important to consider second-line therapies such as rituximab and other immunosuppressive agents, dapsone and fostamatinib, which are not associated with increased thrombotic risk. In particular, fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has promisingly low thrombotic risk. During the current era of the emergence of several novel ITP therapies that do not pose additional risks for thrombosis, it is critical to outline evidence-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in ITP patients.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^111a5SyC]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. The guidelines addressed the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP as well as persistent and chronic ITP with regard to hospitalization, observation, and treatment selection of both first- and second-line agents. The guidelines also carried forward recommendations from the 2011 ASH guidelines for ITP related to diagnostic testing in patients with ITP, management of Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles mumps rubella vaccine–associated ITP. This review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts was requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^115GTiyH]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

3 CHALLENGES IN THE TRANSITION TO SECOND‐LINE TREATMENT

In patients who require additional treatment after first‐line therapy, there is no consensus on when to stop first‐line treatment and switch to a therapy more suitable for maintaining a long‐term response. In addition, there is no consensus on which second‐line option to try first. Perhaps because of this uncertainty, several common suboptimal treatment approaches have emerged in clinical practice.

3.1 Excessive duration of corticosteroid treatment

As corticosteroid treatment is a familiar, low‐cost, and efficacious option for many patients, some clinicians maintain their patients on corticosteroids for months or even years before transitioning to a second‐line therapy. This practice may increase not only the risk of bleeding due to poor management of thrombocytopenia as the corticosteroid dose is tapered, but also the risk of adverse events associated with prolonged exposure to corticosteroids, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, and infections. 6

Patients with ITP already experience a high burden of disease; thus, best efforts should be made to provide treatment options that do not augment the overall burden. Inadequate management of thrombocytopenia may cause emergencies that exacerbate a patient's fear of bleeding. Hospitalizations for emergencies or infusion treatments may also impact the patient's day‐to‐day functioning and be disruptive for work or school. Adverse events associated with corticosteroids are particularly burdensome. Brown et al reported that nearly all patients who received corticosteroids for ITP experienced adverse events, most commonly weight gain or increased appetite and personality/mood changes. Among patients who received corticosteroids, 53% were very highly bothered by the adverse events, compared to 9%‐11% of patients receiving other ITP treatments. 60

3.2 Premature splenectomy

Splenectomy may induce remission and eliminate the need for further treatment, and thus it is sometimes considered soon after diagnosis and before the exhaustion of other treatment options. However, splenectomy is an invasive and irreversible process that leads to a loss of multiple hematological and immunological functions. 10 Therefore, unless there is an urgent need to raise the platelet count and the patient does not respond to or cannot tolerate second‐line medical therapies, splenectomy should generally be reserved for patients in whom remission is unlikely (ie, those with a disease duration of > 1 year). 61

### Positioning new treatments in the management of immune thrombocytopenia [^113pRFty]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a syndrome characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. For most children, ITP is a self-limiting disease; however, for some children and most adults, thrombocytopenia can become chronic. Newer therapies for ITP include rituximab and thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists. Rituximab is a useful second-line therapy and may be splenectomy-sparing. Thrombopoeitin receptor agonists have demonstrated large treatment effects with respect to increasing platelet levels; however, they require maintenance dosing. This review summarizes how these new agents might be positioned in the management of patients with chronic ITP.

### Second-line therapies in immune thrombocytopenia [^111eGF6X]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare, acquired autoimmune condition characterized by a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. Although many children and adults with ITP will not need therapy beyond historic first-line treatments of observation, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D globulin, others will have an indication for second-line treatment. Selecting a second-line therapy depends on the reason for treatment, which can vary from bleeding to implications for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to likelihood of remission and patient preference with regard to adverse effects, route of administration, and cost. Published studies of these treatments are limited by lack of comparative trials, in addition to inconsistent outcome measures, definitions, and efficacy endpoints. This article provides an up-to-date comparison of the second-line treatments, highlighting important outcome measures including bleeding, HRQoL, fatigue, and platelet counts, which influence treatment selection in a shared decision-making model.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) second-line therapy harms include infection, thrombosis, and operative complications, with infection occurring in 10.0%, 6.9%, and 3.7% of patients treated with splenectomy, TPO-RAs, and rituximab, respectively; thrombosis occurring at similar percentages (2.4% with splenectomy, 2.5% with TPO-RAs, 2.2% with rituximab); and operative complications reported in 12.8% of patients undergoing splenectomy. The panel determined that splenectomy had moderate undesirable effects compared with rituximab and did not make a judgment on the undesirable effects of TPO-RAs compared with splenectomy or rituximab.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^113nSxXt]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) second-line selection — evidence-to-decision considerations and conditional recommendations — states that TPO-RAs are more expensive than splenectomy or rituximab, equity and feasibility may be reduced with TPO-RAs and rituximab due to availability and coverage limits, and administration differs between romiplostim and eltrombopag. The panel acknowledged that there is no single second-line treatment that is optimal and that treatment should be individualized. For patients with ITP of < 12 months' duration, it may be preferable to delay splenectomy when possible, and when choosing between TPO-RAs and rituximab the panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of TPO-RAs; rituximab might be preferable for those prioritizing avoidance of long-term treatment or who cannot afford TPO-RAs. For adults who have had ITP for > 12 months, splenectomy, TPO-RAs, and rituximab were considered viable options, and the panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of rituximab over splenectomy because of the operative risks and irreversible nature of splenectomy with attendant long-term risks.

The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10^9/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10^9/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^113djX1u]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with immune thrombocytopenia who do not adequately respond to first-line therapy, there is no clear consensus on which second-line therapy to initiate and when. This situation leads to suboptimal approaches, including prolonged exposure to treatments that are not intended for long-term use (eg, corticosteroids) and overuse of off-label therapies (eg, rituximab) while approved, more efficacious options exist. These approaches may not only fail to address symptoms and burden of disease, but may also worsen health-related quality of life. A better understanding of available second-line treatments may ensure best use of therapeutic options and thereby optimize patient outcomes.

Background

Despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there are minimal data from randomized trials to assist physicians with the management of patients.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the management of ITP.

Methods

In 2015, ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 8 adult clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel reviewed the ASH 2011 guideline recommendations and prioritized questions. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence (up to May 2017) and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non-life-threatening bleeding. Management approaches included: observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations for various management approaches. In general, strategies that avoided medication side effects were favored. A large focus was placed on shared decision-making, especially with regard to second-line therapy. Future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^115cE4iR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^114vcXsU]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

We examined the cost‐effectiveness of the three major second‐line therapies recommended in the 2019 ASH and International Working Group guidelines for treatment of chronic ITP. Our findings suggest that out of the six possible treatment strategies for patients with chronic ITP at a willingness‐to‐pay of $1 95 300/QALY, strategy #5 (splenectomy followed by rituximab and then TRA) represents the cost‐effective strategy. This is notable for two reasons. First, strategy #5 is one of two strategies examined in our study that is at variance with ASH guidelines. Second, while the 2019 ASH guidelines suggest TRAs over rituximab and equivalently suggest TRA therapy or splenectomy, the ICERs for the treatment pathways that incorporate TRAs as the first or second sequential therapy do not represent a cost‐effective strategy as they either substantially exceed the willingness‐to‐pay threshold, or are dominated.

Therapy with TRAs has several advantages, which have led to their use in second‐line therapy and their endorsement in the 2019 ASH guidelines. They are associated with high overall response rates that tend to be sustained as long as the medication is taken, they are well‐tolerated, and a up to a third of patients may be able to stop their TRA and maintain a response off all therapy. Despite these advantages, we found that early use of TRAs in second‐line therapy is cost‐ineffective, largely due to the high cost of the drugs and the need for ongoing therapy in most patients. In contrast, we found that early use of splenectomy in the second‐line was cost‐effective, largely because of high response rates without need for ongoing therapy in most patients. This held true despite our conservative assumptions, which tended to exaggerate risks associated with splenectomy and favor medical over surgical therapy, and across a variety of sensitivity analyses that covered the range of uncertainty present in all estimates, to ensure confidence in our conclusion. Furthermore, we identify that an annual price reduction of more than 80% in TRAs is warranted if any strategy with early TRA utilization is to begin to become cost‐effective.

### State of the art-how I manage immune thrombocytopenia [^116pGhdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rapidly evolving. Over the last 15 years, a number of novel treatments have improved practice, with many steroid-sparing agents and a reduction in the progression to splenectomy. Although this has improved clinical care, many therapeutic challenges remain. There is no diagnostic test, no biomarkers to direct treatment and few comparative studies to help management decisions. Development of up to date guidelines is difficult with little high-grade evidence. First line treatment continues to be steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) although both are often poorly tolerated and not curative. Common second line treatments include rituximab, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag. There are no comparative studies to decide between these agents and treatment is generally individualized, depending on comorbidity. Use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients with chronic disease, although the exact position of splenectomy is subject to debate. Further understanding of the cause of disease in individual patients may help guide treatment. Randomized controlled studies of common treatments and novel treatments for refractory patients are urgently needed.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: current strategies for investigation and management [^116qoLKU]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to manage refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In part, this reflects the need for individualized treatment due to the wide spectrum of patients' requirements and responsiveness to therapies. The objective of this review is to provide a clinically useful guide to current management strategies. This article suggests investigations to identify factors that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia and underlie poor therapeutic responses, and highlights emerging therapies, including the thrombopoietic agents, which are anticipated to dramatically alter the natural history of "refractory" ITP. Morbidity, mortality and heath-related quality of life are also discussed.

Children with ITP who do not respond to first-line treatment — second-line therapy comparisons and peri-splenectomy care: For children with ITP who have non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished HRQoL and do not respond to first-line treatment, the panel suggests the use of TPO-RAs rather than rituximab, suggests TPO-RAs rather than splenectomy, and suggests rituximab rather than splenectomy (all conditional recommendations). A good practice statement adds that the treating physician should ensure appropriate immunizations prior to splenectomy, provide counseling regarding antibiotic prophylaxis following splenectomy, and educate the patient on prompt recognition and management of fever and refer to current recommendations on pre- and postsplenectomy care.

### Fostamatinib is an effective second-line therapy in patients with immune thrombocytopenia [^117MJuwQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations to this post hoc analysis of fostamatinib clinical trial data include the absence of randomization of lines of treatment prior to receiving fostamatinib; and the relatively small number of patients in the second‐line therapy and especially persistent subgroups. The analysis would also have benefitted from study of disease processes, e.g. anti‐platelet autoantibodies, epitope spreading, and/or autoreactive T cells. Discussion of AEs was minimized in this report, other than comparison between second‐line and third‐or‐later‐line patients, since all had been previously reported. 13, 14

In summary, fostamatinib was more effectively, and as safely, used as second‐line therapy for ITP compared to later lines. Additional studies are needed to confirm the current analyses and to explore whether fostamatinib may prevent disease progression.
