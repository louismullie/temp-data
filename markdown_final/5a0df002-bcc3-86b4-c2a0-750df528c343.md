## Question

Heamochezia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hematochezia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hematochezia and distinguishing it from other GI bleeding phenotypes. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, especially hemodynamics and the need to exclude an upper GI source. Next, I will consider risk stratification and how it guides timing and modality of endoscopy. After that, I should review the diagnostic yield and role of colonoscopy versus CT angiography and when to pursue small-bowel evaluation. Finally, I will examine special populations, including patients under 50, pediatrics, and those on antithrombotics, and close with a practical algorithm and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and large cohort data [^2fa40f98] [^4c241821] [^7b636dfc].

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify the problem. Hematochezia is bright red or maroon blood per rectum originating from a colorectal source, distinguishing it from melena (black, tarry stools from proximal bleeding) and from small-bowel bleeding, which is a separate entity with a different diagnostic pathway; importantly, about 10–15% of patients with presumed lower GI bleeding ultimately have an upper GI source, so I need to keep that in mind during triage [^2fa40f98] [^13d47ce0] [^4c241821].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities before jumping to endoscopy. I need to check hemodynamic status immediately and begin resuscitation in parallel, because instability changes both the pretest probability of an upper source and the timing of endoscopy; I should obtain CBC, electrolytes, coagulation studies, and type and crossmatch, and I must not forget a careful rectal exam to look for anorectal sources and to distinguish hematochezia from melena, which would push me toward an upper source evaluation [^3349a924] [^853769e7] [^c676f75a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the bleeding source. Hematochezia with hemodynamic instability may reflect a brisk upper GI bleed, so I should consider nasogastric aspiration or, more definitively, urgent EGD to exclude a proximal source; I initially thought NG lavage reliably rules out UGIB, but wait, I should double-check — evidence shows poor sensitivity and limited utility, so a negative NG aspirate does not exclude UGIB and EGD remains the gold standard when suspicion is high [^4c241821] [^0c7bf343] [^808e4aad].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because it shapes disposition and timing. High-risk features include age over 60, comorbidities, ongoing bleeding, transfusion requirement, hemodynamic instability, and antithrombotic use; low-risk patients are typically younger, stable, with minimal bleeding and no alarm features. I need to ensure I apply these strata to decide between ICU-level care, inpatient observation, or outpatient management with expedited colonoscopy [^853769e7] [^7d50b2b8] [^f136a336].

> I will now examine the role and timing of colonoscopy, since this is central. For most hospitalized patients with hematochezia, colonoscopy is the first-line diagnostic test; urgent colonoscopy within 24 hours after a rapid purge improves diagnostic and therapeutic yield, but I should confirm whether it improves hard outcomes — RCTs and meta-analyses show no consistent reduction in rebleeding or mortality with urgent versus standard timing, so I should individualize timing based on stability and ongoing bleeding rather than reflexively pushing for ultra-urgent scopes in all patients [^2364e12a] [^3f0b1aae] [^0bb09e24].

> Let me consider alternatives when colonoscopy is not feasible or bleeding is too brisk. CT angiography is reasonable as an initial test in ongoing hemodynamically significant hematochezia, with high sensitivity for active extravasation and the ability to guide IR embolization; however, I should confirm that CTA is low yield in minor or resolved bleeding, so I must avoid over-ordering it in stable patients with scant hematochezia [^2364e12a] [^6662039e] [^4de161cd].

> I should double-check the diagnostic yield so I counsel patients accurately. Large cohort data show colonoscopy identifies a bleeding source in about 95% of cases, with diverticular bleeding the most common etiology, followed by ischemic colitis, post-polypectomy bleeding, rectal ulcer, angioectasia, and a small but important fraction of small-bowel or even upper GI sources; this high yield supports colonoscopy as the default test when feasible [^7b636dfc] [^b7b12792] [^2238a938].

> But wait, what if the colon is clean and bleeding persists? I need to ensure I escalate appropriately. After negative upper and lower endoscopy, I should consider small-bowel evaluation with video capsule endoscopy or push enteroscopy, reserving deep enteroscopy for therapeutic needs; I should also remember that a second-look colonoscopy can occasionally reveal a missed colonic source, so I must revisit the colon before labeling the case as obscure [^173185b8] [^1ea8cbd6].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with adults under 50. Young-onset colorectal cancer is rising, and hematochezia is a common presenting symptom; meta-analytic data show a 5- to 54-fold increased likelihood of CRC with hematochezia in this group, so I should maintain a low threshold for complete colonoscopy even in the absence of classic alarm features, and I must also address disparities in timely follow-up that have been documented in VA cohorts [^99905a97] [^4570880e] [^1dddc4c6].

> Let me think about pediatrics, because the differential and urgency differ. In infants, necrotizing enterocolitis is a critical consideration, but many cases of hematochezia are benign, such as milk protein intolerance; in older children, bacterial enteritis is more likely when hematochezia accompanies acute diarrhea, and vascular malformations or Meckel's diverticulum should be considered with recurrent or obscure bleeding; I should tailor imaging and endoscopy to age and acuity, and not overcall NEC in the absence of systemic signs [^0f3deb38] [^3ebd95fb] [^b2b31e67].

> I need to ensure I manage antithrombotics correctly. In acute GI bleeding, I should reverse warfarin with 4-factor PCC rather than FFP when rapid reversal is needed, and I should avoid routine platelet transfusion for antiplatelet agents unless there is severe thrombocytopenia or a planned invasive procedure; after hemostasis, I should resume antiplatelet therapy promptly for secondary cardiovascular prevention, balancing thrombotic risk against rebleeding risk [^cb76fdae] [^3349a924].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with hemodynamic stabilization and exclude an upper source when instability or melena is present; for stable patients, proceed to colonoscopy within 24 hours when feasible; if colonoscopy is negative and bleeding continues, pursue CTA or nuclear medicine bleeding scans and consider IR embolization; if both upper and lower endoscopy are negative, evaluate the small bowel; throughout, tailor level of care, transfusion thresholds, and antithrombotic management to comorbidity and bleeding severity [^2364e12a] [^4c241821] [^7d50b2b8].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this aligns with the evidence: hematochezia is common and usually colorectal, but a meaningful fraction of "severe" cases reflect upper GI bleeding; colonoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnosis and therapy, yet timing should be individualized because urgent colonoscopy improves diagnostic yield but not necessarily mortality; in patients under 50, hematochezia is a red flag for early-onset CRC and warrants complete colonoscopic evaluation; and structured risk stratification with multidisciplinary escalation to CTA, IR, and surgery when needed optimizes outcomes [^2fa40f98] [^99905a97] [^2364e12a] [^7b636dfc].

Hematochezia is **bright red rectal bleeding** from the lower GI tract, most often due to diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or colitis [^812c9b1f] [^e659ef70]. Initial management is **hemodynamic stabilization** and risk stratification, followed by colonoscopy within 24 hours for active bleeding or within 1–2 weeks if stable [^3f0b1aae] [^2364e12a]. Urgent colonoscopy enables diagnosis and endoscopic therapy; if unstable or colonoscopy is inconclusive, CT angiography or tagged RBC scan guides IR embolization or surgery [^2364e12a] [^4de161cd]. In patients under 50, hematochezia is a red flag for colorectal cancer and warrants colonoscopy [^99905a97] [^38687470]. Most cases resolve with supportive care, but recurrence is common, so address modifiable risks and arrange follow-up [^812c9b1f] [^120a258b].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Hematochezia arises from **lower GI sources**, including:

- **Diverticulosis**: Most common cause of acute LGIB; arterial bleeding from diverticula [^812c9b1f] [^5141b78a].
- **Hemorrhoids and anorectal fissures**: Common, typically scant, bright red blood [^e659ef70] [^4f035dac].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease cause mucosal inflammation and bleeding [^a2f094da].
- **Ischemic colitis**: Often in older adults with vascular risk factors; presents with abdominal pain and hematochezia [^ce1cd0c2].
- **Neoplasia**: Polyps and colorectal cancer can bleed intermittently [^812c9b1f].
- **Infectious colitis**: Bacterial pathogens (e.g. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli) can cause bloody diarrhea [^notfound].
- **Angiodysplasia**: Vascular malformations causing intermittent bleeding [^812c9b1f].

---

## Clinical presentation and evaluation

Hematochezia presents as **bright red blood per rectum**, with or without clots, and may be accompanied by abdominal pain, diarrhea, or urgency. Initial evaluation should include:

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Vital signs, orthostatics, and mental status to gauge severity [^c676f75a].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and type and crossmatch [^c676f75a].
- **History and physical examination**: Onset, duration, volume, associated symptoms, medication use (NSAIDs, anticoagulants), and comorbidities; digital rectal exam to identify anorectal sources [^853769e7].

---

## Diagnostic approach

The diagnostic approach depends on **severity and stability**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|
| Severe, ongoing hematochezia | - Colonoscopy within 24 hours after rapid bowel prep [^3f0b1aae] [^a54f6069] <br/> - If unstable or colonoscopy inconclusive, CT angiography or tagged RBC scan, then IR embolization or surgery [^2364e12a] [^4de161cd] |
| Stable, minor hematochezia | - Colonoscopy within 1–2 weeks [^notfound] <br/> - Flexible sigmoidoscopy may suffice in younger patients without alarm features [^34f1f493] |
| Hematochezia with hemodynamic instability | - Exclude upper GI source with EGD if suspicion is high [^4c241821] [^808e4aad] |

---

Colonoscopy is the **gold standard** for diagnosis and therapy, with high diagnostic yield and the ability to perform hemostasis [^7b636dfc] [^812c9b1f].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **tailored to severity and etiology**:

- **Supportive care**: IV fluids, transfusion as indicated, correction of coagulopathy [^3349a924].
- **Endoscopic therapy**: Epinephrine injection, bipolar coagulation, clips, or band ligation for active bleeding or high-risk stigmata [^7d50b2b8].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Octreotide for variceal bleeding, antibiotics for infectious colitis, immunomodulators for IBD [^notfound].
- **Interventional radiology**: Embolization for refractory bleeding or when colonoscopy is not feasible [^2364e12a].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for refractory cases or when endoscopic and IR therapies fail [^812c9b1f].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most cases resolving spontaneously or with endoscopic therapy. Recurrence is common, especially with diverticulosis or angiodysplasia, necessitating ongoing risk modification and surveillance [^120a258b] [^812c9b1f].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Hematochezia in children often reflects infectious colitis, anal fissures, or IBD; evaluation should be age-appropriate [^3ebd95fb] [^0f3deb38].
- **Anticoagulated patients**: Management includes reversal of anticoagulation as indicated, with endoscopic therapy remaining effective [^3349a924] [^cb76fdae].
- **Young adults**: Hematochezia is a red flag for early-onset colorectal cancer, warranting colonoscopy even in patients under 50 [^99905a97] [^38687470].

---

Hematochezia is a common presentation of lower GI bleeding with a broad differential. A structured approach — stabilize, localize, and treat — yields the best outcomes, with colonoscopy central to diagnosis and therapy [^812c9b1f].

### A rational approach to the patient with hematochezia [^a5bf53cd]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hematochezia is a common clinical presentation, with significant morbidity and economic burden. These patients often require costly interventions including hospitalization, blood transfusions, and radiologic or endoscopic procedures. The purpose of this review is to give a rational, concise approach to the patient with hematochezia, with special consideration of recent advances in the literature.

Recent Findings

Recent studies pertaining to hematochezia have evaluated risk stratification, endoscopic intervention, evaluation of small bowel bleeding, and management of anticoagulation.

Summary

A step-wise approach to hematochezia helps determine the cause and provide the appropriate management of these patients. We propose five steps beginning with hemodynamic assessment and risk stratification, then focused history and physical examination, endoscopic intervention when warranted, and consideration of small bowel bleeding in selected instances.

### Evaluation of hematochezia in a two-day-old infant [^0f3deb38]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hematochezia in the pediatric population, particularly infants, has a wide differential diagnosis ranging from benign to life-threatening causes. Obtaining a thorough history and identifying risk factors for more ominous disease is vital during the emergency department (ED) evaluation.

Case Report

The patient is a 2-day-old female who presented to the ED with 8-10 episodes of bright red blood in her stools. She was otherwise asymptomatic, with an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her history was significant for a sibling who recently tested positive for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in his stool and a family history of lactose intolerance. She was exclusively formula fed. An abdominal plain film was obtained and was normal. Milk protein enterocolitis was suspected and she was transitioned to hydrolyzed formula with resolution of her symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: As emergency physicians, we need to be aware of the life-threatening conditions that are associated with hematochezia, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, and act quickly. However, many patients will have benign conditions, and recognizing the key historical and diagnostic pieces of the infant's presentation will prevent unnecessary evaluations and consultations.

### Young-onset colorectal cancer risk among individuals with iron-deficiency anaemia and haematochezia [^2fc31980]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA.Proportion of CRC diagnosed in adults aged <50 years—hereafter called young-onset CRC (YCRC)—has increased over time, with cases often diagnosed at later stages requiring more intense treatment.Some have advocated for more aggressive work-up of individuals aged <50 years presenting with purported ‘red flag’ signs or symptoms for CRC, iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) and haematochezia, under the postulate this may enhance timely diagnosis and treatment.However, US and European clinical practice guidelines conflict regarding whether IDA or haematochezia in adults aged <50 years should trigger diagnostic colonoscopy work-up. For IDA, some guidelines recommend colonoscopy for all individuals, regardless of age or sex, while others recommend colonoscopy for those with IDA aged <50 years based on sex, and presence/absence of key clinical characteristics such as lower abdominal symptoms (table 1).Similar variation exists across guidelines for work-up of haematochezia, with some recommending colonoscopy as first work-up only for those aged ≥40 years, and others stratifying recommendations based on age, CRC risk factors and bleeding characteristics, such as presence of bright red blood per rectum (table 1).

Table 1 
Guidelines for colonoscopy work-up with presentation of iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) or haematochezia

Inconsistency across guidelines reflects insufficient data on YCRC risk among individuals aged <50 years with IDA or haematochezia. Clarifying risk may inform future guidelines, optimise selection of individuals for diagnostic colonoscopy, and ultimately facilitate earlier stage detection and timely YCRC treatment. To address knowledge gaps regarding YCRC risk related to IDA and haematochezia, we conducted a study examining the association between these potential ‘red flag’ diagnoses and YCRC risk in a large cohort of US Veterans (aged <50 years).

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^f716b586]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with hematochezia are at risk of various adverse outcomes, which may be significantly affected by different bleeding etiologies identified on colonoscopy. Moreover, if the precise etiology is not known and suspected incorrectly, errors in treatment and triage may occur. For example, without endoscopy, severe UGIB can be missed and antiacid therapy will not be administered, which could result in repeated rebleeding. Without colonoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease or infectious colitis may be mistakenly suspected, leading to incorrect treatment. Such situations may have potentially serious consequences.

Although guidelines recommend colonoscopy as the first-line procedure for patients presenting with hematochezia, its value remains unclear because of the small number of endoscopy-based large cohort studies conducted to date. Therefore, we have collected data on more than 10,000 cases of acute hematochezia and comprehensively examined the bleeding etiologies identified by endoscopy. The aim of this study was to identify patients at risk for adverse outcomes based on bleeding etiology and to determine whether presenting symptoms and hemodynamic instability can predict the various bleeding etiologies.

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^99905a97]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, nearly half of individuals diagnosed with EOCRC presented with hematochezia and abdominal pain, which were associated with 5- to 54-fold and 1.3- to 6-fold increased likelihood of CRC, respectively. An interval of 4 to 6 months from symptom onset to EOCRC diagnosis was common. These findings underscore the need for clinicians to consider EOCRC as part of the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with potential red flag signs and symptoms, and to follow up through either confirmation of diagnosis and sign or symptom resolution when a benign cause is suspected, or colonoscopy referral to rule out CRC based on sign or symptom severity or absence of diagnosis or sign or symptom resolution after initial workup and management for a suspected benign cause.

Our finding that 45% of individuals with EOCRC presented with hematochezia aligns with current clinical paradigms—hematochezia (or rectal bleeding) is often cited as a common presenting symptom among patients with CRC.In addition, the 5 studies,,,, that measured the association between hematochezia and EOCRC risk found estimates between 5.1 and 54.0, underscoring the urgent need for these patients to undergo comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. A full colonoscopy should be pursued when individuals younger than 50 years present with hematochezia, according to guidelines from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. A high index of suspicion for CRC in younger patients with hematochezia may be particularly useful to identify patients with high risk, given the high frequency and association with CRC.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^4c241821]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Exclusion of proximal source of bleeding in hematochezia—Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source, and an upper endoscopic evaluation should be performed if the suspicion is high to exclude a proximal source of bleeding.

### Appropriateness of colonoscopy in Europe (EPAGE II). Iron-deficiency anemia and hematochezia [^278f44f7]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

To summarize the published literature on assessment of appropriateness of colonoscopy for the investigation of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and hematochezia, and report appropriateness criteria developed by an expert panel, the 2008 European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, EPAGE II.

Methods

A systematic search of guidelines, systematic reviews and primary studies regarding the evaluation and management of IDA and hematochezia was performed. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was applied to develop appropriateness criteria for colonoscopy for these conditions.

Results

IDA occurs in 2 %-5 % of adult men and postmenopausal women. Examination of both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract is recommended in patients with iron deficiency. Colonoscopy for IDA yields one colorectal cancer (CRC) in every 9-13 colonoscopies. Hematochezia is a well-recognized alarm symptom and such patients are likely to be referred for colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is unanimously recommended in patients aged > or = 50. Diverticulosis, vascular ectasias, and ischemic colitis are common causes of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB); CRC is found in 0.2 %-11 % of the colonoscopies performed for LGIB. Most patients with scant hematochezia have an anorectal or a distal source of bleeding. The expert panel considered most clinical indications for colonoscopy as appropriate in the presence of IDA (58 %) or hematochezia (83 %).

Conclusion

Despite the limitations of the published studies, guidelines unanimously recommend colonoscopy for the investigation of IDA and hematochezia in patients aged > or = 50 years. These indications were also considered appropriate by EPAGE II, as were indications in patients at low risk for CRC with no obvious cause of bleeding found during adequate previous investigations.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^2b1ec48b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have accumulated an unprecedentedly large data set for 10,342 patients emergently admitted for outpatient-onset of acute hematochezia, which contains information on baseline characteristics (Table 1), etiologies (Table 2), interventions (Table 3), and clinical outcomes (Table 4). With endoscopy, we could reach a high diagnostic yield of 94.9%, enabling one-third of all cases to be treated endoscopically (Table 3), which is a much higher rate than that reported in previous studies. Notably, confirmation of the bleeding etiology allowed patients at risk for adverse outcomes to be identified (Table 5). Some of the bleeding etiologies had the same presenting symptoms and hemodynamic instability (Table 6), indicating that prediction of etiology based on initial presentation would be challenging. These findings highlight the importance of performing endoscopy in patients with acute hematochezia.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^807d5fef]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (ALGIB) manifests as relatively mild hematochezia but can progress to massive hemorrhage with shock (–). Approximately 30%–50% of adults with ALGIB will progress to severe bleeding (–), and bleeding episodes can frequently recur, requiring reexaminations, rehospitalizations, and repeated transfusions (–). ALGIB episodes have also been shown to increase the risk of subsequent thromboembolism and death, regardless of antithrombotic use. ALGIB, therefore, presents a significant economic burden. Unlike upper GIB (UGIB), which can be treated with antiacid therapy, there are no effective therapies for preventing ALGIB or its recurrence. As such, there is likely to be considerable variation in the management of ALGIB.

In contrast to UGIB, there have been few large studies with more than 1,000 cases with ALGIB, especially using real-world clinical data. Although 1 large UK study demonstrated clinical courses of ALGIB in detail, it could not accurately identify the bleeding etiology because of infrequently performed endoscopy. The source of bleeding in patients with hematochezia varies and mainly includes not only colorectal diseases (e.g. diverticular bleeding, ischemic colitis, and hemorrhoids) but also small bowel bleeding and UGIB. Many physicians empirically suspect etiology based on the presenting symptoms. For example, hematochezia without pain or fever could be highly suspicious of diverticular bleeding, but subsequent colonoscopy may reveal a precise diagnosis of small bowel bleeding, rectal ulcer, or colorectal angioectasia, not diverticular bleeding. The same may be true in cases of hematochezia with abdominal pain. Therefore, the accurate bleeding source of hematochezia will not be known unless colonoscopy is performed.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^77ff30e6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Severe hematochezia—Diagnostic sequence, timing, and outcomes are specified: An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the test of choice for patients presenting with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability, followed by a colonoscopy after an upper gastrointestinal (GI) source is ruled out. In hemodynamically stable patients with severe hematochezia, colonoscopy should be performed first, followed by an EGD if the colonoscopy result is negative, and the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy ranges from 45% to 100% in LGIB. An urgent colonoscopy is recommended and should be performed within 8 to 24 hours of admission; early colonoscopy increases both diagnostic yield and the likelihood of therapeutic intervention, with endoscopic therapy performed in 10% to 40% of patients and immediate hemostasis achieved in 50% to 100%, and success reported as 29% within 12 hours, 13% between 12 and 24 hours, 4% between 24 and 48 hours, and 0% after 48 hours; early colonoscopy reduced the duration of hospitalization and cost, although 2 studies showed no improvement in outcomes of rebleeding or surgery after urgent colonoscopy.

### Time to endoscopy or colonoscopy among adults younger than 50 years with iron-deficiency anemia and / or hematochezia in the VHA [^901de67d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.The proportion of CRC diagnosed among adults younger than 50 years of age—hereafter called early age–onset CRC (EAOCRC)—has increased over time, with cases among this group often diagnosed at later stages, requiring more intense treatment.,,,,,, About 70% to 95% of patients with EAOCRC present with concerning or “red-flag” signs or symptoms that could be indicative of CRC. Risk of EAOCRC is elevated up to 10-fold among individuals with a diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) or hematochezia. Given the frequency of symptomatic EAOCRC presentation, more aggressive workup of adults younger than 50 years of age with these conditions may enhance timely diagnosis and treatment and ultimately improve EAOCRC outcomes.

Published guidelines recommend that all men and postmenopausal women with IDA undergo bidirectional endoscopy—both esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. The American Gastroenterological Association updated their guidelines in 2020 to additionally recommend that otherwise asymptomatic premenopausal women (eg, those without another explanation, such as menorrhagia) also receive bidirectional endoscopy.Adults younger than 50 years of age with hematochezia without lower abdominal symptoms and no known source of bleeding are also recommended to undergo colonoscopy. However, the extent to which these guidelines are followed, and the variation in following guidelines across populations, has not been widely studied, to our knowledge. Accordingly, our goal was to examine the receipt of guideline-concordant workup for IDA and hematochezia and the factors associated with any diagnostic workup for adults younger than 50 years with IDA and/or hematochezia.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a review [^1fd0d7f5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) continues to be a problem for physicians. Acute LGIB is defined as bleeding that emanates from a source distal to the ligament of Treitz. Although 80% of all LGIB will stop spontaneously, the identification of the bleeding source remains challenging and rebleeding can occur in 25% of cases. Some patients with severe hematochezia require urgent attention to minimize further bleeding and complications. This article reviews the causes, diagnostic methods, and endoscopic treatment of LGIB.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^13d47ce0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions—acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^3f0ee191]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have provided clinical findings useful for ALGIB management obtained from a large-scale analysis of 10,342 patients with acute hematochezia. Our high colonoscopy rate identified bleeding etiologies accurately and allowed us to stratify patients at high or low risk of adverse outcomes and those who will likely require more procedures. Our results highlighted the value of colonoscopy in diagnosis and subsequent management in patients with acute hematochezia.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^e40377b8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to consider performing a DRE and flexible sigmoidoscopy as sufficient evaluation in younger patients with chronic intermittent scant hematochezia without alarm symptoms.

### Management of patients with severe hematochezia – with all current evidence available [^becbeb47]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of routine urgent colonoscopy in severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding is reported in this journal from Duke. The only significant differences in results between the standard management (emergency red blood cell (RBC) scanning and angiography with elective colonoscopy) and urgent colonoscopy were in rates of finding a definitive bleeding site-one with a major stigmata of hemorrhage-and in not making a diagnosis. The trial was stopped early for logistics reasons a decade ago. The strengths and limitations of the study are discussed and contrasted with recent reports of other investigators. Similar to management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) hemorrhage, triaging patients to level of care by comorbidity scores and stigmata of hemorrhage, successful colonoscopic hemostasis of focal lesions, and individualization of long-term medical, endoscopic, and surgical care are recommended based on promising reports by other investigators. Meanwhile, further RCTs for patients with severe hematochezia are warranted.

### Does scant hematochezia necessitate the performance of total colonoscopy? [^3c7ac5b6]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Controversy exists as to whether all patients with lower intestinal bleeding need to undergo total colonoscopy. This study compares the prevalence of colonic neoplasms in patients reporting scant hematochezia with the prevalence in controls.

Patients and Methods

Structured interviews were carried out with 4265 consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy. Of these, 468 patients had scant hematochezia, 299 had occult rectal bleeding and 57 reported dark rectal bleeding. Patients with scant hematochezia were matched for age and sex with those having no risk factors for colorectal neoplasms. For all groups, we determined the prevalence of adenomas and cancers below and above 50 cm.

Results

Colonic neoplasms were found in 18 % of patients with scant hematochezia and in 7.5 % of controls. However, most of these tumors were located within the reach of a sigmoidoscope. Compared with controls, patients with scant hematochezia had no increased risk for proximal neoplasms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2), while this risk was significantly increased in patients with occult rectal bleeding (OR = 3.1) and patients who had observed maroon-colored blood in their stool (OR = 4.8).

Conclusions

Flexible sigmoidoscopy appears to be a sufficient work-up for young patients who have observed trace amounts of bright red blood on the surface of their stool.

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^eae77dea]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the lack of standardised clinical care pathways, it is generally accepted that the treatment of rectal varices focuses on the amelioriation of the underlying pathology- that is the portal hypertension. In cases where the bleeding is especially profuse, the majority consensus seems to be on rapid interventional decompression of the mesenteric circulation either by radiological or surgical means[-]. However, in patients whose only symptom is rectal bleeding and whose general medical condition has yet to be physiologically and/or pharmacologically optimized, we suggest that endoscopic intervention may have a role similar to its use in managing patients with bleeding oesophageal varices.

Gastrointestinal bleeding can result in significant morbidity. Scintigraphy plays an important role in detecting, localizing, and grading the bleed. Effective scintigraphic evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding can be complicated by its intermittent nature and the patient's hemodynamic instability. Dynamic evaluation, delayed imaging, and an understanding of the labeling process are necessary tools to help improve detection rate and localization.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^7b636dfc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The bleeding source of hematochezia is unknown without performing colonoscopy. We sought to identify whether colonoscopy is a risk-stratifying tool to identify etiology and predict outcomes and whether presenting symptoms can differentiate the etiologies in patients with hematochezia.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted at 49 hospitals across Japan analyzed 10,342 patients admitted for outpatient-onset acute hematochezia.

Results

Patients were mostly elderly population, and 29.5% had hemodynamic instability. Computed tomography was performed in 69.1% and colonoscopy in 87.7%. Diagnostic yield of colonoscopy reached 94.9%, most frequently diverticular bleeding. Thirty-day rebleeding rates were significantly higher with diverticulosis and small bowel bleeding than with other etiologies. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher with angioectasia, malignancy, rectal ulcer, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopic treatment rates were significantly higher with diverticulosis, radiation colitis, angioectasia, rectal ulcer, and postendoscopy bleeding. More interventional radiology procedures were needed for diverticulosis and small bowel bleeding. Etiologies with favorable outcomes and low procedure rates were ischemic colitis and infectious colitis. Higher rates of painless hematochezia at presentation were significantly associated with multiple diseases, such as rectal ulcer, hemorrhoids, angioectasia, radiation colitis, and diverticulosis. The same was true in cases of hematochezia with diarrhea, fever, and hemodynamic instability.

Discussion

This nationwide data set of acute hematochezia highlights the importance of colonoscopy in accurately detecting bleeding etiologies that stratify patients at high or low risk of adverse outcomes and those who will likely require more procedures. Predicting different bleeding etiologies based on initial presentation would be challenging.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^82a1cea8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as blood loss that originates from a source distal to the ligament of Treitz and results in hemodynamic instability or symptomatic anemia. Although approximately 10% to 15% of patients presenting with acute severe hematochezia have an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding identified on upper endoscopy, the most common causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding are diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, and angiodysplasia. As with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, lower gastrointestinal bleeding ceases spontaneously in most cases.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^af9f1c48]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We selected patients who presented with hematochezia within 24 hours and were urgently hospitalized for bleeding treatment management between January 2010 and December 2019 and included patients aged ≥20 years at the onset of hematochezia regardless of the presence of tarry stools, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or fever. Symptom-based subjects in our study included patients with hematochezia with small bowel bleeding and UGIB and ALGIB defined as colorectal bleeding. The research office reviewed the data of each patient in detail, including the date of onset of symptoms, date of hospitalization, and date of examination, and confirmed the data several times with the representatives of each facility. As a result, the following patients were excluded because they were not considered to be acute, not for bleeding control purposes, or not of outpatient origin: patients with bleeding that had stopped for more than 24 hours, patients admitted for anemia investigation, and patients with in-hospital onset of hematochezia. Data for a total of 11,035 patients were collected and rigorously reevaluated by the secretariat's institution (Tokyo Medical University). After 693 patients were excluded, this left with 10,342 patients emergently admitted with outpatient-onset of acute, continuous, or frequent hematochezia for evaluation.

### Diagnosis and management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^812c9b1f]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) can present as an acute and life-threatening event or as chronic bleeding, which might manifest as iron-deficiency anemia, fecal occult blood or intermittent scant hematochezia. Bleeding from the small bowel has been shown to be a distinct entity, and LGIB is defined as bleeding from a colonic source. Acute bleeding from the colon is usually less dramatic than upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and is self-limiting in most cases. Several factors might contribute to increased mortality, a severe course of bleeding and recurrent bleeding, including advanced age, comorbidity, intestinal ischemia, bleeding as a result of a separate process, and hemodynamic instability. Diverticula, angiodysplasias, neoplasms, colitis, ischemia, anorectal disorders and postpolypectomy bleeding are the most common causes of LGIB. Volume resuscitation should take place concurrently upon initial patient assessment. Colonoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice, for acute and chronic bleeding. Angiography is used if colonoscopy fails or cannot be performed. The use of radioisotope scans is reserved for cases of unexplained intermittent bleeding, when other methods have failed to detect the source. Embolization or modern endoscopy techniques, such as injection therapy, thermocoagulation and mechanical devices, effectively promote hemostasis. Surgery is the final approach for severe bleeding.

### Time to endoscopy or colonoscopy among adults younger than 50 years with iron-deficiency anemia and / or hematochezia in the VHA [^17fc377a]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there variation in the diagnostic test completion rate and in the time to diagnostic workup among veterans younger than 50 years with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and/or hematochezia?

Findings

In this cohort study of veterans with IDA and/or hematochezia, diagnostic testing rates were low. Diagnostic testing was less likely among female, Black, and Hispanic veterans with IDA and Hispanic veterans with hematochezia.

Meaning

This study suggests that optimizing timely follow-up may help improve early age–onset colorectal cancer–related outcomes and reduce sex-based and race and ethnicity–based disparities.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^3f0b1aae]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) initial evaluation and colonoscopy timing are summarized as follows: Patients presenting with overt severe hematochezia should undergo a focused evaluation simultaneous with hemodynamic resuscitation, and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source needs to be excluded in patients with hematochezia and hemodynamic instability. Colonoscopy following a colon purge is the initial test of choice in most patients presenting with acute hematochezia, and in patients with high-risk features and ongoing bleeding colonoscopy should be performed within 24 h of presentation following a colon purge. Urgent colonoscopy (<12 h from presentation) may improve diagnostic and therapeutic yield but has not been shown to reduce rates of rebleeding or surgery, and radiographic interventions should be reserved for the small group of patients with brisk bleeding who cannot be adequately stabilized for colonoscopy.

Association of bleeding etiologies with symptoms and hemodynamic instability

Differences in the proportions of elderly patients and male patients were noted between the etiologies (Table 6). At presentation, higher rates of painless hematochezia were significantly associated with multiple diseases, such as diverticular bleeding, rectal ulcer, hemorrhoids, angioectasia, and radiation colitis. The same was true in cases of hematochezia with diarrhea and fever. Diverticular bleeding and UGIB were associated with a significantly higher rate of hemodynamic instability compared with other etiologies, whereas ischemic colitis was associated with a lower rate.

### Successful treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura-associated hematochezia in a child with hemophilia A: a case report [^6d8aa447]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common form of immunological vasculitis in children. Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder and characterized by spontaneous hemorrhage or prolonged bleeding due to factor VIII deficiency. Both diseases increase the risk of bleeding, but they have different mechanisms. How should we treat patients with both diseases?

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old male with hemophilia A was diagnosed with HSP while receiving coagulation factor VIII replacement therapy in our hospital. Hematochezia occurred 6 days after the diagnosis of HSP. And he treated with coagulation FVIII, methylprednisolone and hemostatic drugs.

Conclusions

There is no causal relationship between hemophilia A and HSP, but both diseases can cause bleeding. This child's hematochezia was caused by HSP, but hemophilia could not be ignored during the treatment. Our case report adds to the present body of knowledge about the treatment of HSP associated hematochezia in a child with hemophilia A.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^343ebc73]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, diverticular bleeding may be suspected in a patient with acute hematochezia who presents without abdominal pain and diarrhea, but our colonoscopy data revealed that lower rates of painless hematochezia at presentation were significantly associated with multiple diseases, such as rectal ulcer, hemorrhoids, angioectasia, radiation colitis, and diverticulosis (Table 6). The same was true in cases of hematochezia with diarrhea, fever, and hemodynamic instability, suggesting that predicting different bleeding etiologies based on initial presentation would be challenging. Although there was no high-quality evidence to show that hemodynamic instability is indicative of an UGIB source and warrants an upper endoscopy, our data strongly support this.

This study has some limitations. First, there are 2 large ALGIB databases with >1,000 cases: 1,198 cases in Italy and 2,528 cases in the United Kingdom ; the median age was 78, 73, and 74 years in Italy, the United Kingdom, and Japan, in that order, although comorbidity scores (CCI) of zero are 29.3%, 43.6%, and 39.9%, CCI ≥2 was 47.4%, 33.4%, and 36.6%, respectively, which was similar among the 3 countries. However, generalizability might be limited by low BMI, with a median of 22.5 in Japan. Although no information is available in the Italy and UK databases, a study in the United States, reported that approximately 20% of participants had a BMI ≥30, compared with only 9.6% (988/10,342) in our study. Second, it had a retrospective design, which resulted in some missing values for baseline characteristics, which is potentially a source of bias. However, there were no missing values for diagnosis, procedures, or outcomes in our Japanese data set, and items with missing values and their rates were lower than in the prospective study done in the United Kingdom. Third, the degree of cleanliness of bowel preparation may affect SRH identification, diagnostic yield, and outcomes, but we could not collect these data.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^2238a938]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common etiology was diverticular bleeding, at 64%, which is consistent with previous reports on ALGIB, although the rates are different: 30% (75/252) in the United States, 26% (668/2,528) in the United Kingdom, and 39% (163/415) in Spain. The next most common diagnoses after diverticulosis in our Japanese population were ischemic colitis, postendoscopy bleeding, and rectal ulcer, which are similar to hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, and postendoscopic bleeding reported in the United States but not to hemorrhoids, undetermined colitis, and malignancy reported in the United Kingdom. The differences in order and proportions of the etiologies between countries probably reflect differences in colonoscopy rates and in hospital departments where patients are managed (e.g. surgery departments in the United Kingdom vs gastroenterology departments in Japan).

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^4570880e]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Early-age onset colorectal cancer (EAO-CRC) versus later-age onset colorectal cancer (LAO-CRC)—presenting symptoms, diagnostic intervals, and stage at diagnosis are characterized by symptom-driven detection and more advanced presentation. In a series including more than 1,000 EAO-CRC patients, rectal bleeding was most common (50.8%), followed by abdominal pain (32.5%) and change in bowel habits (18.0%). Compared with LAO-CRC, EAO-CRC more often presented with hematochezia (28.8% vs 23.2%, P < .01) and abdominal pain (41.2% vs 27.2%, P < .01), experienced a longer duration of symptoms (243 vs 154 days) and a longer delay to diagnosis (152 vs 87 days), and was diagnosed at a more advanced stage. Younger patients had higher risks of regional and distant metastasis at presentation, with relative risks of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.33-1.41) and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.53-1.63), respectively, and advanced stage at diagnosis is not likely explained by longer dwell time or time to diagnosis.

### Hematochezia in children with acute diarrhea seeking emergency department care-a prospective cohort study [^3ebd95fb]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although the passage of blood in stools in children represents a medical emergency, children seeking emergency department (ED) care remain poorly characterized. Our primary objective was to compare clinical characteristics and etiologic pathogens in children with acute diarrhea with and without caregiver-reported hematochezia. Secondary objectives were to characterize interventions and resource utilization.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of the Alberta Provincial Pediatric EnTeric Infection TEam (APPETITE) database. Children <18 years presenting to two pediatric EDs within a 24-hour period and <7 days of symptoms were consecutively recruited.

Results

Of 1,061 participants, 115 (10.8%) reported hematochezia at the enrollment visit at which time those with hematochezia, compared to those without, had more diarrheal episodes/24-hour period (9 vs. 6; difference: 2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0, 4.0; p < 0.001), and were less likely to have experienced vomiting (54.8% vs. 80.2%; difference: -25.4; 95% CI: -34.9, -16.0; p < 0.001). They were more likely to receive intravenous fluids (33.0% vs. 17.9%; difference: 15.2; 95% CI: 6.2, 24.1; p < 0.001) and require repeat health care visits (45.5% vs. 34.7%; difference: 10.7; 95% CI: 0.9, 20.6; p = 0.03). A bacterial pathogen was identified in 33.0% of children with hematochezia versus 7.9% without (difference: 25.1; 95% CI: 16.3, 33.9; p < 0.001); viruses were detected in 31.3% of children with hematochezia compared to 72.3% in those without (difference: -41.0%, 95% CI: -49.9, -32.1; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

In children with acute diarrhea, caregiver report of hematochezia, compared to the absence of hematochezia, was associated with more diarrheal but fewer vomiting episodes, and greater resource consumption. The former group of children was also more likely to have bacteria detected in their stool.

### Mucormycosis causing massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report [^22903edf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by Mucorales, primarily affecting the immunocompromised hosts. A rare clinical presentation of mucormycosis of the GI tract is hematochezia. Early diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis infection is critical but can be challenging, especially in the setting of massive hematochezia where adequate bowel preparation for diagnostic colonoscopy cannot be achieved. Therefore, colonic opportunistic infections such as mucormycosis should be a differential diagnosis for massive GI bleeding in immunocompromised patients. In cases with high clinical suspicion, prompt empiric treatment of possible fungal infection is critical.

### Young-onset colorectal cancer risk among individuals with iron-deficiency anaemia and haematochezia [^38687470]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

YCRC risk among individuals exposed versus unexposed to IDA has not been widely studied. Hung et al found a positive association between IDA diagnosis and CRC, aligning with our findings.Perhaps because of the paucity of prior evidence on YCRC risk associated with IDA versus without IDA, practice guidelines regarding work-up including colonoscopy vary widely (table 1). While our study findings strengthen evidence to support guidelines recommending colonoscopy for men aged <50 years with IDA, they also raise questions concerning recommendations by some to restrict colonoscopy to postmenopausal women aged <50 years rather than all younger women. Women in our IDA analytic cohort had markedly lower YCRC risk compared with men but still had increased risk among those with IDA, even after excluding those with prior menorrhagia or hysterectomy. As such, YCRC risk findings among women aged <50 years with IDA diagnosis suggest harms and benefits of colonoscopy uptake should be carefully considered and studied further. The findings also clarify YCRC risk by age of IDA diagnosis, as the risk difference increases sharply with age, justifying discussion about age-specific colonoscopy referral to rule out YCRC.

YCRC risk among individuals with haematochezia versus without haematochezia has also not been widely studied. Prior studies retrospectively assessed symptoms in patients with YCRC at time of diagnosis, finding between 37% and 59% of symptomatic individuals had rectal bleeding at diagnosis; these symptoms sometimes led to delays in diagnosis because they were attributed to haemorrhoids.Our findings suggest clinicians should recommend patients aged <50 years with haematochezia for complete diagnostic colonoscopy work-up, particularly those between ages 40 and 49 years, or if symptoms persist. If these results are replicated by other population-based studies, practice guidelines may need to be updated to recommend colonoscopy as the primary test to evaluate haematochezia.

Our findings highlight some of the decision-making challenges clinicians face in determining the threshold for colonoscopy follow-up for individuals with IDA or haematochezia but provide a range of data for decision-making. While there may not yet be consensus on whether to base decision-making on relative risk increases, absolute risk increases or cumulative 5-year YCRC incidence, our data provide all of these parameters. As such, clinicians and guideline makers may use these data based on the parameters they feel are most important for clinical decisions, including for shared decision-making with patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^7d50b2b8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for the management of patients with acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed. Risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation. Endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities. Repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia. Patients with established high-risk cardiovascular disease should not stop aspirin therapy (secondary prophylaxis) in the setting of lower GI bleeding. [corrected]. The exact timing depends on the severity of bleeding, perceived adequacy of hemostasis, and the risk of a thromboembolic event. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

### Clinical features, treatments and prognosis of appendiceal bleeding: a case series study [^2fa7c3c7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendiceal bleeding is a rare cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, could be overlooked and diagnosed as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Due to limited real-world cases, the optimized management of appendiceal bleeding is unclear. We here shared our experiences in the past 20 years.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. We reviewed data of 28,175 colonoscopies from 43,095 gastrointestinal bleeding patients between June 2003 and June 2023. Six patients diagnosed as appendiceal bleeding were included. Data including symptoms, laboratory tests, imaging results, endoscopic findings, treatment and prognosis were collected and analyzed.

Results

Appendiceal bleeding accounts for 0.014% in gastrointestinal bleeding patients. Of the six patients, five were male, with a mean age of 48.5 years. Hematochezia was the most common symptom. The etiology included appendiceal angiodysplasia, appendicitis and appendectomy associated bleeding. Hemostasis was achieved by appendectomy, endoscopic therapy or medication according to different cases. One patient did not receive any treatment because of self-limiting bleeding.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of appendiceal bleeding is challenging, repeated flushing during endoscopy is helpful. Appendectomy is the priority option for treatment as well as the etiology clarification, therapeutic endoscopy and medication could be considered case by case.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^c676f75a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB)—initial assessment and risk stratification: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of presentation to assess bleeding severity, location, and etiology; hematochezia with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) source and an upper endoscopy should be performed; a nasogastric aspirate/lavage may be used to assess a possible upper GI source if suspicion of UGIB is moderate; and risk assessment and stratification should be performed to distinguish high- vs low-risk patients and assist triage including timing of colonoscopy and level of care. Initial testing should include a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, coagulation studies, and a type and cross match, and the physical examination should include the measurement of vital signs, including orthostasis.

Diverticular hemorrhage—diverticular bleeding is arterial, typically presents as painless hematochezia, and usually occurs from either the neck or the dome of the diverticulum. Patients with diverticular bleeding are candidates for endoscopic treatment if active bleeding (spurting or oozing), a non-bleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot (that cannot be removed with vigorous washing and suctioning) is found at the time of colonoscopy, and these stigmata of hemorrhage predict a high risk of rebleeding without treatment.

### Minor hematochezia decreases use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^df68bfe0]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pharmacologic prophylaxis rates remain low. We sought to understand the reasons for this by assessing factors associated with VTE prophylaxis in patients with IBD and the safety of its use.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted among patients hospitalized between January 2013 and August 2018. The primary outcome was VTE prophylaxis, and exposures of interest included acute and chronic bleeding. Medical records were parsed electronically for covariables, and logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with VTE prophylaxis.

Results

There were 22,499 patients studied, including 474 (2%) with IBD. Patients with IBD were less likely to be placed on VTE prophylaxis (79% with IBD, 87% without IBD), particularly if hematochezia was present (57% with hematochezia, 86% without hematochezia). Among patients with IBD, admission to a medical service and hematochezia (adjusted odds ratio 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16-0.46) were among the strongest independent predictors of decreased VTE prophylaxis use. Neither hematochezia nor VTE prophylaxis was associated with increased blood transfusion rates or with a clinically significant decline in hemoglobin level during hospitalization.

Conclusion

Hospitalized patients are less likely to be placed on VTE prophylaxis if they have IBD, and hematochezia may drive this. Hematochezia appeared to be minor and was unaffected by VTE prophylaxis. Education related to the safety of VTE prophylaxis in the setting of minor hematochezia may be a high-yield way to increase VTE prophylaxis rates in patients with IBD.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

GUIDELINE STATEMENTS

Management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding

The first 10 guideline statements address the management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding. Acute GI bleeding is defined as patients hospitalized or under observation with acute overt GI bleeding (upper and/or lower) manifesting as melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis. Life-threatening hemorrhage is defined as major clinically overt or apparent bleeding, resulting in hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors or surgery; or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of >5 g/dL, or requiring transfusion of ≥ 5 units of packed red blood cells, or causing death.

VKA reversal.

For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Gastrointestinal bleeding at CT angiography and CT enterography: imaging atlas and glossary of terms [^8faf4655]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common potentially life-threatening medical condition frequently requiring multidisciplinary collaboration to reach the proper diagnosis and guide management. GI bleeding can be overt (eg, visible hemorrhage such as hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena) or occult (eg, positive fecal occult blood test or iron deficiency anemia). Upper GI bleeding , which originates proximal to the ligament of Treitz, is more common than lower GI bleeding , which arises distal to the ligament of Treitz. Small bowel bleeding accounts for 5-10% of GI bleeding cases commonly manifesting as obscure GI bleeding, where the source remains unknown after complete GI tract endoscopic and imaging evaluation. CT can aid in identifying the location and cause of bleeding and is an important complementary tool to endoscopy, nuclear medicine, and angiography in evaluating patients with GI bleeding. For radiologists, interpreting CT scans in patients with GI bleeding can be challenging owing to the large number of images and the diverse potential causes of bleeding. The purpose of this pictorial review by the Society of Abdominal Radiology GI Bleeding Disease-Focused Panel is to provide a practical resource for radiologists interpreting GI bleeding CT studies that reviews the proper GI bleeding terminology, the most common causes of GI bleeding, key patient history and risk factors, the optimal CT imaging technique, and guidelines for case interpretation and illustrates many common causes of GI bleeding. A CT reporting template is included to help generate radiology reports that can add value to patient care. An invited commentary by Al Hawary is available online.

### Time to endoscopy or colonoscopy among adults younger than 50 years with iron-deficiency anemia and / or hematochezia in the VHA [^1dddc4c6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Among veterans aged 18 to 49 years with a diagnosis of IDA and/or hematochezia, the cumulative proportion receiving guideline-recommended diagnostic testing after 2 years was low, at 22% for those with IDA and 40% for those with hematochezia. Furthermore, receipt of diagnostic testing within 60 days of diagnosis of IDA or hematochezia occurred for only 7% of those with IDA and 22% of those with hematochezia. After IDA diagnosis, men were more likely to receive diagnostic testing compared with women, and the likelihood of workup increased with age. After diagnosis of hematochezia, adults aged 30 to 49 years were more likely to receive diagnostic testing compared with adults younger than 30 years. Black veterans were less likely to receive diagnostic testing after an IDA diagnosis, and Hispanic veterans were less likely to receive diagnostic testing after an IDA or hematochezia diagnosis, compared with White veterans. Given that both IDA and hematochezia have been shown to increase EAOCRC risk, our findings suggest that there are significant opportunities to improve EAOCRC outcomes, including sex-based and race and ethnicity–based disparities, by promoting diagnostic testing after IDA and hematochezia diagnosis.

Men were more likely than women to receive diagnostic testing after an IDA diagnosis, which aligns with prior research.Although the risk of incident and fatal EAOCRC is lower among women than men,, the markedly lower likelihood of diagnostic testing is surprising, given that the population with a diagnosis of IDA had a nearly equal amount of men and women. Iron-deficiency anemia is commonly attributed to menorrhagia in premenopausal women, but our study found the disparity in workup persisted even after removal of women with diagnosed cases of menorrhagia or prior hysterectomy. It is plausible that clinicians are more likely to attribute iron deficiency in women to disorders of menstruation. Nevertheless, more research is necessary to uncover why this sex-based disparity in diagnostic follow-up exists and whether substantially lower rates of endoscopic follow-up for women are clinically appropriate.

### Randomized trial of urgent vs. elective colonoscopy in patients hospitalized with lower GI bleeding [^0931f8d6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine, in patients with serious hematochezia, the proportion who have an upper gastrointestinal (GI) source and whether urgent colonoscopy improves outcomes as compared with elective colonoscopy in those without an upper source.

Methods

Patients with hematochezia were eligible if they also had heart rate >100, systolic blood pressure <100, orthostatic change in heart rate or blood pressure >20, hemoglobin drop ≥ 1.5 g/dl, or blood transfusion. Patients had upper endoscopy within 6 h. Those without an upper source were randomized to urgent (≤ 12 h) or elective (36-60 h after presentation) colonoscopy. The primary end point was further bleeding. Patients were followed for the duration of hospitalization.

Results

Eighty-five eligible patients had urgent upper endoscopy; 13 (15%) had an upper source. The remaining 72 were randomized to urgent (N=36) or elective (N=36) colonoscopy. Further bleeding occurred in 8 (22%) vs. 5 (14%) of the urgent vs. elective groups (difference=8%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-9 to 26%). Units of blood (1.5 vs. 0.7), hospital days (5.2 vs. 4.8), subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for bleeding (36% vs. 33%), and hospital charges ($27,590 vs. $26,633) also were not lower in the urgent group. A major limitation is that the study was terminated before reaching the prespecified sample size.

Conclusions

Patients with clinically serious hematochezia should have upper endoscopy initially to rule out an upper GI source. Use of urgent colonoscopy in a population hospitalized with serious lower GI bleeding showed no evidence of improving clinical outcomes or lowering costs as compared with routine elective colonoscopy.

### Identifying bleeding etiologies by endoscopy affected outcomes in 10, 342 cases with hematochezia: CODE BLUE-J study [^b7b12792]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Identification of SRH and bleeding etiology by CT and endoscopy

Abdominal or pelvic CT was performed in 69.1% of all cases (Table 2). The ascending colon (10.4%) was most commonly identified by extravasation on CT, more than twice as often as the sigmoid colon (4.3%). Initial colonoscopy was performed in 87.7% of all cases. SRH was identified on endoscopy in 30.9% of cases, followed by active bleeding in 16.4%, adherent clots in 9.2%, and visible vessels in 5.9%. Similar to CT extravasation, the ascending colon (12.9%) was the most frequent site where SRH was identified, again almost twice as often as the sigmoid colon (7.0%). Overall, 59.2% of patients (6,117/10,342) underwent both endoscopy and CT for further investigation of the source of bleeding, and only 2.4% (244/10,342) did not undergo any imaging tests such as colonoscopy and CT (see Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Digital Content 1,).

Table 2. 
Examinations and bleeding etiologies

The diagnostic yield of the initial and second colonoscopies reached 94.9%, and 22 bleeding source categories, covering 48 diseases, were identified (Table 2). The most common final diagnosis was colonic diverticular bleeding (63.6%), followed by ischemic colitis (9.1%), postendoscopic bleeding (4.5%), and rectal ulcer (2.5%). Bleeding sources other than the colon, rectum, and anus were also evident, including small bowel bleeding (2.4%) and UGIB (1.5%). When the rates of the different etiologies were compared between final diagnosis and initial endoscopic diagnosis, slight differences were evident (see Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Digital Content 4,); in particular, there was a lower rate of unknown cases and a higher rate of definitive diverticular bleeding.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^853769e7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Initial management—initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: “A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality.” History should cover “cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss.” Examination should include “careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia,” and “Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB.” Medication review should assess “NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants,” and “findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease…or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia.”

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^6a4ae768]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Endoscopy in patients with lower GI bleeding—We recommend endoscopic clip or tattoo placement adjacent to a bleeding diverticulum if identified at colonoscopy for future localization in the event of recurrent bleeding; we recommend endoscopic treatment with argon plasma coagulation as the preferred management in patients with bleeding angioectasias; and we recommend surgical and radiologic consultation in patients presenting with severe hematochezia who cannot be stabilized for endoscopy or in whom endoscopic evaluation has failed to reveal a bleeding source.

### Nasogastric aspiration and lavage in emergency department patients with hematochezia or melena without hematemesis [^0c7bf343]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The utility of nasogastric aspiration and lavage in the emergency management of patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis is controversial. This evidence-based emergency medicine review evaluates the following question: does nasogastric aspiration and lavage in patients with melena or hematochezia and no hematemesis differentiate an upper from lower source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding?

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases were searched. Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if the authors had performed nasogastric aspiration (with or without lavage) in all patients with hematochezia or melena and performed esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) in all patients. Studies were excluded if they enrolled patients with history of esophageal varices or included patients with hematemesis or coffee ground emesis (unless the data for patients without hematemesis or coffee ground emesis could be separated out). The outcome was identifying upper GI hemorrhage (active bleeding or high-risk lesions potentially responsible for hemorrhage) and the rate of complications associated with the nasogastric tube insertion. Quality of the included studies was assessed using standard criteria for diagnostic accuracy studies.

Results

Three retrospective studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prevalence of an upper GI source for patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis was 32% to 74%. According to the included studies, the diagnostic performance of the nasogastric aspiration and lavage for predicting upper GI bleeding is poor. The sensitivity of this test ranged from 42% to 84%, the specificity from 54% to 91%, and negative likelihood ratios from 0.62 to 0.20. Only one study reported the rate complications associated with nasogastric aspiration and lavage (1.6%).

Conclusions

Nasogastric aspiration, with or without lavage, has a low sensitivity and poor negative likelihood ratio, which limits its utility in ruling out an upper GI source of bleeding in patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^4535a1f5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding—recommendations: We recommend colonoscopy in patients with occult GI bleeding. We recommend EGD in patients with occult GI bleeding if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in those patients with upper GI symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. We suggest small-bowel evaluation after negative EGD and colonoscopy results in patients with occult GI bleeding who have persistent anemia. We recommend colonoscopy for the evaluation of chronic intermittent scant hematochezia in patients aged > 50 years and for patients who have iron deficiency anemia, risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, or the alarm symptoms of weight loss or bowel habit changes. We suggest that in younger patients presenting with chronic intermittent scant hematochezia without alarm symptoms, a digital rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient evaluation. We recommend EGD in the initial evaluation of patients with melena followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We recommend an initial EGD in patients with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to evaluate for a high-risk upper GI lesion, followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We suggest colonoscopy within 24 hours of admission after a rapid bowel preparation in the evaluation of patients with severe hematochezia. We recommend endoscopic treatment with epinephrine solution injection combined with thermal coagulation or endoscopic clip placement.

### 8-day-old male infant with bilious emesis and hematochezia [^b2b31e67]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for bilious emesis and hematochezia in newborns is broad and includes structural abnormalities (malrotation with volvulus, atresia, pyloric stenosis, intussusception), infectious colitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, milk protein intolerance, vascular malformations, and other bleeding disorders. Here we report a case of bilious emesis and hematochezia in an 8-day-old male infant who was ultimately found to have goat's milk protein intolerance after an extensive workup ruling out other pathology. There have been limited studies that examine goat's milk protein intolerance in pediatric patients, and to our knowledge, our paper presents the youngest patient presenting with bilious emesis related to goat's milk intake.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding-computed tomographic angiography, colonoscopy or both? [^c0fe0e0f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common clinical problem, representing 20 to 30% of patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. LGIB incidence is increasing over time, as it is associated with older age and pre-existing comorbidities. Very distal bleeding, e.g. due to hemorrhoids and low rectal cancer, is rather easy to diagnose, but bleeding from the colon and small bowel remains a diagnostic challenge. According to recent guidelines, hemodynamic stabilization and resuscitation must be performed prior to search any bleeding source. While nasogastric lavage and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy can be considered to rule out upper gastrointestinal bleeding for patients presenting severe hematochezia, lower endoscopy (LE) is the preferred diagnostic approach for LGIB. Nevertheless, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for evaluation of GI bleeding is increasingly used and may challenges lower endoscopy as most appropriate tool. This non-invasive diagnostic modality is readily available in most hospitals and can be rapidly performed without any bowel preparation. Reported sensitivity and specificity rates are 86 and 95%, respectively and bleeding as low as 0.4ml/min can be detected.

So far, there is only limited evidence on the routine use of CTA in the initial management of LGIB. Its accuracy compared to LE remains unclear; and subsequently, its use as a first-line diagnostic modality is not considered in current management algorithms.

This current study aimed to compare the accuracy of CTA and colonoscopy in the diagnosis of LGIB and their influence on bleeding control.

### Large, segmental, circular vascular malformation of the small intestine (in a female toddler with hematochezia): unusual presentation in a child [^dd939223]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Both failure to thrive with chronic diarrhea as well as hematochezia are clinical alarm signs in children potentially warranting endoscopy. And while hematochezia has a great variety of causes, vascular malformations of the small intestine - as one of them - are uncommon in this age group. In particular, there are only very few reports on this disease in children younger than two years [-].

Although infants and children suffering from intestinal vascular malformations may present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea or vomiting, some cases are asymptomatic and thus remain hidden from the diagnostician’s eye for quite some time. On the other hand, very few cases may lay a false trail for the clinician because of unaccompanied anemia. Early imaging using optimal technique is crucial for diagnosing these conditions, in the pediatric age group usually best performed by detailed ultrasound (US), potentially supplemented by MRI.

This is demonstrated by our report of a 19 months old female toddler who presented first with failure to thrive and signs of malabsorption and much later with abdominal pain and hematochezia as the clinical symptoms leading to the diagnosis of an unusual large, segmental, circumferential, low-flow vascular malformation of the ileum.

### The role of colonoscopy in evaluating hematochezia: a population-based study in a large consortium of endoscopy practices [^e659ef70]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the role of colonoscopy in hematochezia are almost exclusively derived from clinical experience in tertiary care practice.

Objective

To characterize the patient population who received colonoscopy for hematochezia in a consortium of diverse gastroenterology practices.

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting

Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative Database, 2002 to 2008.

Patients

Adults undergoing colonoscopy for the indication of hematochezia.

Main Outcome Measurements

Demographics, comorbidity, practice setting, adverse events, and colonoscopy procedure characteristics and findings. Age-stratified analyses and analyses of inpatient- versus outpatient-performed colonoscopies were also performed.

Results

A total of 966,536 colonoscopies were performed during the study period, 76,186 (7.9%) were performed for evaluation of hematochezia. The majority of patients were white non-Hispanic men younger than 60 years old who underwent colonoscopy at a community practice site (79.1%) and had a low-risk American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (81.5%), in whom colonoscopy reached the cecum (94.8%), and serious adverse events were rare. Colonoscopy findings were hemorrhoids (64.4%), diverticulosis (38.6%), and polyp or multiple polyps (38.8%). From the overall cohort, 38.3% were 60 years of age and older. The older age cohort had significantly more white non-Hispanic females, high-risk ASA scores, incomplete colonoscopies, and unplanned events. Colonoscopy findings demonstrated significantly higher rates of diverticulosis, polyp or multiple polyps, mucosal abnormality/colitis, tumor, and solitary ulcer (P < .0001). There were 3941 (5.2%) who underwent inpatient-performed colonoscopy. One third of this cohort (32.6%) was defined as having a high ASA score.

Limitations

Retrospective database review.

Conclusions

These results describe patient populations and characterize colonoscopy findings in individuals presenting with hematochezia primarily in a community practice setting.

### Delphi consensus statement for the management of delayed post-polypectomy bleeding [^52b72537]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1. 
Predictors of active bleeding, need for therapeutic intervention, or moderate/severe bleeding.

To date, only two logistic predictive models have been developed. The first model, originating from Australia, was not subjected to internal validation, and no information regarding its calibration or discrimination properties was provided.The second model, developed in Spain, underwent internal validation through bootstrapping; however, it has yet to undergo external validation.This model provides estimates of the probability of active bleeding. In this study, patients exhibiting three or more risk factors had a predicted probability of >25% of active bleeding, which justified the panel’s recommendation for colonoscopy even in the absence of hourly hematochezia, as this subgroup is likely to benefit from the procedure. For hemodynamically stable patients without a high probability of requiring endoscopic hemostatic intervention (i.e. <3 risk factors), and given the uncertain calibration of the model in real settings, a 24-h timeframe to assess bleeding cessation appears reasonable.If bleeding persists or recurs, a colonoscopy is recommended.

### Mucormycosis causing massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report [^de9c7870]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) presenting as hematochezia is very common in the hospital setting. Most cases of LGIB stop spontaneously, but acute severe bleeding can be life-threatening, especially in patients with comorbidities. To improve diagnostic and therapeutic yields, early colonoscopy is recommended for patients with acute LGIB.

The most common etiologies of LGIB include diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, colorectal neoplasms, hemorrhoids, and rectal ulcer. Other causes such as inflammatory bowel disease and proctitis are also important differential diagnoses. In immunocompromised patients, opportunistic infections of the GI tract resulting in massive LGIB have been reported in previous literature. These include viral infections such as cytomegalovirus colitis, bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, and fungal infections such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Among these infections, mucormycosis causing LGIB has been the least reported.

Presentations of intestinal mucormycosis reported in literature have been non-specific, ranging from afebrile abdominal pain to severe intestinal perforation. In the few reported cases of mucormycosis presenting as severe LGIB, almost all patients died despite treatment. Delayed diagnosis was often identified as the fundamental reason for mortality. We described a case of GI mucormycosis presenting as massive hematochezia in an immunocompromised patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Prompt diagnosis with colonoscopy and antifungal treatment resulted in satisfactory outcome.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^173185b8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline—definitions and classification of small bowel bleeding specify that a source of small bowel bleeding should be considered in patients with overt or occult GI hemorrhage after performance of a normal upper and lower endoscopic examination. Patients should be classified as having small bowel bleeding if a source of bleeding is identified distal to the ampulla of Vater and/or proximal to the ileocecal valve. After normal upper and lower endoscopic examinations and before performance of capsule endoscopy, patients should be classified as having “potential small bowel bleeding.” “Overt small bowel bleeding” refers to patients presenting with either melena or hematochezia with a source of bleeding identified in the small intestine, and the term “occult small bowel bleeding” can be reserved for patients presenting with iron-deficiency anemia with or without guaiac-positive stools who are found to have a small bowel source of bleeding. The term “obscure GI bleeding” should be reserved for patients not found to have a source of bleeding after performance of standard upper and lower endoscopic examinations, small bowel evaluation with VCE and/or enteroscopy, and radiographic testing.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^7f847bcd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding management—hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed, and risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24 h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation, and endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by endoscopist experience, the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities, and repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy, and strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia, and patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin (secondary prophylaxis) should generally resume aspirin as soon as possible after bleeding ceases and at least within 7 days. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

### The incidence and relevance of hematochezia in the interstage congenital heart population [^6d48a915]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) increases morbidity and mortality for infants with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD). While hematochezia often proceeds NEC not all hematochezia progresses to NEC. We aimed to examine the incidence, risk-factors, and outcomes associated with hematochezia and NEC for infants with SVHD. A single-center cohort study including SVHD patients requiring Stage I palliation from 12/2010 to 12/2015 was performed. Demographic, clinical, and outcome measures during the interstage period were abstracted from medical records. We defined hematochezia as blood in the stool without alternative etiology and NEC as systemic or intestinal signs concurrent with hematochezia and/or the presence of radiographic pneumatosis. Clinical characteristics and outcome measures were compared between patients with/without hematochezia and with/without NEC. Of 135 patients, 59(44%) had hematochezia and 20(15%) developed NEC. Demographic and operative factors were similar between patients with and without hematochezia. Patients with NEC were more often premature (15% vs 0%, p=0.04), have lower birth weight (3.0±0.6 vs 3.3±0.5 kg, p=0.03), longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (median 131 vs. 90 min, p=0.02) and more often underwent unplanned cardiac catheterization (20% vs 3%, p=0.04). Patients with hematochezia had more line days (p<0.0001) and longer post-Stage-I length of stay (p<0.0001) than those without hematochezia, and those with NEC had more line days than those without NEC (p=0.02). Hematochezia is frequent following Stage-I palliation, however only one third of these patients develop NEC. Non-NEC Hematochezia is associated with a similar increase in line and hospital days. Further research is needed to identify methods to avoid over treatment.

### Urgent versus standard colonoscopy for management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0bb09e24]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common indication for hospitalization. However, the optimum timing of colonoscopy following patient presentation remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of urgent versus standard colonoscopy timing on management of acute LGIB.

Materials and Methods

Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PubMed were searched up to January 2020. Randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared patients with hematochezia receiving urgent (<24h) versus standard (>24h) colonoscopy. Nonrandomized observational studies were also included based on the same criteria for additional analysis. Pooled estimates were calculated using random effects meta-analyses and heterogeneity was quantified using the inconsistency statistic. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Results

Of 3782 potentially relevant studies, 4 randomized controlled trials involving 463 patients met inclusion criteria. Urgent colonoscopy did not differ significantly to standard timing with respect to length of stay (LOS), units of blood transfused, rate of additional intervention required, or mortality. Colonoscopy-related outcomes such as patient complications, rebleeding rates, and diagnosis of bleeding source did not differ between groups. However, meta-analysis including nonrandomized studies (9 studies, n=111,950) revealed a significantly higher rate of mortality and complications requiring surgery in the standard group and shorter LOS in the urgent group. Overall GRADE certainty of evidence was low in the majority of outcomes.

Conclusions

Timing of colonoscopy in acute LGIB may not significantly affect patient outcomes. Timing should therefore be decided on a case-by-case basis.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^120a258b]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding—diverticular hemorrhage diagnosis, risk factors, natural history, and endoscopic outcomes are summarized as follows: A definitive diagnosis is made in approximately 22% of patients with active bleeding or high-risk stigmata on colonoscopy, and diverticular bleeding is detected by colonoscopy more commonly in the left colon (50%-60%) and by angiography more commonly in the right colon (50%-90%). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk, while hypertension and anticoagulation may contribute to severe bleeding. Presentation is painless hematochezia; bleeding resolves spontaneously in 75% to 80% of patients but recurs in 25% to 40% within 4 years. Older studies of epinephrine and/or thermal coagulation reported early (<30 days) rebleeding rates of 0% to 8% after endoscopic treatment, whereas two recent studies reported no early rebleeding with endoscopic clips and late rebleeding in 18% to 22% of patients; late rebleeding may occur from diverticula at a location different from that of the index bleed.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^c49560be]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Best practice advice—diagnosis in older patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) states that a diagnosis of IBD (CD, UC) should be considered in older patients who present with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, urgency, abdominal pain, or weight loss because up to 15% of new diagnoses of IBD occur in individuals older than 60 years. Fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin may help prioritize patients with a low probability for IBD for endoscopic evaluation, and individuals presenting with hematochezia or chronic diarrhea with intermediate to high suspicion for underlying IBD, microscopic colitis, or colorectal neoplasia should undergo colonoscopy. In elderly patients with segmental left-sided colitis in the setting of diverticulosis, consider a diagnosis of segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis in addition to the possibility of CD or IBD—unclassified.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^a2f094da]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis—diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis—The diagnosis of UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of affected and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist, preferably one with expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. Categories of disease extent include proctitis within 18 cm of anal verge (distal to rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis extending from sigmoid to splenic flexure, and extensive colitis beyond splenic flexure including pancolitis; if the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless other symptoms or findings suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity are needed to guide treatment decisions and should be based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers such as FC, CRP, and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity, and disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^f136a336]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) resuscitation and evaluation—care setting and initial measures are outlined: The majority of patients with chronic LGIB can be managed electively in the outpatient setting, whereas patients presenting with acute LGIB with hematochezia usually require inpatient management. These patients should undergo stabilization and resuscitation with crystalloids or blood products, and coagulation factors and platelets may be necessary in patients on antithrombotic agents or with underlying bleeding disorders. Patients with clinical evidence of ongoing or severe bleeding, those with a transfusion requirement of greater than 2 units of packed red blood cells, and those with significant comorbidities may require admission and monitoring in an intensive care unit setting. The role of nasogastric tube placement and gastric lavage to exclude an upper GI source has not been studied prospectively in suspected acute LGIB; however, this approach should be considered in patients with hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to rule out brisk UGIB. An actively bleeding upper GI source is unlikely if bile is seen in the nasogastric lavage, but it cannot be ruled out in the presence of a clear aspirate.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^3349a924]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB)—initial assessment and stabilization: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology, and initial patient assessment and hemodynamic resuscitation should be performed simultaneously. Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with the goal of optimization of blood pressure and heart rate before endoscopic evaluation/ intervention. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source, and an upper endoscopy should be performed if the suspicion is high to exclude a proximal source of bleeding. Endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an INR of 2.5 or less. Platelets should be administered in the setting of severe LGIB to maintain a platelet count of >30 × 10^9/L, and a higher threshold of >50 × 10^9/L can be considered if endoscopic procedures are required, and there is no benefit to routine platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelets.

### Imaging workup of acute and occult lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^4de161cd]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as occurring distal to the ligament of Treitz and presents as hematochezia, melena, or with anemia and positive fecal occult blood test. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the localization and treatment of lower gastrointestinal bleeds. Imaging tests in the workup of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding include computed tomography (CT) angiography, nuclear medicine scintigraphy, and conventional catheter angiography. Catheter angiography can also be used to deliver treatment. Imaging tests in the workup of occult lower gastrointestinal bleeding include CT enterography and nuclear medicine Meckel scan.

ACG clinical guideline—clinical presentation evidence for CI describes common symptoms and timing: in a retrospective study of 401 patients admitted with CI, the most common symptoms were abdominal pain (78%), rectal bleeding (84%), diarrhea (56%), and nausea (38%); in 22 Korean biopsy-proven CI patients, abdominal pain (77.8%), hematochezia (58.3%), bloody diarrhea (34.7%), and nonbloody diarrhea (19.4%) were common; vomiting (30%), dizziness (10%), and syncope (6%) occur less frequently; in IRCI, only 25–46% have rectal bleeding and physicians should entertain the diagnosis of IRCI for patients with acute, severe abdominal pain who lack hematochezia and/or diarrhea; in a Swiss cohort of 49 biopsy-proven CI patients, 57.1% presented within 24 h and 75.5% within 3 days of symptom onset; CI generally manifests with sudden cramping, mild, left lower abdominal pain; an urgent desire to defecate; and passage within 24 h of bright red or maroon blood per rectum or bloody diarrhea.

### Small intestine duplication cyst with recurrent hematochezia: a case report and literature review [^85847fe8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Enteric duplication cysts (EDCs) are rare congenital anatomical abnormalities of the digestive tract with an incidence of one in 4500. EDCs are found throughout the digestive tract, with nearly half occurring in the small intestine. Even though rare in adults, they are most commonly found in infants. EDCs are typically located at the mesenteric boundary of the digestive tract.

Hematochezia is a difficult matter in clinics and may even be life-threatening. Causes for hematochezia include peptic ulcer, Meckel’s diverticulum, intussusception, and EDC. Sometimes, differential diagnosis is difficult. Small intestine duplication cysts (SIDCs) were mostly located outside the digestive tract. Notably, we observed a case of SIDC inside the distal ileum and it was an unusual source of hematochezia.

### Paradigm shift: the copernican revolution in diverticular disease [^7ad54102]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the most common causes of LGIB is DD. Nevertheless, data concerning the utility of an early endoscopy in patients with diverticular bleeding are scanty. A pivotal trial published in 2000 found that, among patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis, at least one fifth have definite diverticular hemorrhage on colonoscopy performed at the bedside 6-12 h after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia. It was concluded that endoscopic treatment of these patients might prevent recurrent bleeding and decrease the need for surgery. More recently, a retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of the timing of colonoscopy on outcomes in patients with acute diverticular bleeding. It was found that the length of stay in hospital was significantly lower in patients with colonoscopy performed within 24 h of admission as compared to those with late colonoscopy (3.7 vs. 5.6 days; P<0.0001). Total hospitalization costs were also significantly lower in patients with early colonoscopy ($9317 vs. $11,767; P<0.0001). However, there was no difference in mortality between the groups (0.7% vs. 0.8%). This finding was consistent with the results of 2 systematic reviews and meta-analyses that aimed to compare several outcomes between urgent and elective colonoscopy in patients hospitalized for LGIB. Indeed, these reviews did not find any difference in mortality or rebleeding, or in the identification of the bleeding source, in patients with LGIB who underwent an early colonoscopy. In contrast, a meta-analysis of non-randomized studies demonstrated higher diagnostic and therapeutic yields with early colonoscopy (OR 1.86, 95%CI 1.12-2.86; P=0.004; and OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.93-4.90; P<0.001, respectively) and a shorter length of stay (mean difference 2.64 days, 95%CI 1.54-3.73), but no difference in transfusion or rebleeding. The British Society of Gastroenterology’s recent guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute LGIB suggest stratifying patients as unstable or stable. For unstable patients, it is recommended to perform CT angiography, as it provides the fastest and least invasive means of locating the site of blood loss before planning endoscopic or radiological therapy. Stable patients should be categorized as major or minor, using a risk assessment tool. Patients with a major bleed should be admitted to hospital for colonoscopy on the next available list, whilst patients with a minor self-terminating bleed, with no other indications for hospital admission, can be discharged for urgent outpatient investigation.

### Do aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause false-positive fecal occult blood test results? A prospective study in a cohort of veterans [^00a27fec]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether use of regular aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a risk factor for a false-positive fecal occult blood test result.

Methods

Consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test result at a Veterans Affairs hospital were eligible. Patients with hematochezia, peptic ulcer disease, or unevaluated dyspepsia requiring antacids, or who used warfarin, were excluded. Regular aspirin and NSAID use was defined as at least one daily dose for at least 3 days per week. Colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result alone were defined a priori as diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or polyps <1.0 cm with no villous histology. Findings likely to explain a positive test result included cancer and advanced polyps.

Results

The sample comprised 193 veterans with a mean (+/- SD) age of 66 +/- 10 years; 98% were male and 86% were white. No colonoscopic findings explained the positive fecal occult blood test result in 153 patients (79%). One hundred and thirty-five patients (70%) were regular aspirin or NSAID users, of whom 21% (n = 29) had findings to explain the positive test results, compared with 19% (11/58) of nonusers (P = 0.7). There was no relation between aspirin dose and colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result. Multivariate analysis found no association between regular aspirin or NSAID use and a false-positive test result (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 1.84).

Conclusion

Aspirin and NSAID use were not risk factors for a false-positive fecal occult blood test result in this study.

### Endoscopic hemostasis is rarely used for hematochezia: a population-based study from the clinical outcomes research initiative national endoscopic database [^bfe0aa3f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the use of endoscopic hemostasis performed during colonoscopy for hematochezia are primarily derived from expert opinion and case series from tertiary care settings.

Objectives

To characterize patients with hematochezia who underwent in-patient colonoscopy and compare those who did and did not receive endoscopic hemostasis.

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting

Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative National Endoscopic Database, 2002 to 2008.

Patients

Adults with hematochezia.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measurements

Demographics, comorbidities, practice setting, adverse events, and colonoscopy procedural characteristics and findings.

Results

We identified 3151 persons who underwent in-patient colonoscopy for hematochezia. Endoscopic hemostasis was performed in 144 patients (4.6%). Of those who received endoscopic hemostasis, the majority were male (60.3%), white (83.3%), and older (mean age 70.9 ± 12.3 years); had a low-risk American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (53.9%); and underwent colonoscopy in a community setting (67.4%). The hemostasis-receiving cohort was significantly more likely to be white (83.3% vs 71.0%, P = .02), have more comorbidities (classes 3 and 4, 46.2% vs 36.0%, P = .04), and have the cecum reached (95.8% vs 87.7%, P = .003). Those receiving hemostasis were significantly more likely to have an endoscopic diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations (32.6% vs 2.6%, P = .0001) or a solitary ulcer (8.3% vs 2.1%, P < .0001).

Limitations

Retrospective database analysis.

Conclusions

Less than 5% of persons presenting with hematochezia and undergoing inpatient colonoscopy received endoscopic hemostasis. These findings differ from published tertiary care setting data. These data provide new insights into in-patient colonoscopy performed primarily in a community practice setting for patients with hematochezia.

### Feeding practices in infants with hematochezia and necrotizing enterocolitis on acute care cardiology units [^a047932a]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for developing both benign hematochezia and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Despite these risks there are very few studies that investigate modifiable risk factors such as feeding practices. It remains unclear what feeding practices should be avoided due to higher incidence of CHD-NEC. We aim to assess the feeding practices across three high volume tertiary centers to establish a relationship between various feeding practices and development of NEC. A multicenter retrospective review of feeding practices at the time of documented hematochezia event that occurred between 1/2019 and 1/2021 in infants with CHD who were less than 6 months of age. NEC was defined as Bells Stage 2 or greater. Age, weight, ventricular morphology, primary diagnoses, feeding route, feed change, and formula type were evaluated. 176 hematochezia events occurred in 121 patients, 72% of these events were considered benign hematochezia with the remaining 28% being true NEC. Single ventricle (SV) physiology (p<0.05), younger age,<45 days of life, (p<0.001), and feeding route were statistically associated with true NEC (p<0.01). Formula type and recent change in feed administration were not associated with NEC. The caloric density of feeds at the time of hematochezia was nearing significance. The majority of hematochezia events are benign in nature, however, there should be heightened awareness in patients who are SV, younger in age, and those who are post-pylorically fed. There may be some risk in using higher caloric density feeds (>24 kcal/oz), however, additional research is needed to fully establish this relationship.

### Is early colonoscopy after admission for acute diverticular bleeding needed? [^80ce206c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Urgent colonoscopy has been proposed for the diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticular bleeding. Identification of active bleeding and nonbleeding stigmata facilitates diagnosis and endoscopic therapy, but it is unclear whether urgent colonoscopy after presentation increases the diagnostic yield. This study evaluated the association between timing of colonoscopy and diagnostic yield in patients admitted with acute colonic diverticular bleeding.

Methods

Patients admitted for hematochezia and receiving a diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage were identified using the Mayo Clinic GI Bleeding Team and Emergency Room Admissions Databases for the years 1998-2000. Timing of colonoscopy was determined from the time of admission. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether the timing of colonoscopy was associated with an endoscopic finding of active bleeding or nonbleeding stigmata (or both).

Results

A diagnosis of definitive or presumptive diverticular bleeding was made in 78 patients (39 men and 39 women, mean age 78 yr, range 49-96 yr). Twelve patients (15%) had active bleeding or stigmata. Colonoscopies were performed a mean of 18 +/- 11 h after admission. The association between a definitive diagnosis of acute diverticular bleeding and the timing of colonoscopy was not significant (p > 0.46).

Conclusions

No significant association is apparent between the timing of colonoscopy after admission and encountering active bleeding or nonbleeding stigmata. Based on these observations, urgent colonoscopy for these patients does not seem advantageous.

### Jujitsu kick to the abdomen: a case of blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematochezia and transient ischemic colitis [^329541e7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma is a common presentation to the emergency department. Ischemic colitis is a rare complication of this and its possible sequelae are important for an emergency physician to recognize. A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and hourly episodes of bright red blood per rectum shortly after being kicked in the stomach at his jujitsu class. He had no significant medical history, and results of his systems review were otherwise unremarkable. On examination, he appeared well, with normal vital signs. He had mild lower abdominal tenderness, but there were no peritoneal signs present. There was blood on the digital rectal examination. His hemoglobin, platelet, and international normalized ratio levels were normal and his abdominal radiograph was unremarkable. The gastroenterology service was contacted because of the hematochezia and a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. The sigmoidoscopy showed erythema, ulceration, and edema of a segment in the left colon, consistent with ischemic colitis. This was later confirmed on biopsy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was conducted, which revealed left colonic inflammation consistent with colonic ischemia. There was no mesenteric vascular thrombosis or mesenteric hematoma found on CT. His hematochezia and abdominal pain subsided spontaneously, and he was discharged home. This case illustrates transient ischemic colitis as a potential presentation of blunt abdominal trauma, and emergency physicians should consider this uncommon diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting after abdominal trauma.

### Catheter embolization of type II congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt with hematochezia: a case series and review of the literature [^d2831082]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematochezia is a rare clinical presentation of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEPS). We describe a series of three patients with type II CEPS presenting as hematochezia that were treated by catheter embolization, followed by a brief review of published articles. Hematochezia of the patients was due to the giant inferior mesenteric vein, superior rectal vein and colonic varices. The catheter embolization was successfully accomplished in all of the patients. After a mean follow-up of 27 months, no serious adverse effects were observed. For unexplained massive hematochezia, CEPS needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis. Based on our present results and the review of the literature, transcatheter permanent embolization of the giant inferior mesenteric vein might be an effective and safe treatment for type II CEPS.Level of Evidence Level 4, case series.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^1ea8cbd6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline—Diagnosis of small bowel bleeding initial endoscopic evaluation states that second-look upper endoscopy should be considered in cases of recurrent hematemesis, melena, or a previously incomplete exam, and second-look colonoscopy should be considered in the setting of recurrent hematochezia or if a lower source is suspected. If the second-look examinations are normal, the next step should be a small bowel evaluation. Push enteroscopy can be performed as a second-look examination in the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) should be considered as a first-line procedure for SB evaluation after upper and lower GI sources have been excluded, including second-look endoscopy when indicated. Owing to the lower detection rate of lesions in the duodenum and proximal jejunum with VCE, push enteroscopy should be performed if proximal lesions are suspected.

### Diagnostic studies (...) [^440b1378]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding may be classified as overt, obscure, or occult. Overt GI bleeding is visible, such as hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. A family history of GI bleeding may suggest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. A history of gastric bypass surgery may suggest impaired iron absorption. 5 A history of liver disease or stigmata of liver disease suggests portal hypertensive gastropathy or colopathy.

Other helpful physical examination findings that could indicate the presence of an underlying condition include dermatitis herpetiformis; erythema nodosum; an atrophic tongue and brittle, spoon-shaped nails; hyperextensible joints and ocular and dental abnormalities; and freckles on the lips and in the mouth.
4. 15 Limitations of capsule endoscopy include lack of therapeutic capability and poor visualization in the periampullary region. Videos depicting capsule endoscopy may be viewed at: . 10 Other conditions such as small bowel diverticula were present in 2 to 22 percent of patients. No findings were reported in 0 to 57 percent of patients. The diagnostic yield of double-balloon enteroscopy ranged from 41 to 80 percent, with therapeutic success varying from 43 to 76 percent. 10 Perforation rates range from 0. 3 to
3. 6 percent.

10, 16–18 Studies comparing double-balloon enteroscopy with single-balloon enteroscopy 19 and spiral enteroscopy 20 are lacking. However, colonic and upper GI tract lesions, including cancer, have been reported in this group. 26 Thus, premenopausal women who have iron deficiency anemia that cannot be explained by heavy menses, or those who have GI symptoms, should be evaluated for a GI cause. 4, 8, 10. All patients should be evaluated for extraintestinal causes such as epistaxis, hematuria, and heavy gynecologic bleeding. Endoscopic evaluation should include EGD and colonoscopy.

Parasitic causes of eosinophilia and gastrointestinal symptoms without fever—anisakiasis (Pseudoterranova decipiens, Anisakis simplex) is acquired by ingesting infected fish or squid that share an environment with whales, sea lions, or crustaceans; Anisakis invades the stomach or intestinal wall and within hours to days can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, and hematochezia with occasional pruritic rashes and sometimes a tingling sensation during or after ingestion; travelers to endemic areas are at risk after intentional or accidental ingestion of raw or undercooked fish or squid.

### Large, segmental, circular vascular malformation of the small intestine (in a female toddler with hematochezia): unusual presentation in a child [^5790b0a5]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The decision to perform surgery was made because the girl suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia), which required prompt diagnosis and therapy. Although the diagnostic workup immediately revealed a vascular anomaly of the distal ileum, the exact differentiation between a hemangioma and a complex vascular malformation could not be made. Thus medical treatment with propranolol or corticosteroid did not seem justified. Furthermore the MRI could not delineate the exact position or its extent to initiate sclerotherapy or embolization which would also have endangered the vitality of the affected bowel segment. In contrast, laparoscopy identified the affected segment of small bowel as well as the macroscopic borders of the lesion and thus lead to definite surgical therapy. After delivery through a minimally extended umbilical port sire the lesion could be resected completely, the pathology report revealed that the margins of resection were free of disease. Since then, the postoperative course of more than two years has been uneventful.

In conclusion, this case shows that common symptoms may be present even in an extremely rare pathology. Furthermore, it demonstrates that even early invasive diagnostics may still require additional less- or non-invasive methods to enable the correct diagnosis; maybe an initial US study can be considered compulsory before going for more invasive studies.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^2364e12a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute LGIB—diagnostic evaluation and timing: We recommend performance of colonoscopy for most patients who are hospitalized with LGIB because of its value in detecting a source of bleeding (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest performing a computed tomography (CT) angiography as the initial diagnostic test in patients with ongoing hemodynamically significant hematochezia; however, CT angiography is of low yield in patients with minor LGIB or those in whom bleeding has clinically subsided (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We recommend that patients who have a CT angiography demonstrating extravasation be promptly referred to interventional radiology for transcatheter arteriography and possible embolization, and for specialized centers with experience performing endoscopic hemostasis, a colonoscopy can also be considered after a positive CT angiography (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For patients hospitalized with LGIB requiring a colonoscopy, we recommend performing a nonemergent inpatient colonoscopy, as performing an urgent colonoscopy within 24 hours has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
