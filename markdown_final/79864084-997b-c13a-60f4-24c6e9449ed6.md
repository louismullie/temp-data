## Question

Can taking antivirals prevent hsv2 contraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether taking antivirals can prevent contracting HSV-2. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for uninfected individuals versus suppressive therapy for those already infected. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about antivirals as PrEP. Next, I will examine the evidence base for suppressive therapy reducing transmission from infected to uninfected partners. After that, I need to check whether any trials show antivirals reduce acquisition in seronegative people. Finally, I will consider indirect or confounded signals and synthesize a clear, clinically actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Preventing HSV-2 contraction in someone who is HSV-2–seronegative would require pre-exposure prophylaxis, whereas suppressive antivirals in someone who is already HSV-2–seropositive reduce shedding and transmission to partners; these are distinct strategies with different evidence bases, and I need to ensure I don't conflate them [^a71e87c1] [^8aac1c23].

> Now, I should verify the direct answer from authoritative guidelines. The CDC's 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines explicitly state there are no data indicating that antivirals such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir can be taken as PrEP to prevent HSV-2 acquisition, and they should not be used for that purpose; this is a direct answer to the question and carries high credibility [^a71e87c1] [^9f478712].

> Wait, let me verify whether any subgroup or context changes this. The same guideline notes that among people with HIV, oral TDF does not prevent HSV-2 acquisition, reinforcing that even in high-risk populations, antivirals have not shown a preventive effect for acquisition. Additionally, HIV-focused guidance advises against antiviral prophylaxis to prevent primary HSV infection, aligning with the absence of supportive PrEP data [^a71e87c1] [^65495f9a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the evidence base for suppressive therapy in serodiscordant couples to ensure I'm not missing a translational argument. In HSV-2–seropositive individuals without HIV, daily valacyclovir 500 mg reduced transmission to seronegative partners by about 48% over eight months, and suppressive therapy reduces recurrences and shedding, but this benefits the infected index case and their partners; it does not establish that uninfected people can take antivirals beforehand to prevent acquisition, which would be PrEP rather than suppression [^0e3977df] [^8aac1c23].

> I need to check for any indirect or confounded signals that might be misinterpreted. Trials of HSV-2 suppressive therapy in people with HIV did not reduce HIV transmission to partners despite lowering HSV ulcers and modestly reducing HIV RNA, underscoring that suppressive HSV therapy is not a strategy to prevent acquisition of HSV in seronegative individuals; likewise, modeling and systematic reviews emphasize that antivirals do not sufficiently suppress shedding to eliminate transmission, which helps explain the lack of PrEP efficacy signals [^a128320c] [^21247448] [^9e68b2c3].

> Let me consider what is actually recommended for prevention. Consistent condom use reduces HSV-2 acquisition risk by roughly 26–30%, and in selected heterosexual populations, tenofovir-based HIV PrEP reduces HSV-2 acquisition by about 30%, but this latter effect is not reliable across all populations and is not an indication to use TDF/FTC solely for HSV-2 prevention; importantly, these are prevention strategies for uninfected individuals, distinct from antiviral PrEP, which remains unsupported [^8ad5454f] [^9f478712] [^a71e87c1].

> I should double-check whether any guideline or trial contradicts this conclusion. Across CDC, WHO, and HIV-focused guidance, there are no recommendations for antiviral PrEP to prevent HSV-2 acquisition, and no randomized trials demonstrate efficacy of acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HSV-2 in seronegative individuals; the only supportive signals pertain to suppressive therapy in infected persons reducing transmission, not preventing acquisition in uninfected persons [^a71e87c1] [^481ad36a] [^8aac1c23].

> Bottom line, after verifying the direct statements and the evidence base, taking antivirals does not prevent HSV-2 contraction in seronegative individuals; there is no evidence supporting antiviral PrEP for HSV-2, and guidelines advise against it. Prevention should rely on condoms, partner disclosure, and, in appropriate HIV-risk contexts, tenofovir-based PrEP for HIV with the understanding that HSV-2 benefit is modest and context-dependent, not guaranteed [^a71e87c1] [^9f478712] [^8ad5454f].

---

Antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) **do not prevent HSV-2 acquisition** in uninfected individuals [^a71e87c1]. They are for treatment and suppression in those already infected, not for pre-exposure prophylaxis [^9f478712]. The only agents with evidence for reducing HSV-2 acquisition are **tenofovir-based regimens** (TDF or TDF/FTC) in specific populations [^9f478712], with about a 30% reduction in heterosexual women, but they are not recommended solely for HSV-2 prevention [^a71e87c1]. For uninfected individuals, **consistent condom use** [^8ad5454f] and **partner disclosure** are the main prevention strategies [^31ce708c].

---

## Evidence on antivirals for HSV-2 prevention

- **Suppressive therapy**: Daily antivirals reduce shedding and transmission in infected individuals [^8aac1c23] but do not prevent acquisition in uninfected partners [^a71e87c1].

- **RCT evidence**: A randomized trial showed valacyclovir 500 mg daily reduced transmission by ~48% in discordant couples [^0e3977df], but this benefits the infected partner's transmission risk, not the uninfected partner's acquisition risk [^a71e87c1].

- **Guidelines**: CDC and WHO state there is no evidence that antivirals prevent HSV-2 acquisition in uninfected individuals [^a71e87c1] [^9f478712].

---

## Alternative pharmacologic interventions

Among pharmacologic options, **tenofovir-based regimens** are the only agents with evidence for reducing HSV-2 acquisition, showing about a 30% reduction in heterosexual women [^9f478712]; however, they are not recommended solely for HSV-2 prevention because of limited evidence and potential risks [^a71e87c1]. In contrast, **microbicides** such as tenofovir 1% gel have shown promise in women [^9f478712], but they are not yet approved or widely available.

---

## Non-pharmacologic prevention strategies

- **Condoms**: Consistent use reduces HSV-2 acquisition by ~30% [^8ad5454f].

- **Partner disclosure**: Discussing HSV status and avoiding sex during outbreaks reduces risk [^31ce708c].

- **Education**: Counseling on asymptomatic shedding and symptom recognition improves prevention [^08667d72].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from CDC and WHO **do not recommend antivirals** for HSV-2 prevention in uninfected individuals [^a71e87c1] [^9f478712]. Antivirals are indicated for treatment and suppression in infected individuals, not for pre-exposure prophylaxis [^dedd1625].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Antivirals **do not prevent HSV-2 acquisition** in uninfected individuals [^a71e87c1]. They are for treatment and suppression in those already infected, not for pre-exposure prophylaxis [^9f478712]. The only agents with evidence for reducing HSV-2 acquisition are tenofovir-based regimens in specific populations, but they are not recommended solely for HSV-2 prevention [^a71e87c1]. For uninfected individuals, consistent condom use and partner disclosure remain the main prevention strategies [^8ad5454f] [^31ce708c].

Introduction

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2), and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of herpes simplex virus from mother to neonate? What are the effects of antiviral treatment in people with a first episode of genital herpes? What are the effects of interventions to reduce the impact of recurrence? What are the effects of treatments in people with genital herpes and HIV? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antivirals, caesarean delivery, condoms, oral aciclovir, psychotherapy, recombinant glycoprotein vaccines, serological screening, and counselling.

Antiviral agents aimed at treating HSV-2 chronically infected individuals have proven to be effective in the prevention of symptomatic genital herpes and the reduction of viral shedding. These agents play a key role in current HIV prevention trials that will assess the role of suppression of HSV-2 infection on the risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. An added clinical benefit of treating HSV-2/HIV-coinfected individuals is the potential survival benefit, as suggested by earlier studies and by the recent findings that HSV-2/HIV dually infected individuals have higher viral loads. The results of the current HSV-2 suppression trials may provide additional tools to fight the global spread of HIV infection. Treatment of HSV-2/HIV dually infected individuals may prove to be a low-cost intervention to improve clinical outcomes and delay the need for antiretroviral therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppression in people with HIV—chronic suppressive therapy reduces HSV-2 transmission to susceptible HSV-discordant partners without HIV by 25% to 75% and can reduce HSV shedding in HIV/HSV coinfection. All HSV-active antivirals are equally effective in reducing transmission, but twice-daily dosing may be superior to a larger once-daily dose. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) also reduces the frequency of asymptomatic HSV shedding, and when administered to prevent clinical recurrences, suppressive therapy may thus limit spread to sexual partners.

### Potential effect of HIV type 1 antiretroviral and herpes simplex virus type 2 antiviral therapy on transmission and acquisition of HIV type 1 infection [^6c2921c1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Biological strategies for interrupting transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 should be directed at reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1. Potential antiretroviral interventions include reducing the likelihood of transmission of HIV-1 by reducing HIV-1 load in the blood and genital tract of HIV-1--infected person, prophylaxis after high-risk exposure, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for very high risk populations. Antiviral treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, the most common cause of genital ulcers, should be evaluated as a strategy for HIV-1 infection prevention by reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1, on the basis of biological and epidemiological data indicating that HSV-2 facilitates transmission and acquisition of HIV-1. The rationale for antiretroviral and HSV-2-specific interventions and studies to test these strategies are described.

Prevention

Consistent and correct condom use has been reported in multiple studies to decrease, but not eliminate, the risk for HSV-2 transmission from men to women (–). Condoms are less effective for preventing transmission from women to men. Two randomized clinical trials of medical male circumcision (MMC) demonstrated a decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition among men in Uganda and South Africa. Results from a third trial conducted in Kenya did not demonstrate a substantial difference in HSV-2 acquisition among men who received MMC. A systematic review indicated high consistency for decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition among women with a male partner who underwent MMC. These data indicate that MMC can be associated with decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition among adult heterosexual men and with decreased risk for HSV-2 transmission from male to female partners.

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that PrEP with daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition by 30% in heterosexual partnerships. Pericoital intravaginal tenofovir 1% gel also decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition among heterosexual women. Among MSM and transgender women, daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for severe ulcers with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection but not for HSV-2 acquisition. Insufficient evidence exists that TDF/FTC use among those who are not at risk for HIV acquisition will prevent HSV-2 infection, and it should not be used for that sole purpose. Oral TDF does not prevent HSV-2 acquisition among persons with HIV infection who are taking TDF as part of their ART regimen. No data indicate that antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) can be taken as PrEP by persons without HSV-2 to prevent its acquisition.

### Global and regional estimates of the contribution of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection to HIV incidence: a population attributable fraction analysis using published epidemiological data [^21247448]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Trials of daily suppressive antiviral therapy against HSV-2 did not show a reduction in HIV acquisition; however, it has been speculated that the antivirals evaluated did not sufficiently reduce the HSV-associated influx of immune cell targets for HIV for there to be an effect on HIV acquisition.Antivirals do not fully suppress viral shedding, leading to immune cell persistence,,and bioavailability of, and adherence to, aciclovir in the suppressive therapy trials were also cited as potential issues.New, more effective interventions could hold more promise for translating an effect on HSV-2 infection or shedding and disease into gains for the reduction of HIV incidence.

The landscape for HIV prevention and treatment has transformed in the past decade, with expanded availability of HIV prevention interventions such as antiretroviral treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and voluntary medical male circumcision.However, no intervention used alone is likely to be sufficient to achieve global goals to end the HIV epidemic, especially given challenges in uptake and adherence. Hence, combination measures are needed.A potential indirect effect of interventions against HSV-2 on HIV incidence will need to be evaluated in the context of existing HIV prevention interventions and for new interventions against HSV-2, particularly HSV-2 vaccines.Our estimates suggest that HSV-2 prevention measures could be an important additional tool in the fight against HIV.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing recurrence—suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir is effective in preventing recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions and is preferred for patients with severe or frequent recurrences or who want to minimize recurrences (AI). Suppressive therapy for HSV may be continued indefinitely, without regard to improved CD4 count, with the need for continued therapy addressed on an annual basis, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII). Persons starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3 have an increased risk of HSV-2 shedding and genital ulcer disease (GUD) in the first 6 months on ART; suppressive acyclovir decreases the risk of GUD nearly 60%, and may be recommended for persons with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3 starting ART (BI). In persons with HIV not on ART, suppressive anti-HSV therapy decreases HIV RNA levels in plasma, anal, and genital secretions and lowers risk of HIV progression; however, antiviral regimens for herpes do not decrease risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners and should not be used in place of ART to delay HIV progression. In persons on ART, suppressive HSV antivirals do not delay HIV progression, improve CD4 recovery, or decrease markers of systemic inflammation and are not useful for these ends (AI).

Secondary prevention—adolescents and young adults with HIV and recurrent genital HSV: Adolescents and young adults with HIV who suffer severe, frequent, and/or troubling recurrent genital HSV infection will benefit from anti-HSV suppression therapy (strong; moderate). Placebo-controlled trials in adults with HIV who are receiving ART demonstrated that antiviral drugs for recurrent HSV disease reduced symptomatic recurrences by 60% to 75%, and chronic suppressive therapy also reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners without HIV by 25% to 75%; this is an option for patients with frequent, severe, or troubling HSV recurrences.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease prevention strategies in people with HIV—Prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to prevent primary HSV infection is not recommended (AIII). In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in people without HIV, but HSV-2 seronegative people with HIV on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF-containing ART, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in people with HIV. The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV have not been evaluated, and no vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners; however, medical male circumcision to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII).

Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs among persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even those with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. Certain persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of decreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^27df8ee8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Genital herpes—persons with HIV infection—recommended therapy for first-episode genital herpes is the same as for persons without HIV infection, and suppressive or episodic oral antivirals are effective; the risk for genital ulcer disease (GUD) increases during the first 6 months after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART), especially with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cell/mm3, and suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the risk for GUD and can be continued for 6 months after ART initiation; suppressive antiviral therapy among persons with HIV and HSV infection does not reduce the risk for either HIV transmission or HSV-2 transmission and does not delay HIV disease progression; for severe HIV disease, initiating acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours might be necessary; recommended daily suppression regimens include acyclovir 400–800 mg orally 2–3 times/day, famciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day, or valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day; recommended episodic regimens include acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5–10 days, famciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days, or valacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^77e34d7b]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV—HSV episodic versus suppressive therapy and agent selection—oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective, with valacyclovir and famciclovir offering dosing convenience. People with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy when symptomatic lesions occur or with daily suppressive therapy to prevent recurrences. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are all effective for suppressive and episodic therapy. Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, and famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir (only available topically); both have improved oral bioavailability and allow for decreased dosing frequency compared to acyclovir, making them preferred oral regimens for patient dosing convenience and adherence, if available. Episodic treatment for individual recurrences of genital ulcer disease does not influence the natural history of genital HSV-2 infection.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevention in people with HIV—condom effectiveness and per‑act risk estimates: A larger trial demonstrated a 26% reduction in HSV-2 genital infection with condom use, and a pooled analysis of 6 studies found condom use reduced HSV-2 acquisition by 30%, with the risk increasing steadily with each unprotected sex act; per sexual act odds were 3.6% when condoms were never used, 2.7% when sometimes used, and 0% when always used. Individuals with HIV should use latex condoms consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse, should specifically avoid sexual contact when herpetic lesions are evident, and condoms will not protect against orogenital transmission and infection transmitted prior to penetration.

### The management of herpes simplex virus infections [^8b50ba7d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus persists in a latent form for the life of its host, periodically reactivating and often resulting in significant psychosocial distress for the patient. Currently no cure is available. Antiviral therapy is the main treatment modality, used either orally, intravenously, or topically to prohibit further replication of the virus and thereby minimize cellular destruction. However, immunologic advances in the treatment and prevention of herpes simplex infections are promising and continue to be studied.

Asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes—when counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection; episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection; for patients with serologic evidence of HSV-2 without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences; among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied; and because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

Antiviral prophylaxis to prevent reactivation disease (herpes zoster)—adults with HIV: Long-term administration of anti-VZV drugs to individuals with HIV to prevent episodes of herpes zoster is not routinely recommended (AII). In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in Africa evaluating daily acyclovir prophylaxis (acyclovir 400 mg orally [PO] twice a day) in persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection who were not taking ART, acyclovir prophylaxis reduced the rate of herpes zoster by 62%. Acyclovir did not prevent recurrent zoster episodes in patients with prior history of herpes zoster, and patients on suppressive anti-herpes medications for other indications may receive some additional benefit, but the relative risk reduction in persons who are receiving ART is unknown.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^d60cc89c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent HSV-2 genital herpes—Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes, and intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs; antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions, and many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which decreases the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners. Suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent recurrences, and persons receiving such therapy often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less frequent recurrences, long-term safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, and quality of life is improved for many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment. Providers should discuss with patients on an annual basis whether they want to continue suppressive therapy because frequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time for many persons; however, neither treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events and development of HSV antiviral resistance related to long-term antiviral use are uncommon.

### Genital herpes [^4ca9fc9b]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Genital herpes is the main cause of genital ulcers worldwide; the prevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infections in the general population ranges from 10% to 60%. Most genital herpes is caused by HSV-2, although HSV-1 accounts for about half of new cases in developed countries. The risk of HIV acquisition is three times higher in people with HSV-2. Neonatal herpes is an uncommon but serious complication of genital herpes. Most genital HSV-2 infections are unrecognised and undiagnosed; infected individuals, even with mild symptoms, shed HSV, and can infect sexual partners. Since clinical diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, virological and type-specific serological tests should be used routinely. Oral antiviral drugs for HSV infections are safe and effective and can be used both to treat episodes and to prevent recurrences. Antiviral treatment of the infected partners and condom use reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HSV-2.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated herpes simplex virus (HSV) management—treating disease—Patients with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy when symptomatic lesions occur or with daily suppressive therapy to prevent recurrences, and acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective for suppressive and episodic therapy; valacyclovir is the prodrug of acyclovir, and has improved oral bioavailability, with decreased dosing frequency, compared to acyclovir. Patients with orolabial HSV lesions can be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 5 days to 10 days (AIII). First episodes of genital HSV should be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7 days to 10 days; recurrences can be treated for 5 to 10 days (AI). Severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions respond best to initial treatment with intravenous (IV) acyclovir (AIII); once the lesions begin to regress, patients can be switched to oral antiviral therapy and therapy should be continued until the lesions have completely healed. When deciding on suppressive therapy for genital HSV-2 infection in persons with HIV and HSV-2 coinfection, factors to consider include the frequency and severity of HSV recurrences and risk for genital ulcer disease (GUD) when initiating ART, and episodic treatment for individual recurrences of GUD does not influence the natural history of genital HSV-2 infection.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) exposure prevention in people with HIV—Consistent condom use reduces HSV-2 acquisition in heterosexual couples and should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII), and although evidence in men who have sex with men is lacking, consistent condom use should be encouraged (AIII). In heterosexual HIV-negative but HSV-2-serodifferent couples, disclosure of HSV-2 status is associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 transmission. Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding, and people with HIV should avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or orolabial herpetic lesions (AII). In people without HIV, valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduced HSV-2 transmission by 48%, but among people seropositive for HSV-2 and HIV-1 not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir at 400 mg twice daily did not prevent transmission. Suppressive anti-HSV therapy used only for the purpose of preventing HSV-2 transmission to seronegative partners can be considered as part of a shared-decision-making conversation with applicable patients and partners particularly if there is a history of genital ulcer disease (BIII), and patients should be made aware that this strategy may be of modest benefit in preventing transmission (BIII). There are no data available regarding the use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission.

### Predicting the potential individual-and population-level effects of imperfect herpes simplex virus type 2 vaccines [^4cb50082]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 in the United States has increased dramatically since the 1970s. Vaccines are being developed to control the epidemic. We determined the potential public health impact that imperfect, preexposure HSV-2 vaccines could have on reducing the incidence of infection.

Methods

We modeled the future impact of preexposure vaccines with both prophylactic and therapeutic properties. We predicted the individual-level (cumulative number of new infections prevented per 1000 vaccinated individuals) and population-level (cumulative percentage reduction in new infections) impact.

Results

We show that the percentage reduction in incidence of infection would be relatively modest. However, HSV-2 incidence rates are extremely high; thus, we calculate that even imperfect vaccines would prevent >1 million infections in the United States within a decade after introduction. We found that vaccines would prevent 3 times as many infections per vaccinated person in a high-prevalence epidemic than in a moderate-prevalence epidemic. We also identified the vaccine characteristics that have the greatest impact on reducing the incidence of infection. We determined that vaccine take and degree of protection against infection are equally important, whereas therapeutic characteristics are unimportant.

Conclusions

Designing preexposure HSV-2 vaccines with therapeutic characteristics will have little impact on reducing the incidence of infection. HSV-2 vaccines will have a substantially greater public health impact in developing than in developed countries.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV—disease prevention: Prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to prevent primary HSV infection is not recommended (AIII). In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in persons without HIV, but HSV-2 seronegative persons with HIV on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF containing ART regimens, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in persons with HIV infection. The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV has not been evaluated, and no vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision (MMC) decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners; however, MMC to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII).

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^741f0d2d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

We report that the pooled adjusted risk of HIV acquisition after incident HSV-2 infection is almost five times the risk without HSV-2 infection and almost twice the risk associated with exposure to prevalent HSV-2 infection. These findings provide a strong indication for a biological effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV, because the frequency and severity of genital ulceration, viral shedding, and associated inflammation in the genital tract are highest in new HSV-2 infections and tend to decrease with time after infection. The association was higher among general populations than among higher-risk populations. Study-level adjustment for confounders was often incomplete, but did not meaningfully affect the association when comparing crude and adjusted pooled estimates. Heterogeneity across study estimates was moderate. We extended previous reviews through detailed assessment of heterogeneity using meta-regression and sub-pooling and through extensive assessment of potential biases. We found limited evidence of publication bias.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our results provide evidence in support of a direct effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition, which is strengthened by our finding of significantly higher HIV risk associated with incident HSV-2 infection than with prevalent HSV-2 infection. At the population level, new interventions targeting HSV-2, such as new vaccines or microbicides, could have an additional indirect benefit on HIV as a consequence of the interactions between HIV and HSV-2. Such synergies could greatly enhance the effect of combination prevention for HIV infection, particularly in settings with high HIV prevalence. The magnitude of this public health benefit now needs to be carefully estimated for different settings by use of mathematical models informed by the most recent evidence of the associations between HSV and HIV.

Development of multipurpose prevention products that could protect against multiple STIs (eg, topical microbicides and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis) would provide exciting opportunities to simultaneously reduce the burden of disease of more than one infection.Quantifying the effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition has important public health implications, particularly in high-prevalence settings where co-infection is common, because prevention of HSV-2 infection (with single-purpose or multipurpose prevention tools) might indirectly prevent HIV infection. Although trials of use of daily suppressive antiviral therapy against HSV-2 have not shown reduced risk of HIV acquisition or transmission,,,perhaps because agents were not used at sufficient doses or for sufficient duration, new vaccines against HSV-2 that are currently under developmentcould hold more promise for HIV prevention.

### Herpes simplex virus and HIV-1: deciphering viral synergy [^8211db77]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Recent proof-of-concept randomised controlled trials have shown a causal relation between herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infection and HIV-1 replication in co-infected individuals. We explore the mechanisms that may operate to enhance reciprocal viral replication. Direct interactions could involve HIV-1-related immune deficiency, disruption of mucosal barrier by HSV infection/reactivation, HSV-induced mucosal cell recruitment, transactivation of HIV-1 replication by HSV proteins, and immune modulation by HSV decoys. Indirect interactions might coexist through disturbances of the vaginal flora during HSV shedding and systemic immune activation. In co-infected individuals, suppressive HSV treatment reduces HIV-1 genital and systemic excretion. This finding is a likely result of efficacious prevention of HSV2 reactivations, and perhaps of other herpesviruses. Strategies to control HSV2 and other herpesviruses deserve urgent attention and should become part of the HIV-1 prevention and care package.

HIV-associated HSV—considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART)—Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### Acyclovir: a new use for an old drug [^c48e9fad]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) are responsible for two epidemics and that, by overlapping in risk populations, they reinforce the spreading of both HIV-1 disease and genital herpes. Randomized controlled trials have investigated whether acyclovir (ACV), a synthetic drug designed to suppress herpes viruses, might provide an inexpensive and safe way to drastically reduce HIV-1 spreading around the world. The controversial results of these trials are reviewed below in light of the recent discovery of the direct suppression of HIV-1 by ACV.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that although ACV therapy does not prevent HIV-1 transmission, it decreases plasma, genital, rectal, and seminal HIV-1 RNA levels. The decrease of HIV-1 load has been believed to be the result of an indirect mechanism and explained by reduction of HSV-2-mediated inflammation. The discovery of the direct inhibitory activity of ACV on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase brings new insights into the interpretation of these results. Also, it is important to understand why HSV-2-suppressive therapy with ACV did not reduce HIV-1 acquisition/transmission.

Summary

The direct suppression of HIV-1 by ACV activated by coinfecting HSV-2 may in part explain the ACV-induced decrease of HIV load reported in several clinical trials. If this is the case, other herpes viruses capable of ACV activation may contribute to this effect. New basic studies and new targeted clinical trials are needed to understand whether ACV therapy can also be beneficial for HSV-2-negative patients. These studies will show whether ACV therapy should be included in HIV-1 treatment as well as whether ACV-based drugs specifically targeting HIV-1 can be developed.

Pregnancy with HIV/HSV coinfection—maternal management and delivery: Transmission of HSV to fetuses and neonates can occur, but the likelihood is low, and effective ART regimens may decrease, but not prevent, maternal genital HSV shedding and recurrence of genital lesions. In women who do not have HIV, use of acyclovir or valacyclovir near term suppresses genital HSV outbreaks and shedding and reduces the need for cesarean delivery for recurrent HSV, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends suppressive antiviral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks of gestation. The safety and efficacy of this strategy have not been evaluated in women with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection, there is not sufficient data to base a specific recommendation regarding this strategy, and neonatal HSV disease can occur despite maternal suppressive therapy. Elective cesarean delivery, preferably before rupture of membranes, is recommended for all women, both those with and without HIV, who have active genital HSV lesions at the onset of labor.

### Oral antiviral therapy for prevention of genital herpes outbreaks in immunocompetent and nonpregnant patients [^e81e3f79]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or 2 (HSV-2). Some infected people experience outbreaks of genital herpes, typically, characterized by vesicular and erosive localized painful genital lesions.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of three oral antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir) prescribed to suppress genital herpes outbreaks in non-pregnant patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and pharmaceutical company databases up to February 2014. We also searched US Food and Drug Administration databases and proceedings of seven congresses to a maximum of 10 years. We contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We selected parallel-group and cross-over randomized controlled trials including patients with recurrent genital herpes caused by HSV, whatever the type (HSV-1, HSV-2, or undetermined), with at least four recurrences per year (trials concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients or pregnant women were not eligible) and comparing suppressive oral antiviral treatment with oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir versus placebo or another suppressive oral antiviral treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected eligible trials and extracted data. The Risk of bias tool was used to assess risk of bias. Treatment effect was measured by the risk ratio (RR) of having at least one genital herpes recurrence. Pooled RRs were derived by conventional pairwise meta-analyses. A network meta-analysis allowed for estimation of all possible two-by-two comparisons between antiviral drugs.

Main Results

A total of 26 trials (among which six had a cross-over design) were included. Among the 6950 randomly assigned participants, 54% (range 0 to 100%) were female, mean age was 35 years (range 26 to 45.1), and the mean number of recurrences per year was 11 (range 6.3 to 17.8). Duration of treatment was two to 12 months. Risk of bias was considered high for half of the studies and unclear for the other half. A total of 14 trials compared acyclovir versus placebo, four trials compared valacyclovir versus placebo and 2 trials compared valacyclovir versus no treatment. Three trials compared famciclovir versus placebo. Two trials compared valacyclovir versus famciclovir and one trial compared acyclovir versus valacyclovir versus placebo.We analyzed data from 22 trials for the outcome: risk of having at least one clinical recurrence. We could not obtain the outcome data for four trials. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a low quality evidence that the risk of having at least one clinical recurrence was reduced with acyclovir (nine parallel-group trials, n = 2049; pooled RR 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.58), valacyclovir (four trials, n = 1788; pooled RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69), or famciclovir (two trials, n = 732; pooled RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64). The six cross-over trials showed larger treatment effects on average than the parallel-group trials. We found evidence of a small-study effect for acyclovir placebo-controlled trials (adjusted pooled RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75). In analyzing parallel-group trials by daily dose, no clear evidence was found of a dose-response relationship for any drug. In head-to-head trials, the risk of having at least one recurrence was increased with valacyclovir rather than acyclovir (one trial, n = 1345; RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.34) and was not significantly different from that seen with famciclovir as compared with valacyclovir (one trial, n = 320; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.63).We included 16 parallel-arm trials in a network meta-analysis and we were unable to determine which of the drugs was most effective in reducing the risk of at least one clinical recurrence (after adjustment for small-study effects, pooled RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11 for valacyclovir vs acyclovir; pooled RR 1.04, 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.49 for famciclovir vs acyclovir; and pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.75 for famciclovir vs valacyclovir). Safety data were sought but were reported as total numbers of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Owing to risk of bias and inconsistency, there is low quality evidence that suppressive antiviral therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir in pacients experiencing at least four recurrences of genital herpes per year decreases the number of pacients with at least one recurrence as compared with placebo. Network meta-analysis of the few direct comparisons and the indirect comparisons did not show superiority of one drug over another.

HIV-associated HSV—monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS)—Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are occasionally associated with nausea or headache. No laboratory monitoring is needed for patients receiving episodic or suppressive HSV therapy unless they have advanced renal impairment. For patients receiving high-dose IV acyclovir, monitoring of renal function and dose adjustment as necessary are recommended at initiation of treatment and once or twice weekly for the duration of treatment. HSV-2 shedding and genital ulcer disease (GUD) can increase in the first 6 months after initiation of ART, particularly in those with low CD4 counts, and mucocutaneous lesions that are atypical and occasionally recalcitrant to therapy have been reported in individuals initiating ART and have been attributed to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

### Standard-dose and high-dose daily antiviral therapy for short episodes of genital HSV-2 reactivation: three randomised, open-label, cross-over trials [^9e68b2c3]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Skin and mucosal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) shedding predominantly occurs in short subclinical episodes. We assessed whether standard-dose or high-dose antiviral therapy reduces the frequency of such shedding.

Methods

HSV-2-seropositive, HIV-seronegative people were enrolled at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic (WA, USA). We did three separate but complementary open-label cross-over studies comparing no medication with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (standard-dose aciclovir), valaciclovir 500 mg daily (standard-dose valaciclovir) with aciclovir 800 mg three times daily (high-dose aciclovir), and standard-dose valaciclovir with valaciclovir 1 g three times daily (high-dose valaciclovir). The allocation sequence was generated by a random number generator. Study drugs were supplied in identical, numbered, sealed boxes. Study periods lasted 4-7 weeks, separated by 1 week wash-out. Participants collected genital swabs four times daily for quantitative HSV DNA PCR. Clinical data were masked from laboratory personnel. The primary endpoint was within-person comparison of shedding rate in each study group. Analysis was per protocol. The trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00362297, NCT00723229, NCT01346475).

Results

Of 113 participants randomised, 90 were eligible for analysis of the primary endpoint. Participants collected 23605 swabs; 1272 (5·4%) were HSV-positive. The frequency of HSV shedding was significantly higher in the no medication group (n=384, 18·1% of swabs) than in the standard-dose aciclovir group (25, 1·2%; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·05, 95% CI 0·03-0·08). High-dose aciclovir was associated with less shedding than standard-dose valaciclovir (198 [4·2%] vs 209 [4·5%]; IRR 0·79, 95% CI 0·63-1·00). Shedding was less frequent in the high-dose valaciclovir group than in the standard-dose valaciclovir group (164 [3·3%] vs 292 [5·8%]; 0·54, 0·44-0·66). The number of episodes per person-year did not differ significantly for standard-dose valaciclovir (22·6) versus high-dose aciclovir (20·2; p=0·54), and standard-dose valaciclovir (14·9) versus high-dose valaciclovir (16·5; p=0·34), but did for no medication (28·7) and standard-dose aciclovir (10·0; p=0·001). Median episode duration was longer for no medication than for standard-dose aciclovir (13 h vs 7 h; p=0·01) and for standard-dose valaciclovir than for high-dose valaciclovir (10 h vs 7 h; p=0·03), but did not differ significantly between standard-dose valaciclovir and high-dose aciclovir (8 h vs 8 h; p=0·23). Likewise, maximum log(10) copies of HSV detected per mL was higher for no medication than for standard dose aciclovir (3·3 vs 2·9; p=0·02), and for standard-dose valaciclovir than for high-dose valaciclovir (2·5 vs 3·0; p=0·001), but no significant difference was recorded for standard-dose valaciclovir versus high-dose aciclovir (2·7 vs 2·8; p=0·66). 80% of episodes were subclinical in all study groups. Except for a higher frequency of headaches with high-dose valaciclovir (n=13, 30%) than with other regimens, all regimens were well tolerated.

Interpretation

Short bursts of subclinical genital HSV reactivation are frequent, even during high-dose antiherpes therapy, and probably account for continued transmission of HSV during suppressive antiviral therapy. More potent antiviral therapy is needed to eliminate HSV transmission.

Funding

NIH. Valaciclovir was provided for trial 3 for free by GlaxoSmithKline.

### Antiviral agents [^35f97b0b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2001). Low credibility.

The potential severity of many viral infections and the lack of appropriate treatment for these diseases have been a source of endless frustration and helplessness for clinicians. The newly developed field of antiviral therapy is expanding at an astounding rate, with new discoveries each day. Although physicians are not yet able to cure many of the viral infections, such as HSV, HIV, and CMV, a means of controlling them is available. It is hoped that the research and investigations currently under way will lead to a future era of antiviral drugs that will be able to eradicate these diseases.

Asymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, if needed) should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection.
For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with combination testing if needed) without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

HSV-1 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection.
Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences.
For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. Suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.

For persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection (see Genital Herpes During Pregnancy).

Management of Sex Partners

The sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

### Generating protective immunity against genital herpes [^468abdac]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is an incurable, chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Not only does genital herpes cause painful, recurrent symptoms, it is also a significant risk factor for the acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections such as HIV-1. Antiviral drugs are used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, but they cannot stop viral shedding and transmission. Thus, developing a vaccine that can prevent or clear infection will be crucial in limiting the spread of disease. In this review we outline recent studies that improve our understanding of host responses against HSV infection, discuss past clinical vaccine trials, and highlight new strategies for vaccine design against genital herpes.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1b16d96b]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Primary prevention of HSV in sexually active adolescents and young adults with HIV—condoms should be used to prevent HSV in adolescents and young adults with HIV (strong; low), and the data regarding the level of protection are very limited for individuals with HIV and for youth. Male condoms are effective in preventing many sexually transmitted diseases, and a large observational trial showed a 26% reduction in HSV-2 genital infection with condom use, while a pooled analysis of 6 studies found a 30% lower risk of HSV-2 acquisition compared with no condom use. Patients with HIV should use latex condoms consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of acquiring HSV and to protect sexual partners.

### Does valacyclovir each day keep HSV-2 away?-AAFP (...) [^338d1b71]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 has been demonstrated from both symptomatic and asymptomatic reactivations in the infected partner. Daily antiviral therapy has been shown to decrease the frequency and amount of genital HSV shedding. Corey and colleagues tested daily valacyclovir for efficacy in preventing sexual transmission of HSV-2 from infected persons to their uninfected partners. The infected source partner of each enrolled couple was randomized to receive valacyclovir in a dosage of 500 mg or placebo taken once daily for eight months. All couples were encouraged at each follow-up visit to use condoms. The medication dose was increased to twice daily for five days during any HSV-2 reactivation episode. A total of 1, 159 couples were able to complete the entire eight-month protocol, with similar dropout rates in the active treatment and placebo groups.

The number of source partners reporting at least one symptomatic genital recurrence during the study also was cut by about one half with use of daily valacyclovir. Four cases of HSV-1 transmission occurred in couples in which placebo was used, with no such cases in couples randomized to active treatment. In a subgroup of 89 couples who submitted genital swabs daily for two months, HSV-2 DNA was detected on 2. 9 percent of days in source partners taking valacyclovir, compared with
10. 8 percent of days when placebo was taken. The authors conclude that daily valacyclovir halves the transmission rate of HSV-2 to an uninfected partner over an eight-month period. editor’s note: This study confirms the substantial protective benefits of daily viral suppression that have been reported in other trials of anti-herpes therapy. Whether the absolute risk reduction of 1.

7 percent is worth the burden of taking daily medication for eight months is in the eye of the beholder. During this study, 66 monogamous couples dissolved their relationships. Perhaps the best use of viral suppression might be early in a relationship, when the long-term viability of the union is less clear, yet the risk for transmission is present on the many days when viral shedding occurs. —b. z.

Special considerations regarding antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in people with HIV and HSV: Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision to start ART in people with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected people, particularly in those with low CD4 counts, and in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes are often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### Oral antivirals for preventing recurrent herpes simplex keratitis in people with corneal grafts [^332c6be7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ocular herpes is a viral infection of the eye caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), a double-stranded DNA virus. Corneal scarring caused by herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is the leading infectious cause of penetrating corneal graft in high-income countries. Acyclovir is an antiviral drug known to have a protective effect against recurrences in herpetic eye disease. While there are some studies which have evaluated the effects of intervention with oral antiviral in preventing such recurrences in people with corneal grafts, a systematic review of all comparative clinical trials has not been previously undertaken.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of oral antivirals such as acyclovir in any dosage when taken for six months or more, in preventing recurrence of herpetic keratitis in people having corneal graft surgery for herpetic keratitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 1 June 2016. We handsearched conference proceedings and contacted authors of the included studies and researchers active in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). People enrolled in these trials had corneal grafts for HSK. The intervention was oral antivirals for six months or more following the corneal graft surgery, and this was compared to no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted trial investigators for any clarification or missing information. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included three trials, involving 126 participants, comparing the use of oral acyclovir to no treatment or placebo. Two studies were conducted in single centres in Turkey and the USA, and one was multi-centred in the Netherlands. In general, the studies were poorly reported and it was difficult to judge the extent to which bias had been avoided.Oral acyclovir may reduce the risk of recurrence of herpetic keratitis (risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.64, 126 people, low-certainty evidence). Based on data from the included trials, this corresponds to approximately 23 fewer cases of HSK recurrence (95% CI 29 fewer cases to 12 fewer cases) per 100 corneal graft operations if oral acyclovir is used.Oral acyclovir may reduce the risk of graft failure (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.97, 126 people, low-certainty evidence). Based on data from the included trials, this corresponds to approximately 13 fewer cases of graft failure (95% CI 18 fewer cases to 1 fewer cases) per 100 corneal graft operations if oral acyclovir is used.None of the studies reported any serious side effects of the antivirals necessitating stoppage or change. None of the trials reported outcomes over the long term (more than two years) or any data on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to placebo or to no treatment, oral antiviral (acyclovir) may reduce the risk of recurrence of herpetic keratitis in the first 12 months in eyes that have undergone corneal graft surgery.

Genital Herpes Management

Antiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic patients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for use of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection are to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences and improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent transmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the natural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal transmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also integral to clinical management.

Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug is discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three FDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit for genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (–). Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has enhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for less frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high oral bioavailability. Topical therapy with antiviral drugs offers minimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.

First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes

Newly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged clinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic involvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have mild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or prolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, all patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive antiviral therapy.

Recommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes*
Acyclovir † 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days
or
Famciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days
or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days
* Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.
† Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of the frequency of dosing.

### Acyclovir and transmission of HIV-1 from persons infected with HIV-1 and HSV-2 [^a128320c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most persons who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are also infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which is frequently reactivated and is associated with increased plasma and genital levels of HIV-1. Therapy to suppress HSV-2 reduces the frequency of reactivation of HSV-2 as well as HIV-1 levels, suggesting that suppression of HSV-2 may reduce the risk of transmission of HIV-1.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of suppressive therapy for HSV-2 (acyclovir at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily) in couples in which only one of the partners was seropositive for HIV-1 (CD4 count, > or = 250 cells per cubic millimeter) and that partner was also infected with HSV-2 and was not taking antiretroviral therapy at the time of enrollment. The primary end point was transmission of HIV-1 to the partner who was not initially infected with HIV-1; linkage of transmissions was assessed by means of genetic sequencing of viruses.

Results

A total of 3408 couples were enrolled at 14 sites in Africa. Of the partners who were infected with HIV-1, 68% were women, and the baseline median CD4 count was 462 cells per cubic millimeter. Of 132 HIV-1 seroconversions that occurred after randomization (an incidence of 2.7 per 100 person-years), 84 were linked within couples by viral sequencing: 41 in the acyclovir group and 43 in the placebo group (hazard ratio with acyclovir, 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.41; P=0.69). Suppression with acyclovir reduced the mean plasma concentration of HIV-1 by 0.25 log(10) copies per milliliter (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.29; P<0.001) and the occurrence of HSV-2-positive genital ulcers by 73% (risk ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.36; P<0.001). A total of 92% of the partners infected with HIV-1 and 84% of the partners not infected with HIV-1 remained in the study for 24 months. The level of adherence to the dispensed study drug was 96%. No serious adverse events related to acyclovir were observed.

Conclusions

Daily acyclovir therapy did not reduce the risk of transmission of HIV-1, despite a reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of 0.25 log(10) copies per milliliter and a 73% reduction in the occurrence of genital ulcers due to HSV-2. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00194519.)

BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

HSV-2 control measures

A total of 58 studies were identified to address HSV-2 control measures, the most common study location being sub-Saharan Africa (n=24, 41%). The most frequently studied topic area was the use of antiviral therapy (n=27, 47%), followed by condom use (n=12, 21%), vaccine trials (n=10, 17%), microbicide use (n=6, 10%) and male circumcision (n=3, <1%). They encompassed a range of study designs including randomised control trials (n=26, 45%), literature reviews (n=13, 22%), laboratory studies (n=10, 17%), systematic reviews with meta-analyses (n=5, 9%) and cohort or cross-sectional studies (n=3, <1%).

Suppressive therapy

Six articles including a multiregion randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) among HSV-2-seropositive MSM and women in sub-Saharan Africa and South America found that suppressive therapy (400 mg twice daily aciclovir) reduced HSV-2 shedding and transmission rates.For example, Fuchs et al reported a 63% reduction in the frequency of genital ulcers with detectable HSV-2 and a 47% reduction in the rate of GUD recurrence overall.Analogous results were seen among male and female participants living with HIV.RCTs based in South and West Africa reported evidence to suggest that suppressive aciclovir may also be efficacious in reducing HIV shedding and disease progression.However, the results of further East African trials disputed this by showing no significant difference in genital and plasma HIV RNA between the control and intervention (suppressive aciclovir) armsand that suppressive aciclovir had no impact on the incidence/acquisition of HIV in HSV-2-seropositive women.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2: epidemiology and management options in developing countries [^03e2c239]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) is highly prevalent worldwide and an increasingly important cause of genital ulcer disease (GUD). Continued HSV2 transmission is facilitated by the large number of undiagnosed cases, the frequency of atypical disease and the occurrence of asymptomatic shedding. The lack of easy, affordable diagnostic methods and specific antiviral treatment in countries with low and middle income is of great concern, given the ability of GUD to enhance HIV transmission and acquisition. With rising HSV2 prevalence contributing to an increase in the proportion of GUD attributed to genital herpes in high-HIV prevalence settings, a safe and effective HSV vaccine is urgently needed. Meanwhile, multifaceted interventions are required to improve recognition of genital herpes, to prevent its spread and also to prevent its potential to promote HIV transmission in developing countries.

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions

Allergic and other adverse reactions to oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are rare. Desensitization to acyclovir has been described.

HIV Infection

Immunocompromised patients can have prolonged or severe episodes of genital, perianal, or oral herpes. Lesions caused by HSV are common among persons with HIV infection and might be severe, painful, and atypical. HSV shedding is increased among persons with HIV infection. Whereas ART reduces the severity and frequency of symptomatic genital herpes, frequent subclinical shedding still occurs. Clinical manifestations of genital herpes might worsen during immune reconstitution early after initiation of ART. HSV-2 type-specific serologic testing can be considered for persons with HIV infection during their initial evaluation, particularly among those with a history of genital symptoms indicative of HSV infection.

Recommended therapy for first-episode genital herpes is the same as for persons without HIV infection, although treatment courses might need to be extended for lesion resolution. Suppressive or episodic therapy with oral antiviral agents is effective in decreasing the clinical manifestations of HSV infection among persons with HIV. The risk for GUD increases during the first 6 months after starting ART, especially among persons who have a CD4 + T-cell count <200 cell/mm 3. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the risk for GUD among this population and can be continued for 6 months after ART initiation when the risk for GUD returns to baseline levels. Suppressive antiviral therapy among persons with HIV and HSV infection does not reduce the risk for either HIV transmission or HSV-2 transmission to susceptible sex partners. Suppressive antiviral therapy does not delay HIV disease progression and is not associated with decreased risk for HIV-related inflammation among persons taking ART. For severe HSV disease, initiating therapy with acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours might be necessary.

Recommended Regimens for Daily Suppression of Genital Herpes Among Persons with HIV Infection
Acyclovir 400–800 mg orally 2–3 times/day
or
Famciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day
or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day
Recommended Regimens for Episodic Genital Herpes Infection Among Persons with HIV Infection
Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5–10 days
or
Famciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days
or

### Summary measures of adherence using pill counts in two HIV prevention trials: the need for standardisation in reporting [^558236d6]. AIDS and Behavior (2013). Low credibility.

For trials of user-dependent HIV prevention products, accurate adherence measurements are essential to interpret and compare results across trials. We used pill count data from two recent HIV prevention trials of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) suppression, to show that estimates of adherence vary substantially depending on assumptions that are made in analysing pill count data. We associate calculated adherence with biological markers of anti-HSV-2 activity. In both trials, calculated adherence varied considerably, depending on the summary measure used, and the handling of intervals with apparent ‘over-adherence’ (fewer pills returned than expected), and unreturned pills. Intervals of apparent over-adherence were associated with reduced antiviral effects on biological markers of herpes reactivation, indicating these are likely to represent periods of non-adherence. Our results demonstrate the clear need for standardisation in reporting of adherence data that are based on pill counts.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^e127d862]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) epidemiology in adults and adolescents with HIV—Among people aged 14 to 49 years in the United States as of 2016, HSV-1 seroprevalence is 47.8% and HSV-2 seroprevalence is 11.9%. HSV-1 has become an increasing cause of first-episode genital herpes, causing up to 42% of infections in young adult heterosexual women and 76% in young adult men who have sex with men in Sydney, Australia between 1992 to 2006. In one study early in the HIV epidemic, approximately 60% of people with HIV were HSV-2 seropositive and 96% were seropositive for either HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition two- to threefold, and in HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected people not taking effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HSV-2 reactivation and shedding is increased and HSV-2 reactivation is associated with increased HIV RNA levels in plasma and genital secretions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV—exposure prevention and transmission reduction: Persons with HIV who are HSV-2 seronegative should consider partner testing using HSV type-specific serology before initiating sexual activity because disclosure in heterosexual HIV-negative, HSV-2-discordant couples was associated with reduced risk of transmission of HSV-2 (BIII), and consistent use of latex condoms reduced HSV-2 acquisition and should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding, and persons with HIV should specifically avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or oral labial herpetic lesions (AII). In HSV-2 seropositive persons with symptomatic genital herpes but not HIV, suppressive antiviral therapy such as valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible heterosexual partners by 48%, but in HIV-1/HSV-2-seropositive persons not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir 400 mg twice daily did not prevent HSV-2 transmission to HSV-2 seronegative partners; suppressive anti-HSV therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners is not recommended for persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection who are not on ART (AII), and there are no data available regarding use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission.

Episodic therapy

A total of four studies investigated the effect of episodic aciclovir therapy on HSV-2 (and HIV in some instances).Episodic therapy was defined as a 5-day course of aciclovir, and the dose varied between studies from a total of 1.2 g to 1.6 g per day. Ulcer healing was the primary outcome for all four studies. Three of the four studies reported reduced ulcer duration with the use of episodic therapy, although a modest difference was reported by Baeten et al.On the contrary, Phiri et al reported no significant difference in ulcer healing with the use of aciclovir; however, this study used a relatively long duration of 14 days to assess for the presence of ulcers.HIV indicators were described as secondary outcomes in three of these studies.Reduced HIV shedding from ulcers was reported by all three studies on day 7; however, no study found a significant reduction in cervicovaginal or plasma HIV RNA.

A limited number of studies (n=2) were found to evaluate the extent of HSV-2 resistance to antivirals in LMICs and the clinical benefit of early drug initiation following the onset of an ulcer lesion.Two studies evaluated the effect of ART in reducing HSV-2 shedding in dually infected people, with both reporting a reduction in HSV-2 shedding and acquisition, respectively.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^80d44b1c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the association between HSV-2 infection and subsequent HIV acquisition have been done: one in 2002and the other in 2006(the one in 2006 was briefly updated in an editorial). These reviews reported a two to three times increase in the risk of HIV infection with baseline prevalent HSV-2 infection;,estimates of the association tended to be lower for high-risk populations than for low-risk populations. Here we update and substantially augment these reviews to modernise our understanding of the interaction between HSV-2 infection and HIV, in line with the pace of advancing prevention efforts against HSV-2 and HIV.

HSV suppressive therapy dosing in people with HIV—valacyclovir, acyclovir, and famciclovir: Valacyclovir can be given at 500 mg twice daily (AI), 500 mg once daily (CIII), or 1,000 mg once daily (CIII) for suppression; the 500-mg daily dose is less likely to be effective in people with 10 or more recurrences per year, and 500 mg twice daily is the only dose specifically studied in people with HIV; 1,000 mg daily can be considered in people with HIV with more recurrences per year. Oral acyclovir 400 mg twice a day and oral famciclovir 250 mg twice a day are also acceptable options for suppressive therapy (AI), and suppressive therapy for HSV may be continued indefinitely with the need for continued therapy addressed at least annually, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII).

Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent recurrences (–). Persons receiving such therapy often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less frequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Quality of life is improved for many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment. Providers should discuss with patients on an annual basis whether they want to continue suppressive therapy because frequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time for many persons. However, neither treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events and development of HSV antiviral resistance related to long-term antiviral use are uncommon.

Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2 transmission for discordant heterosexual couples in which a partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection. Such couples should be encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic genital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used by those who have multiple partners. HSV-2 seropositive persons without a history of symptomatic genital herpes have a 50% decreased risk for genital shedding, compared with those with symptomatic genital herpes. No data are available regarding efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing HSV-2 transmission among discordant couples in which a partner has a history of asymptomatic HSV-2 infection identified by a positive HSV-2 serologic test. Among HSV-2 seropositive persons without HIV infection, oral TDF/FTC and intravaginal tenofovir are ineffective at reducing the risk for HSV-2 shedding or recurrences.

Recommended Regimens for Suppression of Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes
Acyclovir 400 mg orally 2 times/day
or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally once a day *
or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally once a day
or
Famciclovir 250 mg orally 2 times/day
* Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other valacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent recurrences (i.e. ≥10 episodes/year).

Famciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of viral shedding. Ease of administration and cost also are key considerations for prolonged treatment.

### A meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of oral antiviral treatment to prevent genital herpes outbreaks [^cb73348f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Efficacy of oral antiviral therapies, ie, acyclovir, valacyclovir (VACV), and famciclovir, for suppression of recurrent genital herpes was studied at different doses and regimens.

Objective

We sought to compare the clinical efficacies of the different oral antiviral drugs prescribed prophylactically to suppress recurrent genital herpes.

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles on genital herpes and selected antiviral drugs. The selected trials were: parallel randomized clinical trials testing prophylactic oral antiviral treatment of genital herpes versus placebo in immunocompetent and nonpregnant patients.

Results

Fourteen randomized clinical trials were selected, including a total of 6158 patients. The global relative risk of developing at least one recurrence during the study was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval 45%-49%) in antiviral drug groups compared with the placebo. The best evaluated regimens, with comparable efficacies, were given twice daily, ie, acyclovir (400 mg twice daily), VACV (250 mg twice daily), and famciclovir (250 mg twice daily), or once daily (VACV 500 mg).

Limitations

The only end point available for all the studies was the number of patients presenting at least one recurrence of genital herpes during the observation period.

Conclusion

The results of this first meta-analysis confirmed the high clinical efficacy of oral acyclovir, VACV, or famciclovir for prophylaxis against recurrent genital herpes.

Recurrent HSV-1 genital herpes—recurrences are less frequent after the first episode of HSV-1 genital herpes, compared with genital HSV-2 genital herpes, and genital shedding rapidly decreases during the first year of infection; no data are available regarding the efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission among persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection; because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences through shared clinical decision-making between the patient and the provider.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease epidemiology—among persons aged 14 to 49 years in the United States, the HSV-1 seroprevalence is 47.8% and the HSV-2 seroprevalence is 11.9%, and in the past decade HSV-1 has become an increasing cause of first-episode genital herpes, causing up to 70% of infections in some populations such as young adult women and men who have sex with men. In people with HIV, approximately 70% are HSV-2 seropositive and 95% are seropositive for either HSV-1 or HSV-2, and HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition two- to threefold with reactivation increasing HIV RNA levels in blood and genital secretions.

### 20 years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing WHO priorities for research in HSV-2 / HIV interactions, HSV-2 control and mathematical modelling [^832dfbd5]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

HSV-2/HIV interactions

There was a relative lack of studies assessing the effect of HSV-2 on HIV shedding that included HIV transmission as an outcome measure. While in the past years, this paucity would have shaped future priority setting, addressing this research gap with the current knowledge of U=U (HIV undetectable = untransmittable) would be unethical.This exemplifies the importance of reviewing research priorities in dynamic research fields where new knowledge can significantly alter the landscape.

HSV-2 control measures

Further research on HSV-2 control measures involving young adults, particularly women, as an increased HSV-2 prevalence rate was noted in this age stratum.
Further assessment of microbicide candidates as many of them showed promising initial results. Further focus to be placed on evaluating the microbicide effect in terms of preventing HSV-2 infection in HSV-2 discordant couples.
Although few studies reported encouraging results for either HSV-2 vaccination type in laboratory-based studies in developed countries, no research of this nature was identified based in developing countries. Therefore, further HSV-2 vaccine research is needed in LMICs. The public health gains of a successful vaccine, given the high rates of acquisition in adolescence (e.g in Africa), could be substantial.

HSV-2 mathematical modelling

Further research modelling the impact of HSV-2 vaccination on HSV-2 and HIV indicators which better reflects disease burden
Further studies to model the cost-effectiveness of proposed interventions to better inform future programmes
Further research modelling the risk of antiviral resistance, since an increasing number of LMICs are incorporating aciclovir into the syndromic management algorithm for GUD

### Update on the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases [^405a57b8]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published updated guidelines that provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Patient education is the first important step in reducing the number of persons who engage in risky sexual behaviors. Information on STD prevention should be individualized on the basis of the patient's stage of development and understanding of sexual issues. Other preventive strategies include administering the hepatitis B vaccine series to unimmunized patients who present for STD evaluation and administering hepatitis A vaccine to illegal drug users and men who have sex with men. The CDC recommends against using any form of nonoxynol 9 for STD prevention. New treatment strategies include avoiding the use of quinolone therapy in patients who contract gonorrhea in California or Hawaii. Testing for cure is not necessary if chlamydial infection is treated with a first-line antibiotic (azithromycin or doxycycline). However, all women should be retested three to four months after treatment for chlamydial infection, because of the high incidence of reinfection. Testing for herpes simplex virus serotype is advised in patients with genital infection, because recurrent infection is less likely with the type 1 serotype than with the type 2 serotype. The CDC guidelines also include new information on the treatment of diseases characterized by vaginal discharge.
