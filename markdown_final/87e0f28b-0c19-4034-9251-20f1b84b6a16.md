## Question

10 cm tumor ovarian in 70 years with vessels and puntiforme calcificarions could be benign?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 10 cm ovarian mass in a 70-year-old woman with internal vessels and punctate calcifications could be benign, and how to interpret and manage these findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how size and menopausal status shift malignancy risk. Then, I should verify what "internal vessels" imply on Doppler and whether that is a malignant feature. Next, I will examine the significance of punctate calcifications and whether they favor benign or malignant pathology. After that, I should integrate these findings into validated risk models like IOTA/O-RADS and consider tumor markers. Finally, I will outline guideline-based next steps, including when to refer and what imaging to obtain, and I will double-check for any exceptions or mimics that could alter management.

> Let me first confirm the risk implications of size and menopausal status. A 10 cm adnexal mass in a postmenopausal woman is inherently high risk; multiple guidelines list cyst size greater than 10 cm as a malignancy risk factor, and postmenopausal status itself increases baseline risk substantially compared with premenopausal patients, so I should not downplay this just because the mass is unilocular or partially cystic [^114A1niT] [^113drueq].

> Wait, let me verify what "internal vessels" means on ultrasound. I initially thought "internal vessels" might simply reflect a richly vascular solid component, but hold on, I should be precise: the presence of blood flow within solid tissue or papillary projections — especially central or strong Doppler flow — is a malignant feature in IOTA and O-RADS frameworks, whereas benign lesions more often show peripheral or minimal flow. So "internal vessels" in a solid component pushes the risk upward rather than downward [^115KHVXL] [^115CV3LX] [^111862Eq].

> I will now examine the calcifications. Punctate calcifications can be seen in both benign and malignant ovarian tumors, so I need to check the context. In serous epithelial tumors, psammomatous calcifications are common and can be seen in borderline and low-grade serous carcinomas; however, calcifications also occur in benign entities such as Brenner tumors and mature cystic teratomas, and in papillary projections of benign cystadenofibromas, sometimes with posterior acoustic shadowing that favors benignity; thus, calcifications alone are not sufficient to assign benignity in a 10 cm postmenopausal mass [^115EikxT] [^117TjZNA] [^1158T5bJ] [^113hVR8x].

> Next, I should review how these features integrate into validated risk models. Let me consider IOTA Simple Rules and O-RADS: a 10 cm mass exceeds the benign size thresholds, the presence of solid components with internal vascularity maps to malignant features, and punctate calcifications do not provide a benign override in this context. Therefore, this lesion would be classified as probably malignant by IOTA/O-RADS logic, with a high likelihood of falling into O-RADS 4–5 where observed malignancy frequencies are around 26–77% in surgical cohorts, far above the threshold for conservative management [^115KHVXL] [^112roHUM] [^112MBKyL].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of tumor markers. In a 70-year-old with a complex adnexal mass, CA-125 is appropriate to obtain. While a normal CA-125 does not exclude malignancy, an elevated value in this setting further increases concern and should prompt gynecologic oncology referral rather than reassurance, so I need to ensure CA-125 is measured and interpreted alongside imaging rather than in isolation [^116cgYbn] [^113467ZT] [^112JH8rs].

> Let me think about guideline-based next steps. I should confirm that both ACOG and SOGC recommend urgent referral to gynecologic oncology for postmenopausal patients with complex masses that have solid components, papillary projections, irregular multilocular solid morphology, or strong Doppler flow; given the size, internal vascular solid elements, and patient age, this profile meets multiple referral triggers, so direct referral is indicated rather than surveillance [^115CV3LX] [^116cgYbn].

> I should double-check staging workup before surgery. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest imaging when indicated, are recommended to assess disease extent and surgical resectability; this aligns with ASCO/SGO and NCCN guidance for suspected ovarian cancer and helps surgical planning and counseling about the likelihood of optimal cytoreduction [^112uDdF5] [^116wbPBt].

> But wait, what if this is a benign mimic? Brenner tumors can be solid with punctate calcifications and may grow large, and mature cystic teratomas have characteristic calcifications. However, in a 10 cm postmenopausal mass with internal vascular solid components, the pretest probability remains high enough that malignancy must be assumed until proven otherwise, and management should proceed as for suspected ovarian cancer with gynecologic oncology involvement rather than expectant management [^117TjZNA] [^112NVE7N] [^112GLH4F].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am clear: yes, a 10 cm ovarian mass in a 70-year-old with internal vascular solid components and punctate calcifications can theoretically be benign, but the aggregate risk is high and the balance of evidence strongly favors malignancy. Therefore, the appropriate course is urgent gynecologic oncology referral, CA-125 testing, and cross-sectional staging imaging, with surgical management planned to achieve optimal cytoreduction if cancer is confirmed [^115FYzco] [^112GLH4F] [^112uDdF5].

A 10 cm ovarian mass in a 70-year-old with internal vessels and punctate calcifications is **unlikely to be benign** [^113drueq] because size > 10 cm, solid components with vascularity, and calcifications are all concerning features [^115KHVXL] [^115EikxT]. While calcifications alone can be seen in benign lesions (e.g. Brenner tumor, teratoma) [^117TjZNA] [^116gxHBz], the combination of large size, solid vascular components, and calcifications in a postmenopausal patient **raises the risk of malignancy** [^116AaMto] [^112GLH4F]. Definitive diagnosis requires surgical removal and histopathology; **do not rely on imaging alone** [^114MyYuL].

---

## Imaging features and their implications

### Size of the mass

A diameter > 10 cm is a **high-risk feature** [^113drueq] and increases the likelihood of malignancy in postmenopausal women [^notfound]. Larger masses are more likely to harbor solid, vascular, or irregular components that further elevate risk [^116AaMto].

---

### Presence of internal vessels (vascularity)

Internal vascularity within solid components is a **strong predictor of malignancy** [^115KHVXL]. Malignant ovarian tumors often exhibit neovascularization, characterized by increased blood flow within solid areas [^111862Eq]. Benign lesions typically lack significant internal vascularity, although exceptions exist [^115KHVXL].

---

### Punctate calcifications

Calcifications alone are **not specific** and can occur in both benign and malignant ovarian tumors [^117TjZNA]. Benign tumors such as Brenner tumors and mature cystic teratomas may show calcifications [^117TjZNA] [^116gxHBz]. Malignant tumors, particularly serous carcinomas, may also exhibit calcifications, often associated with psammoma bodies [^115EikxT] [^1118oh6n].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Given the clinical scenario, the **differential diagnosis** includes:

| **Benign tumors** | **Malignant tumors** |
|-|-|
| Brenner tumor | Serous carcinoma |
| Mature cystic teratoma | Mucinous carcinoma |
| Fibroma | Endometrioid carcinoma |
| Thecoma | Clear cell carcinoma |
| Cystadenoma | Metastatic carcinoma |

---

## Risk of malignancy

The combination of large size (> 10 cm), internal vascularity, and calcifications in a postmenopausal patient **significantly increases the risk of malignancy** [^112GLH4F]. While exact risk percentages vary, these features collectively place the patient in a high-risk category, necessitating surgical evaluation and histopathological confirmation [^11484NCg].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

Given the concerning imaging features, the following **diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Surgical exploration**: Laparotomy or laparoscopy with removal of the mass and histopathological examination is essential for definitive diagnosis [^11484NCg].

- **Preoperative imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to assess extent of disease, peritoneal involvement, and metastasis [^112uDdF5].

- **Tumor markers**: CA-125, HE4, and other relevant markers may aid in risk assessment but are not definitive [^113467ZT].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A 10 cm ovarian mass with internal vessels and punctate calcifications in a 70-year-old patient is **unlikely to be benign** [^113drueq]. The combination of large size, internal vascularity, and calcifications significantly increases the risk of malignancy [^115KHVXL] [^115EikxT]. Surgical removal with histopathological analysis is **essential** for definitive diagnosis and management [^114MyYuL].

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasonography-based risk models in differentiating between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in a US cohort [^114Wh9Z4]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

To further investigate and compare the models' ability to stratify patients into risk groups, we discretized the ADNEX continuous personalized risk of malignancy into ordinal categories comparable to the O-RADS scores. This resulted in a reduced overall ADNEX performance (AUC = 0.93), which was similar to the O-RADS performance (AUC = 0.92). Furthermore, the findings suggest that both models effectively stratified patients into the risk categories, with observed malignant tumor frequencies consistent with the targeted range. Indeed, a recent study found comparable performance using O-RADS (version 1) and the ADNEX 2-step strategy (combined with IOTA benign descriptors as the first step) when discretized by the O-RADS risk groups. However, in both that study and ours, the 95% CI for an O-RADS score of 2 was greater than the targeted 1% using the ADNEX or the O-RADS model to stratify patients into the risk groups. The comparable performance of the models is not surprising because O-RADS is based on IOTA phase 1 to 3 studies (including almost 6000 patients). While a simple risk score stratification system modeled after previous cancer classifications (eg, breast mass classification, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) is clinically desirable and could be easily adopted by nonspecialists, adnexal masses are heterogeneous. The normal ovary and fallopian tubes have a multiplicity of different cell typesthat can give rise to benign, borderline, and malignant tumors; the World Health Organization ovary classification lists more than 70 tumor types. Therefore, a personalized risk assessment that allows a more tailored approach may be better suited to adnexal mass evaluations.

### Evaluation and management of ultrasonographically detected ovarian tumors in asymptomatic women [^117FwUyg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Data from screening trials indicate that a significant percent of asymptomatic women older than 50 years of age will develop ovarian abnormalities that are detectable by ultrasonography. Most of these abnormalities are benign, and many will resolve spontaneously. However, the risk of ovarian cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, is of concern. The goal is to use a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that will reliably detect ovarian cancer at the earliest possible stage while limiting the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease. The combination of morphology indexing and serum biomarker analysis can accurately predict the risk of malignancy in most ovarian tumors. Ovarian tumors with cystic or septate morphology are at minimal risk of malignancy and can be followed with serial ultrasonography evaluations, thereby avoiding the morbidity and cost of surgery. Complex or solid ovarian tumors with a high morphology index score, or those with increasing biomarker production, are at a high risk of malignancy, and patients with these tumors should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation and treatment.

### A case report of mesenteric mucinous cystoadenoma with review of the literature [^115V3GUV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 52 year-old woman came to Hospital complaining a vague feeling of heaviness in right lower quadrant in the last few months. The woman had had two pregnancies and the anamnesis did not put into evidence any pathologically relevant note.

The medical examination revealed a deep palpable mass in the abdomen; blood tests were normal, except for the modest raising of the ALT equal to 65 U/Ls (normal range 7–41), CEA equal to 13.58 (normal range: 0.0–4.6), and of the CA 19.9 equal to 43.55 (normal range 0.0–37).

Transvaginal ultrasound features of the mass showed an egg-shaped cystic mass of nearly 14 cm in diameter, uniloculated, with liquid content, and thickened walls with foci of calcification. Colonoscopy revealed compression of terminal ileum and right colon with normal mucosa. The lump was deeply located in the right lower quadrant, in anatomical relationship with ileum, and causing the compression of the right ureter; the ovaries and the female reproductive system were normal. The patient did not undergo abdominal or pelvic computed tomography, since both of them were considered to be unnecessary by the surgeon.

The surgical intervention allowed the removal of the retroperitoneal mass with terminal ileum, right colon, right ovarian vessels and right ureter, which were embedded in the mass. The continuity of the right ureter was guaranteed with a "double J" prosthesis uretero-ureteroanastomosis. Intraoperative examination excluded neoplastic involvement of the resected right ureter.

A mass of 10,5 cm of major diameter was entirely embedded in the mesentery, from which it was easily removed except for an area of firm adhesion to surrounding connective tissue corresponding to terminal ileum, the external surface was smooth and the cut-up showed a cystic lesion with smooth internal surface, containing mucinous whitish fluid (fig. 1).

The wall and the mucosa of both small and large bowel and the right ureter appeared grossly uninvolved by the lesion.

### Logistic regression model to distinguish between the benign and malignant adnexal mass before surgery: a multicenter study by the international ovarian tumor analysis group [^1121eTRc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To collect data for the development of a more universally useful logistic regression model to distinguish between a malignant and benign adnexal tumor before surgery.

Patients and Methods

Patients had at least one persistent mass. More than 50 clinical and sonographic end points were defined and recorded for analysis. The outcome measure was the histologic classification of excised tissues as malignant or benign.

Results

Data from 1,066 patients recruited from nine European centers were included in the analysis; 800 patients (75%) had benign tumors and 266 (25%) had malignant tumors. The most useful independent prognostic variables for the logistic regression model were as follows: (1) personal history of ovarian cancer, (2) hormonal therapy, (3) age, (4) maximum diameter of lesion, (5) pain, (6) ascites, (7) blood flow within a solid papillary projection, (8) presence of an entirely solid tumor, (9) maximal diameter of solid component, (10) irregular internal cyst walls, (11) acoustic shadows, and (12) a color score of intratumoral blood flow. The model containing all 12 variables (M1) gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 for the development data set (n = 754 patients). The corresponding value for the test data set (n = 312 patients) was 0.94; and a probability cutoff value of .10 gave a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 76%.

Conclusion

Because the model was constructed from multicenter data, it is more likely to be generally applicable. The effectiveness of the model will be tested prospectively at different centers.

### Sonographic features of ovarian cystadenofibromas: spectrum of findings [^11169DJ8]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the sonographic characteristics of ovarian cystadenofibromas.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 23 ovarian tumors histopathologically confirmed as ovarian cystadenofibromas that were preoperatively evaluated by transvaginal color Doppler sonography.

Results

In all cases the mass was predominantly cystic. Septations appeared in 30.4% of the tumors. Papillary projections or solid nodules appeared in 56.5% of the cases. The most frequent appearance was a unilocular complex cystic mass. In 47.8% of the tumors, vascularization was detected, having a typical pattern of peripheral vascularization with scattered vessels of high blood flow impedance.

Conclusions

We have described the sonographic spectrum of findings of ovarian cystadenofibromas. The most frequent appearance was a unilocular cystic mass with gross papillary projections or solid nodules. In almost half of the tumors, vascularization could be detected.

### MR imaging of ovarian masses: classification and differential diagnosis [^1144p5Bi]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Compared with 1.5 T, the increased signal-to-noise ratio and improved background suppression at 3 T may allow better categorization of variable components (fluid, blood, lipid, etc.). In addition, in the study of complex adnexal masses, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is especially effective for increasing the conspicuity of findings that are predictive of malignancy. Owing to its higher diagnostic performance, 3 T MRIs categorize and characterize the primary adnexal lesions well, and could be regarded as a reliable non-invasive modality method for distinguishing malignancies from benign tumours, though histological examination is needed to determine the final diagnosis.

### CT and MR in peritoneal malignancies: pearls and pitfalls at preoperative examination [^117RQcct]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal implants: radiological findings

The imaging findings of PM on CT and MRI vary depending on the specific histologic subtypes of the primary tumor. Peritoneal implants most commonly appear as solid lesions characterized by soft-tissue plaques, nodules, or masses with variable enhancement on CT images. A multiparametric imaging approach could be suggested, considering the variable PC findings.

In general, different patterns of lesions have been identified. In case of low burden of disease, it is more likely to have the following patterns:
Cystic metastases are generally derived from primary mucinous carcinomas or primary peritoneal malignancies (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Benign peritoneum mesothelioma in a 61-year-old woman. A CT porta-venous phase, axial plane showed cystic implants in the right and left iliac fossa (white arrows), confirmed in MRI T2w (B, black arrows) and DWI (b = 800 mm²/s) (C, white arrows)
Micronodular pattern: indicating the presence of peritoneal implants less than 5 mm in diameter, affecting the peritoneum and the mesenteric fat (Fig. 3). Infiltration of the small bowel mesentery may produce characteristic stellate patterns, which consist of increased mesenteric fat attenuation and perivascular soft-tissue thickening caused by the infiltration of the perivascular bundles. Fig. 3 Colon adenocarcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis in a 74-year-old woman. A CT delayed phase, axial plane. Relevant diffuse implants with micronodular pattern in the left hypochondrium (arrowheads). MRI T2w and DWI (b = 800 mm²/s) (B, C) axial plane, no micronodular implants are visible
The nodular pattern is characterized by a nodular lesion greater than 5 mm in diameter that might be solid or cystic, depending on the primary tumor (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Colon adenocarcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis in an 81-year-old woman. CT portal-venous phase (A) and MRI T2w (B) demonstrated a nodular pattern in the left iliac fossa (arrowheads) and diffuse ascites (stars)
Calcification: manifesting as areas of hypointensity on MRI scans, both on T1 and T2-weighted sequences and regions of hyperattenuating on CT scan (Fig. 5). Calcified peritoneal implants may suggest a primary ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, a primary papillary mucinous carcinoma, or as a result of chemotherapy. Fig. 5 Mucinous colon cancer with peritoneal implants in a 57-year-old man. CT delayed phase (A) and MRI T2w (B) showed calcifications (arrowheads) within the mucinous implants

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to view the following ultrasound findings as increasing the risk of malignancy:

- cyst size > 10 cm

- papillary or solid components

- irregularity

- presence of ascites

- high color Doppler flow.

### Giant renal angiomyolipoma following ovarian stimulation therapy [^113x4hwH]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are benign tumors with higher prevalence in women. Female hormones have been shown to induce AML enlargement. This case refers to a 40-year-old woman with 4 left kidney AMLs, the larger ones with 1.0 and 1.3cm. Ten months after ovarian stimulation for egg harvesting, a computed tomography revealed an 18-cm AML with large-caliber vessels. Given her high risk of AML bleeding, the patient was submitted to selective arterial embolization, which turned out unsuccessful, supporting a plan of nephron-sparing surgery. Our case highlights the pro-growth effects of female hormones on AML, with particular emphasis to ovarian stimulation.

### Sonographic findings of an ovarian serous surface papillary borderline tumor [^117UVLwK]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Sonographic findings of a serous surface papillary borderline tumor of the ovary have rarely been reported in the English literature. Here, we describe a case of serous surface papillary borderline tumor, which was depicted on gray-scale and Doppler ultrasonography as smoothly lobulated and polypoid heterogeneous echoic bilateral adnexal masses encased or surrounded by what was presumed to be normal-appearing ovarian follicles with increased vascular flow.

### Practice bulletin no. 174: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^1162u5hU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to monitoring of ovarian cysts, general population, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining imaging monitoring in patients with simple cysts < 10 cm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound (obtained by an experienced specialist), even in postmenopausal patients, as these cysts are likely benign.

### The ultrasonography characteristics of borderline ovarian tumor subtypes [^113dSGHC]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Continuous efforts to standardize sonographic assessments, evaluate new imaging modifications and modalities, study novel biomarkers, and discern subtle differences between tumor subtypes will improve preoperative diagnostic accuracy. Until accurate combined imaging techniques and biomarkers are developed and validated, sonographic pattern recognition by expert ultrasound examiners will continue to play a significant role in preoperative tumor assessments. This review sets out to summarize the main sonographic features of borderline ovarian tumors that are useful in clinical assessments by experts and discuss the pitfalls and challenges of their differential diagnosis.

### Borderline tumors of the ovary: CT and MRI features and tumor markers in differentiation from stage I disease [^114DtSx4]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe MDCT and MRI features and tumor marker levels that differentiate borderline ovarian tumors from stage I ovarian tumors.

Conclusion

Borderline ovarian tumors are complex masses with imaging features similar to stage I tumors. The thickness of septations and the size of solid components are significantly larger in stage I tumors, and these features may be helpful for predicting likelihood of invasive tumors. However, neither feature allows confident differentiation of borderline tumors from stage I disease.

### Can we preoperatively risk stratify ovarian masses for malignancy? [^113cYvNS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Given a 10% malignancy rate in pediatric ovarian masses, what preoperative factors are helpful in distinguishing those at higher risk to risk stratify accordingly?

Methods

After institutional review board approval (IRB#022008–095), a 15(1/2)-year retrospective review of operative ovarian cases was performed.

Results

A total of 424 patients were identified, with a mean age 12.5 years (range, 1 day to 19 years), without an age disparity between benign (12.54 years, 89%) and malignant (11.8 years, 11%) cases. The 1- to 8-year age group had the highest percentage of malignancies (22%; odds ratio [OR], 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–6.86). A chief complaint of mass or precocious puberty versus one of pain had an OR for malignancy of 4.84 and 5.67, respectively (95% CI, 2.48–9.45 and 1.60–20.30). Imaging of benign neoplasms had a mean size of 8 cm (range, 0.9–36 cm) compared with malignancies at 17.3 cm (6.2–50 cm, P < .001). An ovarian mass size of 8 cm or longer on preoperative imaging had an OR of 19.0 for malignancy (95% CI, 4.42–81.69). Ultrasound or computed tomographic findings of a solid mass, although infrequent, were most commonly associated with malignancy (33%-60%), compared with reads of heterogeneous (15%-21%) or cystic (4%-5%) lesions. The malignancies (n = 46) included germ cell (50%, n = 23), stromal (28%, n = 13), epithelial (17%, n = 8), and other (4%, n = 2). Tumor markers obtained in 71% of malignancies were elevated in only 54%, whereas 6.5% of those sent in benign cases were similarly elevated. Elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), alpha fetoprotein (alphaFP), and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) were significantly associated with malignancy (P < .02) and an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was not (P = 0.1880).

Conclusion

This reported series of pediatric ovarian masses demonstrates that preoperative indicators that best predict an ovarian malignancy are a complaint of a mass or precocious puberty, a mass exceeding 8 cm or a mass with solid imaging characteristics. Those patients aged 1 to 8 years have the greatest incidence of malignancy. Tumor markers, positive or negative, were not conclusive in all cases but useful for postoperative surveillance.

### Management of ovarian cancer: a 75-year-old woman who has completed treatment [^117Grbxr]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ovarian cancer includes primary tumors of epithelial, sex cord-stromal, or germ cell origin as well as metastatic tumors that frequently originate in the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 90% of ovarian cancer is epithelial in origin and constitutes a major therapeutic challenge because of its advanced stage of presentation in most patients. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most common cause of female cancer death in the United States, with approximately 1 in 70 women developing this disease in their lifetime. Several important advances in surgical and medical management of this disease have led to prolongation of survival and improvement of quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer. Using the case of Ms W, we discuss the signs, symptoms, risk factors, and prognostic factors of epithelial ovarian cancer; review the evidence for surgical and postoperative medical management; and present the current recommendations for screening and follow-up.

### Risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 centimeters in diameter [^115xkQte]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the natural history and to estimate the risk of malignancy of unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter followed conservatively by transvaginal ultrasound.

Methods

From 1987 to 2002, 15,106 asymptomatic women at least 50 years old entered the University of Kentucky's Ovarian Cancer Screening Program and underwent initial transvaginal ultrasonography. If the screen revealed nothing abnormal, women were asked to repeat transvaginal ultrasonography yearly. If the screen revealed abnormalities, transvaginal ultrasonography was repeated in 4 to 6 weeks, along with Doppler flow ultrasonography and CA 125 testing.

Results

Of the 15,106 women at least 50 years old, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with 3259 unilocular ovarian cysts. A total of 2261 (69.4%) of these cysts resolved spontaneously, 537 (16.5%) developed a septum, 189 (5.8%) developed a solid area, and 220 (6.8%) persisted as a unilocular lesion. During this time, 27 women received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and ten had been previously diagnosed with simple ovarian cysts. All ten of these women, however, developed another morphologic abnormality, experienced resolution of the cyst before developing cancer, or developed cancer in the contralateral ovary. No woman with an isolated unilocular cystic ovarian tumor has developed ovarian cancer in this population.

Conclusion

The risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter in women 50 years old or older is extremely low. The majority will resolve spontaneously and can be followed conservatively with serial transvaginal ultrasonography.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to tumor markers, BSGE/RCOG 2011 guidelines recommend to measure LDH, α-fetoprotein, and hCG levels in all < 40 years old patients with a complex ovarian mass because of the possibility of a germ cell tumor.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^111FV1jU]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Imaging — ultrasound-based evaluation and feature rules: Women who are postmenopausal with recurrent and persistent symptoms, even in the setting of a negative physical examination, require further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound) and referral to a higher-level center for further evaluation including a CT scan, and where resources allow, ultrasound-based imaging including a pelvic ultrasound is a general first step in the diagnostic evaluation. The diagnostic evaluation for an ovarian mass is most widely performed with a pelvic ultrasound; prospective studies from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis group have identified 10 characteristics of benign versus malignant ovarian mass, and evaluation of these features via pelvic ultrasound with the designation of benign, malignant, or inconclusive, in addition to clinical assessment, provides a general practitioner guidance for a referral to treatment; a mass is classified as probable malignant if at least one malignant feature and none of the benign features are present and vice versa, and if no benign or malignant features are present or if both benign and malignant features are present, then the rules are considered inconclusive (unclassifiable mass), and clinicians should use further clinical and diagnostic testing.

### Prospective validation of a standardized ultrasonography-based ovarian cancer risk assessment system [^112HCGCc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the performance of a system that standardizes ovarian cancer risk assessment and reporting on ultrasonography.

Methods

We conducted a prospective community-based cohort study of average-risk women undergoing ultrasonography in 2016 using a reporting system that requires adnexal masses to be categorized as 1, 2, 3, or X based on standardized ultrasound criteria including size, presence of solid components, and vascularity assessed by Doppler. With a median follow-up of 18 months, the risk of ovarian cancer or borderline tumor diagnosis for each category was determined.

Results

Among 43,606 women undergoing ultrasonography, 6,838 (16%) had an abnormal adnexal mass reported: 70% were category 1, 21% category 2, 3.7% category 3, and 5.4% category X. Among these women, 89 (1.3%) were subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 59 (0.9%) with borderline tumors. The risks of ovarian cancer diagnosis associated with masses reported as categories 1, 2, 3, and X were 0.2% (95% CI 0.05–0.3%), 1.3% (95% CI 0.7–1.9%), 6.0% (95% CI 3.0–8.9%), and 13.0% (95% CI 9.5–16.4%), respectively; risks of either ovarian cancer or borderline tumor were 0.4% (95% CI 0.2–0.6%), 2.3% (95% CI 1.6–3.1%), 10.4% (95% CI 6.6–14.1%), and 18.9% (95% CI 14.9–23.0%) respectively. Among 36,768 (84%) women with normal or benign adnexal findings reported, 38 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, for a risk of 0.1% (95% CI 0.07–0.14%).

Conclusion

In a community-based setting with low ovarian cancer prevalence, our standardized reporting system differentiated adnexal masses into four categories with distinct levels of risk with 9–10% of women having higher risk masses and 70% of women having masses associated with a risk of cancer similar to that of normal ultrasound findings. The system supports risk-based management by providing clinicians a more consistent assessment of risk based on ultrasound characteristics.

### CT imaging of peritoneal carcinomatosis with surgical correlation: a pictorial review [^112EFj4M]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Concerning the role of preoperative laparoscopy, conflicting views have appeared in the literature. A recent article concluded that both laparoscopy and CT are equally effective in the preoperative PC categorization.

Several concerning radiologic features may be associated with an increased incidence of incomplete cytoreduction; they may indicate either unresectability, or require complex resections that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Imaging findings associated with incomplete cytoreduction include: extensive small bowel involvement, mesentery drawn together by tumor ("clumped bowel"), mesenteric or para-aortic lymphadenopathy, obstructed ureter, psoas muscle invasion, pelvic side wall invasion, involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament, presence of large amount of tumor in the gastrohepatic ligament and/or gastric outlet obstruction due to tumor encasing the antrum of the stomach.

Imaging findings and patterns of peritoneal carcinomatosis morphology of the peritoneal implants

Peritoneal implants are solid with heterogeneous enhancement in the vast majority of cases and may have the form of nodules, plaques or masses. Occasionally multiple tiny implants may be manifested as fat stranding. Miliary tiny implants covering the parietal peritoneum may be seen as thickening and enhancement of parietal peritoneum. Peritoneal implants may rarely be cystic, especially from mucinous carcinoma of the ovary or colon, thus mimicking loculated fluid. Calcifications of peritoneal implants are sometimes observed and suggest that the primary site is either serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma or gastric carcinoma (Fig. 2). Calcification may also occur as a consequence of chemotherapy.

Fig. 2

Ascites

Ascites is a common and early sign of PC and when present, it facilitates the detection of peritoneal deposits. Neoplastic ascites may be due to increased capillary permeability and fluid production or to obstructed lymphatic vessels and decreased absorption. Ascites can be either diffuse or loculated/ septated due to adhesions; the latter may present as a cystic lesion with mass effect.

Imaging findings of low-grade ovarian carcinoma

Ultrasound

Ultrasound is typically performed as the first-line modality for characterising ovarian lesions.

Imaging features used to predict malignancy include thick irregular walls (> 3 mm), papillary projections, and solid echogenic nodules, with flow on colour Doppler.

These findings, integrated with additional clinical features, such as menopausal status and CA-125 level, allow risk stratification of adnexal lesions into likely malignant or benign by calculating the risk of malignancy index.

The International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group developed the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model, which is a risk prediction model that involves three clinical and six ultrasound variables. This model can discriminate benign from malignant adnexal lesions with high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (71%). However, about 25% of adnexal masses stay sonographically indeterminate even when evaluated by sonographic experts.

It is known that the number of papillary projections and solid components increases from SBT to LGSC and to HGSC. On ultrasound, LGSC usually appears as a multilocular cystic lesion with a higher number of solid components when comparing to SBT and with a lower number of solid components when compared to HGSC (Fig. 3). Calcifications corresponding to psammoma bodies are common in LGSCs and can be identified on ultrasound. On the other hand, HGSC appears more frequently as a non-papillary solid mass with areas of cystic change, necrosis, and/or haemorrhage.

Fig. 3
Bilateral LGSC with SBT and peritoneal metastases in a 25-year-old female. Ultrasound images (a, d) reveal a complex mixed tumour with a multinodular aspect involving adnexal structures (arrow). There is fallopian tubes' dilatation with solid echogenic vegetations inside (arrowheads). Sagittal and axial T2-weighted MR images (b, c) demonstrate a bilateral adnexal mixed tumour, with an arborescent growing on the surface of both ovaries (arrows) associated with severe ascites. Axial b -1000 s/mm² diffusion-weighted image (e) and ADC map (f) show diffusion restriction in a perihepatic peritoneal metastasis (arrows)

Doppler ultrasound may also be useful since HGSC tends to be more vascularised than LGSC and SBT. In elastography, LGSC is usually stiffer and less elastic than an HGSC. This fact can be explained by the frequent presence of necrosis in HGSC.

### Characterization of papillary projections in benign versus borderline and malignant ovarian masses on conventional and color Doppler ultrasound [^1158T5bJ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate on endovaginal ultrasound the morphologic and color Doppler characteristics of papillary projections in benign compared with borderline and malignant epithelial stromal ovarian tumors.

Materials and Methods

A total of 283 women (mean age, 52 years; age range, 20–85 years) with 343 operated adnexal masses comprising 167 epithelial stromal tumors of the ovary with 76 tumors containing papillary projections at pathology were retrospectively studied on ultrasound. We systematically evaluated the topography of the papillary projections, the morphologic features of the largest papillary projection, and the presence or absence of color Doppler findings. All these findings were correlated with macroscopic and microscopic features.

Results

Ultrasound detected papillary projections in 78% of tumors. Papillary projections were disseminated in 33% of malignant, 20% of borderline, and 0% of benign tumors (p = 0.0049). The mean size of the papillary projections was 9.6, 15.7, and 35.3 mm in benign, borderline, and malignant tumors, respectively (p = 0.0007). An acute angle was present in 68% of benign tumors and an obtuse angle in 40% of borderline and 89% of malignant tumors (p = 0.0001). The surface was regular in 77% of benign tumors and irregular in 50% of borderline and 88% of malignant tumors (p = 0.0000). Calcifications were present only in benign tumors (18%). For papillary projections ≥ 10 mm, color flow was present in all malignant, in 86% of borderline, and absent in all benign tumors.

Conclusion

Association of morphologic and vascular ultrasound findings can highly suggest the diagnosis of benign or malignant papillary projection.

### Identifying the deceiver: the non-neoplastic mimickers of genital system neoplasms [^115birWx]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute presentation is the most common form. However, the clinical course may be prolonged in the late presentation and differential diagnosis may be difficult in these patients. This clinical course is typically seen in patients with intermittent ovarian torsion which may cause delayed diagnosis. In these patients, torsed and edematous ovary may mimic an ovarian mass and noninvasive diagnosis may be extremely difficult if not impossible (Fig. 30).

Fig. 30
Chronic ovarian torsion. A 42-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history presenting with progressively increasing blunt pelvic pain in the last two months. a US study demonstrated 6 cm mostly solid appearing mass (with central and peripheral cystic areas) (arrows) within the right adnexa. Axial plane postcontrast CT scan b confirmed the presence of the sonographically detected mass (arrows). Postsurgical pathological examination showed no evidence of malignant disease but confirmed chronic ovarian torsion

Intrauterine ovarian torsion may present as a complex heterogeneous cystic mass in the neonatal period and may cause a diagnostic confusion by mimicking neoplastic lesions such as teratomas. On US, fluid-debris level, internal septations, retracting clot, calcifications and solid areas may all be seen (Fig. 31). Doppler US may show internal vascularity in some patients and its presence cannot confidently rule out ovarian torsion. The diagnosis is mostly done after surgery. Histopathological examination may reveal autoamputation of the ovary, hemorrhagic infarcts, necrosis, dystrophic calcifications, and fibrotic tissue.

Fig. 31
Intrauterine ovarian torsion. 10-day-old newborn girl presented with a questionable abdominal mass detected by her parents. She was otherwise asymptomatic. Physical examination was unremarkable except for palpable pelvic mass. a, b Gray scale abdominal US images showed a right adnexal complex cystic mass containing internal echogenic debris (arrowheads). The lesion was mostly cystic with irregularly thickened walls, internal septations (arrow), and a solid component with scattered calcifications (asterisk). Surgical resection and subsequent histopathological examination revealed cystic lesions with internal hemorrhage. The thick walls of the lesion were found to be non-neoplastic and composed of widespread fibrosis, necrosis and dystrophic calcifications. Findings were considered consistent with in utero ovarian torsion. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged 6 days after the surgery

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^112RMSD9]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Secondary tumors of the peritoneum

Ovarian cancer

Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death due to gynecologic malignancy, and it usually presents at an advanced stage (III or IV) due to its vague clinical symptoms, such as mild abdominal pain or malaise. Peritoneal involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients at the initial diagnosis and it is favored by the particular anatomy of the ovaries, which are not covered by the peritoneum and present a single thin layer of surface epithelium. This lack of an anatomical barrier facilitates the seeding of malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity, especially in epithelial ovarian cancers.

Peritoneal spread secondary to ovarian cancer shows the typical appearance of peritoneal carcinomatosis on CT: ascites, stranding and nodularity of omental fat with an omental-cake appearance when it is confluent and prominent, mesenteric nodules and thickening and enhancement of peritoneal sheets (Fig. 11). Ascites is often significant causing abdominal distension, and it may be accompanied by malignant pleural effusion. Peritoneal deposits have variable appearances, from nodular to plaque-like or masses, and may contain psammomatous calcifications (Fig. 12). Pelvic MRI is the technique of choice for local staging of ovarian cancer due to its superior soft tissue contrast, which allows a better depiction of the local invasion of adjacent structures.

### Ultrasound and assessment of ovarian cancer risk [^113kSCLv]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the ultrasound characteristics of ovarian and adnexal masses and to discuss the prediction of the likelihood of ovarian cancer based on these characteristics and clinical parameters.

Conclusion

Ultrasound characteristics can be used to diagnose the classic-appearing nonneoplastic entities, benign neoplasms and malignancies. In cases in which the appearance of an ovarian mass is not classic, assignment of relative risk of malignancy using a multiparametric model is appropriate and beneficial for patient management.

### Ovarian hemangioma presenting with hyperandrogenism and endometrial cancer: a case report [^1172SAkF]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hemangiomas are very rare tumors of the ovary. Here, we report a case of a mixed capillary and cavernous ovarian hemangioma and endometrial carcinoma presenting with postmenopausal bleeding, male pattern receding frontal hairline, and high serum androgen and estradiol levels.

Case

A 70-year-old White female underwent laparotomy for endometrial carcinoma. Intraoperative frozen-section examination of the uterus revealed a 3.5 × 3 cm, grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with more than 50% myometrial invasion. The left ovary contained a 1.5 × 1 × 1 cm, well-circumscribed hemorrhagic nodule on the cut surface. Final histopathological examination of the small nodule demonstrated multiple, enlarged, blood-filled vascular channels lined by a single layer of flattened regular endothelial cells with no atypical features. Vascular spaces within the tumor were of different sizes, ranging from small to large, and were separated by connective tissue. The surrounding ovarian stroma was hyperplastic and contained clusters of luteinized stromal cells. Microscopy of the right ovary showed minimal stromal proliferation and no luteinization of the ovarian stroma.

Conclusion

This is the first case of an ovarian hemangioma synchronous with a well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma. Absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the endothelial cells of the hemangioma suggests that ovarian hemangiomas may occur independent of stimulation by estrogen and progesterone.

Computed tomography

Contrast-enhanced CT is the current imaging modality of choice for ovarian cancer staging and for treatment follow-up. It allows the detection of lymphadenopathy and peritoneal metastases with high diagnostic accuracy (89%).

The use of oral contrast is generally recommended to detect adnexal lesions and is also useful to distinguish peritoneal metastases from the fluid-filled bowel. Oral contrast is especially necessary in women with low body mass index or in premenopause, in whom ovaries might be difficult to detect. Generally, 1.5 L of diluted contrast or water is administered an hour before the study.

Nevertheless, the sensitivity of CT to detect peritoneal metastases depends on their size, and is low for metastases smaller than 1 cm (25–50%).

The use of intravenous contrast allows optimal characterisation of adnexal lesions architecture and identification of pelvic vascular structures. Solid components and papillary projections should be assessed on the venous phase (70–90 s) as they may be missed in the early phase.

LGSC can typically appears on CT as a large, complex, cystic mass with well-marginated septa, papillary projections, and solid components that may be found unilaterally or bilaterally (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7). The number and complexity of serous tumours on solid tissue correlate with malignancy risk.

### The ultrasonography characteristics of borderline ovarian tumor subtypes [^112a95p9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rarely, serous BOTs show exophytic tumor growth patterns on the ovarian surface with papillary surface projectionsthat are frequently associated with noninvasive peritoneal implants. On sonographic imaging, the exophytic pattern is described as a lobulated solid mass with a clear demarcation line between the tumor growth and the normal ovarian tissue. Microcysts and tiny calcifications may also be present. The solid tumors often show rich hierarchical vascular branching on Doppler imaging (i.e. Fireworks sign),(Figure 1G). This exophytic growth pattern may also be associated with low‐grade serous ovarian cancers (LGSC), thus further complicating the ability to differentiate between serous BOTs and low‐grade ovarian carcinomas preoperatively.

LGSC are primary invasive ovarian cancers of epithelial origin that account for < 5% of all ovarian carcinomas. They often arise in association with serous BOTs and are characterized by slow progression and chemotherapy resistance. The chief difference between a serous BOT and LGSC is that LGSC harbors stromal invasion, resulting in reduced overall survival. On sonographic evaluations (Figure 1, H and I), LGSCs often present as bilateral multilocular‐solid or irregular solid lesions with exophytic tumor growth. Papillary projections with varied amounts of vascular flow on Doppler imaging may be present in about one‐third of patients, and hyperechoic foci representing small calcifications are common findings,(Figure 1I). Notably, it is almost impossible to differentiate LGSC from high‐grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) by ultrasound.

### Ovarian malignant germ cell tumors: cellular classification and clinical and imaging features [^112XiyqR]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Ovarian malignant germ cell tumors (OMGCTs) are heterogeneous tumors that are derived from the primitive germ cells of the embryonic gonad. OMGCTs are rare, accounting for about 2.6% of all ovarian malignancies, and typically manifest in adolescence, usually with abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and elevated serum tumor marker levels, which may serve as an adjunct in the initial diagnosis, monitoring during therapy, and posttreatment surveillance. Dysgerminoma, the most common malignant germ cell tumor, usually manifests as a solid mass. Immature teratomas manifest as a solid mass with scattered foci of fat and calcifications. Yolk sac tumors usually manifest as a mixed solid and cystic mass. Capsular rupture or the bright dot sign, a result of increased vascularity and the formation of small vascular aneurysms, may be present. Embryonal carcinomas and polyembryomas rarely manifest in a pure form and are more commonly part of a mixed germ cell tumor. Some OMGCTs have characteristic features that allow a diagnosis to be confidently made, whereas others have nonspecific features, which make them difficult to diagnose. However, imaging features, the patient's age at presentation, and tumor markers may help establish a reasonable differential diagnosis. Malignant ovarian germ cell tumors spread in the same manner as epithelial ovarian neoplasms but are more likely to involve regional lymph nodes. Preoperative imaging may depict local extension, peritoneal disease, and distant metastases. Suspicious areas may be sampled during surgery. Because OMGCTs are almost always unilateral and are chemosensitive, fertility-sparing surgery is the standard of care.

### Predictors of ovarian malignancy in children: overcoming clinical barriers of ovarian preservation [^113PuYf3]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Ovarian preservation is desirable in girls with benign ovarian masses. We aimed to 1) identify clinical predictors of malignant ovarian masses, 2) investigate how often ovarian tissue is present to preserve in benign masses, and 3) identify factors associated with successful ovarian preservation.

Methods

Retrospective analysis (1997–2012) of girls age 1–18years with an ovarian mass managed operatively. Data on presenting symptoms, imaging, biochemical markers, treatment, outcome, and pathology were extracted.

Results

We identified 150 patients. Large mass size, solid components, and elevated tumor markers (AFP, βHCG, and/or LDH) were significantly predictive of malignancy. All masses < 10cm, predominantly cystic, and with negative tumor markers were benign. Masses with all three of these characteristics would decrease a 20% malignancy pretest probability to a posttest probability of 0.25%. Benign masses managed by oophorectomy contained normal ovarian tissue in 76% of the specimens. For benign masses, successful ovarian preservation was significantly associated with size < 10cm, predominantly cystic, laparoscopy, and absence of torsion or calcifications.

Conclusion

Ovarian masses that are < 10cm, primarily cystic, and have negative tumor markers are most likely benign. Viable ovarian tissue is frequently present in benign masses, so significant efforts should be made for ovarian preservation.

### Intravascular leiomyomatosis with cardiac extension, a case report [^113GNyc4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Report

Patient is a 42-year-old woman with a past medical history of uterine leiomyomas. She underwent several fertility treatments in her youth, including ovarian stimulation, hormonal therapies (GnRH agonist), and myomectomies (two were performed at ages 30 and 33 and measured 2 cm in diameter) overall; nevertheless, all failed. She got tired of doctors and treatments so she stopped going to follow-up visits.

In recent years, her leiomyomas had grown to a worrisome size, and in the last year, she began to experience heavy bleeding, frequent spotting, and anemia, so she went to her gynecologist.

On clinical examination, an otherwise healthy patient with no signs of right-sided heart failure symptoms, including swelling and shortness of breath, was encountered; her vital signs were normal however, on her lower abdomen, a palpable mass 10 × 10 cm mass was discovered, along with some mild discomfort in the lower abdomen and pelvis. No other masses or lymph nodes were found at that time. Due to this, complementary exams were needed, Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 11 mg/dl, EKG was normal and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 17.6 × 7.2 × 10.3 cm uterus. It had multiple soft tissue density fibroids with central calcifications, the largest one measured 4 × 5 × 2 cm and was in close contact to the parametrial vessels.

Upon reviewing the venous phase of the CT, we were surprised to discover that within the lumen of the right internal iliac vein, the right common iliac vein, and the inferior vena cava (IVC), there was a mass causing a heterogeneous filling defect that extended from the uterus into the right atrium. All other organs were normal at that time.

With these findings, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done, revealing that the 3 × 1.5 cm mass moved freely into the cardiac chambers without compromising the tricuspid valve or any other structure (Fig. 1 A and B). The mass reached the heart through the IVC; and moved freely with the cardiac cycle. (Fig. 1 C)

### Artificial neural network computer prediction of ovarian malignancy in women with adnexal masses [^112zmpPV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Assessment of the usefulness of a neural model to predict which ovarian tumors are malignant.

Method

Age, menopausal status, body mass index, grayscale and Doppler ultrasonographic features, as well as levels of specific markers (CA 125, tissue polypeptide specific antigen) were examined in 686 women with adnexal masses. The probability of malignancy was calculated using an artificial neural network software and the diagnostic efficiency of the received model was estimated using a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve.

Result

Of the 686 women, 431 (62.8%) had a benign and 255 (37.2%) had a malignant ovarian tumor. The significant malignancy predictors are age, menopausal status, maximum tumor diameter, internal wall structure of tumor, presence of septa and/or solid elements, tumor location, location of vessels, and blood flow indexes. The best network provided 96.0% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity. The area under the curve for the received model was 0.9716.

Conclusions

An artificial neural network model based on clinical and ultrasonographic data allows to calculate the probability of tumor malignancy.

### Imaging features of complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions: proposed algorithm for differential diagnosis [^113BUNzs]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions are broad-spectrum diseases, ranging from benign to malignant. This article describes the broad-spectrum and imaging features of complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions and illustrates an algorithmic approach to such lesions, focusing on the ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging features that allow one to hone the differential diagnosis. Multimodality imaging workup plays an important role in the characterization and differential diagnosis of these diseases. Also, knowledge of the clinical setting and imaging features for the spectrum of complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions can lead to appropriate management.

### Vascular atypia and irregularity on surface as signs of malignant adnexal mass: a complementary method of laparoscopic assessment [^112tstVh]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the risk of malignancy associated with the main macroscopic findings observed on adnexal masses during a laparoscopic approach.

Design

Prospective series of consecutive patients (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

Setting

Tertiary care university hospital.

Patients

One hundred fifteen patients were included. Ninety-eight had benign and 17 malignant adnexal masses.

Interventions

Diagnostic and operative laparoscopy.

Measurements and Main Results

Adnexal images were obtained during laparoscopy, recorded, and analyzed according to irregularity on surface, presence of atypical vessels, lobular form, absence of coral-like surface, implants, large-volume ascites, and cloudy or hemorrhagic ascites. A logistic regression was applied, and the independent findings associated with malignant disease were atypical vessels (OR 16.37; 95% CI 2.85–94.13; p < .01) and irregularity on tumor surface (OR 43.41; 95% CI 8.02–234.96; p < .05). In this way, 95% of the cases were correctly diagnosed.

Conclusions

Atypical vessels and irregularity on tumor surface were important criteria of malignancy during laparoscopic treatment of adnexal masses. The recognition of these features can be helpful in choosing the ideal surgical approach mainly when the preoperative evaluation is unsatisfactory.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^114A1niT]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO resource-stratified guideline — surgical debulking for stage III and IV ovarian cancer (Recommendation 2.2.1) specifies that the goal of surgical management is to perform optimal tumor cytoreduction, achieved by resecting all visible tumor to < 1 cm and ideally to no visible tumor (R0). There is evidence that leaving residual disease > 1 cm is associated with a reduced chance of cure and negatively affects survival. Because benefit diminishes with suboptimal cytoreduction, all patients benefit from a multidisciplinary team approach, and a skilled surgeon should use clinical and radiologic examinations to determine appropriateness of intervention with the intent to achieve complete surgical debulking with limited morbidity. Given the inherent complexity, surgeons skilled in oncologic surgery or trained gynecologic oncologists are best positioned to manage patients with stage III or IV disease.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasonography-based risk models in differentiating between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in a US cohort [^1123aVmS]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Figure 3.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves for the Diagnostic Performance of Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) and Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) Models Using Discrete Ordinal Categories

The O-RADS model classifies each lesion into 1 of 6 risk categories with a score of 0 to 5: 0 for incomplete evaluation and 1 for normal ovary including physiologic cyst; hence, the ROC curve analysis shown includes O-RADS risk scores of 2 to 5 (ordinal categories that correlate with 0%-100% risk of malignant tumor). Converting the ADNEX continuous personalized risk of malignant tumor (0%-100%) into discrete ordinal categories as defined by the O-RADS model (scores 2–5) resulted in a reduced overall diagnostic performance of the ADNEX model; the area under the curve (AUC) decreased from 0.96 to 0.93, which was similar to the O-RADS model performance (AUC, 0.92; p = 0.56).

For a binary comparison of all models (benign vs malignant), a uniform 10% risk threshold, (O-RADS score of 4–5) was used. The sensitivity and NPV of all models were above 91% and 98%, respectively (Table 1). The O-RADS model had the highest sensitivity (98.8%; 95% CI, 93.3%-100%). However, the specificity, PPV, and accuracy (percentage of correctly classified lesions) using the Simple Rules combined with expert evaluation were the highest (specificity: 91.9% [95% CI, 88.9%-94.3%]; PPV: 68.5% [95% CI, 59.0%-77.0%]; accuracy: 92.2% [95% CI, 89.5%-94.3%]), while they were the lowest for the O-RADS model (specificity: 74.4% [95% CI, 70.0%-78.5%]; PPV: 42.1% [95% CI, 35.0%-49.5%]; accuracy: 78.3% [95% CI, 74.4%-81.8%]) (Table 1 and eTable 9 in Supplement 1).

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasonography-based risk models in differentiating between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in a US cohort [^112roHUM]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Using the O-RADS model, the observed malignant tumor frequencies in O-RADS categories 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 0.4% (1 of 240), 0% (0 of 81), 26.2% (34 of 130), and 76.7% (46 of 60), respectively (eTables 5 and 8 in Supplement 1). The ROC curve analysis for the overall performance of O-RADS showed an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90–0.95) (Figure 2). At a 10% risk threshold (O-RADS categories 4–5), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 98.8% (95% CI, 93.3%-100%), 74.4% (95% CI, 70.0%-78.5%), 42.1% (95% CI, 35.0%-49.5%), and 99.7% (95% CI, 98.3%-100%), respectively (Table 1).

Comparison of Risk Models

The overall diagnostic performance of the ADNEX and O-RADS models was analyzed using the ROC curve analysis (Figure 2). However, the AUCs of continuous (ADNEX) and discrete ordinal (O-RADS) variables cannot be equally compared. Therefore, we discretized the ADNEX continuous risk into ordinal categories comparable to O-RADS scores of 2 to 5 (Figure 1). The overall performance of the ADNEX decreased from an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.98) to 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96), which is similar to the performance of the O-RADS (AUC, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95) (Figure 3). The observed malignant tumor frequencies using the ADNEX model to stratify patients into O-RADS categories 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 0% (0 of 75), 2.3% (7 of 303), 30.6% (22 of 72), and 85.2% (52 of 61), respectively, which were comparable to the observed malignant tumor frequencies using the O-RADS model (eTable 8 in Supplement 1).

### A new insight on exophytic serous borderline adnexal tumors: specific sonographic features [^113kA5VX]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize and compare the sonographic features of exophytic serous borderline ovarian tumors (ESBOT) with those of high-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary (HGSC).

Methods

Seven patients with histological diagnosis of ESBOT diagnosed between 2011 and 2019 and 10 consecutive cases of HGSC detected during 2019, both depicting an exophytic growth pattern, were identified retrospectively. The sonographic imaging of the masses was reassessed and characterized according to the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis terms.

Results

A unilateral irregular solid adnexal mass was demonstrated in all patients with ESBOT. The mass typically wrapped an apparently normal ovary, with a clear demarcation line depicted between them and it contained tiny cystic inclusions and calcifications. On color Doppler study of all the ESBOT cases, a unique vascular pattern could be demonstrated: an intratumoral vascular bundle originating from the ovarian vessels and supplying a rich radial blood flow to the tumor periphery. These characteristic morphological and color Doppler features could not be observed in any of the HGSC cases (P < .001). In 42.8% of the patients with ESBOT, additional unilocular-solid components (ipsilateral or contralateral) could be detected, whereas all the HGSC patients presented with a multilocular-solid tumor morphology (P < .001). The interface of the external mass border with the adjacent pelvic walls was regular in all the cases with ESBOT, whereas in 80% of HGSC patients, it was irregular, suggesting invasiveness (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

ESBOT can mimic HGSC. Our results suggest that ESBOT has specific B-mode and color Doppler features, enabling differentiation from HGSC and planning appropriate intervention.

### Ovarian masses: the value of acoustic shadowing on ultrasound examination [^114DTEvG]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Adnexal lesions are a common finding in women and pose a clinical challenge since ovarian cancer is a highly lethal disease. However, most adnexal masses are benign, benefiting from a more conservative approach. In preoperative assessment, transvaginal ultrasound plays a key role in evaluating morphologic features that correlate with the risk of malignancy. The acoustic shadow is the loss of echo behind sound-absorbing components, such as calcifications or fibrous tissues, which are predominantly found in benign lesions. However, recognizing the acoustic shadow is a difficult skill to master, and its usefulness may be underappreciated.

### Diagnostic performance of the ovarian-adnexal reporting and data system (O-RADS) ultrasound risk score in women in the United States [^112MBKyL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

When an adnexal lesion is discovered on pelvic ultrasonography, the goal of imaging is to assess if the lesion is benign or potentially malignant. Most adnexal lesions found on ultrasonography imaging are benign and can be classified as simple cysts, hemorrhagic cysts, endometriomas, and dermoids. The risk of malignancy in these lesions is extremely low. Lesions not meeting the criteria for 1 of these 4 classic benign lesions carry an increased risk of cancer. Multiple ultrasonography-based systems have been developed that use imaging features, such as solid tissue and vascularity, to risk stratify these lesions. Most recently, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data Systems (O-RADS) Committee was formed under the American College of Radiology (ACR), and this international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the O-RADS ultrasound (US) Risk Stratification and Management System. This system is based on the published lexicon of the O-RADS US working group and from data collected in the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) study phase 1 to phase 3 prospective studies and other studies differentiating benign from potentially malignant lesions. The estimates for malignant neoplasm in the O-RADS US Risk Score table are based on the calculated frequency of malignant neoplasm from women undergoing surgery for known adnexal lesions in the IOTA study (Figure 1). The ACR O-RADS US committee acknowledges the limitations of applying a risk score stratification system founded on a database that includes only surgically resected lesions, which may overestimate the risk of malignant neoplasm in other populations.

### MR imaging of ovarian masses: classification and differential diagnosis [^111862Eq]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging

Diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role in detection, characterization and staging of adnexal masses.

Ultrasound (US) is often the first imaging study performed in the evaluation of a suspected ovarian lesion because it's widely available, well accepted by patients, non-invasive and of low cost. A combination of greyscale and colour Doppler features, obtained with transabdominal and/or endovaginal scanning, allow for investigation of both morphological structure and vascular organization of the ovarian mass. Morphological features suggestive of malignancy include thickness (> 2–3 mm) and irregularity of walls and septa, the presence of solid areas and papillary projections, as well as other evidence of malignant activity, namely ascites, peritoneal nodules and metastatic lesions. Regarding the vascularization, colour Doppler study is able to demonstrate both the presence and the localization of new tumour blood vessel: a predominantly central blood flow is more often associated with malignancy, while a peripheral one is more typical of a benign lesion. In an ultrasound-indeterminate adnexal mass, Doppler ultrasound has shown a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 82% in diagnosing cancer. Wu et al. on a recent meta-analysis of ten independent studies, reported a high diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian masses. However, unless morphological and vascularity features clearly indicate a benign lesion, further assessment is mandatory. Levine et al. in a consensus statement (2009) for the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound, made recommendations about management of adnexal masses: "Adnexal masses in the physiologic range in terms of size and appearance in a woman of menstrual age or a simple adnexal cyst less than or equal to 1 cm in a postmenopausal woman are likely benign; these findings are almost always of no clinical importance in asymptomatic women and can be safely ignored".

### Benign brenner tumour of the ovary: CT and MRI features [^117TjZNA]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of benign Brenner tumours (BBT) of the ovary.

Material and Methods

This was a retrospective two-centre study comprising 35 female patients with a definitive diagnosis of BBT at histology in whom CT and/or MRI examinations had been performed. Two experienced radiologists reviewed the CT and MRI features of 39 ovarian BBT retrospectively with consensus reading. The morphological appearance and size of each tumour were recorded. The presence or absence of calcifications within the solid portion was noted at CT. The reviewed characteristics at MRI included qualitative assessment of the signal intensity of the solid portion on diffusion sequence and contrast enhancement, compared to that of the myometrium.

Results

CT and MRI images were available for 27 and 28 lesions, respectively. Sixteen patients had both CT and MRI examinations. BBT were unilateral in 89% of patients, and 49% of lesions were solid and 51% were mixed. Calcifications were depicted at CT in 70.4% of lesions. When present, the cystic portion was multilocular in 85% of cases and corresponded to a mucinous lesion in 74% of cases. Enhancement of the solid portion at MRI was inferior or equal to that of the myometrium in 89% of cases and signal on high b-values diffusion images was deemed low or moderate in 93% of cases.

Conclusion

The combined CT and MRI findings of a unilateral fibrous ovarian mass containing punctate calcifications often associated with a multilocular cyst suggest the diagnosis of ovarian BBT.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^11484NCg]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging

Women who are postmenopausal with recurrent and persistent symptoms, even in the setting of a negative physical examination, require further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound) and referral to a higher-level center for further evaluation including a CT scan. Upon completion of the history and physical examination, where resources allow, ultrasound-based imaging including a pelvic ultrasound is a general first step in the diagnostic evaluation.

The diagnostic evaluation for an ovarian mass is most widely performed with a pelvic ultrasound. Prospective studies from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis group have identified 10 characteristics of benign versus malignant ovarian mass that are highly accurate and reproducible for diagnosis of ovarian cancer (Table 4). Evaluation of these features via pelvic ultrasound with the designation of benign, malignant, or inconclusive, in addition to clinical assessment, provides a general practitioner guidance for a referral to treatment.

TABLE 4
International Ovarian Tumor Analysis Simple Rules

A mass is classified as probable malignant if at least one malignant feature and none of the benign features are present and vice versa. If no benign or malignant features are present or if both benign and malignant features are present, then the rules are considered inconclusive (unclassifiable mass), and clinicians should use further clinical and diagnostic testing.

The clinical presentation and imaging findings of both benign (eg, peritoneal tuberculosis) and other malignancies (eg, GI cancer) may be similar or mimic those of ovarian cancer. Patients in basic-resource settings, when feasible, should be referred to a higher-level care center with capacity for surgical and medical management of patients when there is a concern for malignancy, either of ovarian or other types. Consequently, a histopathologic diagnosis should be undertaken prior to definitive treatment, with referral for diagnosis if feasible. Histology or cytology diagnosis of EOC should be made by a certified pathologist. See the Special Commentary on pathology for further details.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^113Q1z2q]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The main imaging feature of PMP on CT is a high-volume loculated mucinous ascites causing mass effect on solid abdominal organs like the liver or the spleen, which develop a characteristic scalloped appearance (Fig. 17). The appendix should always be scrutinized looking for a primary AMN, that presents as a dilated appendix with hypodense material, frequent septa, thin walls and peripheral calcifications (Fig. 18). Peritoneal mucinous deposits may also present linear or punctate calcifications. A more infiltrative behavior of mucinous implants is seen in cases with high-grade histological features and signet ring cells, with frequent vascular involvement of the epigastric region (Fig. 19). Ovarian involvement in the form of hypodense mucinous implants is also frequent, and must not be misdiagnosed with a primary ovarian neoplasm. Solid peritoneal implants and omental cake may also be seen, more often on PMP with high-grade histological features and signet ring cells, but they can also be present in patients with low-grade histological features. In this sense, it is not unusual to find in the same abdominal CT scan signs of low-grade disease, such as hypodense loculated ascites representing acellular mucin pools, coexisting with high-grade features like dense areas of infiltrative appearance representing mucinous carcinomatosis (Fig. 20).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that simple cysts < 10 cm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound obtained by an experienced specialist are likely benign. Consider monitoring these cysts with repeat imaging without surgical intervention, even in postmenopausal patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to postmenopausal patients (surveillance imaging), RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that asymptomatic, simple, unilateral, unilocular, < 5 cm ovarian cysts have a low risk of malignancy. Obtain repeat evaluation in 4–6 months in patients with normal serum CA-125 levels. Consider discontinuing surveillance after 1 year if the cyst remains unchanged or reduces in size, with normal CA-125, taking into consideration the patient's wishes and surgical fitness.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part I: corpus luteum and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, genital causes of haemoperitoneum and adnexal torsion [^116gxHBz]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

US represents the primary imaging modality to assess ovarian torsion. During ovarian torsion, due to the abovementioned dual blood supply, colour Doppler US may still demonstrate some arterial vascular flow. Nevertheless, in the presence of suggestive clinical and imaging findings, this persistence of adnexal vascularisation does not rule out torsion.

After inconclusive US (lesion not clearly depicted or ambiguous findings), in premenopausal women, MRI represents the better technique to assess suspected AT, but CT is often performed in patients with alternative presumptive diagnoses. At CT, the unilaterally enlarged ovary (usually greater than 5 cm) is displaced from its expected site and often located on the midline, and the uterus is attracted towards the ipsilateral side by the shortened adnexal ligament. The oedematous ovary may show eccentric or concentric wall thickening or a 'target-like' pattern corresponding to peripheral displacement of follicles. Congested, enhancing ovarian blood vessels are generally seen; in this regard, it should be recalled that the pathognomonic twisted pedicle usually shows a spiral configuration, but may also present as a solid-like component adjacent to the ovarian mass. Pelvic free fluid and inflammatory fat stranding are generally present. In full-blown AT, haemorrhage appears as a hyperattenuating area and adnexal contrast enhancement is minimal or absent. When present, a mature cystic teratoma shows calcifications, foci of fat attenuation and enhancing mural nodules (Fig. 18).

Results

Clinical, Demographic, Sonographic, and Pathologic Characteristics

The cohort included 511 female patients with a 15.9% malignant tumor prevalence (81 patients). Mean (SD) ages of patients with benign and malignant masses were 44.1 (14.4) and 52.5 (15.2) years, respectively. Overall, 200 patients (39.1%) were postmenopausal. The cohort included 227 Black women (44.4%), 215 White women (42.1%), 48 women (9.4%) with other race (2 [0.4%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 23 [4.5%] Asian or Mideast Indian, 0 Middle Eastern and North African; 2 [0.4%] Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 21 [4.1%] more than 1 race), and 21 (4.1%) who declined to respond for race; 31 (6.1%) were Hispanic or Latino, 456 (89.2%) were not Hispanic or Latino, and 24 (4.7%) declined to respond for ethnicity (eFigure 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 1). The median malignant lesion diameter was 97.0 mm (IQR, 64.0–130.0 mm), while benign lesions were significantly smaller (median, 49.5 mm [IQR, 31.4–72.0 mm]). The presence of solid components (76 of 81 lesions [93.8%] vs 90 of 430 lesions [20.9%]) and the median maximal solid diameter (59.5 mm [IQR, 33.8–86.5 mm] vs 20.1 mm [IQR, 9.5–49.0 mm]) were significantly greater in malignant lesions compared with benign lesions. Malignant lesions were also more likely than benign lesions to have more than 3 papillary projections (9 of 81 [11.1%] vs 4 of 430 [0.9%]), more than 10 locules (10 of 81 [12.3%] vs 17 of 430 [4.0%]), and higher vascular scores (31 of 81 [38.3%] vs 13 of 430 [3.0%]) on Doppler assessment (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

Introduction

Adnexal masses are found in 35% of premenopausal and 17% of postmenopausal women. Yet, despite their prevalence and the low incidence of ovarian cancer, every time an adnexal mass is discovered, the possibility of malignant tumor must be addressed. Because ovarian cancer has a high mortality rate, the threshold for diagnostic surgery is correspondingly low. Over 200 000 women with an adnexal mass undergo surgery annually in the US, although ovarian cancer is found in only about 10% of these patients. The burden of surgeries for benign tumors was well documented in previous large population-based studies, with complication rates ranging from 3% to 15%. A diagnostic modality that yields a more dependably accurate diagnosis prior to surgery is needed, especially since when malignant tumor is suspected, the outcome is improved when gynecologic oncologists perform the surgery and direct management. If the risk of malignancy can be reliably determined as very low on imaging, the tumor could be confidently managed expectantly or by general gynecologists. Clinically, it is important to have a preoperative assessment that accurately differentiates between benign and malignant tumors to optimize patient triaging and reduce unnecessary surgeries without missing cancer.

Several risk stratification models have been developed to standardize the sonographic evaluation of adnexal masses to improve reproducibility and accuracy. Two leading models, primarily used in Europe, are the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Simple Rules, and the IOTA Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) model. In 2019, based on the IOTA terms and data sets, the American College of Radiology (ACR) introduced the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) model, which also provides management recommendations (Figure 1). However, neither of the IOTA models were widely adopted in the US, and the O-RADS system was only recently introduced with limited uptake. Challenging the use of standardized models were findings showing that subjective expert assessment had the highest accuracy. However, acquiring such expertise in reviewing pelvic sonograms requires extensive training and may not be possible in low-volume practices.

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^116VriZy]. RCOG (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to postmenopausal patients (diagnostic imaging), RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend to do not use spectral and pulse Doppler indices (RI, pulsatility index, PSV, time-averaged maximum velocity) routinely to differentiate benign from malignant ovarian cysts, as their use has not been associated with significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy over morphologic assessment by ultrasound.

### The ultrasonography characteristics of borderline ovarian tumor subtypes [^113hVR8x]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Serous ovarian tumors. Serous borderline ovarian tumors usually appear on ultrasonography Doppler imaging as cystic lesions with numerous vascularized papillary projections (A–F). Rarely, however, they may show an exophytic growth pattern with predominantly solid tumors that exhibit rich hierarchical vascular branching (i.e. a fireworks sign; G). Serous low‐grade ovarian cancer (H, I) often presents as irregular solid lesions with exophytic growth (H) or cystic lesions with endophytic papillary projections (I). Hyperechoic foci representing small calcifications may also be present (yellow arrows in I).

The main differential diagnosis of serous BOTs includes benign cystadenofibromas and invasive epithelial ovarian cancers, both of which may also present as cystic lesions with papillary projections. However, the typical solid papillary projections in benign cystadenofibromas are characterized by an avascular nature on Doppler imaging, and they often cast a posterior acoustic shadowing. In contrast, the papillary projections in serous BOTs and malignant ovarian lesions are not only often vascularized and have less prevalent acoustic shadowing, they also tend to have greater height and are more numerous, confluent, and disseminated than those papillary projections in benign tumors. There are also some differential features on imaging that can help distinguish serous BOTs and invasive ovarian lesions. With increasing degrees of malignant invasiveness on the continuum from borderline to early‐ and late‐stage ovarian cancer, in invasive cancer, solid elements are a greater part of the overall tumor, solid components are more prominent, and ascites becomes more prevalent. Nevertheless, it is often impossible to differentiate between BOTs and invasive ovarian carcinomas with ultrasound, especially in early‐stage cases. Differentiating between the two may be less important clinically than distinguishing between BOTs and benign ovarian lesions, since both BOTs and invasive ovarian carcinomas invariably require surgical intervention, even if they require a different surgical extent.
