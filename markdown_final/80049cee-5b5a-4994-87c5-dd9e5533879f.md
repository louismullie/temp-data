## Question

F person is asymptomatic, 70 years old, normal weight, and has twice measured 9 mmol/l fasting glucose and 7% Hba1c, is it safe to asume they have type 2 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 70-year-old asymptomatic woman with two fasting plasma glucose results of 9 mmol/L and an HbA1c of 7.0% can be safely diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and what confirmatory steps are needed before making the diagnosis and starting treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic thresholds and whether her values meet them. Then, I should verify the requirement for confirmatory testing in asymptomatic individuals. Next, I will consider age-specific issues in older adults, including test selection and the possibility of discordant results. Finally, I will outline immediate next steps, documentation, and initial management considerations while we await confirmation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds so I don't jump to conclusions. Diabetes can be diagnosed by fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% using a certified, NGSP-standardized method, 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL on a 75-g OGTT, or a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of classic symptoms; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, confirmation is required on a separate day or with a different test, ideally in a timely manner [^112ecvmz].

> Wait, let me verify the patient's values against those thresholds. Her fasting glucose of 9 mmol/L equals 162 mg/dL, which exceeds the 126 mg/dL cutoff, and her HbA1c of 7.0% also meets or exceeds the 6.5% diagnostic threshold. So both tests independently meet diabetes criteria, which is important for confirmation strategy [^114kB3Pu] [^113RXHy2].

> Hold on, I should verify the confirmation requirement because she is asymptomatic. In the absence of classic symptoms or a hyperglycemic crisis, diagnosis requires two abnormal results from the same or different tests on separate days; using two different tests both above threshold on different days fulfills this, and if results are discordant near the cut point, repeating the abnormal test in 3–6 months is advised; I initially thought a same-day confirmation might suffice, but that would be incorrect for an asymptomatic patient, so I need to ensure we obtain a second abnormal result on a different day or with a different test before labeling diabetes [^114NY2Ex] [^112ecvmz] [^112ecvmz].

> Let me consider age-specific issues in older adults. I should confirm that both FPG and HbA1c remain valid diagnostic tools after age 65, and they do. However, in some older adults, isolated fasting hyperglycemia may underestimate postprandial dysglycemia, so if there is discordance or strong suspicion despite normal fasting values, an OGTT can unmask diabetes. Given her values already meet criteria, OGTT is not mandatory here, but I should keep it in reserve if results are borderline or discordant on repeat testing [^114kB3Pu] [^112ktcsd] [^114LLNBJ].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps while we await confirmation. I will repeat either the FPG or the HbA1c using a certified laboratory method, ensuring proper preanalytic conditions such as an 8-hour fast for FPG and, if OGTT is ever needed, adequate carbohydrate intake for 3 days. I should also document that both initial results were abnormal and that the patient is asymptomatic, and I will avoid using point-of-care A1c for diagnosis because it lacks the required standardization for this purpose [^115bQfZz] [^111vfunP] [^114Xd2Ju].

> But wait, what if the repeat test is discordant or near the margin. If the repeat FPG is below 7.0 mmol/L or the repeat A1c is below 6.5%, I should double-check for analytic or biological variability and consider repeating again in 3–6 months. Persistent discordance between glucose and A1c warrants evaluation for assay interferences or alternative markers like fructosamine, and I should also remember that in older adults, HbA1c may be less sensitive, so a normal A1c does not fully exclude diabetes when clinical suspicion is high [^114NY2Ex] [^1167MvKp] [^114LLNBJ].

> I will now examine initial management while awaiting confirmation. Even before formal labeling, lifestyle intervention is appropriate given her high likelihood of diabetes. Counseling on weight management, dietary patterns, and physical activity is indicated, and if diabetes is confirmed, I should individualize A1c targets recognizing that many otherwise healthy older adults can reasonably aim for A1c around 7.0–7.5% with attention to hypoglycemia risk, functional status, and comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy decisions should follow confirmation and risk stratification, with metformin as first-line unless contraindicated [^113xt4D1].

> Let me reconsider the core question to ensure I'm precise. Can we safely assume she has type 2 diabetes now. No, not yet; although both initial results meet diagnostic thresholds, guideline-concordant care requires confirmatory testing on a separate day or with a different test in asymptomatic individuals, so I should document the abnormal results, arrange timely confirmation, and then proceed with diagnosis and treatment once the second abnormal result is obtained [^114NY2Ex] [^115oeite].

This 70-year-old asymptomatic woman with two fasting plasma glucose measurements of 9 mmol/L (162 mg/dL) and an HbA1c of 7.0% meets diagnostic criteria for diabetes [^114kB3Pu]. However, in the absence of classic symptoms, **confirmatory testing is required** [^115oeite] on a separate day using a different test (FPG, HbA1c, or OGTT) [^114NY2Ex] before making a definitive diagnosis. If results are discordant, repeat the abnormal test or use OGTT to resolve uncertainty [^114NY2Ex]. Once confirmed, initiate lifestyle therapy and consider pharmacologic treatment based on individual risk and comorbidities [^111HQmAu].

## Diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus

According to the ADA 2025 guidelines, diabetes can be diagnosed by any of the following criteria; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, **confirmatory testing is required** [^114kB3Pu]:

| **Test** | **Diagnostic threshold** |
|-|-|
| HbA1c | ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) |
| Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) | ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT | ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) |
| Random plasma glucose | ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis |

---

In this case, the patient has two FPG measurements of 9 mmol/L (162 mg/dL) and an HbA1c of 7.0%, both of which meet the diagnostic thresholds for diabetes [^114kB3Pu]. However, because she is asymptomatic, **confirmatory testing is necessary** to establish a definitive diagnosis [^115oeite].

---

## Confirmatory testing requirements

The ADA emphasizes that in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, **diagnosis requires two abnormal results** from the same or different tests, obtained on separate days [^114NY2Ex]. Acceptable confirmatory tests include FPG, HbA1c, or a 2-hour plasma glucose during a 75-g OGTT. If results are discordant, repeat the abnormal test or use OGTT to clarify the diagnosis [^114NY2Ex].

---

## Clinical implications of asymptomatic diabetes

Asymptomatic diabetes is common, particularly in older adults, and carries significant risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications [^113UDKKL]. Early detection and management can reduce the risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy [^114A23Hd].

---

## Recommended next steps

Given the patient's results, the following steps are recommended:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat FPG, HbA1c, or perform a 75-g OGTT on a separate day to confirm the diagnosis [^114NY2Ex].
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Initiate lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, physical activity, and weight management, regardless of confirmatory results [^113UDKKL].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Consider initiating pharmacologic treatment, such as metformin, if the diagnosis is confirmed, particularly if the patient has additional risk factors or comorbidities [^111HQmAu].
- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regularly monitor glucose levels, HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk factors to assess treatment effectiveness and adjust therapy as needed [^1147ZxpV].

---

## Conclusion

The patient meets diagnostic criteria for diabetes based on her FPG and HbA1c results. However, in the absence of symptoms, **confirmatory testing is required** before making a definitive diagnosis. Once confirmed, initiate appropriate lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to reduce the risk of complications.

### Choice of HbA1c threshold for identifying individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes and implications for diabetes prevention programmes: a cohort study [^115fkngb]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A major issue for T2D prevention and the design of prevention programmes is defining the at-risk group to determine who should be enrolled. Entry to prevention programmes is usually based on a measure of glycaemia in the 'intermediate' range, often termed 'pre-diabetes' or 'non-diabetic hyperglycaemia'. However, there is no consensus as to which test, and at what threshold, should be used to define pre-diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) defines the elevated risk range for pre-diabetes as an HbA1c 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 5.6–6.9 mmol/L or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 2-h glucose of 7.0–11.1 mmol/L. The International Expert Committee (IEC), World Health Organization (WHO) and many other countries use ranges of HbA1c 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%), FPG 6.0–6.9 mmol/L or OGTT 7–11.1 mmol/L to indicate a high risk of developing diabetes. Some guidelines, such as those in the UK, recommend a two-stage approach using a clinical risk score and HbA1c 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%), where testing is targeted to specific groups at high-risk (e.g. Leicester Risk Score or Cambridge Risk Score).

Initial screening: who should screen

R1: Screening for diabetes in asymptomatic adults IS RECOMMENDED for all individuals aged 35 years or older; younger adults (between 18 and 34 years of age) with either overweight or obesity and any additional risk factor (Table 1); or individuals classified at high or very high risk of T2D, according to the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC).

Summary of evidence:
Screening for T2D in asymptomatic individuals is recommended based on evidence showing that early detection and treatment of T2D can significantly reduce the risk of complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Moreover, screening can identify prediabetes, providing an opportunity for early intervention through lifestyle modifications and preventive measures. Screening strategies and preventive measures are cost-effective in high-risk individuals.
A cross-sectional study conducted in the US (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) showed that the number needed to screen (NNS) is significantly higher in individuals under 35 than in those aged 35 to 80. This study compared the frequency of positive screening (diabetes diagnosis) and NNS in universal screening across age groups (with 5-year intervals). The differences were most pronounced between the 30–34 and 35–39 age groups (prevalence of 1.3% and NNS of 80 in the 30–34 group vs. 3.4% and 31 in the 35–39 group).
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus becomes significant at age 35 and increases steadily with age. In Brazil, according to VIGITEL 2023 data, the prevalence of diabetes is 0.5% among individuals aged 18 to 24, 2.4% among those aged 25 to 34, 5.5% among those aged 35 to 44, 10.4% among those aged 45 to 54, 22.4% among those aged 55 to 64, and 30.3% among individuals aged 65 or older.
There is an association between prediabetes and cardiovascular risk. A study with 505 individuals aged 19 to 88 years demonstrated that HbA1c and FPG levels characteristic of prediabetes are associated with a higher cardiovascular risk, justifying screening to identify individuals who should be targeted for evaluation and intervention.
Screening is cost-effective. From the perspective of the American healthcare system, in adults with an average age of 48 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m², the cost of screening and intervention with metformin and lifestyle modification for identified cases of diabetes and prediabetes over three years would be lower than the cost of not screening and not diagnosing people with diabetes.
The presence of additional risk factors increases the risk of T2D. A sub-analysis of the STAND study evaluated, through OGTT and HbA1c, the prevalence of T2D and prediabetes in 193 young adults aged 18 to 40 years, with a median age of 33.8 years, a median BMI of 33.9 kg/m 2, and one additional risk factor. The prevalence of T2D and prediabetes were 4.7% and 18.1%, respectively.
Risk assessment questionnaires for T2D help identify people under 35 who would benefit most from screening. The Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends using the FINDRISC to stratify the risk of developing T2D.
The FINDRISC tool assesses the likelihood of developing T2D based on factors such as age, BMI, waist circumference, physical activity, dietary habits, family history of diabetes, history of hyperglycemia during pregnancy, or treatment for hypertension. This targeted approach helps efficiently identify individuals most likely to benefit from early screening with a blood test (FPG, HbA1c, and OGTT) and intervention, optimizing healthcare resources and improving outcomes. FINDRISC has a maximum score of 26 and classifies individuals into risk levels as follows: low (< 7 points), slightly elevated (7–11 points), moderate (12–14 points), high (15–20 points), and very high (more than 20 points). The full table for calculating the FINDRISC score is available in Table 2 and can also be accessed at.
The risk of T2D is higher in ethnic minorities. However, since the Brazilian population is highly ethnically admixed, the panelists considered it inappropriate to include ethnicity as a risk factor for diabetes in Brazil.
T2D screening allows for early detection of the disease, which can reduce the risk of its related chronic complications. It also identifies individuals with a higher propensity to develop diabetes who may benefit from effective prevention strategies, such as lifestyle modifications.
In a validated computer simulation model using data from the ADDITION-Europe study, it was assumed that screening could anticipate the diagnosis of diabetes in 3 to 6 years. Earlier initiation of intensified treatment in individuals with T2D was estimated to lead to a reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events, with an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 3.3%, a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 29%, and, over 6 years, a 4.9% ARR and a 38% RRR.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 The diagnostic dilemma

Diabetes can be clinically diagnosed based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2‐hour plasma glucose following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT) or glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). All three metrics are continuous variables in human populations with no inflection points that differentiate between normal glucose metabolism and chronic hyperglycaemia. Marked overlap in what's normal and what's abnormal led to the use of 'prediabetes' as a clinical diagnosis for individuals with inconclusive test results. Normal, prediabetic and diabetic reference ranges recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) represent the medical community's best estimate of what can be expected in metabolically normal people compared to those with Type 2 diabetes. Periodic prediabetes screening is now recommended for all people between 35 and 70 years of age based on FPG, 2hOGTT or HbA1c. The problem with this multimetric approach is that prediabetes diagnoses based on these three common clinical tests often disagree.,

1.2 Are two metrics better than one?

In an effort to develop a more specific, timely and unambiguous approach to diabetes diagnosis, Selvin et al.proposed a two‐dimensional, single‐sample definition of confirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having both FPG and HbA1c levels above their respective ADA diabetes cutpoints. The investigators used this confirmation‐by‐agreement approach to analyse data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and found that 'A single‐sample confirmatory definition of diabetes had a high positive predictive value for subsequent diagnosis and was strongly associated with clinical end points'. The authors defined unconfirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having either FPG or HbA1c but not both above their respective cutpoints and suggested that diagnostic ambiguity should be addressed by monitoring FPG and HbA1c over time.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (treatment goals), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to set lower glycemic goals (HbA1c < 7.0–7.5% or < 53–58 mmol/mol) and/or time in range 70–180 mg/dL or 3.9–10.0 mmol of 70% and time below range < 70 mg/dL or < 3.9 mmol/L of < 4% if continuous glucose monitoring is used) in older patients with diabetes otherwise healthy with few and stable coexisting chronic illnesses and intact cognitive function and functional status.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^115Fqdgr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is one of the fastest growing health challenges of the 21 st century, as the number of adults living with diabetes has more than tripled over the past 20 years. It is estimated that 9.3% of adults aged 20–79 years worldwide (approximately 463 million) and 12% of US adults aged older than 18 years (approximately 30 million) are living with diabetes. More than 9/10 people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. An estimated one-third of the adult US population (approximately 84 million) is at risk for type 2 diabetes (ie, have prediabetes), based on having a fasting glucose (FG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level above the normal range but below the threshold for diabetes. People with prediabetes progress to diabetes at a rate of about 5% to 10% per year. Persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese and who have an impaired glucose tolerance and elevated FG levels can slow the progression to diabetes with intensive lifestyle changes that lead to weight loss. However, sustaining lifestyle changes long-term is challenging, and there is always residual risk even after successful weight loss and maintenance. Therefore, simple, inexpensive, and sustainable approaches that can be applied at the public health level to complement lifestyle changes are needed to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in persons with prediabetes.

Over the last decade, low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level has emerged as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and vitamin D supplementation has been hypothesized as a potential intervention to lower diabetes risk. Observational studies strongly support an inverse association between blood 25(OH)D level and risk of developing type 2 diabetes in diverse cohorts of variable diabetes risk, especially in persons with prediabetes. Results from short-term mechanistic studies offer a biologic plausibility to the hypothesis. Recently, several trials testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation to reduce the rate of progression to diabetes in people with prediabetes have been completed.

We sought to evaluate and synthesize the available evidence to determine the role of vitamin D in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

### The early treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111toY7V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis — increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention — with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes — and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^111VxgLJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^1136G47i]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations for testing for pre-diabetes and diabetes in asymptomatic, undiagnosed adults are listed in Table 3. Testing should be considered in adults of any age with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² and one or more risk factors for diabetes. Because age is a major risk factor for diabetes, testing of those without other risk factors should begin no later than age 45 years.

Either FPG testing or the 2-h OGTT is appropriate for testing. The 2-h OGTT identifies people with either IFG or IGT, and thus, more pre-diabetic people at increased risk for the development of diabetes and CVD. It should be noted that the two tests do not necessarily detect the same pre-diabetic individuals. The efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes has primarily been demonstrated among individuals with IGT, not individuals with IFG (who do not also have IGT). As noted in the diagnosis section (Section I.B), the FPG test is more convenient, more reproducible, less costly, and easier to administer than the 2-h OGTT. An OGTT may be useful in patients with IFG to better define the risk of diabetes.

The appropriate interval between tests is not known. The rationale for the 3-year interval is that false-negatives will be repeated before substantial time elapses, and there is little likelihood that an individual will develop significant complications of diabetes within 3 years of a negative test result.

Because of the need for follow-up and discussion of abnormal results, testing should be carried out within the health care setting. Community screening outside a health care setting is not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. Conversely, there may be failure to ensure appropriate repeat testing for individuals who test negative. Community screening may also be poorly targeted, i.e. it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at low risk (the worried well) or even those already diagnosed.

B. Testing for type 2 diabetes in children

The incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents has increased dramatically in the last decade, especially in minority populations, although the disease remains rare in the general adolescent population. Consistent with recommendations for adults, children and youth at increased risk for the presence or the development of type 2 diabetes should be tested within the health care setting. The recommendations of the ADA consensus statement on type 2 diabetes in children and youth, with some modifications, are summarized in Table 4.

### Natural history of prediabetes in older adults from a population-based longitudinal study [^112Qr7YZ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2017, 352 (7.3%) million adults were living with prediabetes worldwide, and this number is expected to increase to 587 million (8.3%) by 2045 1. Prediabetes is an asymptomatic condition preceding type 2 diabetes (hereafter, diabetes). It is characterized by hyperglycaemia, which is defined as a blood glucose level that is higher than normal but below the level for a clinical diagnosis of diabetes 2. Prediabetes is more common in older than younger people; about 48% of U.S. adults aged ≥ 65 years had this condition in 2010 3, 4.

Prediabetes is a high‐risk state for diabetes; about 5–10% of prediabetes may convert to diabetes annually. According to American Diabetes Association expert panel, 70% of individuals with prediabetes may eventually develop diabetes 5. On the other hand, prediabetes may also convert back to normoglycaemia. Several studies have shown that about 3% of adults aged 25–52 years reverted to normoglycaemia annually 6. In addition, prediabetes is linked to high mortality rate in older adults 7, 8. Although the progression of prediabetes is often described in working‐age adults, the evidence on the progression, reversion and mortality of prediabetes in older adults is limited. Given the high prevalence and heterogeneous outcomes of prediabetes in old age, it is pivotal to investigate the natural course of prediabetes amongst older adults.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114V3E6i]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals based on HbA1c, FBG criteria, or OGTT:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|HbA1c|- 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)|
|Fasting plasma glucose|- 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L)|
|2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT|- 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L).|

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117MLamS]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes — definition and glycemic thresholds: People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol). IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) and 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L). The World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), whereas in 2003 the ADA adopted the range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L). Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension; the presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors and risk management.

R10: If only one screening test for T2D meets diagnostic criteria, it is RECOMMENDED to perform an additional test, preferably repeating the abnormal test for confirmation.

Summary of evidence:
Intra-individual variability of glycemic methods with a two-week interval between measurements was evaluated in 685 individuals over 20 years old without diabetes, included in NHANES III. The 2-h post-load glucose showed more significant variability (16.7%) compared to FPG (5.7%) and HbA1c (3.6%). The proportion of individuals with FPG ≥ 100 mg/dL, FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, FPG ≥ 200 mg/dL, 2-h post-load glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL, 2-h post-load glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, and HbA1c ≥ 6.5% who had the same abnormality on the second result was 78%, 70.4%, 100%, 72%, 72%, and 83.3%, respectively. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes using only one FPG was 3.7%. With confirmation by a second sample, the prevalence was 2.8%, corresponding to a 24.4% reduction. For the 2-h OGTT, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 9% and 6.7%, with one or two abnormalities indicating a 26% reduction. These results suggest differences in diabetes prevalence estimates among epidemiological studies using one or two glycemic measurements.
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes are described in Table 4.

R11: When typical hyperglycemic symptoms are present, it IS RECOMMENDED that the diagnosis of diabetes be established with a random plasma glucose greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL.

Summary of evidence:
This panel suggests that to avoid delaying treatment initiation in acute situations, the diagnosis of DM can be established through random PG testing when typical symptoms of hyperglycemia are present, such as polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113RXHy2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes screening and new-onset diabetes prediction: a 6-year community-based prospective study [^112gYkAw]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly. In the U.S. > 13% of adults have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and a similar prevalence has been reported in Asia. Up to 25% of newly diagnosed diabetic patients already had microvascular complications, which suggests that there is a 6- to 7-year time lag between the onset and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

When considering the clinical implications of diabetes and its complications, it is important to identify individuals with undiagnosed diabetes or those who are prone to diabetes in the near future. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening asymptomatic people at 3-year intervals using a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, it is not easy to perform the OGTT in primary practice, and it is debatable whether the FPG concentration alone provides an accurate diagnosis of diabetes, as indicated by the estimated 40% of people who have undiagnosed diabetes.

The hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) level is measured in a standardized test that produces data consistent with those of the international A1C-derived average glucose and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. The A1C level provides a reliable measure of chronic glycemic control without the need for a fasting or timed sample, and it correlates well with the risk of long-term diabetes complications and mortality. Several population-based studies have investigated the utility of the A1C level for detecting undiagnosed diabetes and the potential to use the A1C level as a good screening tool for type 2 diabetes. However, the recent ADA redefinition of the diagnosis of diabetes using an A1C level ≥ 6.5%, which considers many aspects of diagnostic testing and the economic burden, raises concerns about the possible delay in diagnosing diabetes. Thus, there is widespread debate about the appropriate A1C cutoff value for diagnosing diabetes.

To evaluate the predictive value of the A1C level and to find the appropriate A1C cutoff for identifying undiagnosed diabetes and new-onset diabetes over a 6-year follow-up, we analyzed the data from a large-scale, prospective cohort study of people from a homogeneous ethnic background.

### Screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes mellitus: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1125F868]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2008 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for diabetes in asymptomatic adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults who are at average or high risk for diabetes and its complications.

Population

This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who do not have symptoms of diabetes and are overweight or obese.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose as part of cardiovascular risk assessment in adults aged 40 to 70 years who are overweight or obese. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with abnormal blood glucose to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity. (B recommendation).

Asymptomatic adults — screening approach — Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes risk through a targeted assessment of risk factors or with an assessment tool, such as the ADA risk test, is recommended to guide whether performing a diagnostic test is appropriate. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes meet criteria for conditions in which early detection via screening is appropriate, simple tests to detect preclinical disease are readily available, and the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in older people [^114LLNBJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is ≥ 7 mmol/L or the 2-h postprandial glucose is ≥ 11.1 mmol/L regardless of age. However, normal glycemia is defined as fasting plasma glucose < 6.1 mmol/L or 2-h postprandial glucose < 7.8 mmol/L. Therefore, the two categories between normal glycemia and diabetes are impaired fasting glycemia (fasting glucose ≥ 6.1 but < 7 mmol/L) and impaired glucose tolerance (2-h post prandial glucose ≥ 7.8 but < 11.1 mmol/L). These two categories are at high risk of developing diabetes and vascular complications. Clinicians should be aware that older people may have normal fasting glucose levels in the early stages of diabetes. Fasting blood glucose is less sensitive in diabetes diagnosis in old age but 2-h glucose tolerance test appears to capture undiagnosed cases. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) can be used as a diagnostic test with a cut off level of ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5%) for diabetes diagnosis. It has the advantage of convenience to patients, less day-to-day variability, specificity for diabetes, and it is standardized internationally. However, although HbA1c has high specificity (98.7%), its low sensitivity (46.8%) means that it can miss more than half of subjects with diabetes.

### Diabetes mellitus: screening and diagnosis [^111fpLCj]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors. The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater with typical signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia likely indicates diabetes. Additional testing to determine the etiology of diabetes is not routinely recommended.

### HbA1c measurement improves the detection of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals with nondiagnostic levels of fasting plasma glucose: the early diabetes intervention program (EDIP) [^111nNRXy]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Whereas new diagnostic criteria based on a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of > 126 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) have improved the detection of diabetes, multiple reports indicate that many people with diabetes diagnosed by 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose measurements ≥ 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) would remain undiagnosed based on this FPG criteria. Thus, improved methods to detect diabetes are particularly needed for high-risk individuals. We evaluated whether the combination of FPG and HbA1c measurements enhanced detection of diabetes in those individuals at risk for diabetes with nondiagnostic or minimally elevated FPG.

Research Design and Methods

We analyzed FPG, OGTT, and HbA1c data from 244 subjects screened for participation in the Early Diabetes Intervention Program (EDIP).

Results

Of 244 high-risk subjects studied by FPG measurements and OGTT, 24% of the individuals with FPG levels of 5.5–6.0 mmol/l (100–109 mg/dl) had OGTT-diagnosed diabetes, and nearly 50% of the individuals with FPG levels of 6.1–6.9 mmol/l (110–125 mg/dl) had OGTT-diagnosed diabetes. In the subjects with OGTT-diagnosed diabetes and FPG levels between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/l, detection of an elevated HbA1c (> 6.1% or mean + 2 SDs) led to a substantial improvement in diagnostic sensitivity over the FPG threshold of 7.0 mmol/l (61 vs. 45%, respectively, P = 0.002). Concordant FPG levels ≥ 7.0 mmol/l (currently recommended for diagnosis) occurred in only 19% of our cohort with type 2 diabetes.

Conclusions

Diagnostic criteria based on FPG criteria are relatively insensitive in the detection of early type 2 diabetes in at-risk subjects. HbA1c measurement improves the sensitivity of screening in high-risk individuals.

T2DM has simply been thought to be a result of insulin deficiency and/or peripheral insulin resistance. However, the phenotype of T2DM is heterogeneous, as is the pathophysiology. 2,3.

### Effects of the Norfolk diabetes prevention lifestyle intervention (NDPS) on glycaemic control in screen-detected type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial [^116PMG44]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Eligibility for randomisation into this trial was initially for participants with fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/l on paired baseline samples. In light of international changes in diabetes diagnostic criteria during the programme and UK national policy changes, we also then enrolled screened participants with paired HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes from May 2014. In the initial years of this programme (end 2011–2013), there was still uncertainty about the clinical adoption of HbA1c as a test for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in normal UK practice, compared to data obtained during a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). To exclude an OGTT-based diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (paired 2-h plasma glucose > 11.1 mmol/l) and incorrect randomisation into the NDPS diabetes prevention trial, we undertook an OGTT in higher risk screened participants (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1– < 7.0 mmol/l and HbA1c > 42 mmol/mol) and recruited into the trial reported here those with paired OGTT 2-h glucose values of both > 11.1 mmol/mol. Participants who declined a repeat OGTT after an initial diagnostic value were also offered randomisation into this trial if they had paired baseline HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol. Participants with a single abnormal OGTT were also accepted if they had extreme or symptomatic hyperglycaemia.

Ethical issues

Ethical approval was obtained from the National Research Ethics Service (NRES), Essex 1 Research Ethics Committee (10/H0301/55; January 13, 2011), and all participants gave written informed consent. Participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were informed of their diagnosis and offered discussion with the study team and CI. Each participants' primary care clinician was informed of the diagnosis, and normal diabetes care and management was provided outside the trial protocol by their usual clinician.

Randomisation and consent

We randomised participants in parallel with the screening programme using a rolling recruitment approach with screening and randomisation continuing from August 2011 until 6.4.2017. This allowed each participant to reach a 12 months minimum and 46 months maximum follow-up within the trial. Randomisation was conducted automatically using a dedicated algorithm in the trial data management system. The randomisation mechanism consisted of a pre-prepared random list of codes (for the intervention and control groups) stored in the trial database, and randomisation to groups was in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation enrollment was undertaken by NDPS diabetes prevention facilitators (DPF).

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113UDKKL]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An estimated 13% of all US adults (18 years or older) have diabetes, and 34.5% meet criteria for prediabetes. The prevalences of prediabetes and diabetes are higher in older adults. Estimates of the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes vary widely, perhaps because of differences in the definition of prediabetes or the heterogeneity of prediabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the US. It is also associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death in the US in 2017. Screening asymptomatic adults for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes may allow earlier detection, diagnosis, and treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes.

Objective

To update its 2015 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and preventive interventions for those with prediabetes.

Population

Nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (defined as a body mass index ≥ 25 and ≥ 30, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. (B recommendation).

- first-degree relative with diabetes

- high-risk race, ethnicity, or ancestry, such as African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American

- history of CVD

- hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)

- HDL-C < 35 mg/dL (< 0.90 mmol/L) and/or triglycerides > 250 mg/dL (> 2.8 mmol/L)

### Consensus report: definition and interpretation of remission in type 2 diabetes [^115y7zt9]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Improvement of glucose levels into the normal range can occur in some people living with diabetes, either spontaneously or after medical interventions, and in some cases can persist after withdrawal of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Such sustained improvement may now be occurring more often due to newer forms of treatment. However, terminology for describing this process and objective measures for defining it are not well established, and the long-term risks versus benefits of its attainment are not well understood. To update prior discussions of this issue, an international expert group was convened by the American Diabetes Association to propose nomenclature and principles for data collection and analysis, with the goal of establishing a base of information to support future clinical guidance. This group proposed "remission" as the most appropriate descriptive term, and HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) measured at least 3 months after cessation of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy as the usual diagnostic criterion. The group also made suggestions for active observation of individuals experiencing a remission and discussed further questions and unmet needs regarding predictors and outcomes of remission.

### Brazilian guideline for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: a position statement from the Brazilian diabetes society [^114DgWow]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) often experience prolonged periods of asymptomatic hyperglycemia, which significantly increases the risk of developing chronic complications related to diabetes. Screening programs for individuals at high risk for T2D provide valuable opportunities not only for early diagnosis but also for detecting intermediate hyperglycemic states, commonly referred to as prediabetes. Interventions aimed at preventing diabetes in this group can successfully delay or even avoid the onset of the disease and its associated burdens. This review is an update of the Brazilian Diabetes Society (Sociedade Brasileira de Diabetes [SBD]) evidence-based guideline for diagnosing diabetes and screening T2D.

Methods

The methodology was previously published and defined by the internal institutional steering committee. The working group drafted the manuscript by selecting vital clinical questions for a narrative review, utilizing MEDLINE via PubMed to identify relevant studies. The review assessed the best available evidence, including randomized clinical trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and high-quality observational studies related to the diagnosis of diabetes.

Results and Conclusions

Fifteen specific recommendations were formulated. Screening is recommended for adults aged 35 and older or younger individuals with obesity and additional risk factors. For children and adolescents, screening is recommended starting at age ten or the onset of puberty if they are overweight or obese and have additional risk factors. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c are recommended as initial screening tests. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is recommended for high-risk individuals with normal HbA1c and FPG or those with prediabetes. The 1-h OGTT is preferred over the 2-h OGTT, as it is both more practical and a superior test. A structured approach to reevaluation intervals is provided.

### Diabetes in older adults [^113V2eHt]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

What is the evidence for preventing and treating diabetes and its common comorbidities in older adults?

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes

Older adults are at high risk for both diabetes and prediabetes, with surveillance data suggesting that half of older adults have the latter. The ADA recommends that overweight adults with risk factors — and all adults aged ≥ 45 years — be screened in the clinical setting every 1–3 years using either an FPG test, A1C, or oral glucose tolerance test. The recommendations are based on substantial indirect evidence for the benefits of early treatment of type 2 diabetes, the fact that type 2 diabetes is typically present for years before clinical diagnosis, and the evidence that signs of complications are prevalent in "newly diagnosed" patients.

The benefits of identification of prediabetes and asymptomatic type 2 diabetes in older adults depend on whether primary or secondary preventive interventions would likely be effective and on the anticipated timeframe of the benefit of interventions versus the patient's life expectancy. Most would agree that a functional and generally healthy 66-year-old individual should be offered diabetes screening since interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes or the complications of type 2 diabetes would likely be beneficial given the presumption of decades of remaining life. Most would also agree that finding prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes in a 95-year-old individual with advanced dementia would be unlikely to provide benefit.

### Screening for diabetes and prediabetes [^114A23Hd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is preceded by prediabetes and latent diabetes (lasts 9–12 years). Key dysglycemia screening tests are fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A 1C. Screen-detected T2DM benefits from multifactorial management of cardiovascular risk beyond glycemia. Prediabetes is best addressed by lifestyle modification, with the goal of preventing T2DM. Although there is no trial evidence of prediabetes/T2DM screening effectiveness, simulations suggest that clinic-based opportunistic screening of high-risk individuals is cost-effective. The most rigorous extant recommendations are those of the American Diabetes Association and US Preventive Services Task Force, which advise opportunistic 3-yearly screening.

### Detecting undiagnosed type 2 diabetes: family history as a risk factor and screening tool [^114JDLRz]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

A family history of diabetes is a major risk factor for the disease. As such, it is often included in a variety of tools designed to detect either people at risk of diabetes or people with undiagnosed diabetes. One of the reasons to screen for diabetes is that it has a prolonged asymptomatic phase, which includes impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and the early stages of diabetes. In terms of prevalence, diabetes is a major public health problem. Evidence shows that the detection of impaired glucose metabolism in its early stages (prediabetes) could lead to the delay or prevention of the disease and its complications. However, the issue of using family history to screen for diabetes must be discussed within the context of screening for diabetes in general. Screening for a disease among asymptomatic people must meet a series of stringent requirements to ensure the best possible outcomes. Screening for diabetes meets most of these requirements but the ones it does not meet are still important. Therefore, based on systematically collected evidence or simply by consensus among scientists, influential organizations recommend screening only among high-risk individuals. As a result, researchers have developed a variety of simple tools to identify high-risk individuals for diabetes in populations. Family history is included as a key variable in the vast majority of them. This article is a brief overview of the reasons to screen for diabetes in general, the tools available for conducting this screening, and the role of family history in these tools.

Type 1 diabetes — presymptomatic screening and classification recommendations indicate that screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by the detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8); autoantibody-based screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes should be considered in relatives of people with a family history of type 1 diabetes or otherwise known elevated genetic risk; having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes and, when multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered; and standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment).

Prediabetes — recommendation 11.6 and diagnostic thresholds: Diabetes medications including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) can be considered in persons with prediabetes or in those with adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) who remain glucose-intolerant after weight loss using lifestyle and/or weight-loss medications (Grade A; BEL 1). Prediabetes can be identified by impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test result 140 to 199 mg/dL, 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose), or A1C 5.7% to 6.4%, and progression risk is greatest with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, progressive glycemia within the prediabetes range, or meeting a combination of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome criteria (any 2 out of 3).

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^116Edjgu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

Testing methodology and confirmation — footnotes to criteria: Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours. FPG is the preferred diagnostic test, but either of the two listed is acceptable; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, one of these tests should be done on different days. HbA1c should use a clinical laboratory (not a point-of-care) methodology standardized to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The VA/DoD DM CPG recommends that when HbA1c values between 6.5% and 7.0% suggest diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, this observation should be confirmed with fasting plasma glucose levels to improve diagnostic specificity.

US Preventive Services Task Force — screening recommendation and target population: The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity (B recommendation). Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. The target population is nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (defined as a body mass index ≥ 25 and ≥ 30, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit.

### Evaluation and refinement of the PRESTARt tool for identifying 12–14 year olds at high lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to a clinicians assessment of risk: a cross-sectional study [^111QFKU2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2017, 425 million people had diabetes worldwide, this is projected to increase by 16% to 629 million by 2045. Around 90% of these are diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Worldwide, 352 million people are at risk of developing T2DM and around 1 in 2 adults with T2DM are undiagnosed. Historically T2DM was associated with older age, but over the past 15 years dramatic rises in T2DM are being seen in children, adolescents and young adults. A study assessing the prevalence of T2DM in people aged 10–19 years in the United States found a 30% increase in prevalence between 2001 and 2009. Similar increases have been reported in the UK. Those with early onset T2DM (for example those diagnosed before 40 years old), seem to represent a high risk group, with long disease exposure leading to the early onset of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Emerging evidence also suggests that early onset T2DM is associated with a more extreme phenotype than that seen in older adults. Early onset has additional psycho-societal implications. Those affected by early onset T2DM are of working age, studies show that diabetes is associated with a significant negative impact on the ability-to-work. To date there is very little data regarding undiagnosed T2DM or the number of children, adolescents and young adults at risk of developing diabetes. One UK-based clinical trial recruited overweight and obese 18–40 year olds. Of the 193 participants recruited, 5% had undiagnosed T2DM and 18% had elevated glucose levels putting them at risk of developing T2DM.

Screening to identify adults at risk of developing T2DM is recommended by national bodies, such as NICE in England and Wales. Such guidance usually recommends a two stage approach where a non-invasive risk score which assesses the presence of risk factors is used to pre-screen before a blood test is taken to assess HbA1c or glucose levels in those at high risk. Given T2DM can have a long asymptomatic phase, risk scores can also be used to identify people with undiagnosed T2DM. To date a plethora of risk scores have been developed and validated for use in adults to identify those at risk of either having undiagnosed T2DM or developing it in the future. Risk scores reduce the number of people requiring blood tests, help people understand their modifiable risk factors and have been shown to reduce the cost of screening and increase uptake. Identifying those at risk of developing T2DM and providing prevention programmes is very effective, with the landmark studies in the area showing a 58% reduction in the development of T2DM.

### Diagnosing type 2 diabetes before patients complain of diabetic symptoms – clinical opportunistic screening in a single general practice [^1157XNjC]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 483 people with diabetes were identified over the 19 years. Of these, 429 (88.8%) had T2DM and were eligible for the cohort (Fig. 1).

F1
Categories of patients used in analysis

Prevalence of T2DM in the Practice

A total of 2303 patient-years were available for analysis. The prevalence of patients with T2DM rose from 1.1% in 1987 to 3.0% in 2006 (Fig. 2). The annual incidence of T2DM also rose three-fold from a rate of 0.6 per 1000 registered patients in 1987 to 1.9 per 1000 patients in 2005.

F2
Factors determining the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the Practice

Asymptomatic diagnosis within the subgroup

Since April 1, 2000 (when internationalized HbA1c levels were available), 121 registered patients were diagnosed with T2DM. Of these, 116 (95.9%) were diagnosed within the Practice and 70 were diagnosed without symptoms (57.9%). Of these 121, 88 (76%) had an eligible HbA1c, there being 46 males and 42 females with a mean age at diagnosis of 62.5 years (95% CI = 59.7–65.3). Those diagnosed without any symptoms of diabetes were in the majority (52/88 = 59.1%).

Although we did not obtain the sample size identified theoretically in the power calculation, we nevertheless found statistically significant differences in HbA1c between the two groups. The median HbA1c level at diagnosis for those patients presenting with symptoms was 8.2% [interquartile range (IQR) = 4.2]. The median HbA1c for those diagnosed before symptoms was 7.45% (IQR = 1.98). The median difference was 1.1% (95% CI = 0.3–2.3%; P = 0.01). No other significant differences were seen between the two groups.

B. Diagnosis of diabetes

Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 2. Three ways to diagnose diabetes are recommended at the time of this statement, and each must be confirmed on a subsequent day unless unequivocal symptoms of hyperglycemia are present. Although the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is more sensitive and modestly more specific than the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to diagnose diabetes, it is poorly reproducible and difficult to perform in practice. Because of ease of use, acceptability to patients, and lower cost, the FPG has been the preferred diagnostic test. Though FPG is less sensitive than the OGTT, the vast majority of people who do not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes by FPG but would by OGTT will have an A1C value well under 7.0%.

Though the OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use, it may be useful for further evaluation of patients in whom diabetes is still strongly suspected but who have normal FPG or IFG (see Section I.C).

The use of the A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes has previously not been recommended due to lack of global standardization and uncertainty about diagnostic thresholds. However, with a world-wide move toward a standardized assay and with increasing observational evidence about the prognostic significance of A1C, an Expert Committee on the Diagnosis of Diabetes was convened in 2008. This joint committee of ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation will likely recommend that the A1C become the preferred diagnostic test for diabetes. Diagnostic cut-points are being discussed at the time of publication of this statement. Updated recommendations will be published in Diabetes Care and will be available at diabetes.org.

C. Diagnosis of pre-diabetes

Hyperglycemia not sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes is categorized as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), depending on whether it is identified through the FPG or the OGTT:
IFG = FPG 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)
IGT = 2-h plasma glucose 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)

IFG and IGT have been officially termed "pre-diabetes". Both categories of pre-diabetes are risk factors for future diabetes and for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^113aHNsj]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

A. Testing for type 2 diabetes and risk of future diabetes in adults

Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-fourth of all people with diabetes in the U.S. may be undiagnosed. Although the effectiveness of early identification of pre-diabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been proven definitively (and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur), pre-diabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate. Both conditions are common, are increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens. There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made. Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease. Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes (see IV. PREVENTION/DELAY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see VI. PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES COMPLICATIONS).

Recommendations for testing for diabetes in asymptomatic undiagnosed adults are listed in Table 4. Testing should be considered in adults of any age with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 and one or more risk factors for diabetes. Because age is a major risk factor for diabetes, testing of those without other risk factors should begin no later than at age 45 years.

Either A1C, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is appropriate for testing. The 2-h OGTT identifies people with either IFG or IGT and thus more people at increased risk for the development of diabetes and CVD. It should be noted that the two tests do not necessarily detect the same individuals. The efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes has primarily been demonstrated among individuals with IGT, but not for individuals with IFG (who do not also have IGT) or those with specific A1C levels.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^116aKUsS]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission — expert consensus definition and historical criteria are detailed as follows: Remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.5% for at least 3 months with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy for the specific purpose of lowering blood glucose. The 2021 ADA consensus similarly defined remission as a return of HbA1c to < 6.5% (< 48 mmol/mol) that persists for at least 3 months in the absence of usual glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Historical categorizations included "partial" remission (HbA1c not diagnostic of diabetes [< 6.5%], fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) and "complete" remission (HbA1c < 5.7%, fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]), each requiring at least 1 year's duration; "prolonged" remission lasted more than 5 years. Earlier ABCD/PCDS criteria required confirmation on two occasions separated by at least 6 months and complete cessation of all glucose-lowering therapies, but the panel did not consider "weight loss" to be a necessary criterion. The panel recommended that remission should be deemed a realistic and achievable goal for many adults with T2D using diet as a primary intervention, while noting remission may be harder to achieve in long-standing disease (8 years or more). The panel reached consensus that insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta and HOMA-IR to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations.

Epidemiology and awareness — United States adults: An estimated 13% of all US adults (18 years or older) have diabetes, and 34.5% meet criteria for prediabetes. Of persons with diabetes, 21.4% were not aware of or did not report having diabetes, and only 15.3% of persons with prediabetes reported being told by a health professional that they had this condition. A large cohort study of 77 107 persons with prediabetes reported that the risk of developing diabetes increased with increasing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level and with increasing body mass index (BMI). Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the US and was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death in the US in 2017.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^116AM82n]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

Introduction

Diabetes is a disease of international importance. It is increasing in prevalence, is a lifelong condition, is associated with serious complications and shorter life expectation. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) forms 90% of new diagnoses. Most diagnoses of diabetes are now made in general practice, and over two-thirds of patients with diabetes are now managed in general practice. Diabetes has therefore become a disease of general practice. Treatment can only follow diagnosis, so an important research question is how early in the disease can the diagnosis be made?

Table 2.5 — Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults — testing should be considered in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² or ≥ 23 kg/m² in individuals of Asian ancestry) who have one or more risk factors such as hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) and dyslipidemia with HDL cholesterol level < 35 mg/dL and/or triglyceride level > 250 mg/dL. People with prediabetes (A1C ≥ 5.7% [≥ 39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly; people who were diagnosed with GDM should have testing at least every 1–3 years. For all other people, testing should begin at age 35 years, and if results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status. Individuals in other high-risk groups (e.g., people with HIV, exposure to high-risk medications, evidence of periodontal disease, history of pancreatitis) should also be closely monitored.

### New-onset diabetes: a potential clue to the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer [^117SP3m3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis because cancer-specific symptoms occur only at an advanced stage. If the cancer is to be discovered early, screening will need to be done in asymptomatic individuals. Because the incidence of pancreatic cancer is low, screening for asymptomatic cancer in the general population is not feasible; therefore, screening will need to be restricted to people at high risk of this disease. The proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer who also have hyperglycaemia or diabetes has previously been under appreciated. New data show that up to 80% of patients are either hyperglycaemic or diabetic, both of which can be detected in the presymptomatic phase. Diabetes has been shown to improve after pancreatic-cancer resection, suggesting that diabetes is caused by the cancer. Conversely, older patients with new-onset diabetes have about an eight-times higher risk of having pancreatic cancer than the general population. Recognition of new-onset diabetes as an early manifestation of pancreatic cancer could lead to the diagnosis of asymptomatic, early-stage pancreatic cancer. However, primary type-2 diabetes is common in the general population and pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon, and the two forms of diabetes are clinically indistinguishable. The success of a strategy using new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes as a screening tool to identify people with a high likelihood of having asymptomatic pancreatic cancer will depend largely on our ability to differentiate pancreatic-cancer-associated diabetes from the more common type-2 diabetes by use of a (serological) biomarker.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^1147ZxpV]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

14, 24. 7, 14, 24 The goal is to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without risking significant hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7 percent. 7 Glycemic control requires the patient to have cognitive, visual, and motor skills to monitor and manage blood glucose levels, and identifying and minimizing barriers for effective self-management is an important first step to setting individualized goals. INITIAL MANAGEMENT The first step in managing type 2 diabetes is to normalize fasting glucose levels, with weekly or monthly adjustments in the regimen. Once fasting blood glucose approaches near-normal levels, postprandial glucose is addressed by increasing the dose of the current medications or by adding additional agents.

Once maximal benefit is achieved from first-line medications, other agents, such as exenatide and sitagliptin, can be considered. INITIATING INSULIN THERAPY Less than 40 percent of patients with diabetes successfully achieve an A1C level of less than 7 percent. Newly diagnosed patients also can benefit from acute insulin use. Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause glucose toxicity, a potentially reversible impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This can be corrected with aggressive insulin therapy, then oral medications can be added as insulin is tapered or discontinued. Expert opinion suggests that insulin therapy should be initiated if the fasting blood glucose level is consistently greater than 250 mg per dL, or if random testing shows levels greater than 300 mg per dL 24.

When adding insulin to an oral medication regimen, oral agents should initially be continued. Long-acting insulin should be used initially, typically at a dosage of 10 units per day or 0. 17 to
0. 5 units per kg per day, and titrated in increments of two units approximately every three days. 14, 24. Rapid-acting or premixed preparations can be added if fasting blood glucose levels are persistently high or if A1C has plateaued at about
7. 5 percent, which indicates that postprandial glucose levels are high. Adding more basal insulin in this setting usually will not help patients reach their target levels.

### ADA updates standards of medical care for patients with… [^116CEXaW]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

In the 2016 update, the ADA revised the order and discussion of diagnostic tests to make it clear that no one test is preferred over others. Diabetes may be diagnosed based on results of random plasma glucose testing, fasting plasma glucose testing, two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing, or an A1C level of 6. 5% or greater. impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose on previous testing; other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance; physical inactivity; women who delivered a baby weighing more than 9 lb or who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes; and women with polycystic ovary syndrome). If test results are normal, repeat testing at a minimum of three-year intervals is reasonable.

Technology for Prevention or Delay of Diabetes Randomized controlled trials have shown that persons at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes can significantly decrease the rate of diabetes onset with intensive lifestyle modification programs. Follow-up of these studies has shown sustained reduction in the rate of conversion to type 2 diabetes. Given these results and the known risks of progression from prediabetes to diabetes, persons with an A1C of 5. 7% to
6. 4%, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose should be counseled on lifestyle changes to achieve 7% weight loss and moderate-intensity physical activity of at least 150 minutes per week. Conditions that commonly coexist with type 2 diabetes are clear risk factors for atherosclerotic CVD, and diabetes itself confers independent risk. Studies have shown that controlling cardiovascular risk factors helps prevent or slow atherosclerotic CVD in persons with diabetes.

For children with a significant family history of CVD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends obtaining a fasting lipid panel beginning at two years of age. However, statins are not approved for patients younger than 10 years and should generally not be used in children with type 1 diabetes before this age. Therefore, the recommendation to obtain a fasting lipid profile in children starting at two years of age has been changed to 10 years of age.

Baseline classification of normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance or Type 2 diabetes was based on one oral glucose tolerance test only. The diagnosis of asymptomatic diabetes in clinical practice would require the confirmation by a second oral glucose tolerance test. For the 45 participants with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes established prior to the time of inclusion in this study, a second oral glucose tolerance test would be redundant. Five participants were classified as 'previously unknown Type 2 diabetes' and, for two individuals in this group, the diagnosis was confirmed by a second oral glucose tolerance test at the end of the study. The remaining three individuals were classified as 'impaired glucose tolerance' (2) and 'normal glucose tolerance' (1) after the second oral glucose tolerance test.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117DBhQ3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114NY2Ex]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes diagnosis — confirmatory testing and discordance management: Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L], diagnosis requires confirmation by two abnormal screening test results obtained at the same time or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner; for example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) both above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points also confirm the diagnosis. If results from two different tests are discordant, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test; for instance, if A1C shows two results ≥ 6.5% [= 48 mmol/mol] but FPG is < 126 mg/dL [< 7.0 mmol/L], the person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. If abnormal A1C and FPG results are near diagnostic margins, repeat the test in 3–6 months, and substantial discordance between glucose values and A1C should prompt additional follow-up and consideration of other biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin for monitoring glycemic management.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommends universal screening for prediabetes and diabetes for all adults 45 years or older, regardless of risk factors, and screening persons with risk factors for diabetes (regardless of age); testing for prediabetes and diabetes can be done using a fasting plasma glucose level, 2-hour plasma glucose level during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c level; it recommends repeat screening every 3 years.

### What is diabetes remission? [^116xnBbz]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Current Definitions of Remission

In 2009, Buse and coworkers subdivided remission into two categories, namely partial and complete. Partial remission is defined as HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and fasting glucose between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/l maintained for at least 1 year in the absence of active pharmacological therapy or ongoing antidiabetic procedures. Complete remission is a return to normal measures of glucose metabolism with HbA1c in the normal range (< 6.0% [42 mmol/mol]) and fasting glucose < 5.6 mmol/l. Prolonged remission is defined as remission lasting for > 5 years. The 2009 definitions are not without problems since the day-to-day variations in plasma glucose are rather wide in a person with T2DM in remission, which in combination with the imprecision of the plasma glucose measurements may result in a shift between partial versus complete remission from day to day. Further, in some countries the definition "impaired fasting glucose" (IFG: fasting plasma glucose [FPG] of between 5.6 and 7.0 mmol/l) is not an officially registered diagnosis used in clinical practice. The 2009 definition is also complex in relation to the diagnostic coding systems.

An operative position statement on remission was published by the joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) and the Primary Care Diabetes Society (PCDS) defining remission as both FPG concentration < 7 mmol/l and HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol on two occasions separated by at least 6 months. This definition is pragmatic, fits with the diagnostic criteria for diabetes and is easy for patients to understand and for physicians to use.

However, the discussion of the concept of remission of T2DM has reached new timeliness recently, in particular because of two therapeutic successes: the effects of bariatric surgery and the results of effective weight loss therapies, as recently illustrated in the DiRECT trial. In both cases, the therapy frequently leads to remission. For example, in the DiRECT trial, remission was obtained in 85% of those patients with T2DM who obtained a weight loss of ≥ 15%. Similar results are often seen after bariatric surgery, where weight loss may reach 40 kg at 1–2 years after surgery, with the rate of remission of 70–80%.

II. TESTING FOR DIABETES IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS

Recommendations

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes and assess risk for future diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (Table 4). In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. (B)
If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. (E)
To test for diabetes or to assess risk of future diabetes, either A1C, FPG, or 2-h 75-g OGTT are appropriate. (B)
In those identified with increased risk for future diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. (B)

Table 4
Criteria for testing for diabetes in asymptomatic adult individuals

For many illnesses there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes the same tests would be used for "screening" as for diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase and significant clinical risk markers. Diabetes may be identified anywhere along a spectrum of clinical scenarios ranging from a seemingly low-risk individual who happens to have glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual who the provider tests because of high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. The discussion herein is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in individuals without symptoms. Testing for diabetes will also detect individuals at increased future risk for diabetes, herein referred to as pre-diabetic.

WHO criteria for interpreting 2-h OGTT a

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people, previously controversial, is now recommended for those at risk of developing the disease. The ADA proposes that all asymptomatic people ≥ 45 years of age be screened in a healthcare setting. An HbA 1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT evaluation is appropriate for screening. The IDF recommends that the health service in each country decide whether to implement screening for diabetes. FPG is the suggested test. In contrast, the International Expert Committee and the ADA have recommended that HbA 1c can be used for screening for diabetes (see section on HbA 1c below). If an FPG result is < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and/or a 2-h plasma glucose concentration is < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year intervals. Screening should be considered at a younger age or be carried out more frequently in individuals who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) or obese and who have a least one additional risk factor for diabetes [see for conditions associated with increased risk]. Because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children, screening of children is now advocated. Starting at age 10 years (or at the onset of puberty if puberty occurs at a younger age), testing should be performed every 3 years in overweight individuals who have two other risk factors — namely, family history, a race/ethnicity recognized to increase risk, signs of insulin resistance, and a maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation. Despite these recommendations and the demonstration that interventions can delay and sometimes prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, there is as yet no published evidence that treatment based on screening has an effect on long-term complications. In addition, the published literature lacks consensus as to which screening procedure (FPG, OGTT, and/or HbA 1c) is the most appropriate (,–). On the basis of an evaluation of NHANES III data, a strategy has been proposed to use FPG to screen whites ≥ 40 years and other populations ≥ 30 years of age. The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes has been estimated. The incremental cost of screening all persons ≥ 25 years of age has been estimated to be $236,449 per life-year gained and $56,649 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Interestingly, screening was more cost-effective at ages younger than the 45 years currently recommended. In contrast, screening targeted to individuals with hypertension reduces the QALY from $360,966 to $34,375, with ages between 55 and 75 years being the most cost-effective. Modeling run on 1 × 10⁶ individuals suggests considerable uncertainty as to whether screening for diabetes would be cost-effective. By contrast, the results of a more recent modeling study imply that screening commencing at 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective (< $11,000 per QALY gained). Long-term outcome studies are necessary to provide evidence to resolve the question of the efficacy of diabetes screening.

### Definition and classification of diabetes and prediabetes and emerging data on phenotypes [^115JpzGo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes diagnosis has important implications for individuals. Diagnostic criteria for fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose and HbA1c are universally agreed. Intermediate hyperglycemia/prediabetes is a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Because risk is a continuum, determining cut-point is problematic and reflected in significant differences in recommended fasting glucose and HbA1c criteria. Many types of diabetes are recognized. Diabetes classification systems are limited by a lack of understanding of etiopathogenetic pathways leading to diminished β-cell function. The World Health Organization classification system is designed to assist clinical care decisions. Newly recognized phenotypic clusters of diabetes might inform future classification systems.

II. TESTING FOR PRE-DIABETES AND DIABETES IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS

Recommendations

Testing to detect pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (Table 3). In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. (B)
If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. (E)
To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, an FPG test or 2-h OGTT (75-g glucose load) or both are appropriate. (B)

In those identified with pre-diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. (B)

For many illnesses, there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes, the same tests would be used for "screening" as for diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase and significant clinical risk markers.

The discussion herein is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in those without symptoms. Testing for diabetes will also detect individuals with pre-diabetes.

A. Testing for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults

Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-third of all people with diabetes may be undiagnosed. Although the effectiveness of early identification of pre-diabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been definitively proven (and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur), pre-diabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate. Both conditions are common, increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens. There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made. Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease. Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes (see Section IV) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see Section VI).

Modify frequency of monitoring based on individual risk assessment based on age, number and type of autoantibodies, and glycemic metrics.
