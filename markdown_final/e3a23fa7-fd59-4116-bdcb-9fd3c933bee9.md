## Question

What is the best antibiotic for L5-S1 Acute discitis in a 37 yo female who is non drug user and does not have GU infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about empiric antibiotic selection for acute L5-S1 discitis in a 37-year-old woman without IV drug use or GU infection, including when to start therapy, what to cover, dosing, duration, and how to transition to targeted therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely microbiology and whether empiric therapy is indicated now. Then, I should verify the IDSA guidance on when to withhold versus start empiric antibiotics. Next, I will select an empiric regimen and dosing strategy, followed by duration and IV-to-oral transition. After that, I need to outline source control and diagnostic steps, including biopsy timing and yield. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, monitoring, and a concise final recommendation with caveats and alternatives if cultures are negative or the patient deteriorates.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and likely pathogens. In a healthy 37-year-old woman with acute L5-S1 discitis and no IV drug use or GU source, hematogenous Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism, with streptococci and gram-negative bacilli as less frequent considerations; I should also remember that epidural extension or abscess can complicate this picture and change urgency and source-control needs [^115mBetm] [^116Q4kTB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting antibiotics immediately. I need to check IDSA guidance on empiric therapy timing. In adults with native vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis who are hemodynamically stable and have a normal, nonprogressive neurologic exam, the recommendation is to withhold empiric antimicrobials until a microbiologic diagnosis is established, because early antibiotics reduce culture yield and complicate targeted therapy selection; empiric therapy is reserved for instability, sepsis, or evolving neurologic deficits [^116x95ao] [^117Cu1of] [^115ruohf].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic yield and timing of biopsy. If blood cultures are negative, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the disc space improves microbiologic yield to roughly 31–91%, and withholding antimicrobials for 1–2 weeks prior to biopsy, when clinically safe, maximizes culture positivity; if the patient deteriorates or source control is needed, biopsy can proceed without delay, and repeat biopsy is reasonable if the initial sample is nondiagnostic [^1148zQTS].

> I should confirm the empiric regimen if therapy must be started before cultures return. IDSA suggests vancomycin plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone to cover MRSA, MSSA, streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli; alternatives in beta-lactam allergy include daptomycin plus a fluoroquinolone, with MRSA risk guiding the need for vancomycin or daptomycin up front [^117Cu1of] [^115wn2nT].

> Let me think about dosing and pharmacokinetics. For vancomycin, 15–20 mg/kg IV every 12 hours with consideration of a loading dose and therapeutic drug monitoring is standard; for ceftriaxone, 2 g IV every 24 hours provides reliable bone and soft-tissue penetration and aligns with guideline-preferred agents for staphylococcal and streptococcal coverage; I initially thought vancomycin 1 g IV every 12 hours might suffice, but wait, that underdoses many adults and risks subtherapeutic exposure, so weight-based dosing with monitoring is the safer, guideline-concordant approach [^115Jk7FS] [^117Cu1of].

> Next, I should review duration and the IV-to-oral transition. The standard duration for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis is 6 weeks, and a randomized trial demonstrated that 6 weeks is noninferior to 12 weeks for clinical cure at 1 year; after 2–4 weeks of IV therapy, transition to high-bioavailability oral agents is acceptable if the patient is clinically improving and inflammatory markers are trending down, with total therapy still 6 weeks [^112tYHvh] [^111q8f8W] [^116FphPv].

> I will now examine source control and neurologic surveillance. If there is an epidural abscess, progressive neurologic deficit, or intractable pain from a compressive collection, urgent surgical consultation for decompression is indicated; minimally invasive CT-guided drainage can be effective in selected epidural abscesses when feasible, but I need to ensure that any delay in definitive decompression does not worsen outcomes in unstable patients [^115ruohf] [^114YWyjG].

> But wait, what if cultures remain negative despite optimal sampling. Culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis is not rare, and outcomes with 6 weeks of appropriately selected empiric therapy can still be favorable; I should double-check that the regimen covered the likely pathogens and that adherence and drug exposure were adequate before declaring failure, and consider repeat biopsy or imaging if the clinical course stalls [^113eSZGQ] [^1135ZLNp].

> Let me consider special scenarios and adjustments. If the patient has a severe beta-lactam allergy, vancomycin plus a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin can be used for gram-negative coverage, though fluoroquinolones should be reserved given safety concerns and local resistance patterns; if Cutibacterium acnes is suspected in the context of prior spinal procedures, higher-dose beta-lactam therapy and longer durations may be needed due to organism characteristics and biofilm biology, but I should confirm the procedural history before anchoring on that pathogen [^115wn2nT] [^112BSbfD] [^112U94Vp].

> I need to ensure appropriate monitoring and endpoints. Clinical improvement in pain and function, coupled with downward trends in CRP and ESR by about 4 weeks, supports response; routine repeat MRI is not needed if the patient is improving, but imaging is reasonable if there is suspected treatment failure or new neurologic symptoms, and I should reassess the spectrum and penetration of therapy if markers fail to decline as expected [^116FphPv] [^114A3yic].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows, with the caveat to individualize based on hemodynamics and neurologic status. If the patient is stable, I would hold empiric antibiotics, obtain blood cultures, and arrange CT-guided biopsy to secure a microbiologic diagnosis; if she is unstable or has evolving neurologic deficits, I would start empiric vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 12 hours with monitoring plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 24 hours, continue IV therapy for 2–4 weeks, then transition to an appropriate oral agent to complete a total of 6 weeks, adjusting to culture results as soon as available [^116x95ao] [^117Cu1of] [^115Jk7FS] [^112tYHvh].

---

For acute L5-S1 discitis in a 37-year-old female without IV drug use or GU infection, **empiric IV vancomycin plus ceftriaxone** is recommended to cover MRSA, MSSA, streptococci, and gram-negatives [^117Cu1of]. If the patient is stable, **delay empiric therapy until cultures** are obtained [^116x95ao]; if unstable or neurologically compromised, start immediately [^115ruohf]. Adjust to culture results, and treat for a total of **6 weeks** (IV then oral) [^112tYHvh]. Monitor clinically and with ESR/CRP; repeat MRI only if the response is poor [^116FphPv].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should cover the most likely pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA/MRSA), streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli [^115mBetm]. A **standard regimen** is vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 12 hours plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 24 hours [^117Cu1of]. Alternatives include daptomycin plus a fluoroquinolone or carbapenem for beta-lactam allergy or resistant organisms [^117Cu1of].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain before antibiotics when possible to maximize yield [^114A34PE].
- **MRI**: Gold standard for diagnosis and extent assessment [^notfound].
- **Biopsy**: CT-guided biopsy if blood cultures are negative or to guide therapy [^1148zQTS].

---

## Duration of therapy

Treat for a total of **6 weeks** (IV then oral) based on clinical response and inflammatory markers [^112tYHvh]. Shorter courses (4 weeks) may be considered in select cases with rapid response and negative cultures, but 6 weeks is standard.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular assessment of pain, neurologic status, and systemic signs.
- **Laboratory monitoring**: ESR and CRP at baseline and periodically; trends guide therapy [^116FphPv].
- **Imaging**: Repeat MRI only if clinical response is poor or neurologic deficits develop [^116FphPv].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for **neurologic compromise** (motor weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction) [^115ruohf], **epidural abscess** with significant cord compression, or **spinal instability** due to vertebral destruction. Early decompression improves outcomes in these scenarios [^notfound].

---

## Antibiotic recommendations

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | 15–20 mg/kg IV | Every 12 hours | MRSA, MSSA, streptococci |
| Ceftriaxone | 2 g IV | Every 24 hours | Gram-negative bacilli, streptococci |
| Daptomycin | 6 mg/kg IV | Every 24 hours | Alternative for MRSA |
| Fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) | 500–750 mg IV/PO | Daily | Alternative for Gram-negatives |

---

Empiric vancomycin plus ceftriaxone is **first-line** for acute L5-S1 discitis in a 37-year-old woman without IV drug use or GU infection; tailor therapy to cultures and treat for 6 weeks, with close clinical and laboratory monitoring.

A 47-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of pain in her lumbar back and right buttock. She had stopped injecting drugs 1 year ago. Physical examination was unremarkable except for paraspinal and right sacroiliac joint tenderness. MRI confirmed discitis, osteomyelitis and abscess formation in the L5-S1 disc space. She underwent extensive vertebral surgery and debridement of the spinal abscess. Her surgical cultures grew Mycobacterium fortuitum, and she was treated with an appropriate combination of intravenous antimicrobial therapy.

### Discitis following urinary tract infection manifesting as recurrent autonomic dysreflexia related to truncal movements in a person with tetraplegia [^114s5cPf]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 44-year-old male person with tetraplegia (C-5 AIS-A (American Spinal Cord Injury Association Standard Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale)) developed urinary tract infection and received appropriate antibiotic. Subsequently, he started sweating and shivering when he was sitting up; these symptoms resolved while lying on his back. Autonomic dysreflexia triggered by truncal movements continued to occur for 3 months. CT of the spine showed L5-S1 discitis. MRI of the spine showed diffuse marrow oedema in L5 and S1 vertebrae and a large abscess at L5/S1 level. Blood culture yielded Serratia marcescens sensitive to meropenem. Meropenem followed by ertapenem was given for 12 weeks. After 11 months, MRI showed resolution of discitis and epidural collection. The patient was able to sit up for 9hours without developing autonomic dysreflexia. If a person with cervical spinal cord injury develops posture-related autonomic dysreflexia (eg, in sitting position, lying on sides or while hoisted), disco-vertebral pathology should be suspected.

### Infectious spondylodiscitis [^114A34PE]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the available literature on infectious spondylodiscitis and provide recommendations on management, particularly identification of the causative agent and antimicrobial therapy.

Methods and Results

The medical literature was searched using PubMed, employing the key words discitis, disc space infection, infectious spondylodiscitis, pyogenic discitis, septic discitis and post-operative discitis. Infectious spondylodiscitis is rising in incidence and diagnosis has been facilitated by the availability of sensitive imaging techniques such as MRI. No randomized controlled studies of antimicrobial therapy were identified in this literature search and there appear to be no UK consensus guidelines on investigation and management. Comprehensive French guidelines have been published and were scrutinized for this review.

Conclusions

Unless the patient is severely unwell antimicrobial therapy should be delayed until a microbiological diagnosis is established. If initial blood cultures are negative then a CT-guided biopsy should be conducted. Tentative recommendations for antimicrobial therapy can be made based on theoretical considerations and limited data from uncontrolled studies.

We describe the case of a 3-year-old girl with a 15-day clinical history of lower back pain. We diagnosed a spondylodiscitis of vertebral bodies L5-S1 caused by Salmonella species group B that totally recovered with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Spondylodiscitis in children is a rare condition and Salmonella infection is one of the rarest aetiology. A high index of suspicion is needed for prompt diagnosis to ensure better long-term outcome. Microbiological diagnosis is essential for the appropriate choice of antibiotic treatment.

### Intradiscal pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics to treat chronic lower back pain [^115DPdyn]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

The standard use of prolonged IV antibiotics to treat pyogenic lumbar discitis raises the question of whether oral coamoxiclav achieves adequate tissue exposure to treat putative non-pyogenic disc infections. A comparison of tissue with serum concentrations or whether the tissue drug concentration is above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the bacterial species of interest does not provide a robust assessment of whether adequate antibacterial exposure has been achieved. The in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target for exposure to amoxicillin, which correlates with the efficacy of its approved uses, is the achievement of a free antibiotic concentration in the target tissue above the MIC for more than 40% of the dosing interval; 40% fT > MIC. Furthermore, an appropriate exposure test must be based on population assessment, with > 90% of subjects achieving the appropriate PK/PD target, allowing for variable tissue exposure at the disc. The efficacy of amoxicillin in treating disc infections can be limited by the low concentrations of amoxicillin in the disc, but this may be partially offset by the relatively sensitive C. acnes with a low MIC 90 compared to other bacterial species, such as S. aureus. To assess whether the oral coamoxiclav dose regimens used to date provide adequate achievement of the PK/PD target in disc tissue, data from the literature were used to estimate the disc tissue exposure.

Secondary pharmacokinetic analysis

In this study, the tabulated and graphical data in Housden and Sullivan (1993) were evaluated, and the mean amoxicillin concentrations in disc tissue after intravenous administration of coamoxiclav (1000 mg/200 mg) were estimated to be 2.9 µg/g at 30 min and 0.6 µg/g at 90 min, and the mean serum concentrations were 45.2 µg/ml and 9.2 µg/ml respectively, providing a disc/serum ratio of ~6.5% at both time points (Table 2). Intradiscal clavulanic acid penetration was also a fraction of the serum concentration, approximately 5–10%, with some variability at 90 min with low concentrations (Table 3).

Assuming that exposure to amoxicillin in herniated disc tissue can also be estimated at 6.5% of the serum concentration after oral administration, and estimating the free amoxicillin concentration at 70% of the drug for disc tissue as it is for serum, and using linear proportional scaling for dose, the representative mean amoxicillin pharmacokinetics of herniated disc tissue was modelled (Fig. 1).

Cefuroxime prophylaxis in lumbar laminectomy and discectomy — randomized controlled trial evidence: A prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluated one preoperative 1.5 g dose of cefuroxime; of the 1237 patients, 613 received 1.5 g intravenous cefuroxime and 624 received placebo. Surgical site infection occurred in eight (1.3%) vs 18 (2.8%) patients (p = 0.073), and discitis was 0/613 vs 9/624 (p < 0.01), corresponding to a number necessary to treat of 69 patients; this provides Level I therapeutic evidence that a single dose of cefuroxime versus placebo tends to decrease rate of post operative infection and significantly reduces the rate of spondylodiscitis specifically.

### Impact of follow up blood cultures on outcomes of patients with community-onset gram-negative bloodstream infection [^1113djAw]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Higher mortality in patients without FUBC implies missed opportunities for source control, identification of complications, and optimization of antimicrobial management in this group compared to patients who had FUBC obtained. For example, in a patient who already underwent drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess, the finding of persistent GN-BSI may lead to placement of an additional drain or manipulation of the existing one to optimize source control. Similarly, persistent GN-BSI in a woman with back pain due to first episode of acute pyelonephritis may lead to renal imaging to identify an obstructing ureteric stone or lumbar imaging to identify a complication such as discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis. A doppler ultrasound examination in a patient with an indwelling central venous catheter for hemodialysis and persistent GN-BSI may reveal the diagnosis of septic deep venous thrombosis and allow optimization of antimicrobial treatment duration. While the proportion of patients with persistently positive FUBC varies between studies based on complexity of patient populations and frequency of obtaining FUBC in clinical practice, this proportion cannot be extrapolated to patients without FUBC in an observational cohort design that does not entail randomization. A clinical trial randomizing one group of patients with GN-BSI to have FUBC, as opposed to a comparator group where obtaining FUBC is left to the discretion of the treating clinician, is better equipped to answer this question. In the meantime, FUBC appear to have a role in the management of patients with GN-BSI who are expected to remain hospitalized for > 72 h.

### Spontaneous Corynebacterium discitis in a patient with chronic renal failure [^111aSj9u]. Spinal Cord (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report describing spontaneous Corynebacterium diptheria discitis in a patient with chronic renal failure.

Objectives

To describe this very rare form of discitis and the results of surgical and antibiotic therapy.

Setting

University Department of Neurosurgery, Turkey.

Case Report

A 55-year-old man with chronic renal failure presented with acute low-back pain. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested discitis and osteomyelitis at the L5-S1 level. The L5-S1 disc was operated upon and the discectomy material was sent for pathological and microbiological analysis.

Results

Pathological examination revealed infection and bacterial culture grew C. diptheria. The patient was prescribed combination antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, a third-generation cephalosporin, and rifampicin. Clinical status improved after 8 weeks of therapy. Lumbar MRI revealed remission of the discitis and osteomyelitis after 10 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Chronic renal failure patients with low-back pain should be investigated for spinal infection. These individuals are prone to low-grade infection in the form of discitis or osteomyelitis. Corynebacterium subspecies rarely cause spontaneous discitis. This case is interesting because of the unusual causal organism and the occurrence of discitis in the setting of chronic renal failure.

### Rare cause of back pain: Staphylococcus aureus vertebral osteomyelitis complicated by recurrent epidural abscess and severe sepsis [^114CTgJe]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

An epidural abscess represents a rare acute medical emergency, with a reported incidence of 2.5/10000 hospital admissions annually. The clinical features include fever, spinal pain, radiating nerve root pain and leg weakness. When sepsis is present, prompt recognition is required to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and surgical decompression. We present the case of a man aged 68 years presenting to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever, low back, right hip and leg pain. He was hypoxic, tachycardic and hypotensive. He required intubation and ventilation. An MRI spine confirmed a posterior epidural abscess from T12 to L4. Blood cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus He started treatment with linezolid and underwent incision and drainage. He remained septic and 8days later, a repeat MRI spine showed a peripherally enhancing posterior epidural collection from L2/L3 to L4/L5, consistent with a recurrent epidural abscess. Further drainage was performed. He developed bilateral knee pain requiring washout. His right knee synovial biopsy cultured S. aureus He continued treatment with linezolid for 6weeks until his C reactive protein was 0.8ng/L. He started neurorehabilitation. 10 weeks later, he became feverish with lumbar spine tenderness. An MRI spine showed discitis of the L5/S1 endplate. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed discitis and osteomyelitis. Histology was positive for S. aureus and he started treatment with oral linezolid. After 19days, he was discharged with 1 week of oral linezolid 600mg 2 times per day, followed by 1 further week of oral clindamycin 600mg 4 times daily. This case report reinforces the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion, with a prompt diagnosis and combined medical and surgical treatment to prevent adverse outcomes in this patient cohort. With spinal surgical services centralised, physicians may not encounter this clinical diagnosis more often in day-to-day hospital medical practice. The unique aspect of this case is the persistence and then the recurrence (despite 6weeks of antimicrobial therapy and a second debridement) of S. aureus infection. Furthermore, the paucity of clinical recommendations and the controversy regarding the adequate duration of antimicrobial therapy are notable features of this case.

When empiric therapy is deemed appropriate, physicians should use regimens that would include coverage against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli; such regimens might include vancomycin plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, with alternatives in allergy or intolerance including daptomycin plus a quinolone.

### Best practices: CT-guided percutaneous sampling of vertebral discitis-osteomyelitis and technical factors maximizing biopsy yield [^1148zQTS]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Vertebral discitis-osteomyelitis is an infection of the intervertebral disk and vertebral bodies that may extend to adjacent paraspinal and epidural soft tissues. Its incidence is increasing, likely because of improved treatments and increased life expectancy for patients with predisposing chronic disease and increased rates of IV drug use and intravascular intervention. Because blood cultures are frequently negative in patients with vertebral discitis-osteomyelitis, biopsy is often indicated to identify a causative microorganism for targeted antimicrobial therapy. The reported yield of CT-guided percutaneous sampling is 31–91%, which is lower than the reported yield of open biopsy of 76–91%. However, the less invasive approach may be favored given its relative safety and low cost. If paravertebral fluid collections are present, CT-guided aspiration should be performed. If aspiration is unsuccessful or no paravertebral fluid collections are present, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy should be performed, considering technical factors (e.g., anatomic approach, needle selection, and needle angulation) that may improve microbiologic yield. Although antimicrobial therapy should be withheld for 1–2 weeks before biopsy if clinically feasible, biopsy may still be performed without stopping antimicrobial therapy if needed. Because of the importance of targeted antimicrobial therapy, repeat biopsy should be considered after 72 hours if initial biopsy does not identify a pathogen.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11619zp2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to definitive therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice for patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, including acute pyelonephritis. Recognize that patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from complicated UTI (≤ 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality. Routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Unlabelled

Spinal infections affect the vertebral bodies, the intervertebral disks, the spinal canal, and the paravertebral soft tissues and structures. A delay in diagnosis can result in spine deformity, substantial neurologic complications, and even death. Because of this, a high level of awareness is required by physicians in order to diagnose infections of the spine promptly. Advances in medical microbiologic testing and newer imaging methods have contributed considerably to the medical treatment of these infections. Through careful followup, less invasive approaches orchestrated by a multidisciplinary team that includes a spine surgeon, an infectious diseases specialist, and a neuroradiologist may be sufficient to treat patients with these infections. Research done through multidisciplinary collaborations will further advance our knowledge for the successful treatment of spinal infections.

Methods

Study design and patients' characteristics

Both clinical and imaging data were retrospectively collected between September 2005 and December 2021) from our institutional database. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The local ethics committee approved the study (approval number 880/2021). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study. Patients aged 18–64 years, 65–79 years, and ≥ 80 years with SEA with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) across the thoracic and lumbar spine were consecutively enrolled. The diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (Figs. 1 and 2). The spinal stability of the affected spine was evaluated using computed tomography (CT). Osteoporotic signs were identified by the degree of vertebral reduction, cortical disruption, and impaction of trabeculae, with increased density adjacent to the endplate, as displayed in the CT scans. All patients aged ≥ 80 years presented with signs of osteoporosis. Bone densitometry was not possible because of the acute neurological deterioration demanding a swift switch to therapy. The exclusion criteria were as follows: bony deconstruction resulting in kyphosis or subluxation of the vertebral column, a vertebral collapse of > 50%, bone necrosis, complete loss of disc height, intracranial or cervical pathology, age < 18 years, and insufficient documentation of the requisite data.

### Antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks versus 12 weeks in patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled trial [^112tYHvh]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Duration of treatment for patients with vertebral osteomyelitis is mainly based on expert recommendation rather than evidence. We aimed to establish whether 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 12 weeks in patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.

Methods

In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with microbiologically confirmed pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis and typical radiological features from 71 medical care centres across France. Patients were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks or 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment (physician's choice in accordance with French guidelines) by a computer-generated randomisation list of permuted blocks, stratified by centre. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were classified as cured at 1 year by a masked independent validation committee, analysed by intention to treat. Non-inferiority would be declared if the proportion of cured patients assigned to 6 weeks of treatment was not less than the proportion of cured patients assigned to 12 weeks of treatment, within statistical variability, by an absolute margin of 10%. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2006–000951–18, and Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00764114.

Findings

Between Nov 15, 2006, and March 15, 2011, 359 patients were randomly assigned, of whom six in the 6-week group and two in the 12-week group were excluded after randomisation. 176 patients assigned to the 6-week treatment regimen and 175 to the 12-week treatment regimen were analysed by intention to treat. 160 (90.9%) of 176 patients in the 6-week group and 159 (90.9%) of 175 of those in the 12-week group met the criteria for clinical cure. The difference between the groups (0.05%, 95% CI -6.2 to 6.3) showed the non-inferiority of the 6-week regimen when compared with the 12-week regimen. 50 patients in the 6-week group and 51 in the 12-week group had adverse events, the most common being death (14 [8%] in the 6-week group vs 12 [7%] in the 12-week group), antibiotic intolerance (12 [7%] vs 9 [5%]), cardiorespiratory failure (7 [4%] vs 12 [7%]), and neurological complications (7 [4%] vs 3 [2%]).

Interpretation

6 weeks of antibiotic treatment is not inferior to 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment with respect to the proportion of patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis cured at 1 year, which suggests that the standard antibiotic treatment duration for patients with this disease could be reduced to 6 weeks.

Outcome and follow-up

The lumbar pain decreased and the patient presented no fever during his hospital stay. The CRP decreased from 256 mg/L at postoperative day 3 to day 47 at the last hospitalisation day as well as the WCC, which became normal at 4.7 G/L.

The patient was discharged from the hospital after 11 days, with the surgical wound healing well (figure 3). The antibiotic treatment was finally changed to intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for the remaining 4 weeks in order to achieve a 6-week duration of antibiotics. The infected teeth were treated by surgical avulsion of the teeth 27 and 28. At a 6-week follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and the CRP was 6 mg/L, with satisfactory wound healing. After 1 year, a lumbar MRI showed the same collapse of the L5-S1 but no sign of persistent or recurrent infection (figure 4).

The proportion of serum amoxicillin concentration in disc tissue was calculated in two ways.

The proportion of serum clavulanic acid concentration in disc tissue was calculated in two ways. The first used the mean concentrations at 30 and 90 min, and the second estimated the proportion for each subject and averaged the results.

Coamoxiclav is not indicated for the treatment of bone or disc infections. β-lactam antibiotics penetrate these tissues at concentrations < 10% of those in serum. Pyogenic lumbar spondylodiscitis, a purulent bacterial infection, is typically treated with IV antibiotic administration for 4–6 weeks, followed by oral therapy for another 6 weeks. C. acnes prosthetic joint infections are typically treated both surgically and medically, reducing the bacterial burden by synovectomy, prosthetic revision, and an initial IV antibiotic phase of 2–6 weeks followed by oral antibiotic therapy for another 6–10 weeks. A case report on the treatment of C. acnes discitis associated with vertebral endplate changes described the use of ceftriaxone 2 g IV Q24 h × 6 weeks through a peripherally inserted central catheter. The use of high-dose IV therapies with high serum exposure may lead to sufficient antibiotic exposure in the bone and disc tissues. Administration of intradiscal antibiotics twice weekly of 1–2 g cefazolin or vancomycin, depending on the bacterial infection for an average of 3.5 weeks, has also been reported.

### Pyogenic spondylitis in an S1-S2 immobile segment [^117BQBsZ]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case of pyogenic spondylitis in S1-S2 is presented.

Objective

To describe the diagnosis and management of this rare spondylitis.

Summary Of Background Data

The segment including the first and second sacral vertebrae is not mobile. Therefore, discitis of S1-S2 and adjacent spondylitis is very rare. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of infectious spondylitis in an immobile segment: S1-S2.

Methods

In addition to radiography and bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the diagnosis. Changes consistent with infectious spondylitis were shown, including an epidural abscess.

Results

The patient was treated with laparoscopic drainage and biopsy. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, and adequate antibiotics were administered. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging at approximately 4 months demonstrated normal signal intensity and disappearance of the abscess.

Conclusion

Findings from this study show that pyogenic spondylitis can occur in immobile S1-S2.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis — definition and rates of treatment failure are anchored in microbiologic confirmation: The most specific measure of treatment failure is microbiologically confirmed persistent infection despite receipt of targeted antimicrobial therapy for an appropriate duration, and microbiologically confirmed treatment failure rates occur in 0%–11% of NVO patients in contemporary cohorts. Ascribing treatment failure to NVO patients in the absence of microbiologic evidence may lead to overestimation of treatment failure and predispose patients to potentially unnecessary medical and surgical interventions.

The authors present the case of a 60-year-old man with a Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and associated lumbar discitis in whom a pauci immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and renal failure developed. Treatment with antibiotics and not immunosuppressive agents resulted in improved renal function with a discharge creatinine level of 1.87 mg/dL (165 micromol/L). This case highlights an association of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with discitis that responded to antibiotic therapy alone.

### CT-guided minimally invasive treatment for an extensive spinal epidural abscess: a case report and literature review [^114YWyjG]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We present a case involving an extensive epidural abscess that was successfully treated with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous needle drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.

Methods

A 44-year-old woman with a history of spine injection procedures complained of severe backache and progressive radiating pain in her right lower extremity followed by sensory deficits in her right lower limb. A laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis and hyperglycemia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar region revealed an extremely large posterior spinal epidural abscess (SEA) extending from L2 to S2. Because the patient did not respond to intravenous antibiotics alone, she underwent CT-guided percutaneous needle drainage and irrigation.

Results

Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the purulent material from this abscess. Her clinical symptoms were dramatically and immediately relieved after this procedure. She achieved complete neurological recovery after 2 months of antibiotic therapy.

Conclusion

CT-guided percutaneous needle drainage and irrigation may be a rational treatment choice for patients with SEA with the exception of patients with a chronic abscess, an anterior abscess or discitis.

### Epidural abscess related toin a 57-year-old immunocompetent patient [^116Q4kTB]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Spinal epidural abscess, a collection of pus or inflammation between the thecal sac and surrounding tissue, is a rare condition in healthy adult patients, with an incidence of 2.4 cases per 100 000 persons. Around half of the cases are due to a haematogenous spread, and almost a third because of a discitis spread. The most frequent microorganism is Staphylococcus aureus in 50%–65% of cases, followed by Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli (18%) and Pseudomonas species in intravenous drug users. Usually seen in adults aged more than 60 years, risk factors include immunodeficiency, HIV infection, malignancy, immunosuppressive treatments and intravenous drug abuse. Adequate timely diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess is crucial because around one-fourth of patients may develop motor deficit or paralysis.

We describe here the case of a healthy patient who presented a lumbar spinal epidural abscess related to a dental infection following lumbar torsion, without any risk factor.

### Treatment guideline for patients with native culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis [^113eSZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With the development of evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, various nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies have achieved favorable results. However, sufficient administration of appropriate antibiotics is a prerequisite for treatment success, which cannot be guaranteed in patients with culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, previous studies on culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis were limited by small patient groups, short follow-up periods, varied treatment protocols, and inconsistently defined clinical endpoints.

Questions/Purposes

Among patients treated according to our center's treatment protocol for culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, which included patients treated without surgery, with surgery but without spinal instrumentation, as well as patients treated with instrumented surgery, (1) what proportion of patients in each treatment group experienced recurrence (or persistence) of infection, complications of treatment, and death; and (2) what factors were independently associated with recurrent or persistent infection after treatment under this algorithm?

Methods

This was a retrospective evaluation of a treatment protocol in use at one center from 2008 to 2020. During that time, we treated 183 patients for culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. The diagnosis was based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological features excluding disease that presents similar features to pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. For those patients, our protocol included three possible approaches: nonsurgical treatment, including the use of empirical antibiotics (nonoperative group, n = 82); spinal decompression without instrumentation (noninstrumented group, n = 41); and spinal decompression with instrumentation (instrumented group, n = 60). The indications for each treatment during the period remained relatively consistent. Nonsurgical treatment including empirical antibiotics was applied to all patients according to the specified antibiotic protocol. Spinal decompression without instrumentation was employed when a patient presented substantial or aggravating neurologic deficits or intractable pain from an abscess. Instrumentation was added in patients with mechanical instability before or after spinal decompression. Minimum follow-up to be included in this study was 1 year, and 91% (252 of 277) of patients were accounted for at that time, with no differential loss to follow-up among the study groups (12, five, and four patients missing from the three groups, respectively, at 1 year). Chart review was performed to ascertain the proportion of patients in each group who experienced recurrence, complications, and death. Factors associated with recurrence were assessed across the entire cohort using a multivariable logistic model. We analyzed 1-year recurrence and mortality rates using the Kaplan-Meier method, and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the method by Hosmer and Lemeshow.

Results

At 1 year, the recurrence-free survival rate was 87% (95% confidence interval 78% to 93%) in the nonoperative group, 87% (95% CI 72% to 94%) in the noninstrumented group, and 91% (95% CI 80% to 96%) in the instrumented group. The proportion of patients who experienced a major medical complication in each group was 12% (10 of 82), 10% (4 of 41), and 8% (5 of 60), respectively. At 1 year, the survival rate with patient death as the endpoint was 95% (95% CI 88% to 98%) in the nonoperative group, 95% (95% CI 82% to 99%) in the noninstrumented group, and 97% (95% CI 87% to 99%) in the instrumented group. After controlling for potentially confounding variables including age, medical comorbidities, and anatomical involvement of infection, the following factors were independently associated with increased odds of infection recurrence or persistence: higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (odds ratio 1.6 per point on the CCI [95% CI 1.2 to 2.1]; p = 0.004) and the presence of a psoas abscess (OR 4.7 [95% CI 1.6 to 13.9]; p = 0.005).

Conclusion

Among patients with negative initial nonoperative culture results, spinal decompression and abscess drainage can be used in those with substantial or aggravating neurological deficits or intractable pain caused by an abscess, while additional early spinal instrumentation can be applied upon consideration of their medical comorbidities and the presence of a psoas abscess when mechanical instability is present before or after the spinal decompression. Reasonable clinical results can be expected, regardless of the results from subsequent operative cultures. However, our study results should be replicated by other centers, and further studies that consider individual differences such as bone mineral density and include patients with previous spinal instrumentation or recurrent infection should be performed to establish a more comprehensive treatment protocol.

A 50-year-old man with no medical history of note presented with new onset of confusion and dyspnoea. He tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), and subsequently, was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe sepsis and acute renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Shortly afterwards, he was intubated due to haemodynamic instability. His blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, and echocardiogram showed evidence of vegetation in the aortic valve area. He was commenced on intravenous antibiotics for infective endocarditis (IE). Following extubation, he underwent an MRI of the spine due to increasing back pain. This was suggestive of L5-S1 discitis, likely secondary to septic emboli from IE. A few days later, he developed acute ischaemia of the left toes and extensive thrombosis of the right cubital and left iliac veins. Following a prolonged hospital admission, he was discharged home and later underwent an elective forefoot amputation from which he made a good recovery.

### Understanding the management of pediatric spondylodiscitis based on existing literature; a systematic review [^113NkT17]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, some patients have been treated with antibiotics due to a history of other diseases or infections, which has caused negative culture results. However, not all patients who had a negative blood culture were previously treated with antibiotics or had a history of previous diseases. This difference can be due to other etiologies of spondylodiscitis besides bacterial infectious diseases, including viral infections or inflammatory conditions, or, in some cases, the possibility of a failure of the organism growing in the culture, errors in sampling techniques, and the unavailability of tissue samples.

A biopsy is not necessary for patients demonstrating clear clinical features but is indicated for those whose symptoms do not rapidly improve with treatment or who have atypical presentations. Due to low yield, morbidity, and the need for sedation or general anesthesia in young children, a biopsy is not routinely recommended to evaluate children with spondylodiscitis. Biopsy results often yield low results due to confounding factors such as inadequate sampling, culture technique, previous antibiotic treatment, or rapid host response to a low-virulence pathogen.

Spondylodiscitis has four radiographic stages: the latent stage, when x-rays are frequently normal; the acute phase, which occurs within two to four weeks of the onset of symptoms and is characterized by narrowing and erosion of the disc space; the healing phase, which takes place two to three months after radiography changes and is characterized by sclerosis of the contours of the vertebral body; and late stage, is characterized by a narrowing of the affected disc space.

The initial imaging study should be plain radiographs of the suspected area to rule out other causes of pain. However, radiographs at the onset of discitis are usually normal and, after 2 or 3 weeks, show the disease's progression and often require other advanced techniques. The primary X-ray features suggest loss of disc height, periosteal abscess, bone consolidation, destruction of the vertebral body, irregularity of the vertebral erosions of the adjacent vertebral endplate, and intervertebral disc space narrowing. Plain radiographs reveal isolated intervertebral disk space narrowing when symptoms present for one week or more. By 3 to 4 weeks, tooth erosion of adjacent vertebral endplates had been seen.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^114qA1J6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

An important limitation of traditional clinical guidelines is the frequent dissociation between quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. As a result, some past guideline recommendations have endorsed harmful care, which was only subsequently recognized when high-quality, prospective controlled trials were conducted. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel approach, called WikiGuidelines, to establish clear recommendations only when high-quality, hypothesis-confirming evidence is available (see group charter in Supplement 1).

Our initial social media poll revealed a desire for renewed guidance on a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pyogenic osteomyelitis occurs at a rate of approximately 20 cases per 100 000 person-years, with rates rising among patients with diabetes and older patients, as well as those with prosthetic joints. In low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), osteomyelitis may be more common in younger patients as a result of traumatic injury. Nevertheless, the global economic burden of osteomyelitis is considerable for high-income countries and LMIC.,

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease, with the earliest documented case in an unfortunate, 250-million-year-old dimetredon with a fractured spinal shaft. In the modern era, radiography, surgical methods, and antibiotics have revolutionized its management. However, these successful interventions have resulted in long-standing diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms that have guided treatment despite lacking strong evidence, including the need for diagnostic x-rays and intravenous-only antibiotic therapy for all patients. Recent studies have begun to challenge these dogmas. This guideline focuses on data regarding management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults (see Supplement 2 for the complete guidelines).

### Balancing the benefits and costs of antibiotic drugs: the TREAT model [^113zCA2B]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

TREAT is a computerized decision support system aimed at improving empirical antibiotic treatment of inpatients with suspected bacterial infections. It contains a model that balances, for each antibiotic choice (including 'no antibiotics'), expected benefit and expected costs. The main benefit afforded by appropriate, empirical, early antibiotic treatment in moderate to severe infections is a better chance of survival. Each antibiotic drug was consigned three cost components: cost of the drug and administration; cost of side effects; and costs of future resistance. 'No treatment' incurs no costs. The model worked well for decision support. Its analysis showed, yet again, that for moderate to severe infections, a model that does not include costs of resistance to future patients will always return maximum antibiotic treatment. Two major moral decisions are hidden in the model: how to take into account the limited life-expectancy and limited quality of life of old or very sick patients; and how to assign a value for a life-year of a future, unnamed patient vs. the present, individual patient.

- TMP/SMX 160/800 mg BID for 3 days, if local resistance rates of uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis are < 20% or if the infecting strain is known to be susceptible

- fosfomycin trometamol 3 g in a single dose, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it appears to have inferior efficacy compared with standard short-course regimens

- pivmecillinam (in regions where it is available) 400 mg BID for 3–7 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it may have inferior efficacy compared with other available therapies.

ASRA Pain Medicine — screening, decolonization, hygiene, antibiotics, and hair removal to reduce surgical site infections: Perioperative blood glucose should ideally be maintained at ≤ 150 mg/dl for implantable device surgeries. Patients should be tested for Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) using a nasal swab, and decolonization should be performed in colonized patients prior to pain device implantation. In individuals known previously to be carriers, decolonization should be repeated prior to additional procedures beyond 90 days from initial decolonization, and decolonization should occur no earlier than 10 days prior to the planned surgery. When performing decolonization, use mupirocin nasal application and chlorhexidine body wash. Hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub prior to the first case of the day, before and after glove use, before and after patient contact, and any time hands are visibly soiled is directed, with use of alcohol-based scrub for manufacturer recommended time or surgical hand scrub for at least 2 min. Appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis administered within 1 hour prior to surgical incision (2 hours for vancomycin) is recommended; prophylactic intradiscal and intravenous antibiotics have not been shown to conclusively decrease the rate of discitis in humans. Vancomycin should only be used in patients colonized with MRSA or who are at high risk for MRSA. Do not perform hair removal routinely prior to procedures, and if hair is removed, use electric clippers immediately before surgery.

### Spondylodiscitis… [^113dQpXA]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

Spondylodiscitis is a combination of discitis and spondylitis, the latter generally involving the areas adjacent to the intervertebral disc space. Causes Spondylodiscitis is the most common complication of sepsis or local infection, usually in the form of an abscess. The overall incidence of infectious spondylodiscitis is estimated at around 3 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants per year, consistent with recent epidemiological studies. The main causative organisms are staphylococci, but potential organisms include a large number of bacteria, fungi, zoonoses. Spondylodiscitis frequently develops in immunocompromised individuals, such as by a cancer, infection, or by immunosuppressive drugs used for organ transplantations.

Diagnosis The main methods to diagnose a spondylodiscitis are magnetic resonance imaging, biopsy and microbiological tests such as PCR to determine an infectious cause. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography has shown higher diagnostic accuracy than labeled leukocyte scintigraphy and is increasingly used alongside MRI in doubtful cases. Treatment Approximately 90% of cases can be treated conservatively. In the absence of spinal cord/nerve root compression and lack of data on instability of the inflamed segment, conservative treatment with:

- Antibiotics
- empirical treatment should start AFTER biopsy material for microbiological testing is obtained. The following empirical treatment may be administered for a total of 6 weeks:

- Ceftriaxone 2x2g and Clindamycin 3x600mg i. v. for 2 weeks
- Ciprofloxacin 2x500mg and Clindamycin 4x300mg p. o.

for 4 more weeks If the pathogen can be identified
- antibiotic treatment should be adapted to the susceptibilities of the microorganism.

### Discitis… [^116uKx3b]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Discitis, or diskitis, is an infection in the intervertebral disc space that affects different age groups. Symptoms include severe back pain, leading to lack of mobility. In adults, it can lead to severe consequences, such as sepsis or epidural abscess, but it can also spontaneously resolve, especially in children under 8 years of age. Discitis occurs post-surgically in approximately 1–2 percent of patients after spinal surgery. There is debate as to the cause. Diagnosis is usually apparent on MRI, although plain X-rays and CT examinations can be suggestive. Treatment is difficult and usually includes antibiotics. Reducing the mobility of the affected region is an occasionally recommended solution, but changes from case to case. Description Discitis is an infection in the intervertebral disc space. It affects different age groups. Signs and symptoms Symptoms include severe back pain, leading to lack of mobility.

In adults, it can lead to severe consequences, such as sepsis or epidural abscess, but it can also spontaneously resolve, especially in children under 8 years of age. Discitis occurs post-surgically in approximately 1–2 percent of patients after spinal surgery. Some very young children may refuse to walk and arching of the back is possible. In post-operative situations, the symptoms occur within a week and result in severe low back pain or neck pain. If untreated, the discitis may resolve on its own, causing spontaneous fusion of the intervertebral disc space, cause a chronic low grade infection, or progress to osteomyelitis and possibly even an epidural abscess. In case of concomitant inflammation of one or more vertebrae the condition is called spondylodiscitis. Epidemiology According to a 2008 study, the incidence of discitis in the United States is around 0.

4 to
2. 4 per 100, 000 people each year depending on age group. According to a later 2016 study, the combined prevalence of discitis and vertebral osteomyelitis with or without spinal epidural abscess for persons under 20 years old is uncommon, and higher in older patients. Causes There is debate as to the cause, although hematogenous seeding of the offending organism is favored as well as direct spread. Spontaneous discitis is usually from hematologic spread from a urinary or respiratory infection while discitis from a post-operative complication usually involves skin flora such as staph aureus. It can be caused due to spinal tuberculosis and spread along spinal ligament to involve the adjacent anterior vertebral bodies, causing angulation of the vertebrae with subsequent kyphosis. The cause may be aseptic.

Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually apparent on MRI, although plain X-rays and CT examinations can be suggestive. The MRI will reveal air changes in the disc and possibly even external involvement involving the bone or epidural regions. A biopsy may be performed and helps with diagnosis in some cases but often an organism is not obtained. C-reactive protein levels and ESR levels will be elevated and are useful for treatment. The white blood cell count may be normal. Differential diagnosis includes other common causes of back pain and the potential for rarer infections, noting that some differential diagnoses like epidural abscesses and osteomyelitis may be caused by discitis or have a separate cause. This includes:

- Osteomyelitis
- Spinal tumors
- Spinal epidural abscess
- Spinal fracture
- Muscle or tendon injury
- Spinal disc herniation
- Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies.

### Doxycycline [^113q5k6T]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Medical uses In addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease, chronic prostatitis, sinusitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, severe acne, rosacea, and rickettsial infections. The efficiency of oral doxycycline for treating papulopustular rosacea and adult acne is not solely based on its antibiotic properties, but also on its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties. Antibacterial General indications Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is employed in the treatment of numerous bacterial infections. It is effective against bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis, Brucella melitensis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Additionally, doxycycline is used in the prevention and treatment of serious conditions like anthrax, leptospirosis, bubonic plague, and Lyme disease.

However, some bacteria have shown resistance to doxycycline, including Haemophilus spp. Mycoplasma hominis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is also effective against Yersinia pestis, and is prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Specifically, doxycycline is indicated for treatment of the following diseases:

- Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, scrub typhus, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsia.
- respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
- Lymphogranuloma venereum, trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

Indications for Gram-negative bacteria When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug, doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria:

- Escherichia coli infections,
- Klebsiella aerogenes infections,
- Shigella species infections,
- Acinetobacter species infections,
- respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae,
- respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Indications for Gram-positive bacteria Some Gram-positive bacteria have developed resistance to doxycycline. Up to 44% of Streptococcus pyogenes and up to 74% of S. faecalis specimens have developed resistance to the tetracycline group of antibiotics. When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug, doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria:

- upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,
- skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections,
- anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis infection. Penicillin contraindication When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline can be used to treat:

- syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum,
- yaws caused by Treponema pertenue,
- listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes,
- Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme,
- actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii,
- infections caused by Clostridium species. Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline is widely used as an adjunctive treatment to scaling and root planing for periodontitis. SDD is also used to treat skin conditions such as acne and rosacea, including ocular rosacea. In ocular rosacea, treatment period is 2 to 3 months.

### Levofloxacin… [^1162fiAD]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin, sold under the brand name Levaquin among others, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It is the left-handed isomer of the medication ofloxacin. It is used to treat a number of bacterial infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, H. pylori, urinary tract infections, Legionnaires' disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it may be used to treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. A warning concerning all fluoroquinolones was issued in 2016: "An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together.

These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system". Medical uses Levofloxacin is used to treat infections including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form. As of 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that "serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs generally outweigh the benefits for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who have other treatment options. For patients with these conditions, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who do not have alternative treatment options". Levofloxacin is used for the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections.

As of 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of America and the American Thoracic Society recommended levofloxacin and other respiratory fluoroquinolines as first line treatment for community acquired pneumonia when co-morbidities such as heart, lung, or liver disease are present or when in-patient treatment is required. Levofloxacin also plays an important role in recommended treatment regimens for ventilator-associated and healthcare-associated pneumonia. As of 2010 it was recommended by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with rifampicin as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections.

The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial prostatitis when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it was recommended to treat bacterial prostatitis by the NIH research network studying the condition. Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones have also been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections, indications for which major medical societies generally recommend the use of older, narrower spectrum drugs to avoid fluoroquinolone resistance development. Due to its widespread use, common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have developed resistance. In many countries as of 2013, resistance rates among healthcare-associated infections with these pathogens exceeded 20%. Levofloxacin is also used as antibiotic eye drops to prevent bacterial infection.

### Quinolone antibiotic… [^112U94Vp]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

Medical uses Fluoroquinolones are frequently prescribed for genitourinary tract infections and are widely used in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections associated with urinary catheters. The FDA published a 2018 safety alert recommending FQs be reserved for use only in patients who have no alternative treatment options for the following indications: uncomplicated urinary tract infection, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis. In community-acquired infections, they are only recommended when risk factors for multidrug resistance are present or after other antibiotic regimens have failed. However, for serious acute cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis where the person may need to be hospitalised, fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy.

Due to people with sickle-cell disease being at increased risk for developing osteomyelitis from Salmonella, fluoroquinolones are the "drugs of choice" for this organism due to their ability to enter bone tissue without chelating it, as tetracyclines are known to do. In biofilm-associated infections, quinolones exhibit a good ability to penetrate the biofilm and target bacteria within it, especially during the early stages of biofilm formation. Their antibiofilm activity is generally higher than that of old beta-lactams and glycopeptides but remains lower compared to antibiotics such as tetracyclines, daptomycin, and fosfomycin, which demonstrate greater efficacy against biofilms. Fluoroquinolones are featured prominently in guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. In the UK, the prescribing indications for fluoroquinolones for children are severely restricted.

Only inhalational anthrax and pseudomonal infections in cystic fibrosis infections are licensed indications in the UK due to ongoing safety concerns. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, serious adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these were considered by the treating physician to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the study drug. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the U. S. FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 U. S. Meta-analyses conclude that fluoroquinolones pose little or no additional risk to children compared to other antibiotic classes.

Fluoroquinolone use in children may be appropriate when the infection is caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, or when alternative treatment options require parenteral administration and oral therapy is preferred. Adverse effects On May 12, 2016 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration advised that the serious, disabling and potentially permanent side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibiotics generally outweigh the benefits for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. These side effects can involve tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system as well as cardiac, dermatologic and worsening of myasthenia gravis conditions. With fluoroquinolones these effects are sometimes collectively called floxing. Some experts have advised avoidance of fluoroquinolones in athletes.
