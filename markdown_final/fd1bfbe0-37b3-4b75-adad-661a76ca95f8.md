## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about allergy diagnosis and management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical history and how to structure it to separate allergic from non-allergic causes. Then, I should verify the physical examination features that support an allergic diagnosis. Next, I will review when and how to use diagnostic testing, including skin prick tests, serum-specific IgE, and oral food challenges, and I need to ensure I interpret results in clinical context. After that, I should classify allergic diseases and consider comorbidities. Then, I will outline management principles, including pharmacotherapy, allergen avoidance, and immunotherapy, and I must double-check guideline-concordant choices. Finally, I will address special populations, prevention, and follow-up, and I will close with a concise decision algorithm that ties these steps together [^114WqBMt] [^112FVUn4] [^117X2fgw].

> Let me first confirm the primacy of the clinical history, because symptoms alone are not sufficient to diagnose allergy and can mimic non-allergic conditions; I need to check for temporal relationships to exposures, symptom patterns, and atopic history to raise or lower pretest probability before ordering tests [^113ZfNZr] [^117DqLFj]. I should ask about symptom timing relative to allergen exposure, organ systems involved, severity and progression, seasonality, occupational or environmental triggers, family and personal atopy, medication use including antihistamines, and prior testing or treatments, while also screening for red flags such as anaphylaxis, severe asthma, or poor growth in children [^117K7uwF] [^117RSuwD] [^112t3Pxx] [^112mV7F2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the physical examination features that support an allergic etiology, including pale, edematous nasal mucosa with clear secretions, allergic shiners, Dennie-Morgan lines, and conjunctival injection, while also checking for comorbid asthma, eczema, or otitis media with effusion that would influence management and risk stratification [^112FVUn4] [^111bMSs2]. I need to ensure I distinguish these findings from non-allergic rhinitis features such as boggy mucosa without itch or sneeze, and from infectious or structural causes that can mimic allergy [^113q5WXd] [^112a9tvF].

> Next, I should review when to test and when to treat empirically; in high-prevalence settings with classic symptoms, empiric intranasal corticosteroids or second-generation antihistamines are reasonable, but I should confirm the diagnosis with specific IgE testing when treatment fails, the diagnosis is uncertain, or when identifying triggers will change management such as for immunotherapy or avoidance strategies [^115Vu2GR] [^112FVUn4]. Wait, let me verify the principle that sensitization does not equal disease; positive skin or serum IgE must correlate with clinical symptoms and exposure to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^113zEVZv] [^115scSi8].

> I will now examine skin prick testing, which is generally preferred for inhalant allergens due to high sensitivity and immediate results; I should double-check that patients stop antihistamines appropriately and that testing is performed by trained personnel, and I must remember that false positives and cross-reactivity can occur, so results must be interpreted in the clinical context [^115scSi8] [^1147AT2D]. But wait, what if skin testing is not feasible or confounded by dermatographism or medications? In that case, serum-specific IgE is a reasonable alternative, though I need to ensure I do not over-order broad panels without a targeted history to avoid irrelevant positives [^1147AT2D] [^115scSi8].

> For suspected food allergy, I should confirm that the diagnosis hinges on a compatible history plus demonstration of allergen-specific IgE, recognizing that sensitization without clinical reactivity is common; oral food challenges remain the gold standard when the history is unclear or when I need to establish tolerance or a safe threshold, and I must be prepared to treat reactions during supervised challenges [^112KV8Qc] [^1119hUKZ] [^117X2fgw]. Hold on, I should verify that component-resolved diagnostics can refine risk stratification in some cases, but they do not replace the need for correlation with clinical history and, when necessary, food challenges [^11692HHo] [^114fxNiG].

> Let me consider the classification of allergic disease to guide management; IgE-mediated disorders include allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and food allergy, whereas non-IgE-mediated entities include eosinophilic esophagitis, food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome, and celiac disease, and mixed mechanisms occur in some conditions, so I need to ensure I match the phenotype to the mechanism before choosing therapy [^115KUnFP] [^112mV7F2] [^116CQZ6K] [^11349trv]. I should double-check for comorbid asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis because their coexistence alters treatment complexity and prognosis, and I must screen for anaphylaxis risk and provide epinephrine autoinjectors when indicated [^116M1AU5] [^111bMSs2].

> Now, I will outline management principles, starting with allergen avoidance and environmental controls when triggers are identified and avoidance is feasible; however, I need to ensure I do not overburden patients with low-certainty interventions, and I should tailor multicomponent dust mite strategies to sensitized individuals with symptoms rather than applying blanket recommendations [^115v8vcr] [^112FVUn4]. Wait, let me verify that for food allergy, strict avoidance plus emergency action plans and epinephrine access are foundational, and that emerging strategies like oral immunotherapy require specialist oversight and shared decision-making given variable efficacy and risk profiles [^112KV8Qc] [^114wJSGj].

> Pharmacotherapy should be symptom-targeted and guideline-concordant; for allergic rhinitis, intranasal corticosteroids are first-line for moderate to severe disease, second-generation oral antihistamines address itch and sneeze, intranasal antihistamines or combination therapy can be added for refractory symptoms, and leukotriene receptor antagonists have a limited role and are not first-line for primary AR therapy [^112FVUn4] [^113xC45y]. I should confirm that first-generation antihistamines are avoided in children and those who drive due to sedation and cognitive effects, and I must consider age-appropriate dosing and formulations for pediatric patients [^113xC45y] [^116SpnUo].

> For asthma, I need to ensure a stepwise controller approach with inhaled corticosteroids as the backbone, add-on therapy based on control and phenotype, and attention to allergic triggers; I should double-check that allergic rhinitis co-treatment improves asthma outcomes and that allergen mitigation is individualized and evidence-aligned rather than generic [^115v8vcr] [^112Fiqbo]. Hold on, I should verify that for food allergy, intramuscular epinephrine is first-line for anaphylaxis, that patients and caregivers are educated on early recognition and prompt use, and that delays worsen outcomes, so I must reinforce this at every visit [^112t3Pxx] [^112KV8Qc].

> Allergen immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying treatment for allergic rhinitis and can reduce medication needs long term; I should confirm eligibility with positive specific IgE correlating to symptoms and exposure, and choose subcutaneous or sublingual routes based on patient preference, comorbidities, and access, while avoiding immunotherapy in the absence of clinically relevant sensitization [^116r4wkR] [^112FVUn4]. Let me reconsider the timing and duration; multi-year courses are typically required to achieve durable benefit, and I should set expectations accordingly [^116r4wkR].

> Special populations require tailored approaches; in children, I need to ensure age-appropriate testing and treatment, recognize that cow's milk and egg allergy often remit and require planned reintroduction, and provide school action plans and epinephrine training for food allergy [^113zVtzm] [^112mV7F2]. In pregnancy, I should prefer second-generation antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids if needed, and avoid initiating immunotherapy; in older adults, I must watch for anticholinergic burden and drug interactions, and in occupational allergy, I should integrate exposure modification with medical management and consider legal protections [^116r4wkR] [^113xC45y].

> Prevention and follow-up are integral; I should confirm that for infants at risk of peanut allergy, early introduction strategies can reduce incidence, and for all patients, periodic reassessment of triggers, control, and comorbidities is necessary, with explicit plans for food reintroduction in non-IgE-mediated disease and vigilance for emerging or resolving sensitizations [^113JbaC6] [^112mV7F2]. I need to ensure patients have written emergency plans, up-to-date epinephrine prescriptions, and education on cofactors that lower reaction thresholds, and I should schedule follow-up to track adherence, adverse effects, and quality-of-life impact [^112t3Pxx] [^112KV8Qc].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm without oversimplifying: start with a detailed history and exam to estimate pretest probability; if probability is high and symptoms are typical, initiate guideline-directed pharmacotherapy and reassess; if probability is low or symptoms are atypical, evaluate for non-allergic mimics; if the diagnosis remains uncertain or immunotherapy is contemplated, perform targeted skin or serum IgE testing and interpret results in clinical context; for suspected food allergy, correlate history with specific IgE and proceed to supervised oral food challenge when needed; throughout, screen for comorbid asthma, atopic dermatitis, and ocular disease, provide epinephrine and education for anaphylaxis risk, and consider immunotherapy for eligible patients with persistent symptoms despite optimized pharmacotherapy [^112FVUn4] [^114WqBMt] [^117X2fgw] [^116r4wkR].

Allergies are **IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions** to otherwise harmless environmental or dietary allergens, driven by mast cell degranulation and type 2 inflammation [^114WqBMt]. They are diagnosed by correlating clinical history with **skin prick or serum-specific IgE testing** [^112FVUn4], and confirmed for food allergy with **oral food challenges** when needed [^117X2fgw]. Management centers on **allergen avoidance**, patient education, and pharmacotherapy (antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, epinephrine for anaphylaxis) [^113xC45y], with allergen immunotherapy as the only disease-modifying option for selected patients [^113xC45y]. Allergies are common and rising, especially in children, and impose substantial quality-of-life and economic burdens [^115Ww25M] [^112Uv1yf].

---

## Pathophysiology

Allergies are **IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions** to otherwise harmless environmental or dietary allergens, driven by mast cell degranulation and type 2 inflammation [^114WqBMt]. Key mechanisms include sensitization (allergen exposure → Th2 activation → IgE production → mast cell binding) and re-exposure (allergen cross-links IgE → mast cell degranulation → mediator release → symptoms) [^114fxNiG]. Type 2 inflammation (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) sustains eosinophilic inflammation and chronic symptoms [^114WqBMt].

---

## Common allergens

Allergens vary by exposure route and geography; **common examples** include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Inhalant | - Pollen (trees, grasses, weeds) <br/> - Dust mites <br/> - Animal dander <br/> - Mold spores [^114WqBMt] |
| Food | - Peanuts <br/> - Tree nuts <br/> - Milk <br/> - Eggs <br/> - Shellfish <br/> - Soy <br/> - Wheat <br/> - Fish [^11349trv] |
| Insect venom | - Bee <br/> - Wasp <br/> - Fire ant stings [^113hSV21] |
| Medications | - Penicillin <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Chemotherapeutic agents [^113hSV21] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Allergic reactions span mild local symptoms to **severe systemic anaphylaxis**:

- **Respiratory**: sneezing, nasal congestion, wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal edema [^114WqBMt].
- **Cutaneous**: urticaria, angioedema, eczema [^115TSdYM].
- **Gastrointestinal**: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain [^116hYyxR].
- **Cardiovascular**: hypotension, shock [^112t3Pxx].
- **Anaphylaxis**: rapid-onset, multi-organ, potentially fatal reaction [^116PBTXd].

---

## Diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis relies on correlating clinical history with **objective testing**:

- **Clinical history**: cornerstone; details symptoms, timing, exposures, and family history [^117RSuwD].
- **Skin prick testing**: rapid, inexpensive, detects sensitization; results must match clinical context [^115scSi8].
- **Serum-specific IgE**: useful when skin testing is contraindicated or unavailable [^notfound].
- **Oral food challenges**: gold standard for confirming food allergy and establishing tolerance [^117X2fgw].

---

## Management strategies

Management is individualized and **multimodal**:

- **Allergen avoidance**: primary strategy; environmental controls and dietary restrictions [^115v8vcr].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, epinephrine for anaphylaxis [^113xC45y].
- **Allergen immunotherapy**: disease-modifying for selected patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or venom allergy [^113xC45y].
- **Patient education**: essential for adherence, emergency preparedness, and quality of life [^1172RvSM].

---

## Epidemiology and public health impact

Allergies are **highly prevalent and rising**, especially in children [^113ZfNZr]. Prevalence estimates include **allergic rhinitis** at 14% in the US [^114WqBMt], **food allergy** at 6.2% in adults and 5.8% in children [^115Ww25M], and **asthma** at 7–10% globally. Allergies impair quality of life, sleep, and productivity and impose substantial direct and indirect costs [^116M1AU5] [^113hee9S].

---

## Emerging trends and research

Current research focuses on **precision medicine** with biomarkers and endotypes to guide therapy [^114ewF3x], digital health tools to improve monitoring and adherence, and novel biologics targeting type 2 pathways (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL-4/IL-13) [^notfound]. Prevention strategies include early allergen introduction and environmental interventions [^113JbaC6] [^115722Zw].

---

Allergies are **IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions** with diverse manifestations; diagnosis hinges on history plus testing, and management combines avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Prevalence is rising, driving innovation in prevention, biomarkers, and targeted therapies.

### IgE-associated allergic disorders: recent advances in etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114Q8PVs]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

IgE-associated allergic diseases belong to the most common inflammatory conditions. Their clinical manifestation ranges from mild symptoms to life-threatening episodes. Often patients experience a reduction in physical and psychologic well-being and suffer from a decreased quality of life due to disease activity. The continuously rising number of people that are affected by an allergic condition indicates an urgent need for better diagnostics and more efficient treatment options. Recent progress in the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IgE-associated allergic disorders has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of drug candidates that are currently under evaluation. In this review, we highlight studies and clinical trials, which have helped to gain further insight in the etiology of IgE-associated allergic conditions as well as advances in the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches recently published in Allergy (European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology).

### Diagnosis of allergy syndromes: do symptoms always mean allergy? [^113ZfNZr]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic disease has become a major burden in westernized societies because of a recent rise in its prevalence. Approximately one-third of children suffer from an allergic disease, with the prevalence varying from 15 to 20% for atopic dermatitis, 7 to 10% for asthma and 15 to 20% for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Despite the increase, it is important not to assume a diagnosis of allergy on the basis of symptoms alone, because allergic and nonallergic conditions may present with similar symptoms. An accurate allergy diagnosis is important in order to treat the patient most appropriately and to potentially prevent or delay the development of allergic disease. A good clinical history is the starting point for accurate allergy diagnosis but is not unequivocal. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology has recognized the importance of allergy testing and therefore developed evidence-based recommendations on allergy testing in children. Widespread adherence to these recommendations should improve the quality of care for allergy patients. Cooperation between all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of allergy patients is also a key to improve our response to the allergy epidemic.

### Improving the management of atopic disease [^117DqLFj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma, wheeze, eczema, and, to a certain extent, rhinitis are very common conditions among children. The prevalence of allergic disease in the general population has increased alarmingly over the past 25 years, particularly in Western industrialised countries. However, it is important to remember that the symptoms often associated with allergy can have other aetiologies. Evidence suggests that in most circumstances, only 30–40% of chronic allergic-type symptoms are due to allergy. Accurate diagnosis of the presence of allergy is therefore an important issue, particularly given the interventions that such a diagnosis may initiate. In this review, we examine management options for allergy, provide the evidence as to what proportions of patients with common allergic-type symptoms are actually allergic, and list other causes of such symptoms. The importance of allergy testing and the options available are described, particularly with reference to the role of the non-allergist.

### Can we prevent allergy? [^115722Zw]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic conditions continue to increase steeply. The last two decades have seen many prevention trials, studying the effect of dietary and environmental interventions. These trials have yielded invaluable information about the atopic march and also highlighted the need for a clear and commonly used nomenclature as well as a need for better outcome measures. This review discusses primary and secondary prevention studies and their results.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^1112AMqa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Common allergic rhinitis clinical scenarios — because "the guidelines task force could not agree on a simple algorithm for treating allergic rhinitis as variations in patient preferences, severity of symptoms, duration of symptoms, coexisting conditions, and allergen sensitizations all influenced reasonable recommendations", the figure "provides guidance for practitioners using illustrative clinical scenarios that are consistent with available evidence and expert advice".

### Ocular allergy overview [^1142jSiT]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of ocular allergy clearly is underappreciated and has been under diagnosed and undertreated. The ocular symptoms associated with the most common ocular allergy conditions, such as seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, are twice as likely to affect the allergy sufferer rather than nasal symptoms alone. The differential diagnosis of conjunctivitis is quite broad, with the most common forms associated with allergies, infections, and hormones. There are common features and some discerning features that, with a good history and examination, may provide a more focused and appropriate management.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^117X2fgw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People suspected of food allergy require accurate diagnosis to help manage their condition and get appropriate care. Recent guidelines summarize the latest evidence about diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy, but they do not describe how to address practical issues when testing. There is a need to translate guideline recommendations into a practical common pathway that all centers dealing with food allergy can use.

Objective

The Global Network of Centres of Excellence for Anaphylaxis & Food Allergy — ANAcare developed a pathway to help clinicians apply the latest diagnostic guidelines and overcome implementation challenges.

Methods

The pathway is based on reviewing guidelines, research and clinical feedback, plus consensus of experts from 13 countries.

Results

We describe practical tips that clinicians can use when taking a detailed clinical history and testing people with suspected IgE-mediated food allergy. Tests for IgE sensitization such as skin prick tests and specific IgE are readily available and inexpensive. However, they only demonstrate sensitization, not clinical allergic disease, so they need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical history. A controlled oral food challenge may also be needed to identify which foods the person is experiencing reactions to and what quantity can be tolerated.

Conclusions

Correct diagnosis is essential to support individualized management. Allergy centers around the world can use our practical tips to help avoid under- and overdiagnosis.

### Clinical practice. allergic rhinitis [^114WqBMt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on allergic rhinitis:

- Definition: Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa characterized by symptoms of sneezing, nasal pruritus, airflow obstruction, and clear nasal discharge.
- Pathophysiology: Common allergens that are associated with allergic rhinitis include pollen and mites (67%), animal dander and pollutants (23%), and fungal allergens (21%).
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis is estimated at 14% in the US.
- Disease course: In patients with allergic rhinitis, exposure to allergens triggers an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, leading to mucosal inflammation and associated nasal symptoms. Type 2 helper T cells play a role in maintaining persistent mucosal inflammation beyond the time of allergen exposure.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Allergic rhinitis can impair QoL by interrupting sleep. It is associated with work performance impairment and missed work time.

### Reaction phenotypes in IgE-mediated food allergy and anaphylaxis [^114sUea6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Food allergy encompasses a range of food hypersensitivities. Different clinical phenotypes for food allergy are likely to exist in much the same way as endotype discovery is now a major research theme in asthma. In this review, we discuss the emerging evidence for different reaction phenotypes (ie, symptoms experienced after allergen exposure in food allergic individuals) and their relevance for clinical practice.

### The economic impact of allergic rhinitis and current guidelines for treatment [^113hee9S]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the economic burden of allergic rhinitis treatment and current guidelines for treatment.

Data Sources

Review articles and original research were retrieved from MEDLINE, OVID, PubMed (1950-November 2009), personal files of articles, and bibliographies of located articles that addressed the topic of interest.

Study Selection

Articles were selected for their relevance to the burden of allergic rhinitis and current guidelines for treatment. Publications included reviews, treatment guidelines, and clinical studies.

Results

Despite the common symptoms of allergic rhinitis, its impact on patient quality of life, and the huge cost to society and individuals of treatment, including pharmacotherapy, many patients do not adhere to their medication regimens because the medications do not adequately address their symptoms or are otherwise problematic for them to use.

Conclusions

The economic impact of allergic rhinitis is substantial; the total direct medical cost of allergic rhinitis is approximately $3.4 billion, with almost half of this cost attributable to prescription medications. Multiple treatment options are available, and these were reviewed to provide an update on effectiveness and adverse effects that may affect patient adherence.

### Allergic rhinitis – history and presentation [^112iYb2K]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a common disorder that results from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic causes. This disorder has a tremendous impact on the quality of life and on health care expenditures, as evidenced by a large loss of worker productivity. Care must be taken to promptly diagnose patients with this condition, evaluate them for associated conditions, and begin appropriate management to reduce its impact on the individual and the health care system. Allergic rhinitis represents only a component of the spectrum of inflammatory diseases involving the unified airway.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^1149FdUN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Despite numerous national and international guidelines and consensus statements, common misconceptions still persist in terms of diagnosis and appropriate management, both among healthcare professionals and patient/carers. We address some of these misconceptions and highlight the optimal approach for patients who experience potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.

### Epidemiology of allergy [^115KUnFP]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Atopic disease represents a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal sensitivity mediated by IgE; approximately 20% of Americans suffer from some form of allergic disease. The sequelae of inhalant and food allergies may present in many organ systems. Manifestations of allergic disease in one site are often associated with symptoms from another site. It is important for clinicians to understand the epidemiology of atopic disease and its causes to facilitate implementation of effective treatment and prevention strategies. This review focuses on the epidemiology of inhalant allergies causing allergic rhinitis and asthma and on IgE-mediated food allergies.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^112KV8Qc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Food allergy — definition and epidemiology: Food allergy is defined here "as an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food", and "the term allergy is not limited to IgE-mediated immunologic reactions and is used to connote the induction of clinical signs and symptoms, as opposed to sensitivity, which indicates the presence of IgE antibodies to a food, often in the absence of clinical symptomatology". Prevalence estimates indicate that "food allergy is estimated to affect more than 1% to 2% and less than 10% of the population", with higher estimates based on "self-report (approximately 12% to 13%)" compared with oral food challenges "(OFCs; approximately 3%)". The text notes that "more than 170 foods have been identified as triggers of food allergy" with common examples listed, and that "Food allergy (to foods other than shellfish and fruits/vegetables) is more common in children than in adults".

### How to interpret skin prick tests and serum-specific IgE in children and young people with food allergy [^113zEVZv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is common, it can lead to significant morbidity andnegatively impacts on quality of life; therefore, it is vitally important we get the diagnosis right. However, making the diagnosis can be complex. Clinical history is the most important diagnostic tool and subsequent investigation may help confirm the diagnosis. The investigations available to most paediatric departments are skin prick testing and specific IgE so we will focus on these. Within this article we explore the evidence related to targeted testing and how to interpret these within the clinical context.

### Anaphylaxis: past, present and future [^111YFLA4]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and recent reports suggest increased prevalence. A diverse set of primary genetic and environmental influences may confer susceptibility to anaphylactic reactions. Anaphylaxis presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. It often manifests with a broad array of symptoms and signs that might be similar to other diseases. The management of anaphylaxis consists of emergency treatment of acute episodes as well as preventive strategies to avoid recurrences. Treatment is complicated by its rapid onset and progression, presence of concurrent diseases or medications, and need for long-term allergen avoidance. Health care professionals must be able to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis, treat an episode promptly and appropriately, and provide preventive recommendations. Recognizing the gaps in our understanding and management of anaphylaxis may help identify promising targets for future treatment and prevention and areas that require further study.

### An algorithm recommendation for the pharmacological management of allergic rhinitis in the UK: a consensus statement from an expert panel [^114S7y7G]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

How AR can affect patients?

AR a common condition that affects > 20% of the UK population, is a frequent presenting problem in primary care, and is increasing in prevalence. It is associated with considerable morbidity; significantly reducing quality of life, interfering with attendance and performance at school and work, – and resulting in considerable health-care and indirect costs. – Around 50–80% of AR patients report that their condition interferes with sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue, decreased alertness, inability to concentrate, depression and irritability. AR is also associated with a number of coexisting conditions, including asthma, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media with effusion and nasal polyposis.

### Evidence-based diagnostic strategies for evaluating suspected allergic rhinitis [^115Vu2GR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is an increasingly common disease, with a prevalence of at least 10% to 25% in the United States. Diagnostic allergy tests, such as skin tests and in vitro tests, can assist clinicians in determining whether nasal symptoms are allergic in origin. In addition, safe and effective medications are available to treat allergic rhinitis. The initial strategy should be to determine whether patients should undergo diagnostic testing or receive empirical treatment. This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, skin tests, and in vitro tests in diagnosing allergic rhinitis from the perspective of decision thresholds. A combination of pertinent medical history features in a practice with a high baseline prevalence of allergic rhinitis justifies the common practice of empirical treatment since allergy medication has minimal toxicity and side effects. The situation is more complex when the patient needs a diagnostic test, because reported sensitivities and specificities of skin tests and in vitro tests vary widely. As a result, it is difficult to calculate the post-test probability of allergic rhinitis with any confidence. The decision to initiate diagnostic testing must rely on clinical judgment to select patients who would benefit most from determining their allergic status while minimizing unnecessary testing and medications. Diagnosing allergy to a specific antigen allows patients to avoid the allergen and makes them candidates for allergen immunotherapy, which can decrease the need for medications.

### Food allergy [^1119hUKZ]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Food allergy encompasses a range of disorders that result from adverse immune responses to dietary antigens. This group of conditions includes acute, potentially fatal reactions, and a host of chronic diseases that mainly affect the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Tools for diagnosis and management have not changed much in the past two decades, and include the clinical history, physical examination, tests for specific IgE antibody to suspected foods, elimination diets, oral food challenges, and provision of medications such as epinephrine for emergency treatment. However, much research in the past few years has enhanced our understanding of the clinical, epidemiological, and immunological aspects of these disorders. In this review I will discuss these advances and incorporate them into an improved diagnostic and management scheme. Additionally, emergent diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies are reviewed.

### Overview of allergy and anaphylaxis [^116PBTXd]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis occur on a severity continuum from mild and self-limited to potentially life-threatening or fatal reactions. Anaphylaxis is typically a multiorgan phenomenon involving a broad range of effector cells and mediators. Emergency department visits for anaphylaxis are increasing, especially among children. There is a broad differential diagnosis for anaphylaxis, and the diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be aided by the use of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network clinical diagnostic criteria. Risk factors for severe anaphylaxis include older age, delayed epinephrine administration, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities.

### Allergic rhinitis [^116mDFq8]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Familiarity with the diagnosis and management of allergic rhinitis is important for physicians concerned with the nasal airway. Allergic rhinitis is a common and manageable condition that may cause persistent or intermittent symptoms that vary as to duration and severity. Allergic rhinitis impairs quality of life, sleep, school performance, and productivity on a scale that compares with other chronic diseases. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but supported by allergy testing. Therapeutic options for allergic rhinitis include pharmacotherapy, environmental control, and immunotherapy. More recently, a role for sublingual immunotherapy and turbinate reduction has been reported.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### Diagnostic testing in the evaluation of food allergy [^115W9pHo]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food-related symptoms are frequent in childhood, and pediatricians are often requested to initiate a food allergy diagnostic workup. A careful history is the cornerstone for assessing whether tests are needed and which diagnostic procedures are most appropriate. Skin prick tests should be performed only according to standard procedures by a skilled health professional. Determining serum IgE levels (in vitro tests) are available for a wide range of foods. Of utmost importance is the need to correlate test results to the clinical picture. When a conclusion cannot be reached, oral food challenges should be performed for a definite diagnosis.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^111fZ5W5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Food allergies involve an abnormal immune-mediated response to food, often a protein. They can be IgE mediated, non–IgE mediated, or mixed type (Fig 1). In this report, we focus on IgE-mediated food allergies, hereafter termed food allergies.

Fig 1
Typology of IgE-mediated, non–IgE-mediated, and mixed-type food allergies.

Food allergy is a major health issue that affects the nutrition, quality of life, and social activities of individuals, their families, and wider communities. Symptoms can affect any organ system. They vary in their severity, from mild skin symptoms to serious systemic reactions. Symptoms can be upsetting, painful, and even life-threatening.

Food allergies are distinct from other reactions to food that may be based on intolerance and/or that have autoimmune features, such as celiac disease. It is essential to provide prompt and accurate diagnosis for people suspected of food allergy so they can get individualized support about nutrition, foods to avoid, and treatment strategies.

Recent international reviews and guidelines summarize up-to-date evidence about the most effective ways to diagnose and manage food allergies. However, guidelines alone are not sufficient because first, most guidelines focus only on certain elements of the diagnostic process; second, recent guidelines give slightly different recommendations, which may be confusing when trying to apply them in practice; and third, guidelines do not describe how to address practical issues and obstacles when performing diagnostic tests and food challenges.

In order to help patients, guidelines need to be put into practice. The recommendations need to be consistent and interpreted in the same way across settings and regions. Currently, diagnostic guidelines are not being well implemented. There are large variations in the diagnostic approaches used in clinical practice as well as differences in funding, staffing, and processes around the world. There are also significant regional differences in access to allergy specialists, the use of diagnostic tests, and the ability to perform oral food challenges.

### Allergic rhinitis: broader disease effects and implications for management [^114ubMLX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a burdensome disease for a significant part of the population in both adults and children. Poorly controlled allergic rhinitis can trigger exacerbations of asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media, diseases with which it shares common pathophysiologic elements. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment should be a priority for patients and physicians, not only to control the symptoms of allergic rhinitis but also to improve the management of associated diseases. Several pharmacologic therapies can be considered in an armamentarium that includes antihistamines (intranasal and systemic), intranasal cromolyn, intranasal anticholinergic agents, intranasal steroids, systemic steroids, immunotherapy, and, most recently, leukotriene receptor antagonists. Often, combinations of these treatments are used to maximize control of refractory symptoms.

### Prevalence and severity of food allergies among US adults [^115TSdYM]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measures for the study were the prevalence and severity of overall and food-specific convincing adult food allergy. Food allergies were considered to be convincing if the most severe reaction reported to that food included at least 1 symptom on the stringent symptom list developed by our expert panel (eFigure in the Supplement). Reported allergies with reaction symptoms characteristic of oral allergy syndrome or food intolerances were excluded and not considered to be convincing according to the food allergy categorization flowchart summarized in Figure 1, even if such allergies were reported as diagnosed by a physician. Only convincing food allergies for which a physician's diagnosis was reported were considered to be physician diagnosed for the purposes of our study. For each convincing allergy, a severe reaction history was indicated by reporting 1 or more stringent symptoms across 2 or more of the following organ systems: skin or oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular, and respiratory tract.

Figure 1.
Convincing, Physician-Diagnosed, and Severe Food Allergy (FA) Categorization Flow Diagram

Stringent symptoms by organ system include skin or oral mucosa (hives, swelling [except lip or tongue], lip or tongue swelling, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening), respiratory tract (chest tightening, trouble breathing, wheezing), gastrointestinal tract (vomiting), and cardiovascular (chest pain, rapid heartbeat, fainting, low blood pressure). Gastrointestinal symptoms commonly associated with intolerance (eg, diarrhea, cramps) were not considered to be stringent symptoms. The following allergies were considered for exclusion as probable oral allergy syndrome (OAS) based on symptom report: fruit, vegetable, peanut, tree nut, wheat, soy, barley, rice, seed, spice, shellfish, and fin fish.

### Allergic rhinitis: treatment based on patient profiles [^114B8gbt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a common medical condition characterized by nasal, throat, and ocular itching; rhinorrhea; sneezing; nasal congestion; and, less frequently, cough. The treatment of allergic rhinitis should control these symptoms without adversely affecting daily activities or cognitive performance and should prevent sequelae such as asthma exacerbation or sinusitis. This review describes a stepwise approach to treatment of allergic rhinitis derived from a synthesis of clinical trial results, patient preferences, and real-world tolerability data. Key clinical considerations include frequency and intensity of symptoms, patient age, comorbidities, compliance with treatment regimens (influenced by formulation, route and frequency of administration), and effects on quality of life. Oral second-generation antihistamines, versus first-generation agents and inhaled corticosteroids, should be considered first-line treatment because they provide rapid relief of most allergic rhinitis symptoms without safety and tolerability issues. Additional therapeutic agents can then be added or substituted based on individual symptom response.

### Allergic rhinitis [^113xC45y]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a very common disorder that affects people of all ages, peaking in the teenage years. It is frequently ignored, underdiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and mistreated, which not only is detrimental to health but also has societal costs. Although allergic rhinitis is not a serious illness, it is clinically relevant because it underlies many complications, is a major risk factor for poor asthma control, and affects quality of life and productivity at work or school. Management of allergic rhinitis is best when directed by guidelines. A diagnostic trial of a pharmacotherapeutic agent could be started in people with clinically identified allergic rhinitis; however, to confirm the diagnosis, specific IgE reactivity needs to be recorded. Documented IgE reactivity has the added benefit of guiding implementation of environmental controls, which could substantially ameliorate symptoms of allergic rhinitis and might prevent development of asthma, especially in an occupational setting. Many classes of drug are available, effective, and safe. In meta-analyses, intranasal corticosteroids are superior to other treatments, have a good safety profile, and treat all symptoms of allergic rhinitis effectively. First-generation antihistamines are associated with sedation, psychomotor retardation, and reduced academic performance. Only immunotherapy with individually targeted allergens has the potential to alter the natural history of allergic rhinitis. Patients' education is a vital component of treatment. Even with the best pharmacotherapy, one in five affected individuals remains highly symptomatic, and further research is needed in this area.

### Clinical presentation and nutrition management of non-IgE-mediated food allergy in children [^112mV7F2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-IgE-mediated food allergy encompasses a wide spectrum of allergic disorders ranging from mild to severe presentations, including food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, and food protein-induced enteropathy. Other gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation and gastroesophageal reflux disease have not previously been recognised as symptoms of non-IgE-mediated food allergy in food allergy guideline publications. Recently, two new consensus documents from the European Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology address a potential role of food allergens in these disorders, where standard treatment has failed, and provide guidance for diagnosis and management of these conditions. Additional updates include the World Allergy Organisation guidance on the diagnosis and management of cow's milk allergy, the most commonly implicated food in non-IgE-mediated food allergy. These documents all help practitioners to distinguish between common manifestations in infancy that are not pathologic and non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Understanding diagnostic criteria is vital to prevent overdiagnosis, limit unnecessary elimination diets and preserve breastfeeding. Conversely, proper diagnosis may reduce symptoms in infants who are affected. Therefore, the first step in management of non-IgE-mediated food allergy is establishing a correct diagnosis, which requires understanding the clinical presentations and if needed, applying an appropriate short-term diagnostic elimination diet to observe for symptom resolution, followed by food reintroduction to assess for symptom recurrence. Once diagnosed, treatment requires removal of the trigger food, most commonly cow's milk, which is not without burden and nutrition risk. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies typically resolve early in childhood with some disorders resolving in infancy therefore early reassessment for tolerance is vital. Management of non-IgE-mediated food allergy entails following diagnostic algorithms, developing an individualised dietary plan, and timely assessment of tolerance development to reduce burden and nutrition risk.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^111GEFsw]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Estimating the risk of severe reactions is one of the most significant knowledge gaps in managing people with food allergy. Near‐fatal and fatal anaphylaxis to food are rare: the estimated incidence of fatal food‐anaphylaxis is 1.81 (95% CI 0.94–3.45) per million person‐years. Near‐fatal anaphylaxis to food (requiring intensive care support) is around 10 times more common, but still rare. However, such severe reactions are unpredictable. Most people who die from fatal food‐anaphylaxis only have a history of previous mild reactions. Our inability to identify those at greater risk of severe reactions means that people with food allergy are often managed as being at equal risk of fatal reactions. This can cause unnecessary anxiety, excessive dietary restriction and reduced health‐related quality of life.

Ideally, clinicians would be able to risk‐stratify people with food allergy, to provide cost‐effective, targeted support to those at greatest risk. Various models incorporating potential risk factors have been proposed — both for any anaphylaxis, and anaphylaxis refractory to treatment (hereafter described as refractory anaphylaxis); however, the underlying evidence is disparate. Some useful narrative reviews have begun to draw the evidence together, but we identified no systematic reviews exploring this topic. In this rapid review, we summarize what is known about the risk factors for more severe reactions in people with food allergy.

### Rational approach to allergy testing [^1147AT2D]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Allergy testing is commonly used when symptoms of allergic rhinitis are refractory to symptoms and there is potential for treatment with institution of avoidance measures or immunotherapy. Once the decision for testing has been made, the method of testing by either in vivo skin testing by prick/puncture or intradermal testing or in vitro testing of serum-specific IgE is dictated by factors in the clinical history and an informed decision by the patient. Because there is no perfect testing method, understanding the benefits and limitations of each method is important in selecting the best testing option for each patient.

FIGURE 3
Evolution of symptoms and clinical reactivity at food challenge. Many individuals will experience initially subjective symptoms, with objective symptoms appearing with further doses (A). Anaphylaxis will only develop if the food challenge continues. Others will experience anaphylaxis as their first objective symptom: either at a dose of allergen exposure with no preceding subjective symptoms (B), or with prior subjective symptoms (C), without evidence of a clear dose‐response for symptoms. Note that anaphylaxis can occur at all levels of exposure (both at low levels of allergen exposure, represented by the solid bars, and higher doses indicated by dotted lines). Reproduced under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License from reference

For any given individual patient, therefore, the absence of prior anaphylaxis may be due to insufficient allergen exposure causing previous reactions, (rather than the patient being at an inherently lower risk). Therefore, a history (or not) of anaphylaxis is a poor predictor of future anaphylaxis. Reassuringly, there is no robust evidence that food‐allergic individuals who react to very low levels of allergen are at greater risk of anaphylaxis.,

A history of reaction to only relatively large exposures (with no or minimal symptoms to smaller doses) may be useful in informing the approach to allergen avoidance in any given individual, particularly given more recent data suggesting that reaction thresholds for an food‐allergic person are fairly reproducible under typical challenge conditions, at least for peanut and cow's milk.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) — less common than EoE — is believed to be both IgE-mediated and non–IgE-mediated and is occasionally linked to food allergies; it features variable gastrointestinal symptoms with pathologic eosinophilic infiltration that can be localized or very widespread. Common symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and failure to thrive/weight loss, and multiple food allergens are often implicated.

### Diagnosis of inhalant allergies: patient history and testing [^114S44Ej]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

In the United States, roughly 20% to 25% of the general adult population is afflicted by some form of chronic allergic respiratory disease, making allergy one of the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Among children, allergic disease is more common, with some sources estimating that it affects up to 40% of children. The focus of this article involves making the diagnosis of the most familiar and best understood of the hypersensitivity reactions, type 1 hypersensitivity, also termed immediate hypersensitivity. Although type 1 hypersensitivity can be caused by ingestion of food antigens or pharmaceuticals, this article focuses on IgE-mediated allergic disease caused primarily by inhalant allergens.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^117RSuwD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

IgE-mediated food allergy diagnosis — Summary Statement 22: The clinician should obtain a detailed medical history and physical examination to aid in the diagnosis of food allergy. [Strength of recommendation: Strong; B Evidence] Because IgE-mediated food allergy most often presents with immediate symptoms (within 2 hours) after ingestion of the culprit food, certain historical features such as immediate onset of oropharyngeal symptoms or skin abnormalities after ingestion are informative, and a history consistent with anaphylaxis or immediate multisystem symptoms after food ingestion is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of IgE-mediated disease. The physical examination alone cannot be considered diagnostic of food allergy, and evidence of atopy, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis, might indicate an increased risk of IgE-mediated food allergy.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common tinnitus terms define primary tinnitus as idiopathic and it "may or may not be associated with sensorineural hearing loss", with a footnote clarifying that "the word idiopathic is used here to indicate that a cause other than sensorineural hearing loss is not identifiable"; secondary tinnitus is associated with "a specific underlying cause (other than sensorineural hearing loss) or an identifiable organic condition". Duration categories are specified as recent onset tinnitus "less than 6 months in duration" and persistent tinnitus "6 months or longer in duration". Impact categories distinguish bothersome tinnitus — where a distressed patient has "affected quality of life and/or functional health status" and seeks "active therapy and management strategies" — from nonbothersome tinnitus, which "does not have a significant effect on a patient's quality of life but may result in curiosity of the cause or concern about the natural history and how it might progress or change".

### Prevalence and severity of food allergies among US adults [^112Uv1yf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Food allergy is a costly, potentially life-threateninghealth condition that can adversely affect patients' well-being. Although population-based studies, have examined the prevalence of food allergy among children, less is known about the population-level burden of food allergy among adults in the United States. The few population-based studies, to date that examined adult food allergy have focused on a limited number of specific allergens (eg, peanut) or allergen groups (eg, tree nut, seafood) or have been secondary analyses of federal health surveys, which were not designed to comprehensively characterize food allergy prevalence and severity among US adults. For example, neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveynor the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Food Safety Surveycollects information about specific allergic reaction symptoms critical for differential diagnosis of food allergy (eg, food intolerances, oral allergy syndrome). Nevertheless, food allergy prevalence estimates from these recent national surveys exceed 9% of US adults, suggesting that food allergy may affect more US adults than previously acknowledged.

Although some children with food allergy develop natural tolerance, others retain their food allergy as they enter adulthood. Adults can also develop new food allergies, and evidence suggests that certain food allergies (eg, shellfish and fin fish) may be more likely than others to develop during adulthood. Moreover, studies, suggest that rates of food allergy–related emergency department (ED) visits may be increasing among children and young adults.

Much remains to be learned about the population-level consequences of adult food allergy in the United States, including the relative frequency and timing of adult- vs childhood-onset food allergy, allergen type, severity, and key sociodemographic and clinical factors of each of these food allergy characteristics. This study aimed to provide comprehensive, nationally representative estimates of the distribution, severity, and factors associated with adult food allergy in the United States.

### Clinical asthma syndromes and important asthma mimics [^111RtnWE]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple clinical phenotypes. Phenotypes can be grouped into clinical or physiological, trigger-defined, and inflammatory phenotypes. Treatment based on inflammatory phenotyping improves clinical measures of asthma morbidity. Further study of individual asthma phenotypes will improve understanding of their immunologic and pathologic characteristics and improve diagnosis and therapy. Because asthma is a common disorder with nonspecific presenting features, other disorders are often misdiagnosed as asthma. A high index of suspicion for alternative diagnoses must be maintained when evaluating a patient who presents with clinical features suggestive of asthma, particularly if the patient presents with atypical symptoms or fails to respond to therapy.

### Associations of four sensitization patterns revealed by latent class analysis with clinical symptoms: a multi-center study of China [^11692HHo]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is an abundance of evidence to support the associations of allergic sensitization with several clinical symptoms, for instance, asthma or rhinitis. However, the complicated distribution of dominating allergens in different regions and sensitization to multiple allergens concurrently enable the patients to present complex anaphylaxis, which poses a huge hinder in clinical diagnosis and therapy of allergy. In traditional clinical practices, clinicians commonly use a skin prick test (SPT) or specific Immunoglobulin E (sIgE) measurement results in combination with the corresponding exposure history of allergens for clinical diagnosis of allergy. However, it's not uncommon that the co-sensitization of allergens exists among allergic patients. Therefore, the diagnosis precision of specific allergens might be confused by complicated sensitization patterns. Recently, advanced molecular-based diagnosis technique for allergy has been developed rapidly, for instance, component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) has facilitated the clarification of the biological mechanism of allergic diseases. Given conventional analysis for co-sensitization characteristics using the Venn diagram couldn't disclose the complexity of sensitization patterns, many researchers have begun to utilize some more robust statistic methods for exploring the heterogeneity of potential sensitization patterns.

Latent class analysis (LCA) is a typical unsupervised machine learning method regarding categorical latent variable measured with categorical items. Individuals can be divided into subgroups or latent classes based on unobservable constructs using multiple correlated categorical variables. The latent classes are mutually exclusive and characterized by having a high probability distribution to a set of specific observed categorical variables. Although several latent variable models have been successfully formulated to identify underlying patterns of sensitization to common allergens or component-specific IgE responses, most of them just focused on school-age childrenor specific allergic symptoms in many developed countries. To our best knowledge, few studies have been conducted in China to comprehensively investigate the associations between the patterns of sensitization to common allergens revealed by LCA and different clinical symptoms.

The sensitization patterns of allergy among Chinese are highly complicated, which results from significant regional differences in the distribution of allergensand herd susceptibility. Previous studies have reported that house dust mite are common in the southern and eastern areas of China, while pollen allergies are prevailing in the western and northern China. In this study, we recruited all qualified patients with allergies from 13 medical centers that are distributed to four regions of China, including south, north, west and east areas. A total of 18 common allergens which covered house dust mite, german cockroach, aspergillus fumigatus, penicillium and 14 grass pollen allergens were utilized to perform SPT.

### Food allergies [^113zVtzm]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is 1 of the 4 manifestations of the "atopic march", along with eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Depending on the pathophysiologic immune mechanisms behind a food allergy, it can be classified as immunoglobulin E-mediated, non-immunoglobulin E-mediated, or mixed. The prevalence of food allergies has risen worldwide during the past few decades, becoming a significant global health concern. Patients experiencing food allergies and their caregivers are heavily burdened personally, socially, emotionally, and financially. The health-care system is also considerably affected. Pediatricians, as primary health-care providers, are often challenged with these patients, becoming the first-line for the recognition and management of food allergies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of food allergies, including the most up-to-date information, recent guidelines, and recommendations.

### Rhinitis subtypes, endotypes, and definitions [^117SUsSh]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Rhinitis is often seen as posing a small burden. However, rhinitis is a complex disease that is underpinned by a plethora of different mechanisms and causes. Rhinitis is frequently associated with other comorbid conditions but, by itself, is a source of considerable morbidity for patients and creates a significant financial burden on health systems worldwide. This article approaches this condition from both a phenotypic and mechanistic standpoint, focusing on the complexity of characterizing these subtypes. Developing a clearer demarcation of the currently obscure rhinitis phenotypes and endotypes will substantially improve their future prevention and treatment.

### Current management of allergic rhinitis [^111U2UaV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic disease worldwide and one of the most common chronic diseases in general. Allergic rhinitis is caused by inhalant allergens from outdoor and indoor environments with varying significance of different allergens in global regions. We provide options for the current management for AR including pharmacological treatments and nonpharmacological options and allergen immunotherapy (AIT). A literature review has been conducted in Medline, Pubmed, as well as the national and international study (ClinicalTrials.gov) and guideline registers and the Cochrane Library. Human studies published on the topic in the period up to and including November 2023 were taken into account. Allergen avoidance measures, pharmacotherapy, and AIT are the cornerstones of AR treatment. Nonpharmacological measures and behavioral recommendations should be adequately added. Tools of precision medicine are already playing a significant role and will be part of the diagnostic and therapeutic standard in the future. Patients benefit most in a network of different pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment measures including AIT. Application of precision medicine tools for diagnosis and treatment will improve standards of care.

Guidelines and recommendations for management of allergy patients during COVID‐19

FIGURE 9
Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in allergic patients might be complex due to overlap of aeroallergy and COVID‐19 symptoms. Fever, cough, shortness of breath, body aches, and sore throat can indicate SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, whereas runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, and watery eyes point‐out more into respiratory diseases manifestation. Uncertainty regarding the source of observed manifestations should be always (tele)consulted with physicians and an extensive screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 should be assured to limit the spread of the virus. COVID‐19, coronavirus disease 2019; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

In summary, allergic diseases and asthma do not aggravate the risk of severe/critical COVID‐19 outcomes in the absence of underlying lung disease or any other immunosuppressive or metabolic comorbidities. Adherence to recommended social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, can lower the incidence of exacerbations by reducing aeroallergen exposure. Patients with any underlying allergic disease should continue with standard treatment and be reassured of its safety and efficacy. Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in allergic patients might be challenging due to overlap of allergy and COVID‐19 symptoms and reluctance for doctor consultations. Screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 is imperative to minimize viral transmission and to differentiate between COVID‐19 symptoms and allergies.

### Global trends in anaphylaxis epidemiology and clinical implications [^113hSV21]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anaphylaxis represents the more severe end of the spectrum of allergic reactions, and is most commonly triggered by medication, food, or insect stings. Measuring and evaluating epidemiological data related to episodes of anaphylaxis is an important means by which trends, burden of disease, and risk factors can be identified. Such information can highlight novel emerging allergens, changes in epidemiology, and risk-factor associations, which can in turn inform clinical practice and may prevent future severe reactions and fatalities.

Difficulties in the collection and interpretation of epidemiological anaphylaxis data must be acknowledged. These include variation in definitions of anaphylaxis across different regions of the world, logistical and coding issues related to collection of large health service data sets, and the inherent difficulties in collecting data for a disease state that largely occurs in the community, not within a hospital or health facility.

### Food allergy and hypersensitivity reactions in children and adults – A review [^11349trv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Adverse reactions after food intake are commonly reported and a cause of concern and anxiety that can lead to a very strict diet. The severity of the reaction can vary depending on the type of food and mechanism, and it is not always easy to disentangle different hypersensitivity diagnoses, which sometimes can exist simultaneously. After a carefully taken medical history, hypersensitivity to food can often be ruled out or suspected. The most common type of allergic reaction is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy (prevalence 5–10%). Symptoms vary from mild itching, stomach pain, and rash to severe anaphylaxis. The definition of IgE-mediated food allergy is allergic symptoms combined with specific IgE-antibodies, and therefore only IgE-antibodies to suspected allergens should be analyzed. Nowadays, methods of molecular allergology can help with the diagnostic process. The most common allergens are milk and egg in infants, peanut and tree nuts in children, and fish and shellfish in adults. In young children, milk/egg allergy has a good chance to remit, making it important to follow up and reintroduce the food when possible. Other diseases triggered by food are non-IgE-mediated food allergy, for example, eosinophilic esophagitis, celiac disease, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, and hypersensitivity to milk and biogenic amines. Some of the food hypersensitivities dominate in childhood, others are more common in adults. Interesting studies are ongoing regarding the possibilities of treating food hypersensitivity, such as through oral immunotherapy. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the most common types of food hypersensitivity reactions.

Rhinitis 2020 — clinical history components, asthma comorbidity, and screening tools emphasize that the clinical history is the most important element for establishing rhinitis, should include detailed symptom characterization and comorbid respiratory conditions, should seek asthma symptoms with spirometry if appropriate, and that allergic rhinitis (AR) commonly coexists with asthma; in primary care the diagnosis is often made by history, validated questionnaires are more useful for excluding AR than confirming it, and a validated 4‑question tool has high negative predictive value for positive skin prick tests.

### Advances and highlights in biomarkers of allergic diseases [^114ewF3x]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

11 CONCLUSIONS

The assessment and management of allergic diseases is challenging since the pathological molecular mechanisms are complex and heterogeneous in their clinical presentation. Improvement of disease management requires a personalized treatment regimen, which requires well‐defined and reliable biomarkers to unravel the phenotypes and endotypes of allergic diseases. There is a current need to identify prognostic biomarkers to guide the selection of appropriate therapies and to monitor treatment efficacy. Several biomarkers have been studied in allergic diseases, but only a few are readily available for clinical use. Newly identified biomarkers based on omics and novel imaging techniques must be validated and standardized before they can be routinely applied in clinical practice. The development of robust biomarkers will facilitate precision medicine‐based treatment approaches for allergic diseases.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^116r4wkR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy — diagnostic confirmation and eligibility — requires that a definitive diagnosis depend on allergy testing and that treatment decisions align with specific IgE results and exposure history. Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing is generally the preferred method for specific IgE, and immunotherapy should be considered when positive tests correlate with suspected triggers and exposure. Immunotherapy should not be given to patients with negative specific IgE tests or to those with positive tests that do not correlate with suspected triggers, clinical symptoms, or exposure; the presence of specific IgE alone does not necessarily indicate clinical sensitivity, and there is no evidence that immunotherapy for any allergen is effective in the absence of specific IgE antibodies.

### BSACI guideline for the diagnosis and management of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis (revised edition 2017; first edition 2007) [^115VCA98]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

This is an updated guideline for the diagnosis and management of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, first published in 2007. It was produced by the Standards of Care Committee of the British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, using accredited methods. Allergic rhinitis is common and affects 10–15% of children and 26% of adults in the UK, it affects quality of life, school and work attendance, and is a risk factor for development of asthma. Allergic rhinitis is diagnosed by history and examination, supported by specific allergy tests. Topical nasal corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for moderate to severe disease. Combination therapy with intranasal corticosteroid plus intranasal antihistamine is more effective than either alone and provides second line treatment for those with rhinitis poorly controlled on monotherapy. Immunotherapy is highly effective when the specific allergen is the responsible driver for the symptoms. Treatment of rhinitis is associated with benefits for asthma. Non-allergic rhinitis also is a risk factor for the development of asthma and may be eosinophilic and steroid-responsive or neurogenic and non- inflammatory. Non-allergic rhinitis may be a presenting complaint for systemic disorders such as granulomatous or eosinophilic polyangiitis, and sarcoidoisis. Infective rhinitis can be caused by viruses, and less commonly by bacteria, fungi and protozoa.

### ICON: diagnosis and management of allergic conjunctivitis [^116DcWjy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming the challenges of underdiagnosis and even misdiagnosis by a better understanding of the subtleties of an in-depth patient history, ophthalmologic examination techniques, and diagnostic procedures, which are of paramount importance in making an accurate diagnosis of OA. Appropriate cross-referral between specialists (allergists and eyecare specialists) would maximize patient care and outcomes. This would significantly improve OA management and overcome the unmet needs in global health.

Rhinitis is a familiar disorder affecting up to 20% of the general population. Chronic rhinitis can be broadly classified into allergic, infectious, or nonallergic or noninfectious, which are distinguished mainly by a careful history and allergy testing. The pathophysiology of nonallergic rhinitis likely involves a combination of inflammatory and neurogenic mechanisms that are poorly understood. Treatment involves avoiding the offending agent, when possible, and using appropriate medications to control the patient's predominant symptoms.

### Prevalence and severity of food allergies among US adults [^113JbaC6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Adult-onset food allergies are an important emerging health problem. A recent analysisof electronic health record data collected from a network of Chicago-area clinics concluded that although shellfish, tree nut, and fin fish allergies were the most common adult-onset food allergies, it appears to be possible to develop adult-onset food allergies to all major food allergen groups. In the current study, adult-onset allergies were observed to every assessed food. After wheat, the most common adult-onset allergies in our sample were shellfish, soy, tree nut, and fin fish, which were the top 4 allergies identified by Kamdar et al. Furthermore, the observed rates of adult-onset shellfish and fin fish allergy in our sample are not dissimilar to the rates of 60% and 40%, respectively, observed by Sicherer et almore than a decade ago. The most common childhood-onset allergy was peanut, which underlines the importance of early-life primary prevention efforts, such as the targeted early introduction practices advocated by the recent Addendum Guidelines for the Prevention of Peanut Allergy in the United States.

In light of the considerable economicand quality of lifeconsequences associated with allergen avoidance and other food allergy management behaviors, individuals with a suspected food allergy should receive appropriate confirmatory testing and counseling to counter unnecessary avoidance of allergenic food. Greater patient education efforts regarding key differences between food intolerances and allergies also may be warranted. Furthermore, the results of our study suggest that adults need to be encouraged to see their physicians to receive proper diagnosis, epinephrine prescription, and counseling for their food allergy. Given the increasing evidence for the preventive benefits of early allergen exposure during infancy and potential treatment options, adults should be made aware of these new practices to potentially prevent food allergies in their children or consider treatments in the near future.

Limitations

Although double-blinded, placebo-controlled oral food challenges remain the criterion standard for food allergy diagnosis, such methods were not used to confirm self-reported food allergy in the present study because of their expense and impracticality with such a large nationally representative sample and concerns about nonparticipation bias. However, similar to past work, to strengthen the rigor of our self-report questionnaire, stringent criteria were established in collaboration with an expert panel to exclude food allergies for which corresponding symptom report was not consistent with an IgE-mediated food allergy. Nevertheless, given the self-report paradigm used in the present study, bias remains a concern.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115v8vcr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

For individuals with asthma who have allergy symptoms or a test result suggesting that they are allergic to dust mites, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels in the home and improve asthma outcomes. Use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes.

Overall, the studies of allergen mitigation strategies provide low certainty of evidence that these strategies are beneficial for key asthma outcomes. Therefore, the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals with asthma who are exposed to these specific allergens and have either symptoms based on clinical history or an allergy to these substances based on allergy testing.

Based on current data on the use of a variety of single-component and multicomponent strategies to reduce exposure to allergens, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementing allergen exposure reduction strategies:
Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages with asthma of all levels of severity.
Clinicians need to tailor mitigation strategies to the individual based on their allergy symptoms, sensitization, and exposures. Clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate, before committing individuals to specific allergen mitigation strategies that may be burdensome. See Table IIIA for allergen-specific mitigation interventions addressed in the systematic review report. Table IIIB summarizes the certainty of evidence on various allergen mitigation interventions.
The Expert Panel recognizes the existing inequities in access to specialists and allergen testing. The panel therefore advises clinicians to, at a minimum, take a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma to help determine the need for allergen mitigation.
Allergy testing (with a skin prick or allergen-specific IgE test) may have false-positive and false-negative results, and certain allergens (eg, dust) may also act as irritants. For an individual whose symptoms worsen on exposure to specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if the individual's test result is negative.
Some of the interventions examined provide no or low certainty of evidence about their efficacy in improving asthma outcomes (including exacerbations, quality of life, asthma control, and symptoms). The Expert Panel recognizes that some of the interventions, especially integrated pest management and mold mitigation, may have broader public health benefits. However, these interventions do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials.
Some people are allergic to dander (flakes of skin) or saliva from pets. The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results. However, if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms. Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home.
Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them.
If an individual with asthma has sensitization to an allergen on skin prick testing and is exposed to that allergen but has no objective evidence of worsened disease control and denies having symptoms, chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment. Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified. Clinicians may also find it helpful to consider the severity of a patient's asthma, the small benefit, and the extent of previous symptoms and exacerbations when recommending allergen mitigation interventions. Allergen mitigation interventions may be expensive or difficult for patients to use or maintain. Clinicians should consider the cost implications of certain interventions, especially among those with limited financial resources, and assess the magnitude of the potential value of an intervention in improving an individual's asthma outcomes.

### Using data from food challenges to inform management of consumers with food allergy: a systematic review with individual participant data meta-analysis [^114wJSGj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is a global issue, affecting the international food supply, public health agencies, and government regulators. Historically, those with food allergies have been managed passively (ie, through dietary avoidance and provision of rescue medication such as self-injectable epinephrine), which is not a treatment strategy. However, our approach to food allergy is now rapidly shifting toward an approach in which active patient management (through interventions such as food allergy desensitization) and primary prevention are becoming commonplace. Some clinicians now advocate the use of food challenges (FCs) (including single-dose FCs) to establish a "safe" threshold for any given individual with a food allergy, which can then inform dietary allergen avoidance. In addition, allergen immunotherapy is now an established option to increase a patient's reaction threshold and reduce the risk posed by accidental allergen exposure.

There is increasing interest in the application of scientific approaches to allergen risk assessment and management to improve allergen declarations for foods. Food businesses and some national regulators are increasingly embracing the use of "eliciting dose" (ED) data (derived from oral FC results) to inform allergen risk management in industry, such as the need for precautionary allergen labeling. Although some gaps in knowledge remain, these approaches typically use the estimated elicited doses (EDs) at which 5% and 1% of the population with an allergy will experience objective symptoms (the ED 05 and ED 01, respectively). Although there is a consensus that zero risk is not realistic or achievable, the level of risk that is acceptable to consumers and regulators remains unclear. Although most consumers with an allergy may believe that mild, self-limiting symptoms in response to these low levels of allergen exposure are acceptable, others may not. Some consumers will still experience significant symptoms, and the proportion of these reactions that might constitute anaphylaxis is unclear. Furthermore, the stability or reproducibility of reaction thresholds (the minimum ED causing an objective allergic reaction) for individuals with an allergy is unknown: a consumer with an allergy may tolerate an ED 05 exposure on 1 occasion but not on another. This may be due to the impact of "cofactors" (such as exercise, sleep deprivation, and intercurrent infection), or it may be independent of any cofactor. This is important, as the proportion of individuals with an allergy who react to an ED 05 is unlikely to be static, as a result of which more than 5% of the population with an allergy might conceivably react to an ED 05 level at some stage.

### Rethinking our approach to allergic rhinitis management [^114jR3Xw]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This article reviews the recommendations by the World Health Organization's new guidelines, "Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma" (ARIA), and the paradigm for treating allergic rhinitis based on disease classification. After reading this article, readers should understand the ARIA guidelines and the salient issues involving the challenges inherent in the management of allergic rhinitis.

Data Sources

Relevant and appropriately controlled clinical studies and results of patient surveys were used. Only literature in the English language was reviewed.

Study Selection

Material was taken from academic/scholarly journals, published abstracts, and presentations at a major congress.

Results

The ARIA guidelines' new classification categorizes patients' allergic rhinitis as either intermittent or persistent with gradations from mild to moderate-severe. These guidelines propose a stepwise approach to management guided by symptom severity and evaluation of treatment response, with the underlying concept for treatment being to select therapies that address individual patients' symptoms. Although few data were available at the time of their inception, the guidelines recognize that antileukotriene medications may play an important role in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Results of recent clinical trials support the use of antileukotriene medications in allergic rhinitis, alone or concomitantly with an antihistamine.

Conclusions

Targeting specific and multiple mechanisms of allergic rhinitis and individualizing all available and effective treatments to each patient, with specific medications for specific symptoms, will be of particular benefit to patients with allergic rhinitis.

### It's time to rethink mite allergen avoidance [^113zxfXF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The role of allergen exposure in the etiology of allergic sensitization and asthma is complex. Advice on strategies to avoid domestic allergens remains contentious because trials of interventions aimed to prevent asthma or reduce symptoms have often failed to demonstrate benefits. Asthma management guidelines differ widely in their recommendations, while Web-based information often claims benefits associated with products. In this rostrum we argue that although many factors have a role in both the etiology and the exacerbation of asthma, allergen exposure probably remains an important contributor to the manifestations of the disease. Currently, there is no evidence-based framework for effective domestic allergen avoidance interventions to reduce chronic aeroallergen exposure. The development of an effective approach to allergen avoidance requires a better understanding of (a) the physical nature of chronic aeroallergen exposure and methods for measuring and reducing this, (b) the interaction between allergen exposure and innate immune modulators at different disease stages, and (c) markers enabling the identification of individuals who would benefit from this. The strategic risk of overemphasizing other novel mechanisms and approaches to asthma management is that we will prematurely abandon and fail to improve an existing approach that could have a significant impact on the development, progression, and symptoms of the disease.

### Common characteristics of upper and lower airways in rhinitis and asthma: ARIA update, in collaboration with GA (2) LEN [^112Fiqbo]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

This update aimed to review the new evidence available to support or refute prior Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) statements. A Medline search of publications between 2000 and 2005 was conducted, with articles selected by experts. New evidence supports previous ARIA statements, such as: (i) allergic rhinitis (AR) is a risk factor for asthma; (ii) patients with persistent rhinitis should be evaluated for asthma; (iii) most patients with asthma have rhinitis; (iv) a combined strategy should be used to treat the airways and (v) in low- to middle-income countries, a different strategy may be needed. The increased risk of asthma has also been found among sufferers from non-AR. Recent reports show AR is a global problem. Many studies demonstrated parallel increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis, but in regions of highest prevalence, it may be reaching a plateau. Factors associated with a reduced risk of asthma and AR have been identified, confirming previous findings of protection related to exposure to infections. Treatment of rhinitis with intranasal glucocorticosteroids, antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists or immunotherapy may reduce morbidity because of asthma. To take advantage of the paradigm of unified airways, there is a need to rationalize diagnosis and treatment to optimize management.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) burden — sleep and productivity impacts are substantial, with up to 45% of children experiencing sleep disruption because of nasal allergy symptoms and workers reporting both absenteeism and presenteeism with large productivity losses. Specifically, up to 10% of workers reported absenteeism, up to 25% reported presenteeism, and an estimated 23% to 33% decrease in productivity on worst allergy days versus no-symptom days. AR commonly coexists with asthma, being present in about 75% to 80% of all patients with asthma and in nearly 100% with allergic asthma, and is associated with increased asthma-related hospitalizations and higher total annual medical costs.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a very common disease with over 600 million people (200 million of them with concomitant asthma) worldwide suffering from it. The majority of patients who seek medical advice are seen in primary care.

Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) is one of the most common conditions in medicine, affecting the quality of life of millions of patients throughout the United States. Despite its ubiquitous nature, NAR remains a poorly managed and often difficult to treat condition. NAR is often suboptimally managed by clinicians with poor clinical outcomes. Establishing the correct diagnosis requires a keen understanding of the unique underlying mechanisms involved in NAR, which is still evolving. Ultimately epidemiologic studies that better define NAR prevalence and its economic burden on society are needed to convince funding agencies of the need for research to elucidate mechanisms and specific treatment approaches for this condition.

Cow's Milk

Seventeen studies were identified representing 1045 positive FCs (98% in children) (Table E5, available in this article's Online Repository at). At meta-analysis, the estimated rate of anaphylaxis in those individuals reacting with objective symptoms to ED 05 levels of exposure was 4.9% (95% CI: 2.1%-11%) (Figure E5, available in this article's Online Repository at). Two studies also reported the occurrence of subjective symptoms to low-level exposures. Blom et alestimated that 13% to 20% of individuals with an allergy to cow's milk will develop subjective symptoms to ED 05 exposures (2.4–6.6 mg of cow's milk protein). Turner et alreported a single-dose challenge study in which 50 of 172 milk-allergic individuals (29%) developed any symptoms to 0.5 mg of cow's milk protein; at least 19% developed transient subjective symptoms, consistent with the estimate of Blom et al.

Although cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies in early childhood, the majority of children tend to outgrow it. This may explain why there is a perception that cow's milk allergy is less "serious" than other food allergies. In reality, there are different phenotypes and children with persisting cow's milk allergy may be more at risk of severe reactions: indeed, cow's milk is the single most common cause of fatal anaphylaxis in children in the United Kingdomand a common cause of fatal and near-fatal reactions elsewhere.

Allergy diagnostic testing — pollen sensitization and aerobiologic survey discordance is noted when skin reactivity or specific IgE tests are positive to pollens present at low levels or absent in surveys; potential explanations include cross-reactivity, sensitization at low or high exposure levels, nonapplicability of aeroallergen surveys to a patient's environment, or clinically irrelevant sensitization. When seasonal symptoms remain unexplained by routine testing, the clinician might consider testing with more esoteric allergens, perhaps based on a home visit.

Diagnosis and Management

Once a patient is diagnosed with a food allergy, it becomes important to identify the allergen(s) that cause the disorder and determine if it is mediated by IgE. If so, treatments for IgE-associated allergies can be selected (Figure 3). In early studies of food allergies, diagnoses were based on careful analyses of case histories and diaries to document symptoms and offending foods. For more information on the diagnosis of food allergies, see Figure 3 and articles by Sicherer and Sampson, De Silva et al, and Boyce et al.

Figure 3
Diagnosis and management of IgE-associated food allergies. The diagnosis of a food allergy involves a case history and a demonstration of allergen-specific IgE production. Provocation tests and diets are used to identify disease-causing allergens. Based on this information, allergen-specific forms of treatment can be selected. This approach currently is being introduced into clinical practice. CFSE, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia.

Results from serologic and in vitro tests alone are not sufficient for the diagnosis of IgE-associated food allergies because the presence of allergen-specific IgE is not always associated with symptoms. This might be because certain antigens in food react with IgE but do not have allergenic activity. Furthermore, certain allergens easily are degraded and/or do not pass the epithelial barrier in sufficient quantities. For this reason, provocation tests often are useful and required to confirm IgE-associated food allergy. Skin tests are relatively easy to perform, but just as for IgE tests, results are not always associated with symptoms. Skin tests can detect IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation; these include the skin-prick test, prick-to-prick test, and intradermal test. Atopy patch tests can detect delayed-type reactions mediated by T-cell reactions.

### Evolving paradigms of treatment of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis [^117SZaDu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a prevalent disease affecting approximately 15% of the US population, which is approximately 50 million individuals. More broadly, it is estimated that 400 to 500 million people worldwide experience AR. Not surprisingly, AR has a significant impact on quality of life due to increased fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, presenteeism or absenteeism, and impairment of performance, which all contribute to an increased cost burden to the medical system. Recent studies have identified social determinants of health including income level, age of migration from rural to urban areas or to high-income countries, and access to health care as important factors associated with the prevalence of allergic diseases. However, up to 25% of individuals have non-AR triggered by mechanical, osmotic, and chemical irritants, and 50% have mixed rhinitis characterized by allergic and nonallergic triggers. Uncontrolled chronic rhinitis subtypes have all been associated with asthma, eczema, chronic or recurrent sinusitis, cough, and both tension and migraine headaches. This review will address AR and non-AR with a focus on evolving treatments in adults.

The guideline is based on evidence as well as on expert opinion and is for use by both adult physicians and paediatricians practicing in allergy. The recommendations are evidence graded. During the development of these guidelines, all BSACI members were included in the consultation process using a web-based system. Their comments and suggestions were carefully considered by the SOCC. Where evidence was lacking, consensus was reached by the experts on the committee. Included in this guideline are clinical classification of rhinitis, aetiology, diagnosis, investigations and management including subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy. There are also special sections for children, co-morbid associations and pregnancy. Finally, we have made recommendations for potential areas of future research.

### Advances and highlights in biomarkers of allergic diseases [^115B2SGj]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestations of food allergies are generally induced by specific IgEs with symptoms ranging from pruritus, wheezing, vomiting, and diarrhea to anaphylaxis. The term "anaphylaxis" refers to a rapid, systemic reaction that can lead to hypotension, respiratory failure, and death. Anaphylactic reactions are not only limited to food‐allergic individuals, but can occur as a serious allergic reaction upon contact with some allergens in individuals sensitized to these allergens. Aeroallergens on the other hand do not cause systemic anaphylactic reactions upon inhalation in environmental exposure doses. Local challenges with segmental allergen exposure however can cause anaphylactic reactions locally. There are limited studies on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of anaphylaxis. Newer models of adrenaline autoinjectors facilitate the administration of adrenaline. There is a current need to improve public knowledge of using autoinjectors, especially for people at risk of anaphylaxis, and for individuals working in day care centers. Blazowski et al. classified clinical phenotypes of real‐life food‐induced anaphylaxis in a large homogenous children population. Their results reveal two clinical phenotypes of different severity. Importantly, the first phenotype is defined as skin/non‐severe respiratory phenotype with mild‐to‐moderate allergic reactions and no cardiovascular, life‐threatening respiratory, and severe central nervous system. The second phenotype is four times less frequent and characterized by a severe respiratory/cardiovascular phenotype, with predominant severe to life‐threatening manifestations, including all cardiovascular, severe respiratory, and central nervous system symptoms.

### Diagnostic challenges in anaphylaxis [^111EggBU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Since its discovery over 100 years ago, research has led to great strides in describing pathophysiologic mechanisms of anaphylaxis; however, there is still imprecision regarding its definition and a lack of reliable, confirmatory testing. In this paper, we review definitions of anaphylaxis, highlighting studies examining the utility of the current clinical consensus definition. In addition, we evaluate current difficulties and limitations for both providers in acute care settings managing episodes and allergists evaluating patients after an episode has resolved. Finally, we provide an algorithm for outpatient evaluation of patients with a history of possible anaphylaxis.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^117WcVkS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

This report is an important step toward addressing these challenges. It is novel in that it combines disparate recommendations from recent guidelines into a common practical pathway that can be used by all centers dealing with food allergy. We showcase how to apply guidelines in practice and provide tips to cope with challenges.

We provide practical steps for health care professionals working with people suspected of food allergy. Our target audience is professionals working in allergy centers, as well as in other hospital roles and in primary care. Not every clinic or setting will be able to undertake all the steps mentioned. We hope that describing a clear pathway concordant with recent guidelines will encourage referrals to other centers where necessary and develop more local capacity and capability over time. Different geographic regions can use this pathway to implement guidelines more consistently and harmonize how diagnostic tests are performed. This may also support more comparable data from different centers to enhance research.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^1127Wu3c]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

4 LIMITATIONS OF THIS REVIEW

We chose to focus on IgE‐mediated food allergy and FPIES, as these are arguably the only food allergy phenotypes with clear diagnostic criteria associated with acute, life‐threatening reactions. However, since only two papers relating to FPIES were identified for inclusion, the majority of this review relates to IgE‐mediated food allergy and anaphylaxis. The majority of included studies were from Europe and North America, thus, our conclusions require confirmation in food‐allergic people from other regions. The extensive heterogeneity in severity definitions applied to food allergy, and their highly variable usage by individual studies, precluded a more quantitative analysis of the evidence.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^116CQZ6K]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) — a clinicopathologic diagnosis — requires symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction and isolated eosinophilic inflammation of the esophagus; although commonly associated with food sIgE, the precise mechanistic role of food allergy is not well defined and both IgE-mediated and non–IgE-mediated mechanisms can be involved. In younger children EoE presents with feeding disorders, vomiting, reflux symptoms, and abdominal pain, whereas in adolescents and adults it most often presents with dysphagia and esophageal food impactions.

### Fish and shellfish allergy: presentation and management differences in the UK and US-analysis of 945 patients [^1172o8ER]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Seafood allergy (SA), including allergy to shellfish (crustacean and mollusks) and fish, is among the 4 most common food allergies causing anaphylaxis, but there are limited data showing SA clinical management in different countries.

Objective

We sought to characterize a large cohort of patients with fish and shellfish allergy and to facilitate standardization of future care for this increasingly common allergic disease.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, observational, noninterventional study from 945 patients from 2015 to 2019 in 7 hospitals in the United States and the United Kingdom to evaluate SA. A chi-square test was used to detect differences in family history, medical history, and current symptoms between patients in 2 countries.

Results

Underdiagnosed anaphylaxis in patients with SA was associated with underuse of epinephrine (adrenaline) autoinjectors in both countries. Oral food challenge was used only when skin or serologic test results were negative. Asthma and allergic rhinitis were more common in the US patients with SA, but eczema was more common in UK patients with SA (P < .001). Respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms were higher in UK patients with SA than in US patients with SA (P < .001).

Conclusions

In international multicenter cohorts of patients with fish and shellfish allergy, there are opportunities for improvement in management. Physician identification of anaphylaxis, use of diagnostic oral food challenges, and anaphylaxis treatment with epinephrine are areas with significant knowledge gaps in need of improvement in the United Kingdom and the United States. There is an opportunity for the development of unified, standardized diagnostic protocols for SA with distribution for allergists and trainees.

### An algorithm recommendation for the pharmacological management of allergic rhinitis in the UK: a consensus statement from an expert panel [^111iv3Xk]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Management in primary care — diagnosis

The definition, aetiology and classifications of AR are described in Table 1, and the diagnosis of AR by symptom assessment is outlined in Fig. 1. Confirmation of the diagnosis may be made through questions concerning family history, social history (housing, pets, occupation, possible triggers), and visual examination. The common triggers for AR are listed in Table 1.

AR is the predominant form of rhinitis in children, but also accounts for one-third of adult cases. At greatest risk are those with a personal or family history of atopy (defined by positive skin prick tests or specific IgE to common aeroallergens). The clinical history should determine whether allergy testing is required, which may be useful to identify or exclude an allergic trigger that may influence management, e.g. aeroallergen avoidance. GPs should perform either skin prick testing or serum total/specific IgE depending on local availability. The former has the advantage that it is cheaper and the patient gets instant feedback, but is time consuming and requires stopping anti-histamines for a week. Ideally, allergy testing would be performed in all patients with rhinitis not only for advice about potential allergen avoidance but also because it will alter the management pathway. Allergy testing will not, however, identify non antigenic chemical irritants which can cause nasal airway hyper-reactivity through a non IgE-mediated pathway. Indeed in many cases exogenous chemical irritants may aggravate underlying AR. In reality, the majority of patients presenting in primary care with AR can be managed without formal identification of the specific allergic triggerwith pharmacotherapy.

### US food allergy patients' experiences, priorities, and needs: a qualitative study [^113ZEZ8M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

We interviewed 81 people residing in the United States with at least 1 physician-confirmed diagnosed IgE-mediated FA. Participant characteristics are reported in Table II. More than half were diagnosed before the age of 7 years (Table II). Many participants had multiple FAs, and the most common allergies were to peanuts and/or tree nuts (86%), with allergies to milk and/or shellfish each found in 27% of respondents. Younger participants were more likely to report a peanut allergy, and older participants were more likely to report a shellfish allergy. Self-reported reaction types were largely skin or mouth (91%), respiratory (65%), and gastrointestinal (53%).

Table II
Participant demographic and clinical characteristics

Natural history of FA

About 10% of interviewees had trouble remembering the specifics of their diagnosis because it occurred at a very young age, sometimes decades ago. The most common starting point for peoples' experiences with FAs was that someone outside the health system noticed signs or symptoms (see Table III). This was either the individual themselves, a family member, or a school or daycare provider. Parents mentioned that it can be challenging to identify FAs among infants and toddlers who cannot yet speak, which is significant given that 43% of diagnoses occurred before the age of 4 years. People experience a range of symptoms when they encounter a food allergen. Reactions range from mild symptoms to severe anaphylaxis requiring emergency care. Participants described symptoms characteristic of IgE-mediated (Table IV) and non–IgE-mediated FAs (see Online Repository Materials, Table E1, at). Direct quotes from patients provide examples of the terminology patients use to describe symptoms.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^112t3Pxx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of anaphylaxis by organ system involvement — key table footnotes and exclusions — are specified for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) criteria: gastrointestinal involvement is "variably defined as 'persistent' (NIAID) or 'severe' (WAO)", hypotension is defined as "a decrease in systolic BP greater than 30% from that person's baseline", and for "Adults and children above 10 years" as "systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg". WAO also specifies exclusion of "lower respiratory symptoms triggered by common inhalant allergens or food allergens perceived to cause 'inhalational' reactions in the absence of ingestion", and notes that "Laryngeal symptoms include stridor, vocal changes, and odynophagia".

### Improving outcomes for asthma patients with allergic rhinitis: conclusions from the metaForum conferences [^114SFwmb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The two MetaForum conferences provided an opportunity for presentation of current information on asthma and allergic rhinitis, as well as a forum for discussion by European experts of important issues in the field of allergy and asthma. Several key points were the focus of the talks and discussions and led to the development of consensus recommendations at the end of each conference. These topics remain the focus of active investigation as well as being very relevant today.

Results of epidemiologic studies indicate that allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma, that allergic rhinitis and asthma often occur in association, and that having comorbid allergic rhinitis is a marker for the presence of more difficult to control asthma and greater use of resources for asthma. Patients enrolled in the international survey reported in the present supplement often experienced a worsening of asthma symptoms when allergic rhinitis symptoms worsened. Moreover, inflammatory processes are very similar in asthma and allergic rhinitis.

These findings support the Allergic Rhinitis Impact on Asthma recommendation that all patients with asthma be checked for allergic rhinitis, and vice versa. Treatment plans need to take into account the presence of both conditions. More generally, there is a need to promote the use of combined therapies that are safe and effective for treating symptoms of both asthma and allergic rhinitis and that address the inflammatory nature of these two conditions affecting the 'one airway'.Active study continues to better characterize the burden of comorbid asthma and allergic rhinitis, as well as the potential benefits of concomitantly treating both conditions.

The structured review of patient surveys reported in the present supplement suggests that asthma remains poorly controlled for many adults and children. Patients tolerate symptoms and have low expectations of asthma treatment; communication between patients and their physicians could be improved; and physicians often inaccurately assess disease severity and asthma control. Results of a recent review of pediatric studies worldwide support these findings and suggest that asthma guidelines are often not followed.

### Allergy relief for your child… [^116SpnUo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

When a child's sniffles and sneezing won't go away for weeks, the cause might be allergies. Long-lasting sneezing, with a stuffy or runny nose, could signal the presence of allergic rhinitis — the collection of symptoms that affect the nose when you have an allergic reaction to something you breathe in, and it lands on the lining inside the nose. Allergies can be seasonal or year-round. In most parts of the U. S., plant pollens are often the cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis, more commonly called hay fever. Indoor substances — such as mold, dust mites and pet dander — can cause the perennial kind. Up to 40% of children suffer from allergic rhinitis. And children are more likely to develop allergies if one or both parents have allergies. Allergy: The Body's Reaction to Allergens An allergy is the body's reaction to a usually harmless substance, or allergen.

Our immune system responds to the invading allergen by releasing histamine and other chemicals that typically trigger symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes or skin. In some children, allergies can also trigger symptoms of asthma, a disease that causes wheezing or difficulty breathing. If a child has allergies and asthma, not controlling the allergies can make asthma worse. It may help to keep windows closed in your house and car and run the air conditioner. Allergy Medicines for Children For most children, symptoms may be controlled by avoiding the allergen, if known, and using nonprescription medicines. But if a child's symptoms are persistent and not relieved by nonprescription medicines, see a health care professional. Always read the product label to make sure a medication is right for your child's age. Some OTC allergy medicines are approved for children as young as 6 months — but not all.

Just because a product's box says it's intended for children, doesn't mean it is intended for children of all ages. After allergy testing, typically by skin testing to detect what allergens your child may react to, a health care professional injects the child with "extracts, " small amounts of the allergens that trigger a reaction. The doses are gradually increased so that the body builds up immunity to these allergens. Allergen extracts are manufactured from natural substances, such as pollens, insect venoms, and animal hair. More than 1, 200 extracts are licensed by the FDA.
