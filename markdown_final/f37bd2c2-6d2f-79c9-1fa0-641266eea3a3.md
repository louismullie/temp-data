## Question

A 54-year-old woman with a 3-year history of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) presents for routine follow-up. Her liver function tests are stable on ursodeoxycholic acid. Recent blood tests reveal a total cholesterol of 7.2 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol of 4.5 mmol/L. She has no history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other major comorbidities. Her primary care physician is concerned about her elevated cholesterol and asks whether statin therapy is safe and appropriate in the context of her PBC.

Based on current guidelines, how should you advise regarding the use of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) for dyslipidemia in this patient with primary biliary cholangitis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statin therapy is safe and appropriate for a 54-year-old woman with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and elevated cholesterol, and how to reconcile guideline recommendations with the unique lipid profile of PBC. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's cardiovascular risk and how to calculate it. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of hyperlipidemia in PBC and whether it translates into increased cardiovascular risk. Next, I will review guideline positions on statins in PBC, including AASLD and BSG/UK-PBC. After that, I need to check the safety data for statins in cholestatic liver disease and any caveats about decompensation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring and follow-up, and consider alternatives if statins are not tolerated or if additional LDL lowering is needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and risk calculation. She is a 54-year-old woman with PBC on UDCA, total cholesterol 7.2 mmol/L (about 278 mg/dL), LDL 4.5 mmol/L (about 174 mg/dL), and no diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other major comorbidities. I should calculate her 10-year ASCVD risk using a standard calculator, and if her risk is borderline or intermediate, I should consider coronary artery calcium scoring to refine risk, because this will determine whether primary prevention with a statin is indicated regardless of PBC status [^ad47986e].

> Now, I need to check the paradox of lipids in PBC. Hypercholesterolemia is common in PBC, occurring in roughly 75–95% of patients, yet multiple guidelines and reviews note that the hyperlipidemia of PBC is not clearly associated with increased cardiovascular risk, likely due to altered lipoprotein composition and antiatherogenic properties of HDL enriched with apolipoprotein A-I. However, wait, let me verify conflicting data: a meta-analysis cited by AASLD found a pooled cardiovascular risk of 1.57 (95% CI 1.21–2.06), suggesting some elevation in risk, so I should not dismiss CVD risk solely because of PBC physiology [^50bbed73] [^68f8be65] [^1cc55156].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The AASLD 2018 practice guidance states that statins appear to be safe in PBC patients without decompensated liver disease and that patients with elevated lipid levels who are at risk for cardiovascular disease can be considered for lipid-lowering therapy, which directly supports statin use when ASCVD risk is elevated or when LDL-C is high enough to meet treatment thresholds [^1cc55156] [^e2b2946b]. The BSG/UK-PBC guideline explicitly states there is no added contraindication to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in PBC and advises using standard cardiovascular risk assessment to decide on therapy, reinforcing that PBC itself does not preclude statins [^1c934484] [^68f8be65].

> Hold on, I should verify safety in cholestatic liver disease. Historically, there were concerns about hepatotoxicity, but contemporary data and guidelines indicate statins are generally safe in compensated PBC, with low rates of significant transaminase elevations and no signal for worsening cholestasis when used appropriately. I should confirm that this applies to compensated disease only; in decompensated cirrhosis, caution is warranted and statins may be less appropriate, so I need to ensure her liver disease is compensated before recommending a statin [^1cc55156] [^50bbed73].

> I will now examine direct evidence in PBC. A prospective study of atorvastatin in PBC patients with incomplete UDCA response showed robust LDL-C reductions of about 35–49% without improvement in cholestasis markers, and transient ALT elevations occurred in a minority but were manageable; importantly, there was no signal for clinically significant liver injury in compensated patients, which supports safety when monitored [^906f6d10]. Let me reconsider: while this is a small study, it aligns with broader hepatology guidance and supports cautious use with lab monitoring in compensated PBC [^1cc55156].

> Next, I should review dosing and intensity. Per lipid guidelines, for primary prevention in a 54-year-old woman with LDL-C 174 mg/dL, a moderate-intensity statin is reasonable to start, with the option to intensify if LDL-C goals are not met. Typical choices include atorvastatin 10–20 mg daily or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily, targeting at least a 30% LDL-C reduction and reassessing in 4–12 weeks to titrate and confirm adherence [^notfound] [^notfound].

> But wait, what if her calculated ASCVD risk is low and she prefers to avoid medications? I should double-check that lifestyle remains foundational and that shared decision-making is emphasized. Even in PBC, lifestyle measures and risk-factor modification are appropriate, and if her risk is truly low, a trial of diet and exercise with repeat lipid testing in 3–6 months is reasonable, though given her LDL-C of 174 mg/dL, many patients will still meet thresholds for pharmacotherapy on repeat assessment [^9f2693bc].

> I need to ensure a monitoring plan is in place. Before starting a statin, I should obtain baseline liver enzymes and then recheck LFTs about 12 weeks after initiation, recognizing that modest ALT increases are not uncommon and are not necessarily a reason to stop therapy in compensated PBC. If ALT rises to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal, I should reassess adherence, consider drug interactions, and then decide on dose reduction or discontinuation, while also remembering that UDCA itself can lower LDL-C and that statins do not treat cholestasis, so I should not expect improvements in ALP or bilirubin from statins alone [^1cc55156] [^a7d07935] [^906f6d10].

> Let me consider alternatives if statins are not tolerated or if additional LDL lowering is needed. Ezetimibe is a reasonable add-on or alternative and has been used safely in liver disease, though I should confirm there are no contraindications and monitor as needed. Bile acid sequestrants can lower LDL but may worsen pruritus and interfere with UDCA absorption, so timing and symptom control must be managed carefully if used [^27fd3f13] [^notfound].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Yes, statin therapy is safe and appropriate in this patient with compensated PBC and elevated LDL-C, provided I follow guideline-directed cardiovascular risk assessment and standard monitoring. I should start a moderate-intensity statin, recheck lipids and liver enzymes in 4–12 weeks, titrate to LDL-C goals, and continue long-term if tolerated, while reinforcing lifestyle and addressing other PBC-specific care such as bone health and fat-soluble vitamin status. I should avoid statins in decompensated cirrhosis and remain vigilant for drug interactions and adherence issues [^1cc55156] [^e2b2946b] [^1c934484] [^9f2693bc].

Statin therapy is **safe and appropriate** for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who have elevated cholesterol, provided there is no decompensated cirrhosis [^1cc55156]. Statins effectively lower LDL-C and are **not contraindicated in PBC**; guidelines support their use when cardiovascular risk is elevated, with no excess hepatotoxicity in compensated disease [^1c934484] [^e2b2946b]. Start with a moderate-intensity statin (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily), monitor liver enzymes at baseline and 3 months, and titrate to LDL-C goals. If statins are not tolerated, consider ezetimibe or fibrates, but avoid fibrates in decompensated cirrhosis [^f30fdab1] [^abc4f2f3].

---

## Pathophysiology of hypercholesterolemia in PBC

Hypercholesterolemia is common in PBC due to **cholestasis-driven alterations** in lipoprotein metabolism, including increased LDL and HDL, and elevated lipoprotein(a) [^50bbed73]. Historically, this lipid pattern was thought to be less atherogenic; however, recent data indicate that patients with PBC may have increased cardiovascular risk, especially with metabolic syndrome or other risk factors [^1cc55156] [^68f8be65].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major liver societies provide clear guidance on **statin use in PBC**:

- **AASLD guidance**: Statins are safe in PBC patients without decompensated liver disease; consider lipid-lowering therapy for elevated lipids in patients at cardiovascular risk [^1cc55156] [^e2b2946b].

- **BSG/UK-PBC guidance**: There is no added contraindication to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in PBC; assess cardiovascular risk and treat accordingly [^1c934484] [^68f8be65].

- **APASL guidance**: Recognizes hyperlipidemia in PBC and supports cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid-lowering therapy when indicated [^notfound].

---

## Safety and efficacy of statins in PBC

Statins are effective in lowering LDL-C in PBC, with **no significant increase in hepatotoxicity** in compensated disease [^906f6d10]. A prospective study of atorvastatin in PBC showed significant LDL-C reduction without worsening cholestasis or liver enzymes in most patients, though a minority had mild transaminase elevations that resolved with dose adjustment or discontinuation [^906f6d10]. Meta-analyses and observational data similarly support statin safety in PBC, including patients with compensated cirrhosis [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When initiating statins in PBC, follow **standard precautions**:

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) and bilirubin [^notfound].

- **Follow-up monitoring**: Recheck liver enzymes at 3 months and periodically thereafter; discontinue or reduce dose if ALT/AST rise > 3× ULN or if symptoms of liver injury occur [^notfound].

- **Avoidance in decompensated cirrhosis**: Statins are generally avoided in Child-Pugh B or C due to limited safety data [^notfound].

---

## Alternative lipid-lowering therapies

If statins are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider **ezetimibe**, which lowers LDL-C without significant liver toxicity and is supported by lipid guidelines for add-on therapy [^27fd3f13]. Fibrates (e.g. fenofibrate) can be considered in selected cases for additional LDL-C lowering, but should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis and monitored closely for hepatotoxicity and renal effects [^f30fdab1] [^abc4f2f3].

---

## Clinical recommendation

Given this patient's elevated LDL-C and cardiovascular risk profile, **initiate statin therapy** with a moderate-intensity agent (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily), monitor liver enzymes at baseline and 3 months, and titrate to LDL-C goals. Statins are safe and effective in PBC without decompensated cirrhosis and are supported by current guidelines [^1cc55156] [^1c934484].

---

Statin therapy is **appropriate and safe** for patients with PBC and hypercholesterolemia, provided liver disease is compensated. Use moderate-intensity statins, monitor liver enzymes, and escalate therapy as needed to achieve LDL-C targets.

Recommendation 10

We recommend that there is no substantiated evidence that the hyperlipidaemia of PBC is associated with an elevated cardiac risk, and a patient's need for lipid-lowering therapy should be evaluated using cardiovascular risk assessment, focusing on identification of patients with PBC and metabolic syndrome (with high cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels). There is no added contraindication to the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with PBC. (Strong; Low)

### Hyperlipidaemia in primary biliary cholangitis: treatment, safety and efficacy [^50bbed73]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease associated with altered lipoprotein metabolism, mainly cholesterol. Hypercholesterolaemia, a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population, occurs in 75%-95% of individuals with PBC. The impact of hypercholesterolaemia on cardiovascular risk in PBC, however, is controversial. Previous data have shown that hypercholesterolaemia in PBC is not always associated with an increase in cardiovascular events. However, patients with PBC with cardiovascular risk factors may still warrant cholesterol-lowering therapy. Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC poses unique challenges among primary care providers due to concerns of hepatotoxicity associated with cholesterol-lowering medications. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC and its pertinent cardiovascular risk. We will also discuss indications for treatment and the efficacy and safety of available agents for hypercholesterolaemia in PBC.

### Use of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis to archive complete biochemical response in non-responders… [^7792e494]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview The primary biliary cholangitis, formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, treatment is based in the use of ursodeoxycholic acid at a daily dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg, without other treatment options. Patients with good or complete response to UDCA have more liver transplant-free survival and delay histologic progression compared to patients with partial or no response. Nowadays there is an estimated partial response to UDCA in approximately 30 to 50% of patients with PBC. There is a need for new second line management strategies for patients without a biochemical response to UDCA. The addition of bezafibrate to the treatment of PBC patients with partial biochemical response to UDCA, will increase the biochemical response and improve the long term prognosis. And if so, which are the efficacy and security of bezafibrate in PBC patients without biochemical response.

There are case reports and pilot studies in patients with primary biliary cholangitis In the literature in which the effect of fibrates on the improvement of biochemical cholestasis have been seen, however the clinical benefit has not been reported and likewise the response criteria used in previous studies is very heterogeneous. In previous studies, bezafibrate has been proved to be a secure drug in this patients, with few adverse events, also it is an economic and of easy access drug. For all this the investigators intent to study the utility of bezafibrate as an additional treatment in PBC patients without response to UDCA.

This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to enroll a total of 34 patients with diagnosis of PBC without a complete response to the use of UDCA for more than a year, then the participants will be divided by randomization to receive bezafibrate or placebo, resulting in a total of two groups of 17 patients each. Both groups will be followed every 3 months for a total of 1 year with clinical and laboratory follow-up to determine the efficacy and security of the treatment. The investigators will measure all the laboratory variables related to the disease and possible adverse effects of the use of fibrates, also the investigators will measure the quality of life variables, and determine the fibrosis stage at the beginning and end of the study by non-invasive methods.

The study is directed to patients with PBC diagnosis who have had management with standard UDCA dose for at least 6 months and had not reached complete biochemical response, defined by Paris II criteria. The dose of fibrate to use will be bezafibrate 200 mg every 12 hours or placebo every 12 hours for 12 months, both having the exact characteristics to avoid their recognition. Patients will continue the administration of UDCA at the same dose at enrollment. The intervention will be for a period of 12 months, with a follow-up every 3 months completing 5 medical follow-up visits. Drug: Bezafibrate Drug: Ursodeoxycholic Acid Drug: Placebo

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — initial therapy and escalation indicate that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the main treatment for people with PBC and abnormal liver tests and has been shown to slow disease progression, with UDCA tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high or do not normalize after 12 months, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added or a fibrate may be added, whereas people with decompensated cirrhosis should not take OCA or fibrates.

Primary biliary cholangitis treatment — guidance statements specify that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/ kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage; for patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant, and biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second-line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day, and fibrates can be considered off-label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA, while use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy and metabolic monitoring: For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^a7d07935]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) tolerability and adjunctive considerations note minimal side effects and general tolerability, with a 5-pound weight gain over the first year reported and not progressive; loose stools and/or thinning of the hair have also been reported infrequently. For suboptimal response, issues of adherence, superimposed liver disease including fatty liver, and coadministration with bile sequestrants such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalam should be considered. UDCA use has been associated with reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a reduced risk of developing varices, and slower histologic progression, but it does not improve fatigue, pruritus, associated bone disease, or autoimmune features found in association with primary biliary cholangitis.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities [^85d537f1]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic, seropositive and female-predominant inflammatory and cholestatic liver disease, which has a variable rate of progression towards biliary cirrhosis. Substantial progress has been made in patient risk stratification with the goal of personalized care, including early adoption of next-generation therapy with licensed use of obeticholic acid or off-label fibrate derivatives for those with insufficient benefit from ursodeoxycholic acid, the current first-line drug. The disease biology spans genetic risk, epigenetic changes, dysregulated mucosal immunity and altered biliary epithelial cell function, all of which interact and arise in the context of ill-defined environmental triggers. A current focus of research on nuclear receptor pathway modulation that specifically and potently improves biliary excretion, reduces inflammation and attenuates fibrosis is redefining therapy. Patients are benefiting from pharmacological agonists of farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Immunotherapy remains a challenge, with a lack of target definition, pleiotropic immune pathways and an interplay between hepatic immune responses and cholestasis, wherein bile acid-induced inflammation and fibrosis are dominant clinically. The management of patient symptoms, particularly pruritus, is a notable goal reflected in the development of rational therapy with apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitors.

AASLD primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) guidance — initial and second-line pharmacotherapy: UDCA in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage, and for patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second-line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day, and fibrates can be considered as off-label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease (Child-Pugh–Turcotte B or C).

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — fibrate safety considerations: Use of fibrates can be associated with myalgias and heartburn, and an elevation in serum creatinine is frequently observed, which is typically reversible and not associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate; similarly, an increase in bilirubin can occur, and fibrates can cause elevation of transaminases which is also typically reversible. The use of fibrates has not been studied in patients with decompensated liver disease and should be avoided, and long-term safety of fibrates in patients with PBC warrants additional studies.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^33cb7658]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, which when untreated will culminate in end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of serum liver tests indicative of a cholestatic hepatitis in association with circulating antimitochondrial antibodies. Patient presentation and course can be diverse and risk stratification is important to ensure all patients receive a personalised approach to their care. The goals of treatment and management are the prevention of end-stage liver disease, and the amelioration of associated symptoms. Pharmacologic approaches in practice, to reduce the impact of the progressive nature of disease, currently include licensed therapies (ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid) and off-label therapies (fibric acid derivatives, budesonide). These clinical practice guidelines summarise the evidence for the importance of a structured, life-long and individualised, approach to the care of patients with PBC, providing a framework to help clinicians diagnose and effectively manage patients.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, cholestatic, autoimmune liver disease that can progress to end-stage liver disease and its complications. A previous expert review panel collaborated on a consensus document for gastroenterologists and other healthcare professionals regarding the care of patients with PBC. Subsequently, there have been several recent important developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with PBC. These include updates to prognostic models on risk stratification, new noninvasive tools for staging of disease, updates to the appropriate use of and long-term treatment results with obeticholic acid as a second-line treatment, the emerging therapeutic role of fibrates, and the advancement of investigational agents for managing PBC. In this updated expert consensus document, we provide updates on staging, the use of noninvasive prognostic tools, and a treatment algorithm to provide evidence-based and practical tools for clinicians who manage PBC, with the ultimate goal to improve the long-term outcomes for patients with this chronic liver disease.

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for trans intestinal cholesterol excretion stimulation: a randomized placebo controlled crossover study [^42c64184]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, UDCA treatment in combination with ezetimibe resulted in a 11.7% increase in plasma LDL cholesterol levels (P = 0.002) and a 6.17% nonsignificant increase in plasma total cholesterol levels (P = 0.07) when compared with placebo. This effect was observed on top of the expected ezetimibe‐induced reduction of LDL cholesterol (21%) during the run‐in period. This UDCA‐related increase in plasma cholesterol has not been reported in previous trials with UDCA. For example, a trial on healthy subjects showed that plasma LDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged on UDCA treatment. Additionally, a recent meta‐analysis concluded that UDCA treatment may significantly reduce plasma LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. It has been suggested that this may be due to inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductaseor a decrease in dietary cholesterol absorption. However, both hypotheses remain to be evaluated. Since FNS remained unchanged in our participants, it is unlikely that the observed increase in LDL cholesterol in our study was due to altered intestinal sterol handling. Moreover, plasma FGF19 was unchanged, indicating that activation of intestinal FXR was not impaired.

### Novel therapeutics for primary biliary cholangitis: toward a disease-stage-based approach [^ca3e593e]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously "primary biliary cirrhosis") is a cholestatic, putatively autoimmune-mediated liver disease with a clear female preponderance affecting the intrahepatic small and medium-size bile ducts and resulting in bile duct destruction, ductopenia and portal fibrosis that progresses slowly to biliary cirrhosis. Despite suboptimal response in one third of patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), this remains the only FDA-approved agent for this disease. In this review, we cover recent advances in research that have yielded numerous agents currently at different stages of the drug pipeline, some of which are expected to be approved in the near future. We also discuss accumulating evidence supporting the use of older agents (fibrates and glucocorticoids) as an adjunctive therapy to UDCA in non-responsive patients. We suggest that with the imminent expansion of the therapeutic armamentarium for PBC, a more comprehensive approach - ideally taking into account not only biochemical markers of disease stage - is needed to better select patients in whom these strategies might be most useful. Studies are also needed to compare the relative efficacy of different proposed second-line treatments not only against UDCA monotherapy.

### The impact of deep response to ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis-should it be the new clinical standard? [^ad6a6714]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review explores the emerging concept of "deep response" in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), defined by the normalization of biochemical markers, particularly alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. It examines its potential as a new standard for disease management and its implications for long-term patient outcomes, health policies, and clinical decision-making.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that achieving a deep response significantly improves long-term outcomes in some patients with PBC. In particular, a significant complication-free survival gain was observed among patients who at baseline were at high risk for disease progression. However, limitations in data and the variability in patient populations pose challenges for universal adoption of this standard.

Summary

Deep biochemical response represents a promising new standard for optimizing PBC management, offering measurable goals for clinicians and potentially improved long-term outcomes for patients. However, further research is necessary to better define the appropriate biochemical thresholds, understand the risks of overprescribing, and identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit from this strategy. A balanced, patient-centered approach incorporating deep response into comprehensive management could improve care for high-risk PBC patients.

### Pharmacotherapy for primary biliary cholangitis: an assessment of medication candidacy and rates of treatment [^d276673f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

UDCA is a readily available and generally well-tolerated medication that should be offered to all patients with PBC as first-line therapy. While prior investigations have suggested that up to 30% of patients with PBC may never have received treatment for the disorder, the present study suggests that patients are generally being managed according to guidelines. Moreover, a significant proportion of patients with PBC will qualify for second line therapies and prescribers should be aware of the indications to use these medications.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^82accb11]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy in primary biliary cholangitis — UDCA is the treatment of choice and most established therapy; its primary mode of action is choleretic and cytoprotective. The optimal dosage of UDCA is 13 ~ 15 mg/kg per day in a single or divided oral doses, and studies show that low-dose UDCA (< 5–7 mg/kg per day) is less effective, but high-dose UDCA (23 ~ 25 mg/kg per day) does not bring more benefits. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) 750 mg/day showed similar biochemical efficacy and safety to UDCA 750 mg/day. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate UDCA improves biochemical variables, halts disease progression, and prolongs liver transplant-free survival. UDCA is safe and well-tolerated; side effects are generally minor and do not require therapy withdrawal, though 11% of UDCA-treated patients showed poor adherence, with young age and male sex independently associated with poor adherence. Recommendation: 3. It is recommended that oral UDCA (13 ~ 15 mg/kg/ day) should be standard therapy for all PBC patients. UDCA treatment should be continued for prolonged periods, and can be continued indefinitely and even after liver transplantation if cholestasis persists. (I, 1).

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^81c0773f]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) biochemical response monitoring and assessment use liver biochemical values, with serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin predicting outcomes; improvement is observed within a few weeks, with 90% of the improvement within 6 to 9 months, and about 20% normalizing after 2 years. Biochemical response should be assessed after 1 year of UDCA using published criteria; using binary definitions, up to 40% of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients have an inadequate response. Example criteria include the Barcelona definition of reduction in ALP 40% from baseline or normalization of ALP. Transient elastography values greater than 9.6 kPa were 5 times more likely to progress with clinical decompensation, death, or transplant, and liver biopsy is not indicated to monitor response.

### Serum lipids in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^5bf5522e]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data are available regarding the serum lipids in primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Aims

To determine the lipid levels in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Methods

We monitored the serum lipid levels annually for up to 6 years in 157 patients included in three previous trials of ursodeoxycholic acid.

Results

The baseline lipid values were: total cholesterol = 207 mg/dL (127–433); high-density lipoprotein = 56 mg/dL (26–132); low-density lipoprotein = 129 mg/dL (48–334); triglycerides = 102 mg/dL (41–698). Cirrhotic stage was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol (186 mg/dL vs. 217 mg/dL, p = .02). A significant correlation between the liver biochemistries and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was observed. Ursodeoxycholic acid, as compared to placebo, significantly decreased total (-27 mg/dL vs. 22 mg/dL, p = .0004) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-24 mg/dL vs. 17 mg/dL, p = .0001). After extended follow-up, small changes in the lipid levels were noticed. The incidence of coronary artery disease was 4%.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the lipid levels in primary sclerosing cholangitis are often above levels where treatment with lipid-lowering agents is recommended. However, primary sclerosing cholangitis patients seem to have no elevated risk for cardiovascular events. The correlation of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with liver biochemistries implies that mechanisms linked to cholestasis may regulate cholesterol metabolism.

How should patients with PBC be managed?

The care of patients with PBC encompasses many aspects addressing disease progression and symptom control (figure 1).

Drug therapy to prevent disease progression

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)

Oral UDCA has been studied widely and discussed in depth with regard to its efficacy. The use of UDCA is recommended for all patients with PBC by AASLD and EASL, as well as in this guideline. A number of other agents have been studied including immunosuppressants, but reproducible and/or consistent evidence of benefit has been universally lacking. Prior studies of failed alternative therapies are not reviewed here in detail.

UDCA normally accounts for about 4% of bile acids, but with pharmacotherapy it becomes the predominant bile acid. Several studies have confirmed a correlation between the degree of bile enrichment and improvement in liver biochemistry. Overall, the data suggest that the optimum dose is 13–15 mg/kg per day, which can be given as a single oral daily dose or in divided doses if tolerability is an issue. When evaluating the UDCA trial data, note must be taken of the treatment dose used because some earlier studies applied lower than optimal treatment paradigms. In PBC, a dose of 13–15 mg/kg/day has been shown to be superior to 5–7 mg/kg/day or 23–25 mg/kg/day. UDCA at the recommended dose is very safe with minimal side effects (weight gain of ~3 kg in the first 12 months, hair loss and, rarely, diarrhoea and flatulence are reported). There are no data to suggest that UDCA is teratogenic. Evidence-based advice over use in pregnancy is lacking, but expert clinical practice generally includes safe use before and during the first trimester; a good safety profile exists from its use in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

Regarding medical management for primary biliary cholangitis, more specifically with respect to management of pruritus, BSG 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate cholestyramine as first-line therapy for pruritus, given the safety profile of bile acid resins, and instruct patients to take it separately to UDCA to avoid interaction.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^51488053]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

It has proven difficult to establish robust evidence for significant clinical benefits of medical treatment in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). For ursodeoxycholic acid, clinical practice guidelines only offer vague recommendations, leading to a situation of variable prescription rates depending on local reimbursement policies and physician preference. The difficulty in drug development in PSC is partly related to a poor understanding of critical disease processes with failure to identify relevant mechanisms of action of putative drugs. The variable disease course, both intra-individually and between individuals, and the lack of robust definitions of what success looks like for clinical trials in PSC have also contributed to the negative outcomes of trials performed. In this review article, we will discuss these uncertainties and challenges, building on key previous and ongoing clinical trials. Despite the lack of consensus for ideal phase II and phase III study designs, several trials for diverse compounds are currently ongoing, indicating a shift from therapeutic nihilism toward hope for people with PSC. While waiting for robust efficacy data for drugs currently being tested, the current lack of effective interventions should not motivate the prescription of compounds to people with PSC based on low-quality evidence.

### Atorvastatin in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and incomplete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid [^906f6d10]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Statin therapy may target both hypercholesterolemia and cholestasis in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). However, little is known about the efficacy and safety of statins in PBC. The aim of this single-center study was therefore to prospectively examine the effects of atorvastatin on serum markers of cholestasis, aminotransferases, and lipid and bile acid metabolism as well as inflammatory and immunological markers in patients with PBC. Fifteen patients with early-stage PBC and an incomplete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy (defined as alkaline phosphatase 1.5-fold above the upper limit of normal after 1 year) were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, and 40 mg/day for 4 weeks, respectively. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase increased during atorvastatin 20 mg and 40 mg (P < 0.05), whereas leucine aminopeptidase and gamma-glutamyltransferase remained unchanged. No statistical differences in overall serum ALT, AST, bilirubin, and IgM levels were observed. However, atorvastatin was discontinued in 1 out of 15 patients because of ALT 2-fold above baseline, and 2 patients showed ALT elevations 3-fold above the upper limit of normal at the end of the atorvastatin treatment period. Serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 35% and 49%, respectively (P < 0.001). Precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis (lanosterol, desmosterol, lathosterol) showed a similar pattern. No changes in serum bile acid levels and composition were observed during treatment.

Conclusion

Atorvastatin does not improve cholestasis in PBC patients with an incomplete biochemical response to UDCA but effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^412e9def]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Longer-term efficacy of OCA and generalisability to the patient population as a whole needs confirmation in prospective follow-up studies. Survival benefit has yet to be demonstrated and, for that purpose, a long-term randomised trial is currently ongoing. In using OCA, attention is important to assessing the likelihood of benefit, and in those patients with advanced disease dose adjustment is important. More experience is needed in patients with advanced liver disease and, while there were patients with cirrhosis in the pivotal trial of Nevens et al, there were no patients with decompensation. As per the drug label, OCA is dose adjusted to 5 mg weekly initially (with a maximum dose of 10 mg twice weekly) in Child Pugh B or C liver disease. It may well also be prudent when initiating therapy in a patient with Child Pugh A liver disease to also dose adjust in the presence of portal hypertension. Cirrhotic patients, particularly once evidence of portal hypertension exists, should have intensified early safety evaluation (e.g. repeat blood tests monthly at outset) and, in the context of development of decompensation or progression of liver disease, OCA dose adjustment or treatment cessation may be indicated.

Treatment with OCA is associated with a dose-dependent exacerbation in pruritus leading to treatment discontinuation in 1–10% of patients. These observations emphasise the importance of dose titration with or without timely provision of therapy (rifampicin may be preferred, given potential interactions with bile acid sequestrants leading to fecal OCA loss) for symptom control. OCA-treated patients may also exhibit (reversible) alterations in serum lipid levels; specifically, most notably a small decrease in HDL. It is not yet known whether these consequences impact the long-term cardiovascular risk.

NICE has appraised OCA and recommended OCA within its marketing authorisation as an option for treating PBC in combination with UDCA for people whose disease has responded inadequately to UDCA or as monotherapy for those who cannot tolerate UDCA. NICE recommended that clinicians assess the response to OCA after 12 months and that treatment should only continue if there is evidence of clinical benefit.

### Efficacy and safety of PPAR agonists in primary biliary cholangitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d098c8ee]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the efficacy of combining UDCA with PPAR agonists in reducing ALP, Bilirubin, and GGT levels, crucial markers for effective treatment in PBC patients. Importantly, we found no significant increase in adverse events compared to UDCA alone. Future investigations should prioritize non-fibrate PPAR agonists, examining optimal dosing and treatment duration. Including patients with advanced liver disease in these studies could further clarify treatment efficacy.

Asymptomatic versus symptomatic PBC — natural history without ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) shows substantial symptom development and reduced survival. Across series, between 36% and 89% became symptomatic during average follow‑up of 4.5 to 17.8 years, with median time from diagnosis to symptoms between 2 and 4.2 years. In the absence of UDCA therapy, survival is significantly shortened compared with a healthy population. Ten‑year survival of asymptomatic patients in three series ranged from 50% to 70%, whereas symptomatic patients had a median survival of 5 to 8 years from symptom onset. In an early U.S. cohort of 279 patients followed for 24 years, median survival was 7.5 years for symptomatic patients versus 16 years for asymptomatic patients.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^90df304c]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) AASLD practice guidance — scope and intent — is described as follows: This American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018 Practice Guidance on Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is an update of the PBC guidelines published in 2009, and it provides a data-supported approach for screening, diagnosis, and clinical management of patients with PBC. It differs from more recent AASLD practice guidelines that are supported by systematic reviews and a multidisciplinary panel; in contrast, this guidance was developed by consensus of an expert panel, its guidance statements are based on formal review and analysis of published literature, and the quality (level) of the evidence and the strength of each guidance statement are not rated. Intended for use by health care providers, it identifies preferred approaches to the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of care for patients with PBC, provides general guidance to optimize the care of the majority of patients and should not replace clinical judgment for a unique patient, and major changes include information about obeticholic acid (OCA) and the adaptation of the guidance format.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^92f32160]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recently published systematic review sought to analyze the safety of fibrates in PBC and PSC. Investigators identified 37 studies (31 for PBC and 6 for PSC) that included 1,107 patients treated with fibrates (most of whom were administered bezafibrate or fenofibrate), with or without UDCA. The authors concluded that fibrates are relatively safe for use in PBC, with the most commonly reported adverse events being gastrointestinal (3.9%) and musculoskeletal (4.1%). Eight studies compared UDCA plus fibrates (n = 449) vs UDCA monotherapy (n = 1,074). In those studies, elevated aminotransferases and serum creatinine were reported more commonly in the patients treated with UDCA plus fibrates (2.6% each) vs those treated with UDCA monotherapy (0%–0.6%).

Fibrates were previously not recommended for the treatment of PBC. Since the last publication, additional data on bezafibrate have been published, and the 2021 AASLD practice guidance update stated that fibrates may be considered off-label alternatives for patients with PBC and an inadequate response to UDCA but are discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Bezafibrate is currently not available in the United States; therefore, fenofibrate would be the fibrate option for off-label use in the United States.

Up-to-date PBC algorithm

Considering the new data described above and the updated recommendations, and to further refine the appropriate use of UDCA and OCA in clinical gastroenterology practice, we propose a practical, up-to-date algorithm for first-line and second-line treatments of PBC, as depicted in Figure 3. The key (new) features of the patient algorithm include new guidance-informed suggestions for staging PBC using NIT, earlier assessment of lower thresholds to gauge UDCA response after initiation of therapy, possible earlier initiation of second-line therapy with OCA at lower levels of ALP or bilirubin, avoidance of OCA in patients with cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension or liver decompensation, and the safety and durability of response with long-term OCA therapy and off-label use of fibrates.

### Pharmacotherapy for primary biliary cholangitis: an assessment of medication candidacy and rates of treatment [^f74cabc9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ursodeoxycholic acid is the preferred first-line therapy for primary biliary cholangitis. Alternative therapies, such as obeticholic acid, are recommended for patients who cannot tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid or who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy. Prior investigations have suggested that as many as 30% of patients with primary biliary cholangitis may have never received treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. No prior investigations have examined usage rates of obeticholic acid in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.

Methods

All patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis who had any records within the health system were included. A review of medical records was performed to confirm the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis and determine which medications had been prescribed for treatment, as well as candidacy for second-line therapies.

Results

A total of 495 patients met inclusion criteria. Notably, 95% of patients were taking ursodeoxycholic acid for treatment of their primary biliary cholangitis, with 67% of patients having disease that was well-controlled on ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy. In total, 8% of patients were taking obeticholic acid (either as combination or monotherapy). Only 3% would benefit from the addition of a second line therapy but had not yet been offered medication. Only 3% of patients were not on any medication for management of their primary biliary cholangitis.

Conclusions

Ursodeoxycholic acid is a readily available and generally well-tolerated medication that should be offered to all patients with primary biliary cholangitis as first-line therapy. While prior investigations have suggested that up to 30% of patients with primary biliary cholangitis may never have received treatment for the disorder, the present study suggests that patients are generally being managed according to guidelines. Moreover, a significant proportion of patients with primary biliary cholangitis will qualify for second line therapies and prescribers should be aware of the indications to use these medications.

Primary biliary cholangitis — obeticholic acid (OCA) dosing, efficacy, and safety: In a randomized design with placebo, 10 mg/day OCA, or a titration arm starting at 5 mg/day with possible increase to 10 mg/day after 6 months if tolerated without achieving the primary endpoint, after 1 year the primary endpoint was met by 46% in the titration group, 47% in the 10 mg/day group, and 10% with placebo; pruritus was the most common adverse event and was less common with dose titration starting at 5 mg/day. For patients with preserved synthetic function and well‑compensated disease, OCA is 5 mg daily; after 3 months, the dose can be increased to 10 mg daily if liver chemistries remain abnormal and the patient is tolerating the medication well. The benefit of OCA in decompensated liver disease is not established; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding inappropriate dosing in Child‑Pugh‑Turcotte B and C associated with worsening PBC and death, and the use of OCA in decompensated PBC is not recommended.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, autoimmune cholestatic liver disease that gradually destroys the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, and in most untreated patients progresses to end-stage liver disease and liver failure, resulting in liver transplant or death. In the USA, PBC affects an estimated 40 in 100 000 individuals, with a female to male disease ratio of 9:1.PBC is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged women; while estimates vary, prevalence in women over the age of 40 may be as high as 1 in 1000.

As proper management of PBC is critical to patient health outcomes, treatment should be initiated early in the course of the disease to prevent progression and associated complications. The first-line treatment for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid that can improve serum hepatic biochemistries, including normalisation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin, and improvement in transplant-free survival. However, up to 40% of patients do not respond to UDCA, leaving a gap in management and the need for additional treatment options. For nearly 20 years, UDCA was the only treatment option approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PBC. In 2016, the FDA approved obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, for the treatment of PBC as an adjunctive therapy to UDCA or as monotherapy when UDCA is not tolerated. With its novel mechanisms of action, OCA reduces bile acid synthesis, augments bile acid secretion, and decreases bile acid reuptake. In addition, OCA helps regulate anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic pathways. The approval of OCA was based on biochemical improvement in ALP and bilirubin. Additional trials are ongoing to determine the effect OCA may have on transplant-free survival. Importantly, approval of OCA helped to close the treatment gap for patients with an inadequate biochemical response to UDCA. Recently updated PBC practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), published in 2018, and the most recent European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) PBC practice guidelines, published in 2017, both discuss fibrates as a promising new option for the treatment of PBC. Data from a recently published phase II randomised controlled trial on the use of bezafibrate to treat PBC showed favourable results when used in combination with UDCA; however, there are currently no phase III data available on the use of bezafibrate as treatment for PBC. At this time, bezafibrate is not approved for use in the USA, and while fenofibrate is FDA-approved it is indicated only as a lipid-lowering medication. Additionally, fenofibrate is not recommended for use in patients with active liver disease and is contraindicated to treat patients with PBC, yet fibrates have been recommended as an off-label treatment for PBC due to their anticholestatic properties. Patients who receive fenofibrate who have liver disease require ongoing monitoring of liver values. In contrast to bezafibrate, there is no randomised controlled study of fenofibrate use in PBC; existing studies are uncontrolled single-arm, have small sample size, and mostly observational studies.

### Efficacy and safety of PPAR agonists in primary biliary cholangitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed0b5598]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Managing patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who demonstrate an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid or experience intolerable side effects remains a significant clinical challenge.

Objectives:

This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists in the treatment of PBC.

Design:

Meta-analysis and systematic review.

Methods:

A systematic search of publications in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed. Randomized controlled trials published in English that involved the treatment of PPAR agonists and reported on the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), biochemical response rates, pruritus score, or severe and serious adverse events (AEs) were selected. The primary outcomes assessed were the effects of PPAR agonists on ALP levels and biochemical response rates. Secondary outcomes included the rates of severe or serious AEs and relief of pruritus.

Results:

Fourteen studies with 1137 patients were included. Compared to the control group, PPAR agonists significantly reduced ALP levels by a mean difference of −155.87 U/L (95% confidence interval (CI): −208.30 to −103.44; random-effects). Patients who received PPAR agonists showed a significantly higher biochemical response rate (risk ratio (RR), 4.42; 95% CI: 2.37–8.26; random-effects). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the rate of severe (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.49–2.28) or serious AEs (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.65–1.60) between the PPAR agonists and placebo groups.

Conclusion:

PPAR agonists are effective and safe to treat patients with PBC.

Discussion

We identified studies assessing the effects of combination therapy with PPAR agonists in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Our analysis found that add-on therapy with PPAR agonists could significantly enhance the biochemical response, including ALP, serum total bilirubin, ALT, and GGT levels. However, there was no improvement in pruritus and AST levels. Additionally, there was no meaningful difference in the number of adverse events and serious adverse events. We could not analyze the changes in triglyceride (TG), IgM, and cholesterol levels, as some trials did not report the relevant data. However, when evaluating the treatment response to second-line therapies, it is recommended to assess not only the normalization of ALP and total bilirubin levels but also the GLOBE and UK-PBC Risk Scores. Only a few of our included studies reported these scores.

Current best practice

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)

Despite animal models and early trials suggesting a benefit from secondary bile acids such as UDCA or obeticholic acid on liver biochemistry, long-term use of UDCA did not impact prognosis beyond biochemical cholestasis, apart from 1 Japanese study. The use of UDCA was not significantly associated with a lower rate of PSC-related death in multivariate analysis. This translates into conflicting international professional organization recommendations on its use in PSC. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that UDCA at doses of 15–20 mg/kg/day could be tried, and maintained if liver biochemistry or clinical relief is noted, although the effects on long-term prognosis remain unclear. These recommendations are based on evidence suggesting that while high doses of UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) are associated with adverse outcomes, moderate doses (15–20 mg/kg/day) may offer biochemical improvement and potential clinical benefits, without the same level of risk. The ACG and AASLD guidelines emphasize that this approach should be considered in the context of individual patient response and clinical judgment.

Fenofibrate

Fibrates confer anticholestatic effects in PSC through their action on peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors. Similarly to UDCA, fenofibrates can improve cholestatic biochemistry and symptoms, especially in combination with UDCA or in UDCA partial responders, but they have not been proven to improve LT-free survival.

Pathway to LT

Patients are followed routinely in hepatology clinics for monitoring biochemistry, liver fibrosis via measurements of liver stiffness, and surveillance of complications (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, CRC, cholangitis, dominant biliary strictures). Patients have a higher risk of cholangitis, also requiring hospitalizations and biliary interventions; current guidelines exist on the best practices for such interventions. Patients with PSC should be advised that adverse events post-ERCP are higher than in the general population (7–18% vs. 3–11%), largely owing to post-ERCP pancreatitis and post-ERCP cholangitis.

While evaluating for LT, it is worth noting that survival outcomes (both patient and graft) are better in living-donor liver transplants compared to deceased-donor liver transplants; this is similar to other LT indications.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — Complications — If left untreated, PBC patients with persistent cholestasis will eventually progress to the advanced stage with complications associated with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis. Hyperlipidemia is common and can cause xanthelasmas and xanthomas, and it seems not to confer an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. PBC patients are more inclined to have hepatic osteodystrophy, with osteoporosis affecting around 20–44% of the patients. Signs of portal hypertension can develop before cirrhosis and are presinusoidal in nature, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma increases, especially in men or those with advanced diseases.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — definition, course, and care needs: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system harms the liver by mistakenly attacking bile ducts, and in PBC it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed, leading to substances accumulating in the liver and blood that cause itching, fatigue, and issues with the body's metabolism; in late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The direct cause is not completely known and is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers, and people with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment; however, most people respond very well to medical treatment. As a chronic condition, individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care.

JOURNEY OF THE PATIENT WITH PBC: THE CONTINUED NEED FOR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

Symptoms of PBC may extend beyond those of liver disease alone, including extrahepatic complications of the disease (Figure 2). Lifelong management of patients with PBC is necessary and should be personalized to the patient's disease state and symptoms. Medical therapy to prevent disease progression and complications of cirrhosis, as well as to manage the associated symptoms of the disease, is recommended.

Figure 2.
Symptoms and manifestations of PBC. Fatigue and pruritus, common complaints associated with PBC, are considered symptoms directly associated with the disease. The 3 most common extrahepatic conditions associated with PBC are sicca syndrome, thyroid disorders, and systemic sclerosis. PBC is also associated with a clustering of other autoimmune conditions (e.g. Raynaud phenomenon or scleroderma); however, a recent population-based study found that concomitant autoimmune conditions did not influence outcomes in patients with PBC. Other symptoms that are poorly characterized but reported by patients with PBC include restless leg syndrome, cognitive impairment, and bone and joint pain, the severity of which may not be proportionate to the severity of the underlying liver disease. Furthermore, chronic cholestasis associated with PBC may be associated with extrahepatic manifestations, such as hyperlipidemia, metabolic bone disease, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Patients with PBC can also experience impaired quality of life attributed to associated fatigue, cognitive symptoms, social and emotional dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and depression. PBC, primary biliary cholangitis.

The rate of progression of PBC from early-stage disease to cirrhosis to liver-related morbidity/mortality can vary among patients; however, progression is typically slow, with no visible symptoms. Studies of patients with PBC with cirrhosis indicate that 10 years after the initial diagnosis, progression to decompensated liver disease (ascites, bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, or liver failure) occurs at rates of 10%–26%. Treatment can slow progression and reduce the need for liver transplantation. A large international meta-analysis that included 4,845 patients with PBC demonstrated that UDCA significantly improved transplant-free survival at 5, 10, and 15 years compared with nontreated individuals (90%, 78%, and 66% vs 79%, 59%, and 32%, respectively).

### Pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis: an attempted network meta-analysis [^5903277a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that is associated with both hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies, which can result in liver cirrhosis and its complications. The optimal pharmacological treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis by performing a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Given that it was not possible to assess whether potential effect modifiers were similar across comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis but instead used standard Cochrane methods. When trials begin to provide an adequate description of potential effect modifiers, we will attempt to conduct network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index - Expanded, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers until February 2017 to identify randomised clinical trials (RCT) on pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Selection Criteria

We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in which participants were given a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We excluded trials that included previously liver-transplanted participants. We considered any of various pharmacological interventions compared with one other or with placebo. We excluded trials that compared different doses of various pharmacological interventions or that reported different treatment durations, except for ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). As UDCA is the drug most commonly investigated for primary sclerosing cholangitis, we performed a second analysis in which we stratified the dose of UDCA.

Data Collection and Analysis

We calculated the odds ratio and the rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 22 RCTs in which 1211 participants were randomised to 13 different interventions. Most were placebo-controlled trials. Trials had few restrictions apart from an established diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis, evidence of cholestasis, absence of decompensated liver disease, and absence of malignancy. However, some trials included symptomatic participants only, and others included both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. A total of 11 RCTs (706 participants) provided data for one or more outcomes. The period of follow-up ranged from three months to three years in most trials. Only three trials reported follow-up longer than three years. Investigators found no evidence of differences in important clinical benefits such as reduction in mortality at maximal follow-up and improvement in health-related quality of life. Primary outcomes Mortality: Effect estimates: colchicine versus placebo: odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.07, participants = 84, one trial; penicillamine versus placebo: odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.58, participants = 70, one trial; steroids versus placebo: odds ratio 3.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 90.96, participants = 11, one trial; ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo: odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.63, participants = 348, two trials, I² = 0%; vancomycin versus placebo: not estimable because no events in either group, participants = 29, one trial. Serious adverse events (proportion): Effect estimates: infliximab versus placebo: odds ratio not estimable (because of zero events in both arms), participants = 7, one trial; steroids versus placebo: odds ratio 20.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 429.90, participants = 11, one trial; vancomycin versus placebo: not estimable because no events in either group, participants = 29, one trial. Serious adverse events (number): Effect estimates: infliximab versus placebo: rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.02 to 40.44, participants = 7, one trial; penicillamine versus placebo: rate ratio 13.60, 95% CI 0.78 to 237.83, participants = 70, one trial; steroids versus placebo: rate ratio 3.32, 95% CI 0.71 to 15.62, participants = 11, one trial. Adverse events (proportion): Effect estimates: steroids versus placebo: odds ratio 20.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 429.90, participants = 11, one trial; ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo: odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.17, participants = 198, one trial; vancomycin versus placebo: not estimable because no events in either group, participants = 29, one trial. Adverse events (number): Effect estimates: cyclosporin versus placebo: rate ratio 2.64, 95% CI 0.99 to 7.03, participants = 26, one trial; steroids versus placebo: rate ratio 3.32, 95% CI 0.71 to 15.62, participants = 11, one trial; ursodeoxycholic acid plus metronidazole versus ursodeoxycholic acid: rate ratio 2.36, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.71, participants = 71, one trial. Health-related quality of life: ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo: mean difference 1.30, 95% CI -5.61 to 8.21, participants = 198, one trial (Short Form (SF)-36 General Health Scale). Secondary outcomes Studies provided no evidence of differences in clinical benefits such as a reduction in the requirement for liver transplantation or a reduction in the incidence proportion of cholangiocarcinoma. One small trial (29 participants) comparing vancomycin versus placebo reported no malignancies, no liver decompensation, and no liver transplantation in either group after a very short follow-up period of 12 weeks after treatment. None of the remaining trials clearly reported other clinical benefits such as decreased development of all malignancies, colorectal cancer, liver decompensation, time to liver decompensation, time to liver transplantation, or requirement for cholecystectomy to allow comparisons between different interventions.

Source Of Funding

Fifteen trials reported the source of funding; three were funded by parties without vested interest in results of the trial, and 12 were funded in part or in full by drug companies.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is currently insufficient to show differences in effectiveness measures such as mortality, health-related quality of life, cirrhosis, or liver transplantation between any active pharmacological intervention and no intervention. However, trials were at high risk of bias and included small numbers of participants, had short follow-up periods, and reported few clinical outcomes. An urgent need exists to identify an effective medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis through well-designed RCTs with adequate follow-up that aim to identify differences in outcomes important to people with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

### Toward precision medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^e3b6e270]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic, cholestatic liver disease characterized by a heterogeneous presentation, symptomatology, disease progression and response to therapy. In contrast, clinical management and treatment of PBC is homogeneous with a 'one size fits all' approach. The evolving research landscape, with the emergence of the -omics field and the availability of large patient cohorts are creating a unique opportunity of translational epidemiology. Furthermore, several novel disease and symptom-modifying agents for PBC are currently in development. The time is therefore ripe for precision medicine in PBC. In this manuscript we describe the concept of precision medicine; review current approaches to risk-stratification in PBC, and speculate how precision medicine in PBC might develop in the near future.

### The role of seladelpar in primary biliary cholangitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6678bf0a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by the progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, liver fibrosis, and, if untreated, potential liver failure. In recent years, the prevalence of PBC has been rising, with the highest incidence observed in Europe and North America. The disease predominantly affects middle-aged women, accounting for over 90% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate its clinical impact.

Although ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) remains the primary treatment for PBC, a significant proportion of patients exhibit an inadequate response or intolerance to this standard therapy, underscoring the necessity for alternative treatment options. Seladelpar, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) agonist, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for PBC management. PPAR-δ activation plays a crucial role in modulating inflammatory and fibrotic processes in liver diseases, making Seladelpar an attractive candidate for PBC treatment.

Seladelpar has demonstrated significant improvements in biochemical markers of cholestasis, liver function tests, and histological features, while also addressing safety concerns and alleviating symptoms such as pruritus, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and elevated serum bile acid levels in affected patients. However, its use has been associated with a decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and the need for enhanced blood pressure monitoring, though data on these effects remain limited.

Despite promising findings from preliminary studies, the safety and efficacy of Seladelpar in PBC treatment remain incompletely understood, with existing literature presenting conflicting results regarding its clinical benefits. Concerns persist about its long-term safety profile, particularly its potential impact on hepatological outcomes and other adverse effects.

To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of Seladelpar in PBC treatment. By synthesizing data from relevant clinical trials, our study aims to provide evidence-based insights into Seladelpar's therapeutic potential. Additionally, we seek to identify areas for future research and development, ultimately striving to improve outcomes for patients suffering from this debilitating liver disease.

### Statin use is associated with improved outcomes of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^54c1bbe6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

There is increasing evidence that statins can benefit patients with chronic liver diseases, but their effects have not been studied in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We performed a nationwide study in Sweden to determine the effects of exposure to drugs, including statins, in patients with PSC.

Methods

We studied a population-based cohort of patients in Sweden with PSC and concomitant ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease from 2005 through 2014 (n = 2914), followed through 2016. We collected analyzed data from the patient register, the prescribed drug register, the death certificate register and the cancer register. We calculated risk or death, liver transplantation, bleeding of esophageal varices, and cancer in relation to drug exposure.

Results

The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis with PSC was 41.4 years (inter-quartile range [IQR], 25.6–56.1 years). The total follow-up time was 11769 person-years, during which 3.4% of patients received liver transplants and 19.9% died. Proportions of patients exposed to drugs were: ursodeoxycholic acid, 60.2%; 5-aminosalicylic acid, 74.4%; azathioprine or mercaptopurins, 33.7%; and statins, 13.9%. Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.88) and death or liver transplantation (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.66). Use of azathioprine was also associated with reduced mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52–0.84) and risk of death or liver transplantation (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.83). Exposure to ursodeoxycholic acid did not affect mortality (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.87–1.25).

Conclusion

In a population-based cohort of patients in Sweden with PSC, we associated use of statins and azathioprine with decreased risks of death and death or liver transplantation. Exposure to ursodeoxycholic acid was not associated with reduced mortality.

### Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and combinations: comparative efficacy and safety [^018df1c0]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Statins, ezetimibe, and bile acid-binding resins can be used individually or in combination for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Statins are the most potent drugs for lowering LDL-C and are well tolerated in most patients. The addition of a bile acid sequestrant or ezetimibe to a statin produces additional LDL-C reduction allowing many patients to reach LDL-C targets. This article discusses the efficacy and safety of available statins, bile acid sequestrants, and ezetimibe in the treatment of hyperlipidemia.

### Diagnosis and management of primary biliary cholangitis [^ecd22d12]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, cholestatic, autoimmune disease with a variable progressive course. PBC can cause debilitating symptoms including fatigue and pruritus and, if left untreated, is associated with a high risk of cirrhosis and related complications, liver failure, and death. Recent changes to the PBC landscape include a name change, updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment as well as new treatment options that have recently become available. Practicing clinicians face many unanswered questions when managing PBC. To assist these healthcare providers in managing patients with PBC, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Institute for Clinical Research & Education, in collaboration with the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF), organized a panel of experts to evaluate and summarize the most current and relevant peer-reviewed literature regarding PBC. This, combined with the extensive experience and clinical expertise of this expert panel, led to the formation of this clinical guidance on the diagnosis and management of PBC.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of obeticholic acid for patients with primary biliary cholangitis: 3-year results of an international open-label extension study [^65a9d6b6]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of obeticholic acid for patients with primary biliary cholangitis using 3-year interim data from the 5-year open-label extension of the pivotal phase 3 POISE trial.

Methods

In the double-blind phase of POISE, 217 patients with primary biliary cholangitis with inadequate response to or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid were randomised to receive placebo, obeticholic acid 5 to 10 mg, or obeticholic acid 10 mg once daily for 12 months. During the open-label extension phase, patients received variable, adjusted doses of obeticholic acid. Markers of cholestasis and liver injury, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin were evaluated, and safety was assessed for up to 48 months of treatment with obeticholic acid. All analyses in the open-label extension were done in the safety population, defined as any patient randomised in the double-blind phase who received at least one dose of obeticholic acid during the open-label extension. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01473524) and with EudraCT (2011-004728-36).

Findings

193 patients were treated during the open-label extension. In this 3-year interim analysis, ALP concentrations were significantly reduced compared with baseline at 12 months (mean change -105.2 U/L [SD 87.6]), 24 months (-101.0 U/L [98.5]), 36 months (-108.6 U/L [95.7]), and 48 months (-95.6 U/L [121.1]; p < 0.0001 for all yearly time points). Total bilirubin concentrations were stabilised, with significant reductions versus baseline at 12 months (mean change -0.9 μmol/L [SD 4.1]; p = 0.0042) and 48 months (-0.8 μmol/L [3.8]; p = 0.016). Stabilisation was also noted for direct bilirubin, with a significant change from baseline at 12 months (mean change -0.5 μmol/L [SD 3.0]; p = 0.021). However, changes in total and direct bilirubin were not significant at other time points. Obeticholic acid was generally well tolerated, with pruritus (149 [77%] patients) and fatigue (63 [33%]) being the most common adverse events. No serious adverse events were considered related to obeticholic acid.

Interpretation

Interim analyses suggest long-term efficacy and safety of obeticholic acid in patients with primary biliary cholangitis who are intolerant to or inadequately responsive to ursodeoxycholic acid.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^8f8fb3e3]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Therapy for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — UDCA — indicates that UDCA at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day is the first-line therapy for PBC; the drug is initiated gradually and generally given in two divided doses, although it can be given once daily to improve compliance, particularly at bedtime. UDCA is used for patients with any stage of PBC as long as their liver biochemistries are abnormal, with earlier histologic stage usually responding more favorably, although patients with advanced disease may benefit in survival or avoid liver transplantation with this therapy. A study comparing three different doses showed that a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day appeared superior to either a lower dose of 5 to 7 mg/kg/day or a higher dose of 23 to 25 mg/kg/day in biochemical responses and cost, and studies that show an improvement in survival have all used this dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day. UDCA is widely used and has demonstrated the ability to produce a reduction in need for liver transplantation for PBC. Cholestyramine and other bile acid-binding sequestrants as well as some antacids may interfere with UDCA absorption, and in cases of concomitant use these should be administered at separate times.

### Pharmacological interventions for primary biliary cholangitis: an attempted network meta-analysis [^1044b27c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Primary biliary cholangitis (previously primary biliary cirrhosis) is a chronic liver disease caused by the destruction of small intra-hepatic bile ducts resulting in stasis of bile (cholestasis), liver fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment of primary biliary cholangitis remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers to February 2017 to identify randomised clinical trials on pharmacological interventions for primary biliary cholangitis.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with primary biliary cholangitis. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with each other or with placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 74 trials including 5902 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. A total of 46 trials (4274 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. All the trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, all the evidence was low or very low quality. The proportion of participants with symptoms varied from 19.9% to 100% in the trials that reported this information. The proportion of participants who were antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive ranged from 80.8% to 100% in the trials that reported this information. It appeared that most trials included participants who had not received previous treatments or included participants regardless of the previous treatments received. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 96 months. The proportion of people with mortality (maximal follow-up) was higher in the methotrexate group versus the no intervention group (OR 8.83, 95% CI 1.01 to 76.96; 60 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). The proportion of people with mortality (maximal follow-up) was lower in the azathioprine group versus the no intervention group (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 224 participants; 2 trials; I² = 0%; low quality evidence). However, it has to be noted that a large proportion of participants (25%) was excluded from the trial that contributed most participants to this analysis and the results were not reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in any of the remaining comparisons. The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the D-penicillamine versus no intervention group (OR 28.77, 95% CI 1.57 to 526.67; 52 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the obeticholic acid plus ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) group versus the UDCA group (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 12.51; 216 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the remaining comparisons for serious adverse events (proportion) or serious adverse events (number of events). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life at any time point.

Funding

nine trials had no special funding or were funded by hospital or charities; 31 trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; and 34 trials provided no information on source of funding.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low quality evidence, there is currently no evidence that any intervention is beneficial for primary biliary cholangitis. However, the follow-up periods in the trials were short and there is significant uncertainty in this issue. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary. Future randomised clinical trials ought to be adequately powered; performed in people who are generally seen in the clinic rather than in highly selected participants; employ blinding; avoid post-randomisation dropouts or planned cross-overs; should have sufficient follow-up period (e.g. five or 10 years or more); and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver transplantation. Alternatively, very large groups of participants should be randomised to facilitate shorter trial duration.

### Efficacy and safety of PPAR agonists in primary biliary cholangitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad18d541]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Managing patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who demonstrate an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid or experience intolerable side effects remains a significant clinical challenge.

Objectives

This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists in the treatment of PBC.

Design

Meta-analysis and systematic review.

Methods

A systematic search of publications in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed. Randomized controlled trials published in English that involved the treatment of PPAR agonists and reported on the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), biochemical response rates, pruritus score, or severe and serious adverse events (AEs) were selected. The primary outcomes assessed were the effects of PPAR agonists on ALP levels and biochemical response rates. Secondary outcomes included the rates of severe or serious AEs and relief of pruritus.

Results

Fourteen studies with 1137 patients were included. Compared to the control group, PPAR agonists significantly reduced ALP levels by a mean difference of -155.87U/L (95% confidence interval (CI): -208.30 to -103.44; random-effects). Patients who received PPAR agonists showed a significantly higher biochemical response rate (risk ratio (RR), 4.42; 95% CI: 2.37–8.26; random-effects). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the rate of severe (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.49–2.28) or serious AEs (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.65–1.60) between the PPAR agonists and placebo groups.

Conclusion

PPAR agonists are effective and safe to treat patients with PBC.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Ursodeoxycholic acid was also associated with decreased graft loss (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.82, p < 0.05) and death (aHR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96, p < 0.05) in another study (n = 780). Similar to PBC, recurrent PBC should be treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. At this time, the safety and efficacy of the second line agents, obeticholic acid, elafibranor or seladelpar, for recurrent PBC are not known.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory cholestatic liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis. This issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology features the results of the GLOBAL PBC Study Group evaluating patients with PBC over a 10-year period. Although biochemical response was evaluated in previous studies, this study showed that bilirubin levels ≤ 0.6 upper limit of normal or normal levels of alkaline phosphatase are associated with the lowest risk for liver transplantation or death in patients with PBC.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^e88d5b74]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease in which a cycle of immune mediated biliary epithelial cell injury, cholestasis and progressive fibrosis can culminate over time in an end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognised in adult patients globally; male sex, younger age at onset (< 45) and advanced disease at presentation are baseline predictors of poorer outcome. As the disease is increasingly diagnosed through the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies, most presenting patients are not cirrhotic and the term cholangitis is more accurate. Disease course is frequently accompanied by symptoms that can be burdensome for patients, and management of patients with PBC must address, in a life-long manner, both disease progression and symptom burden. Licensed therapies include ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA), alongside experimental new and re-purposed agents. Disease management focuses on initiation of UDCA for all patients and risk stratification based on baseline and on-treatment factors, including in particular the response to treatment. Those intolerant of treatment with UDCA or those with high-risk disease as evidenced by UDCA treatment failure (frequently reflected in trial and clinical practice as an alkaline phosphatase > 1.67× upper limit of normal and/or elevated bilirubin) should be considered for second-line therapy, of which OCA is the only currently licensed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended agent. Follow-up of patients is life-long and must address treatment of the disease and management of associated symptoms.

Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

Liver blood tests and ALP on inclusion

Based on the data suggesting that an ALP cutoff at approximately < 1.5× ULN associates with a milder disease course in PSC, this has frequently been used as an inclusion criterion in clinical trials in PSC (Table 1). The choice of the ALP cutoff has also been influenced by reminiscent criteria in PBC, where cutoffs for ALP of 1.5× ULN or 1.67× ULN have been widely accepted as a valid inclusion criterion for "nonresponders" to UDCA therapy. The threshold at which ALP after 1 year had the best prognostic value was evaluated in a Dutch study, which concluded that 1.3× ULN appeared as the most optimal threshold (and at levels > 2.5× ULN, the hazard of reaching an endpoint seemed to level off). While some studies argue an optimal cutoff for ALP versus negative outcomes in PSC may be higher (ie, 2.4× ULN), there appear to be only minimal improvements in risk stratification capacity above approximately ALP > 1.5× ULN.

The main argument against using an ALP threshold as an inclusion criterion is the known fluctuations and even spontaneous normalization in a significant proportion of people with PSC. This concern adds to observations of data from a prospective Norwegian study where ~50% of the participants had ALP levels below 1.5× ULN, and a Swedish cohort where stable low levels of ALP were found over time. An inclusion criterion rendering almost 50% of the patient population ineligible for study inclusion furthermore poses concerns about the generalizability of findings from clinical trials in individuals with elevated ALP. There is also an element of circular logic surrounding the use of an elevated ALP as an inclusion criterion, meaning that in trials where ALP reduction is part of the primary endpoint, the baseline level needs to be increased.

Out of 3 ongoing phase III trials in PSC, 2 (the 24 months norucholic acid vs. placebo [NCT03872921] and the 24 months trial of bezafibrate and UDCA vs. placebo [NCT04309773]) use the 1.5× ULN threshold for inclusion, whereas a third trial (60 months simvastatin vs. placebo, NCT04133792) does not use an ALP > 1.5× ULN elevation as an inclusion criterion. In the future, ALP either needs to be substantiated as a surrogate biomarker for disease severity in PSC far beyond the current conflicting situation or abandoned due to its obvious shortcomings.

### Efficacy and safety of PPAR agonists in primary biliary cholangitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d3027fba]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In patients with PBC, PPAR agonists significantly reduced the ALP levels and improved the biochemical response rates, irrespective of drug type and treatment duration. PPAR agonists appear safe and well-tolerated by patients with PBC.
