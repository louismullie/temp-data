## Question

Nirsevimab prophylaxis against RSV infection in high-risk populations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nirsevimab prophylaxis against RSV infection in high-risk populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the high-risk populations and the clinical outcomes that matter most. Then, I should verify the regulatory indications and dosing by age and weight. Next, I will appraise the efficacy and effectiveness evidence from randomized trials and real-world studies, including subgroup analyses. After that, I need to check safety signals, including antibody-dependent enhancement and second-season outcomes. I will then examine cost-effectiveness and implementation considerations, and finally synthesize practical recommendations and highlight uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the high-risk populations and the key outcomes. High-risk groups include preterm infants, especially those born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, and immunocompromised children, including those with cancer or stem cell transplant, as well as children entering their second RSV season who remain at increased risk for severe disease, while the outcomes of greatest clinical importance are RSV-associated hospitalization, ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation, and medically attended RSV lower respiratory tract infection, with attention to disease severity metrics like oxygen requirement and length of stay [^10fb41c1] [^744a274d] [^d3e8d45b] [^451759f9].

> I need to verify the labeled indications and dosing. The FDA approves nirsevimab for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season, and for children up to 24 months who remain at increased risk through their second RSV season, with dosing of 50 mg IM for infants under 5 kg and 100 mg IM for infants 5 kg or more in the first season, and 200 mg as two 100 mg IM injections for children 8–19 months entering a second season, ideally timed shortly before or during the RSV season and within 1 week of birth for infants born during the season [^c6a284bd] [^c3b70fc7] [^da63722b].

> Next, I should review randomized trial efficacy. In the phase 3 MELODY trial of healthy term and late preterm infants, nirsevimab reduced medically attended RSV LRTI by 76.4% and RSV hospitalization by 77.3% over 150 days, with a pooled analysis showing 79% efficacy against medically attended RSV LRTI and 80.6% against RSV hospitalization, and 90% against ICU admission, while the phase 2b trial in healthy preterm infants showed 70.1% efficacy against medically attended RSV LRTI and 78.4% against RSV hospitalization, and the HARMONIE pragmatic RCT demonstrated 83.2% efficacy against RSV hospitalization and 75.7% against very severe RSV LRTI requiring oxygen, with consistent effects across countries and subgroups [^5cdad590] [^a6c90269] [^0c19aadc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about real-world performance. I should confirm post-licensure effectiveness. Early U.S. estimates from the 2023–2024 season showed 90% effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization, and a 2024–2025 cohort found 79% effectiveness against hospitalization and 63% against ED encounters, while European population-based data from Galicia demonstrated 82% effectiveness against RSV hospitalization with an 89.8% reduction in RSV hospitalizations and a number needed to immunize of 25, and Italian multicenter data showed a 68% reduction in RSV hospitalizations with attenuated but still meaningful protection in preterm infants and those with older siblings, and a Western Australia program reported 88.2% effectiveness against RSV hospitalization in young children, including during the second season [^f5956df0] [^f752f8e8] [^f3ca7173] [^aa162223] [^c7ed439c].

> Wait, let me verify safety and the concern about antibody-dependent enhancement. Across trials and follow-up, nirsevimab has a favorable safety profile similar to placebo, with no excess serious adverse events or deaths attributable to nirsevimab, and importantly, follow-up through the second RSV season in MELODY showed no increase in medically attended RSV LRTI or enhanced disease severity, arguing against antibody-dependent enhancement in this context, although rare hypersensitivity reactions remain possible and should be monitored [^5cdad590] [^28dffc68] [^f52b70cd] [^b3d9972f].

> I should double-check subgroup considerations, especially for preterm infants. While nirsevimab is effective in preterm populations, several real-world and modeling analyses suggest that lower gestational age infants remain at higher risk of early RSV hospitalization despite prophylaxis, possibly due to immature immune systems, altered pharmacokinetics, or lower maternal antibody transfer, prompting discussion of whether alternative dosing strategies could be warranted, though current guidelines still endorse standard dosing pending stronger evidence for modification [^dbe0252b] [^58113ec6] [^2c810387].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness and implementation. Replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab is generally cost-saving due to higher efficacy and single-dose administration, but universal infant prophylaxis is cost-effective only at lower price points, with Canadian analyses suggesting thresholds around $112–$183 per dose depending on region and risk, and Spanish modeling estimating economically justifiable prices near €222–€356 per dose, while U.S. ACIP estimates place cost per QALY at roughly $102,811 for first-season universal use and far higher for second-season use in the general population, reinforcing selective second-season recommendations [^f3038570] [^0721b933] [^3ac7ac23] [^40c12914].

> Let me consider practical administration and timing. Nirsevimab should be given shortly before or during the RSV season, with infants born during the season receiving it within 1 week of birth, and coadministration with routine childhood vaccines is acceptable, though clinicians should align with local epidemiology and consider early-season administration if access is uncertain, while recognizing that protection lasts about 5 months and wanes thereafter, which is why second-season dosing is reserved for high-risk children [^da63722b] [^31098f20] [^f752f8e8].

> But wait, what if maternal vaccination was used. I need to ensure we do not duplicate protection. Current guidance positions maternal RSV vaccination and infant nirsevimab as alternative strategies for first-season protection, with the choice individualized by timing, access, and patient preference, and if maternal vaccination was given sufficiently before birth, infant nirsevimab may be deferred, whereas if maternal vaccination was not given or was too close to delivery, infant nirsevimab is recommended to ensure protection [^e1f553be] [^791a6764].

> I will now examine special populations and second-season use. For immunocompromised children, real-world data show suboptimal uptake but clear clinical benefit when given, supporting efforts to improve access, and for children 8–19 months at increased risk, ACIP recommends a 200 mg dose for the second season, with particular emphasis on American Indian and Alaska Native children given observed disparities in severe RSV burden, while acknowledging that second-season effectiveness data are more limited and cost-effectiveness is less favorable in the general population [^d3e8d45b] [^744a274d] [^40c12914].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis. Nirsevimab provides approximately 70–90% protection against RSV hospitalization across diverse settings, with the most robust evidence in infants entering their first RSV season, a strong safety record without evidence of enhanced disease, and favorable operational advantages over palivizumab, while residual risk persists in preterm infants and those with high household exposure, and cost-effectiveness of universal first-season use is highly price sensitive, supporting broad first-season use and selective second-season use in high-risk groups [^5cdad590] [^0c19aadc] [^f3ca7173] [^aa162223] [^f3038570].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical recommendations. For high-risk infants in their first RSV season, administer nirsevimab per weight-based dosing as early as feasible, ideally before seasonal circulation, with coadministration of routine vaccines as appropriate, and for children 8–19 months at increased risk entering a second season, give 200 mg in two injections, while coordinating with maternal RSV vaccination when used and prioritizing access in underserved populations to mitigate disparities in severe RSV outcomes [^c3b70fc7] [^5cd7bbb5] [^744a274d] [^e1f553be].

Nirsevimab is **highly effective** at preventing RSV-associated hospitalizations and severe disease in high-risk infants, including preterm infants and those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or immunocompromise [^0c19aadc] [^a6c90269]. It provides **approximately 70–90% protection** against RSV hospitalization and reduces the need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation, with a single dose protecting through the RSV season [^0c19aadc] [^a6c90269]. Nirsevimab is **safe and well tolerated**, with no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement or increased severity in breakthrough infections [^28dffc68] [^f52b70cd]. It is recommended for all infants in their first RSV season and for high-risk children up to 24 months, offering a significant advance over palivizumab due to its single-dose regimen and broader eligibility [^c3b70fc7] [^d22a0b17].

## Efficacy in high-risk populations

### Preterm infants

In the phase 2b trial of healthy preterm infants (29–34 weeks' gestation), nirsevimab reduced medically attended RSV LRTI by **70.1%** and RSV hospitalization by **78.4%** over 150 days [^a6c90269]. The phase 3 MELODY trial in healthy term and late preterm infants showed a **76.4%** reduction in medically attended RSV LRTI and a **77.3%** reduction in RSV hospitalization, with **90%** efficacy against ICU admission [^5cdad590]. Real-world data from Galicia, Spain, demonstrated an **82%** reduction in RSV hospitalizations and an **86.9%** reduction in severe RSV requiring oxygen support, with an **89.8%** reduction in RSV-related LRTI hospitalizations and a number needed to immunize of 25 [^f3ca7173].

---

### Infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) and congenital heart disease (CHD)

In the phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial, nirsevimab was noninferior to palivizumab in infants with CLD or hemodynamically significant CHD, with **similar safety and pharmacokinetics** [^8f183e2e]. Although the trial was not powered for efficacy, the **noninferiority** and favorable safety profile support use in these high-risk groups [^8f183e2e].

---

### Immunocompromised children

A single-center study in pediatric oncology and stem cell transplant patients reported **62% uptake** of nirsevimab, with RSV occurring in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, including one RSV-related death in an unvaccinated patient, underscoring the need for improved access and uptake in this population [^d3e8d45b].

---

## Safety profile

Nirsevimab has a **favorable safety profile**, with adverse event rates similar to placebo in clinical trials [^5cdad590]. No evidence of **antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)** or increased disease severity has been observed in breakthrough infections [^28dffc68] [^f52b70cd]. Serious adverse events were **not increased** compared with placebo, and no deaths were attributed to nirsevimab in the pivotal trials [^5cdad590].

---

## Duration of protection

Nirsevimab's extended half-life (**approximately 65–70 days**) provides protection for at least 5 months, covering a typical RSV season with a single dose [^96448278] [^0a0bc1ab]. The HARMONIE trial confirmed sustained protection through **180 days** post-dose, exceeding the typical 5-month season [^47896f53].

---

## Comparison with palivizumab

| **Parameter** | **Nirsevimab** | **Palivizumab** |
|-|-|-|
| Dosing schedule | Single dose per season | Monthly injections |
| Efficacy against RSV hospitalization | 77–83% | 39–55% |
| Duration of protection | 5–6 months | 28 days |
| Cost-effectiveness | More cost-effective due to single dose and broader eligibility | Higher cost and logistical burden |

---

Nirsevimab's single-dose regimen and broader eligibility make it a **more practical and cost-effective** alternative to palivizumab [^1636d839].

---

## Current recommendations and guidelines

- **First RSV season**: All infants < 8 months should receive nirsevimab [^c3b70fc7].
- **Second RSV season**: Children 8–19 months at increased risk (e.g. CLD, CHD, immunocompromise) should receive nirsevimab [^744a274d].
- **Administration**: 50 mg for infants < 5 kg, 100 mg for infants ≥ 5 kg, and 200 mg (two 100 mg injections) for second-season high-risk children [^c3b70fc7] [^5cd7bbb5].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Preterm infants**: Lower gestational age may influence timing and durability of protection, suggesting a need for tailored strategies [^dbe0252b] [^58113ec6].
- **Second season**: Limited efficacy data exist for the second RSV season, though early results are encouraging [^3f7f7917].
- **Access and equity**: Implementation challenges remain, particularly in low-resource settings and among underserved populations [^99278073].

---

Nirsevimab is **highly effective and safe** for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants, providing broad protection with a single dose and significantly reducing hospitalizations and severe disease. It is recommended for all infants in their first RSV season and for high-risk children up to 24 months, representing a major advance over palivizumab.

### Estimated effectiveness of nirsevimab against respiratory syncytial virus [^64576566]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), particularly affecting newborns and infants. Globally, RSV is responsible for approximately 1.4 million hospitalizations and 13 300 in-hospital deaths annually among infants aged 0 to 6 months. The recent introduction of several prophylactic interventions provides a promising strategy to mitigate RSV's impact on this vulnerable population.

Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2023 after demonstrating safety and efficacy in prelicensure trials. These trials reported 79% efficacy against medically attended RSV, 81% efficacy against RSV requiring hospitalization, and 90% efficacy against severe RSV requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Following its licensure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended nirsevimab for infants younger than 8 months entering their first RSV season and for high-risk infants and children aged 8 to 19 months.

While prelicensure clinical trials demonstrated efficacy, it is essential to validate these findings through postlicensure studies that assess the effectiveness of nirsevimab in clinical settings. Such studies are needed to ensure that the protective effects of immunizations remain as they are being used in routine clinical practice, where factors like comorbidities, access to care, and clinician practices can influence outcomes. Early clinical data from the 2023 to 2024 RSV season in Europe and the US show effectiveness ranging from 70% to 90% against hospitalization for RSV-associated LRTI. However, several gaps in knowledge remain. Specifically, there are limited data on nirsevimab's long-term effectiveness, its impact at different dosages, and its ability to prevent milder RSV cases. Furthermore, there is a need for further exploration of its effectiveness in diverse populations, particularly those with underlying health conditions. To address these gaps, this study aims to estimate the clinical effectiveness of nirsevimab in a diverse US patient population and examine how protection varies over time, by disease severity, and by dosage.

### Does nirsevimab prevent lower respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus? [^cfc36baf]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

RSV is one of the most ubiquitous respiratory viruses worldwide and contributes to significant disease burden, morbidity, and mortality in infants and children. Young infants and children, particularly those with medical complications such as prematurity or complex congenital heart disease, are at the highest risk for morbidity and mortality from LRTI associated with RSV. Despite the increased risk for children with medical complexity, most medically-attended RSV LRTIs and hospitalizations occur in otherwise healthy children.

The widespread use of nirsevimab promises to reduce the burden of RSV significantly among young children. For this reason, the FDA recently approved nirsevimab for use in neonates and infants entering their first respiratory season and for children up to 24 months with increased risk for severe RSV-related respiratory disease entering their second respiratory season. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the use of nirsevimab in all infants < 8 months and in infants and children 8–19 months who are at high risk of severe RSV related disease for the 2023–2024 RSV season.

Several studies have examined the efficacy and safety of nirsevimab. The manuscript discussed in this review reports the results of the MELODY Phase III clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03979313). At the time of publication, the investigators had acquired sufficient data to determine the primary endpoint. However, they had only half the planned enrollment for examining secondary outcomes. They continued enrollment and published the updated results. Additionally, the authors report results from the analysis of pooled data from the previous Phase IIb placebo-controlled trial, which examined the safety and efficacy of nirsevimab in healthy preterm infants (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02878330). This practice of pooling data from the Phase IIb and Phase III trials is not typically performed but is advantageous in the process of developing treatments for rare diseases. Although the authors did not explicitly justify using this technique in this common disease, analysis of the pooled data is compelling given the unanticipated effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on enrollment.

### Nirsevimab prophylaxis and respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations among infants [^ee582ce5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the leading cause of hospital admission in infants, contributing to a significant seasonal health care burden. The primary etiologic agent is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has also been associated with long-term respiratory sequelae, including recurrent wheezing and asthma, emphasizing the urgent need for effective preventive strategies.

Preterm infants are particularly susceptible to RSV because of immature immune responses. In addition, household transmission is a major driver of infant RSV, and prior studies consistently demonstrate higher risk with larger household size and the presence of older siblings. To date, no specific antiviral therapy has demonstrated efficacy, and management mainly relies on respiratory support. Historically, palivizumab — a monoclonal antibody targeting RSV — has been used for prophylaxis in high-risk infants. However, its broader application is limited by restrictive eligibility criteria, high cost, and logistic challenges, which have hindered widespread implementation.

In November 2022, the European Commission approved nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV fusion protein. Unlike palivizumab, nirsevimab offers the advantage of single-dose administration and has broader applicability, potentially transforming RSV prevention strategies. Both clinical trials and early data have demonstrated nirsevimab's efficacy in reducing RSV hospitalization risk.,

Italian national guidelines now recommend universal prophylaxis for all infants born during the yearly RSV epidemic period (September 1 to March 31) as well as for children previously eligible for palivizumab. Despite these advances, evidence on the impact of nirsevimab in routine clinical practice remains limited.

A critical question is whether nirsevimab's protective effect is consistent across gestational age groups or whether preterm infants experience attenuated benefits given their inherent susceptibility. Of note, current evidence on this interaction is largely extrapolated from clinical trials, with no studies to our knowledge available to confirm the robustness of the evidence. A prior study by our group, which included only hospitalized infants, found that preterm infants remained at higher risk for severe RSV outcomes despite receiving prophylaxis. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the role of household exposure — particularly the presence of older siblings — in modifying RSV hospitalization risk under prophylaxis remains totally unexplored.

### Nirsevimab prophylaxis and respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations among infants [^aa162223]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter cohort of 13 624 newborns, we found robust evidence that nirsevimab was associated with a significant reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations during the first winter of life. With 79.2% prophylaxis coverage of the study population, nirsevimab was linked to a 68% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization risk — closely mirroring efficacy reported in pivotal clinical trials and prior studies.,

Preterm birth and having older siblings within the household were found to be factors independently associated with RSV hospitalization even among infants who received nirsevimab, indicating that residual risk remains elevated in these high-risk groups. We found no evidence that siblings or prematurity significantly modified the nirsevimab outcome, supporting the interpretation that these risk factors capture intrinsic factors and environmental exposure intensity rather than altering monoclonal antibody pharmacodynamics.

Our findings suggest that nirsevimab prophylaxis is associated with a milder clinical course of RSV LRTI in hospitalized infants, as evidenced by a significant reduction in HFNC requirements. Although there were no associations with length of stay and ICU admission, point estimates favored protection and may have been underpowered due to the small number of treated infants, which produced a wide 95% CI and insufficient power once hospital-level clustering and covariate adjustment were taken into account. Overall, these findings suggest that even breakthrough RSV infections have a milder course in infants who have received nirsevimab prophylaxis, though larger studies are needed to clarify the impact on critical care utilization.

From a clinical perspective, universal nirsevimab prophylaxis was associated with markedly reduced RSV hospitalizations and a lower LRTI burden across the RSV season — a period that previously placed extraordinary strain on health care systems. However, the residual risk observed among preterm infants and those with older siblings suggests that nirsevimab alone may not fully address the heightened susceptibility associated with these factors. Collectively, these findings underscore the need for complementary public health interventions, such as different nirsevimab dosing regimens or maternal vaccination, and strengthened infection-control practices in households with high-risk infants to further alleviate the RSV disease burden.

### Use of nirsevimab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease among infants and young children: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^dff9b4a5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Since October 2021, the Work Group has conducted a systematic literature search and reviewed available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of nirsevimab. The Work Group considered a priori outcomes that were critical or important to policy decisions. § For infants born during or entering their first RSV season, evidence regarding efficacy and safety was derived from multicountry trials that randomized infants, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive nirsevimab or placebo; a phase 2b trial that enrolled 1,453 preterm infants born at 29–34 weeks' gestation (phase 2b trial); and a phase 3 trial that enrolled 3,012 late preterm and term infants born at ≥ 35 weeks' gestation (phase 3 trial). For children at increased risk for severe disease entering their second RSV season, evidence regarding efficacy and safety was obtained from a multicountry trial that randomized children to receive nirsevimab or palivizumab. The Work Group used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to nirsevimab, rated on a scale of very low to high certainty. The Work Group then used the EtR Framework to guide its deliberations on recommendation of nirsevimab, reviewing data on the public health problem, benefits and harms, value to the target population, acceptability to key stakeholders, feasibility, resource use, and equity.

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults: a living systematic review and meta-analysis [^3f7f7917]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of nirsevimab for children beyond 1 year old remains debated. The European Medicines Agency and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration have approved its use in infants up to 24 months of age who have risk factors for severe RSV disease. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention does not currently recommend nirsevimab for infants aged 20 months or older. Evidence of the effectiveness during children's second RSV season is limited. One study in the USA demonstrated effectiveness of 88.0% (95% CI: 48.0% to 97.0%) in preventing medically attended RSV-related acute respiratory infections during the second RSV season. In our review, we found an increased median age at the time of medically attended RSV infection after the implementation of nirsevimab, which may indicate the need to offer immunisation to older infants as well. More real-world evidence is required to assess how immunisation with nirsevimab impacts RSV-associated disease during children's first and second RSV seasons.

In current practice, a nirsevimab dose of 50 mg is administered to children weighing less than 5000 g and a dose of 100 mg is given to children weighing 5000 g or more. The appropriate dosage for infants with a very low body weight (eg, under 1000 g) has not been ascertained, and limited data are available for this population. In a US study, the effectiveness estimates for the 100 mg and 50 mg doses were comparable, with overlapping CIs. In addition, the effectiveness for preterm infants appears to be similar to that of infants born at term. On the other hand, an increased dose of 200 mg is administered to children 8–19 months old with risk factors in their second RSV season. A brief report with 230 children observed a favourable safety profile for the second dose of 200 mg nirsevimab. Future research exploring the dose-effectiveness relationship would be beneficial to provide guidance for optimal use of this product depending on children's clinical characteristics.

### Infants receiving a single dose of nirsevimab to prevent RSV Do not have evidence of enhanced disease in their second RSV season [^28dffc68]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study of children in their second RSV season who received nirsevimab prior to their first RSV season, the incidence of RSV LRTI was low and there was no increase in the severity of disease relative to placebo. Thus, in the predicted conditions of sub-neutralizing concentrations of nirsevimab, there was no indication of ADE in this population. Furthermore, the similar incidence of RSV LRTI among nirsevimab and placebo recipients in their second RSV season suggests that prophylaxis with nirsevimab to protect against RSV disease in the first season does not result in a shift of the burden of disease to the second year of life. This is in keeping with evidence that nirsevimab does not inhibit an immune response to natural RSV infection.

RSV circulates seasonally for approximately 150 days, or 5 months of the year in temperate regions, consequently, the dates of the second season varied depending on whether the child lived in the Northern or Southern hemisphere and when they were enrolled. However, regardless of location, a limitation of these data is that RSV circulation in 2020–2021 was lower than usual due to the wide implementation of nonpharmacologic interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, there is a lower risk for RSV LRTI in the second year of life. Consequently, to capture as many potential cases as possible and to enable the most comprehensive and robust analysis, we have provided data from any test across both seasons and between seasons (152–361 days post-dose), including all-cause data and data from the most sensitive case definitions.

In conclusion, these data do not indicate an increase in the incidence or severity of events of RSV LRTI in the second year of life among infants administered nirsevimab prior to their first RSV season. Although ADE is a theoretical concern of RSV prevention approaches, there was no evidence of such an effect in infants who received nirsevimab.

### Cost-effectiveness of nirsevimab and maternal RSVpreF for preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants across Canada [^0721b933]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, and RSVpreF, a maternal vaccine, are newly approved respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylactics for infants in Canada. Both have the potential to expand prevention efforts, but there is limited evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness and how it varies across the country, despite disparate hospitalisation rates and resource use among different populations.

Methods

We developed a decision tree model to follow twelve monthly birth cohorts through their first year of life, incorporating risk differentiation based on Canadian region, prematurity, and comorbidities. The model tracked medically attended infections, including hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, and outpatient visits, comparing costs (in 2024 Canadian dollars) and effectiveness (in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) of nine different immunisation strategies compared to no intervention. The analysis was conducted from both healthcare and societal perspectives. We conducted threshold price analyses, varying the price-per-dose of each product to determine the threshold prices at which expanded coverage becomes cost-effective.

Results

At base case prices, the optimal strategy varies by region, but in all cases, the optimal strategy is both cost-saving and more effective than no intervention. In southern Canada, it is optimal to immunise only palivizumab-eligible infants (those born very prematurely or with high-risk comorbidities) with nirsevimab, resulting in cost savings of $4.14 and QALY gains of 0.000022 QALY per infant compared to no intervention. In the Northwest Territories, it is best to expand protection with nirsevimab to include all preterm infants (cost savings of $28.68 and QALY gains of 0.00007 per infant). In Nunavik and Nunavut, immunising all infants under 6 months and all infants under twelve months with nirsevimab are the best strategies, respectively (cost savings of $399.61 and QALY gains of 0.000821 per infant in Nunavik, and cost savings of $1067.03 and QALY gains of 0.000884 per infant in Nunavut). Universal, country-wide immunisation with nirsevimab would require a price-per-dose of under $112 to become the most cost-effective prevention strategy.

Conclusions

The optimal strategy for preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in Canadian infants depends on product price and regional risk level and resource use. Canadian policy should account for these factors.

### Estimating the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab versus standard of practice for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and infants in Spain: a cost-utility modelling study [^48177ff9]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Prophylactic interventions

Two prophylactic interventions were compared. The first intervention corresponded to the prior SoP before nirsevimab introduction, which consisted of monthly administrations of palivizumab for eligible infants during the RSV season (for a maximum of five doses) and no prophylaxis for preterm and term infants. In eligible infants born outside of the RSV season (OoS), monthly palivizumab administration begins at the start of the season in October; for those born within the RSV season (WiS), monthly administration begins at birth. The last dose of palivizumab was considered to be administered in February. The second intervention consisted of universal immunisation with a single dose of nirsevimab administered at the beginning of the RSV season for infants born OoS and at birth for those born WiS. While a previous study estimated the impact of universal immunisation of all infants with nirsevimab in Spanish neonates and infants during their first RSV season only, given the latest recommendationsand updated nirsevimab indications published by the European Medicines Agency, the current analysis considered two RSV seasons for eligible infants. Immunisation in a subsequent RSV season is recommended for a subset of high-risk infants only; these infants received either monthly administrations of palivizumab during the season (for a maximum of five doses) or an administration of two doses of nirsevimab at the start of the subsequent season.

The efficacy of both preventive interventions was captured by the reduction of MA RSV-confirmed LRTI risk. The sources consulted for those efficacy-related inputs in the model represented the highest evidence level publicly available, and searching for equivalent definitions of the cases of RSV infection. Regarding healthy preterm and term infants, while randomised clinical trials proved that nirsevimab conferred at least 5-month protection from RSV, additional studies found that nirsevimab induced anti-RSV antibody levels remained higher compared with placebo after 1 year. Nonetheless, in the base-case setting, the duration of protection associated with nirsevimab was considered constant up to 5 months to present a conservative analysis. For palivizumab-eligible infants, given that palivizumab has been administered in newborns for almost 20 years, epidemiological data on RSV infection were considered to contain the efficacy of this intervention indirectly. Non-inferiority of nirsevimab compared with palivizumab was applied based on the available evidence; thus, the risk of medical events with nirsevimab remained equal to the risk of those infants at high risk receiving palivizumab.

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults: a living systematic review and meta-analysis [^6a8c0948]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

We defined the effectiveness of nirsevimab and RSV vaccines as the relative reduction in the odds or risk of medical attendance due to RSV infection or LRTI, including bronchiolitis, following prophylaxis. Effectiveness (%) and corresponding 95% CIs using the effect estimates (OR, risk ratio (RR), HR and incidence rate ratio (IRR)) as reported by the studies: effectiveness (%) = 100 × (1−adjusted effect ratio). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted: (1) stratified by different effect estimates (eg, OR, RR, HR or IRR); (2) by pooling unadjusted estimates into overall analysis. Some studies reported statistical estimates without explicitly providing the relative reduction in outcomes; in such cases, we calculated effectiveness based on the reported estimates. For multiple reports from the same study, only the most recent data were included in the meta-analysis.

A separate analysis was conducted for interrupted time series studies, as their comparisons were based on the odds or risk of outcomes at different time points. Different epidemic seasons were analysed in relation to the total number of patients with RSV-related LRTI who used healthcare services. The effectiveness was expressed as a reduction (%) in RSV-related healthcare visits.

We performed a subgroup meta-analysis for each outcome (primary care visits, emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions), as well as by country, risk of bias and length of follow-up (≤ 5 months versus > 5 months, as 5 months was the mean follow-up). The I² statistic was used to measure the proportion of total variability attributable to between-study heterogeneity, and the τ² statistic was used to estimate the absolute between-study variance. Random-effects model was used to pool all estimates, with inverse-variance weighting incorporating an estimate of between-study variance. The impact of publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and funnel plots for meta-analyses containing at least 10 studies.

For safety outcomes, we conducted a narrative analysis, as most data were reported narratively. Meta-analyses were performed using the 'meta' package in R (V.4.2.3).

### Estimated effectiveness of nirsevimab against respiratory syncytial virus [^7ba039b9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this test-negative case-control study, nirsevimab was highly effective at preventing RSV-associated outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and severe diseases requiring ICU admission or high-flow oxygen. Its estimated effectiveness persisted for at least 3 months postvaccination, consistent with results from randomized trials. These findings reinforce the benefits of RSV immunoprophylaxis and support US guidelines recommending nirsevimab for all infants entering their first RSV season.

### Early estimate of nirsevimab effectiveness for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization among infants entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season-new vaccine surveillance network, October 2023-February 2024 [^3d5d0291]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants, responsible for 50,000–80,000 hospitalizations annually in children aged < 5 years. The highest hospitalization rates occur during the first months of life, and risk declines with increasing age in infancy and during early childhood. In August 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for all infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season, and for children aged 8–19 months at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season. In a pooled analysis of data from prelicensure randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, 1 dose of nirsevimab given at age < 8 months was 79% efficacious against medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection and 81% efficacious against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with hospitalization through 150 days after injection. In September 2023, a maternal RSV vaccine also became available to prevent RSV disease in young infants. ACIP recommends either nirsevimab or maternal RSV vaccination to protect infants born during or entering their first RSV season. In October 2023, in response to nirsevimab shortages, CDC recommended that health care settings with limited supply of nirsevimab prioritize nirsevimab for infants aged < 6 months and infants with underlying conditions at highest risk for severe disease. In January 2024, additional doses of nirsevimab became available, and CDC recommended that health care settings with adequate nirsevimab supply return to the original ACIP recommendations for nirsevimab use. This analysis provides the first U.S. estimate for post-introduction nirsevimab effectiveness among U.S. infants during their first RSV season.

### Effectiveness and impact of universal prophylaxis with nirsevimab in infants against hospitalisation for respiratory syncytial virus in galicia, Spain: initial results of a population-based longitudinal study [^f3ca7173]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Galicia (Spain) was one of the first regions worldwide to incorporate nirsevimab for universal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in infants into its immunisation programme. The NIRSE-GAL longitudinal population-based study aimed to assess nirsevimab effectiveness in preventing hospitalisations (ie, admittance to hospital).

Methods

The 2023–24 immunisation campaign with nirsevimab in Galicia began on Sept 25, 2023, and concluded on March 31, 2024. The campaign targeted three groups: infants born during the campaign (seasonal group), infants younger than 6 months at the start of the campaign (catch-up group), and infants aged 6–24 months with high-risk factors at the start of the campaign (high-risk group). Infants in the seasonal group were offered immunisation on the first day of life before discharge from hospital. Infants in the catch-up and high-risk groups received electronic appointments to attend a public hospital or health-care centre for nirsevimab administration. For this interim analysis, we used data collected from Sept 25 to Dec 31, 2023, from children born up to Dec 15, 2023. Data were retrieved from public health registries. Nirsevimab effectiveness in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) hospitalisations; severe RSV-related LRTI requiring intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or oxygen support; all-cause LRTI hospitalisations; and all-cause hospitalisations was estimated using adjusted Poisson regression models. Data from five past RSV seasons (2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, and 2022–23), excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period, were used to estimate the number of RSV-related LRTI hospitalisations averted along with its IQR. The number needed to immunise to avoid one case in the 2023–24 season was then estimated from the averted cases. Nirsevimab safety was routinely monitored. The NIRSE-GAL study protocol was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06180993), and follow-up of participants is ongoing.

Findings

9408 (91·7%) of 10259 eligible infants in the seasonal and catch-up groups received nirsevimab, including 6220 (89·9%) of 6919 in the catch-up group and 3188 (95·4%) of 3340 in the seasonal group. 360 in the high-risk group were offered nirsevimab, 348 (97%) of whom received it. Only infants in the seasonal and catch-up groups were included in analyses to estimate nirsevimab effectiveness and impact because there were too few events in the high-risk group. In the catch-up and seasonal groups combined, 30 (0·3%) of 9408 infants who received nirsevimab and 16 (1·9%) of 851 who did not receive nirsevimab were hospitalised for RSV-related LRTI, corresponding to an effectiveness of 82·0% (95% CI 65·6–90·2). Effectiveness was 86·9% (69·1–94·2) against severe RSV-related LRTI requiring oxygen support, 69·2% (55·9–78·0) against all-cause LRTI hospitalisations, and 66·2% (56·0–73·7) against all-cause hospitalisations. Nirsevimab effectiveness against other endpoints of severe RSV-related LRTI could not be estimated because of too few events. RSV-related LRTI hospitalisations were reduced by 89·8% (IQR 87·5–90·3), and the number needed to immunise to avoid one RSV-related LRTI hospitalisation was 25 (IQR 24–32). No severe adverse events related to nirsevimab were registered.

Interpretation

Nirsevimab substantially reduced infant hospitalisations for RSV-associated LRTI, severe RSV-associated LRTI requiring oxygen, and all-cause LRTI when given in real-world conditions. These findings offer policy makers and health authorities robust, real-world, population-based evidence to guide the development of strategies for RSV prevention.

### 180-day efficacy of nirsevimab against hospitalisation for respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections in infants (HARMONIE): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^47896f53]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalisations in infants worldwide. The primary analyses of HARMONIE showed that nirsevimab reduced infant hospitalisations due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through the RSV season. This analysis aims to evaluate nirsevimab's efficacy at 180 days after dosing, a period exceeding the typical 5-month RSV season.

Methods

HARMONIE is an ongoing, open-label, parallel arm, randomised, controlled, phase 3b study conducted in France, Germany, and the UK. Infants aged 12 months or younger, born at a gestational age of at least 29 weeks, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single intramuscular dose of nirsevimab (50 mg for children < 5 kg or 100 mg for children ≥ 5 kg) or standard care (without RSV prophylaxis) before or during their first RSV season. Randomisation was electronically done, stratified by country and age-group. The primary efficacy endpoint for this analysis was the incidence of hospitalisations due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection up to 180 days after nirsevimab administration or randomisation in all randomised participants. Safety up to 365 days following nirsevimab administration was also assessed. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05437510.

Findings

Between Aug 8, 2022, and Feb 28, 2023, 8057 infants were randomly assigned to either the nirsevimab group (n = 4038) or the standard care group (n = 4019). The median age at randomisation was 4·00 months (IQR 1·0–7·0; range 0·0–12·0, and 4195 (52·1%) were male and 3862 (47·9%) were female. Up to 180 days, 12 (0·3%) of 4038 infants in the nirsevimab group and 68 (1·7%) of 4019 infants in the standard care group had been hospitalised for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, corresponding to a nirsevimab efficacy of 82·7% (95% CI 67·8–91·5; p < 0·0001). Most participants experienced grade 1 (2759 [68·7%] of 4016 in the nirsevimab group; 2696 [67·1%] of 4018 in the standard care group) or grade 2 (1447 [36·0%] of 4016 in the nirsevimab group; 1436 [35·7%] of 4018 in the standard care group) treatment-emergent adverse events, and no apparent safety concerns were raised up to 365 days after dosing.

Interpretation

Nirsevimab offers consistent and sustained protection against hospitalisation due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection for at least 6 months. This finding provides global health systems greater flexibility when implementing nirsevimab, providing substantial benefit in the ongoing effort to reduce the burden of infant RSV and the potential wider public health value.

### Monoclonal antibody for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants and children: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0d43f01e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection in children younger than 5 years; effective prevention strategies are urgently needed.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of RSV infection in infants and children.

Data Sources

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from database inception to March 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that enrolled infants at high risk of RSV infection to receive a monoclonal antibody or placebo were included. Keywords and extensive vocabulary related to monoclonal antibodies, RSV, and randomized clinical trials were searched.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was used. Teams of 2 reviewers independently performed literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Developments, and Evaluation approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A random-effects model network meta-analysis was conducted using a consistency model under the frequentist framework.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were all-cause mortality, RSV-related hospitalization, RSV-related infection, drug-related adverse events, intensive care unit admission, supplemental oxygen use, and mechanical ventilation use.

Results

Fifteen randomized clinical trials involving 18 395 participants were eligible; 14 were synthesized, with 18 042 total participants (median age at study entry, 3.99 months [IQR, 3.25–6.58 months]; median proportion of males, 52.37% [IQR, 50.49%-53.85%]). Compared with placebo, with moderate- to high-certainty evidence, nirsevimab, palivizumab, and motavizumab were associated with significantly reduced RSV-related infections per 1000 participants (nirsevimab: -123 [95% CI, -138 to -100]; palivizumab: -108 [95% CI, -127 to -82]; motavizumab: -136 [95% CI, -146 to -125]) and RSV-related hospitalizations per 1000 participants (nirsevimab: -54 [95% CI, -64 to -38; palivizumab: -39 [95% CI, -48 to -28]; motavizumab: -48 [95% CI, -58 to -33]). With moderate-certainty evidence, both motavizumab and palivizumab were associated with significant reductions in intensive care unit admissions per 1000 participants (-8 [95% CI, -9 to -4] and -5 [95% CI, -7 to 0], respectively) and supplemental oxygen use per 1000 participants (-59 [95% CI, -63 to -54] and -55 [95% CI, -61 to -41], respectively), and nirsevimab was associated with significantly reduced supplemental oxygen use per 1000 participants (-59 [95% CI, -65 to -40]). No significant differences were found in all-cause mortality and drug-related adverse events. Suptavumab did not show any significant benefits for the outcomes of interest.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, motavizumab, nirsevimab, and palivizumab were associated with substantial benefits in the prevention of RSV infection, without a significant increase in adverse events compared with placebo. However, more research is needed to confirm the present conclusions, especially for safety and cost-effectiveness.

### Estimating the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab versus standard of practice for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and infants in Spain: a cost-utility modelling study [^85756bb5]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Until recently, palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against RSV F glycoprotein, was the only approved prophylactic intervention for RSV to be considered as the standard of practice (SoP) for eligible infants in Spain. However, its use is restricted to the high-risk population — infants with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD) or chronic lung disease (CLD), and those born prematurely (< 29 weeks gestational age (GA)).

Nirsevimab, a single-dose long-acting monoclonal antibody, is an intervention approved in the European Union for the prevention of RSV-lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants during their first RSV season, and children up to 24 months who are vulnerable to RSV severe disease through their second RSV season. The approval was based on the results of nirsevimab's clinical programme, including the phase III MELODY, phase II/III MEDLEY, phase IIb trials and additional studies of nirsevimab in the second RSV season, which showed a reduction of 79.0% (95% CI: 68.5% to 86.1%) in medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (MA-LRTI) in a pooled cohort of preterm and term infants, along with an acceptable safety profile. The National Immunisation Technology Advisory Group of the Ministry of Health in Spain issued a temporary recommendation for both RSV seasons 2023–2024and 2024–2025, advising the use of nirsevimab in all infants under the age of 1 year, prioritising those at high risk of developing serious disease from RSV infection (including preterm infants < 35 weeks GA and those with CLD, CHD or other conditions with a high risk of developing serious RSV bronchiolitis). High-risk infants are recommended to receive nirsevimab before each RSV season until they reach 2 years of age. This recommendation makes Spain one of the first countries in the world to announce a universal immunisation programme with nirsevimab for all infants, which also achieved remarkable coverage rates during the last immunisation campaign of almost 90%. A recent study modelling the potential public health and economic impact of nirsevimab for all infants in their first RSV season vs the prior Standard of Practice (SoP) predicted that implementing universal immunisation with nirsevimab of all infants would prevent close to 70% of MA-LRTI cases and save €46 million in healthcare costs (excluding the cost of prophylaxis).

Nirsevimab Efficacy and Safety

Among infants aged < 8 months who were born during or entering their first RSV season, efficacy was evaluated through 150 days after injection. For the GRADE assessment, results from the phase 3 and phase 2b trials were pooled. Only infants who received the recommended dose of nirsevimab were included in pooled estimates. †† Pooled efficacy in preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTI §§ was 79.0% (95% CI = 68.5%–86.1%; 31 of 2,579 in nirsevimab arm and 80 of 1,293 in placebo arm), efficacy in preventing RSV-associated LRTI with hospitalization was 80.6% (95% CI = 62.3%–90.1%; 12 of 2,579 in nirsevimab arm and 33 of 1,293 in placebo arm), and efficacy in preventing RSV-associated LRTI with ICU admission was 90.0% (95% CI = 16.4%–98.8%; one of 2,579 in nirsevimab arm and six of 1,293 in placebo arm). No deaths attributable to RSV were reported in either trial. The incidence of serious adverse events * was not increased in the nirsevimab arm compared with that in the placebo arm. ††† The overall evidence certainty using GRADE criteria was rated as moderate. The GRADE evidence profile and supporting evidence for the EtR Framework are available atand.

### Lower respiratory tract infections following respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody nirsevimab immunization versus placebo: analysis from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial (MELODY) [^09e11849]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are significant sources of global pediatric morbidity and mortality. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of LRTI, with annual RSV epidemics resulting in high levels of healthcare resource utilization among infants and children aged ≤ 24 months. The risk of severe RSV LRTI is highest during the first year of life, with the majority of hospitalizations occurring in otherwise healthy infants born at term.

Nirsevimab is an extended half-life (approximately 71 days) anti-RSV fusion protein monoclonal antibody designed to confer protection against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease for the duration of a typical 5-month (150-day) RSV season with a single intramuscular injection. Nirsevimab binds to a conserved antigenic site Ø ("zero") neutralization epitope exclusive to the prefusion conformation of the RSV fusion protein to inhibit host cell entry. Nirsevimab demonstrated consistently high efficacy against medically attended (MA) RSV LRTI through 150 days post-dose during 2 pivotal placebo-controlled studies. Efficacy rates were 70.1% in healthy preterm infants (gestational age [GA], ≥ 29 to < 35 weeks) during a phase 2b study (NCT02878330) and 76.4% in healthy term and late preterm (GA, ≥ 35 weeks) infants in an analysis of the full phase 3 MELODY study (NCT03979313) enrollment cohort. A similarly high efficacy against RSV LRTI hospitalization of 83.2% was observed in these populations during the phase 3b HARMONIE study (NCT05437510; open-label trial of nirsevimab versus standard care). Nirsevimab has been approved for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season and in children aged ≤ 24 months who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season in various geographic regions.

RSV is often present as a coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. Nirsevimab has demonstrated a consistent benefit against MA-LRTI of any cause in placebo-controlled studies during the first RSV season (through 150 days post-dose) and in real-world settings. Questions remain over the contribution of other respiratory pathogens to pediatric LRTIs, especially considering the effects of nirsevimab in reducing RSV-associated lower respiratory disease. In this exploratory post hoc analysis of the MELODY study, we examined the incidence of RSV and non-RSV LRTIs among study participants to explore the effect of RSV prevention on non-RSV LRTI incidence.

Table 3
Base-case model estimates on RSV-related health events, costs and QALYs loss

Based on these estimations, the EJP for nirsevimab in the all-infants immunisation strategy considering the payer perspective was estimated at €222, € 321 and €356 at a WTP threshold of €0, €22 000 and €30 000 per QALY gained, respectively. The analysis, including the societal perspective, found that the EJP of nirsevimab would increase to €281, €380 and €415 for those WTP thresholds (table 4).

Table 4
Base-case results: EJP for nirsevimab

The acquisition and administration of palivizumab produced a cost of €17 184 839 for the whole population of infants at high risk (€3740.41 per high-risk infant), for which the prophylactic intervention is recommended. This estimate was based on the proportion of high-risk newborns, the distribution of births by month (as those infants born during the RSV season receive less than five doses of palivizumab), and the proportion of high-risk infants eligible for palivizumab during the second RSV season. Since the administration of this intervention is not recommended in infants born between 29 and 35 weeks or after, no costs were derived from the acquisition of palivizumab in those populations. In the palivizumab-eligible population, total direct costs were estimated at €20 548.263 (€4472.49 per high-risk infant). When considering indirect costs, the model estimated €21 927.017 for the high-risk cohort, which represented €4772.59 per infant.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to nirsevimab prophylaxis, CDC 2023 guidelines recommend to offer one dose of nirsevimab (200 mg, administered as two 100 mg injections given at the same time at different injection sites) in infants and children aged 8–19 months at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization among U.S. infants. In July 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for passive immunization to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection among infants and young children. Since October 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Maternal and Pediatric RSV Work Group has reviewed evidence on the safety and efficacy of nirsevimab among infants and young children. On August 3, 2023, ACIP recommended nirsevimab for all infants aged < 8 months who are born during or entering their first RSV season and for infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and are entering their second RSV season. On the basis of pre-COVID-19 pandemic patterns, nirsevimab could be administered in most of the continental United States from October through the end of March. Nirsevimab can prevent severe RSV disease among infants and young children at increased risk for severe RSV disease.

### Early estimate of nirsevimab effectiveness for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization among infants entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season-new vaccine surveillance network, October 2023-February 2024 [^f5956df0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants in the United States. In August 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for infants aged < 8 months to protect against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection during their first RSV season and for children aged 8–19 months at increased risk for severe RSV disease. In phase 3 clinical trials, nirsevimab efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with hospitalization was 81% (95% CI = 62%-90%) through 150 days after receipt; post-introduction effectiveness has not been assessed in the United States. In this analysis, the New Vaccine Surveillance Network evaluated nirsevimab effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization among infants in their first RSV season during October 1, 2023-February 29, 2024. Among 699 infants hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, 59 (8%) received nirsevimab ≥ 7 days before symptom onset. Nirsevimab effectiveness was 90% (95% CI = 75%-96%) against RSV-associated hospitalization with a median time from receipt to symptom onset of 45 days (IQR = 19–76 days). The number of infants who received nirsevimab was too low to stratify by duration from receipt; however, nirsevimab effectiveness is expected to decrease with increasing time after receipt because of antibody decay. Although nirsevimab uptake and the interval from receipt of nirsevimab were limited in this analysis, this early estimate supports the current nirsevimab recommendation for the prevention of severe RSV disease in infants. Infants should be protected by maternal RSV vaccination or infant receipt of nirsevimab.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that provides advice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, normally meets 3 times per year to develop US vaccine recommendations. The ACIP met June 21–23, 2023, to discuss respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, influenza vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, and COVID-19 vaccines. The ACIP also held a special meeting on August 3, 2023, to discuss RSV prophylaxis in infants. This update summarizes the proceedings of these meetings that are most relevant to the pediatric population. Major updates for pediatric clinicians include a new recommendation for the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab for prevention of RSV disease in all infants, recommendations regarding use of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and discussion of potential forthcoming changes to meningococcal and COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

Cost Effectiveness

The cost effectiveness for use of nirsevimab for infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season (at $445 per dose) was estimated to be $102,811 per quality adjusted life year. Because infants and children entering their second RSV season are at reduced risk for severe RSV disease compared with infants during their first RSV season, cost effectiveness for use of nirsevimab for the general population of children entering their second season (at $890 per dose) was estimated to be $1,557,544 per quality adjusted life year. Data to assess the incidence of severe RSV disease and death by type of chronic disease during their second RSV season are limited, as are data on efficacy and safety of nirsevimab among infants and children in their second RSV season.

RSV Among Infants and Young Children

RSV infection is the leading cause of hospitalization among U.S. infants; most children are infected during the first year of life, and nearly all have been infected by age 2 years. Infants with RSV infection frequently develop bronchiolitis, an LRTI that can be severe and result in hospitalization. Approximately 50,000–80,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations and 100–300 RSV-associated deaths occur annually among U.S. infants and children aged < 5 years.

The rate of RSV-associated hospitalization among infants born at ≤ 30 weeks' gestation (premature) is three times that of term infants. Premature infants also have higher rates of RSV-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Although prematurity is a recognized risk factor for RSV-associated hospitalization, RSV is also the leading cause of hospitalization among healthy term infants. An estimated 79% of infants and children aged < 2 years hospitalized with RSV have no underlying medical conditions.

Before licensure of nirsevimab, the only FDA-approved product to prevent severe RSV disease among infants and young children was palivizumab, another monoclonal antibody. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends palivizumab only for children with certain underlying medical conditions (comprising < 5% of all infants), and its use is further limited by high cost and the requirement for monthly dosing.

Study conclusion

The authors concluded that nirsevimab has good efficacy in preventing medically-attended LRTIs due to RSV in healthy late preterm and term infants. A post hoc analysis of the data from the northern hemisphere suggested that the number needed to treat to prevent one medically-attended LRTI was 11 (95% CI 9–16), and the number needed to treat to prevent one hospitalization was 57 (95% CI 31–500). Additionally, the authors concluded that nirsevimab has a good safety profile.

### Does nirsevimab prevent lower respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus? [^80b59cbb]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

The efficacy of nirsevimab in preventing hospitalization due to RSV-associated LRTI was 62.1% (95% CI −8.6–86.8, p = 0.07). A pre-specified pooled analysis combined the intention-to-treat data from this trial with data from a previous trial studying the efficacy of 50 mg of nirsevimab in infants born at 29 + 0 to 35 + 6 weeks gestation and showed an efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3–89.7%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed lower efficacy in younger (≤ 3 months) and smaller (weight < 5 kg) infants.

Pharmacokinetics data demonstrated a linear decrease in serum nirsevimab concentrations over time. Antidrug antibody was detected in 58 of the 951 infants (6.1%) who received nirsevimab and 5 of the 473 (1.1%) who received placebo. The nirsevimab pharmacokinetics of patients who developed antidrug antibodies did not differ from those who did not through day 151 after injection.

Frequencies of reported adverse events were similar between the intervention and placebo groups, and most were of low severity. Serious adverse events occurred in 6.8% in the nirsevimab group and 7.3% in the placebo group. Three infants in the nirsevimab group died between days 140 and 361 after injection; no infants in the placebo group died. The investigators reviewed the deaths and did not believe that they were related to the study intervention. Overall, 1.0% of infants in the nirsevimab group and 1.4% in the placebo group experienced adverse events that were considered related to the trial regimen. None of these were considered serious adverse events.

### Lower respiratory tract infections following respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody nirsevimab immunization versus placebo: analysis from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial (MELODY) [^667ed0b3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Nirsevimab prophylaxis led to a lower incidence of RSV infections over time versus placebo without viral replacement, that is, no increased incidence of other viral infections, consistent with efficacy observed against all-cause MA-LRTI (70.1%–76.4%). The difference in cumulative MA-LRTI incidence primarily emerged during days 1–151. This difference between nirsevimab and placebo was maintained through day 511, with a slight numerical increase in the difference (the minimal difference driven primarily by cumulative incidence to day 151), coupled with a lower incident event rate of RSV infection with nirsevimab versus placebo to both day 151 and day 511. Data from South African participants in MELODY suggest nirsevimab efficacy beyond a typical 5-month RSV season. Furthermore, a recent analysis of MELODY participants followed through their second RSV season showed that the incidence of RSV-associated MA-LRTI in the first (through day 151) and second (days 362–511) seasons was 1.7% and 1.8% with nirsevimab versus 7.5% and 2.1% with placebo. Importantly, there was no increase in the incidence or severity of disease in the second season among infants who received nirsevimab in their first season relative to those who received placebo, suggesting no shift in the burden of disease and no evidence for antibody-dependent enhanced disease with nirsevimab.

### Use of nirsevimab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease among infants and young children: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^dd6bcd31]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization among U.S. infants. In July 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for passive immunization to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection among infants and young children. Since October 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Maternal and Pediatric RSV Work Group has reviewed evidence on the safety and efficacy of nirsevimab among infants and young children. On August 3, 2023, ACIP recommended nirsevimab for all infants aged < 8 months who are born during or entering their first RSV season and for infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and are entering their second RSV season. On the basis of pre–COVID-19 pandemic patterns, nirsevimab could be administered in most of the continental United States from October through the end of March. Nirsevimab can prevent severe RSV disease among infants and young children at increased risk for severe RSV disease.

Key Points

Question

What is the cost-effectiveness of no intervention, maternal vaccination, and nirsevimab administration during the overall respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season and for each monthly birth cohort?

Findings

In this economic evaluation of an estimated monthly birth cohort of 299 277 infants, maternal vaccination was cost-effective compared with no intervention ($19 562 per quality-adjusted life-year), but these results were driven by infants born earlier in the season. Compared with maternal vaccination, nirsevimab was cost-effective only in October and November, at $67 178 and $88 531 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively.

Meaning

The seasonal nature of RSV and the waning immunogenicity of these interventions suggest that earlier administration could optimize clinical and economic outcomes.

RSV immunization products for infants — first-line options and second-season indication: Nirsevimab and clesrovimab are considered the first-line recommended immunization products for administration to infants to protect against medically attended respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease and are long-acting monoclonal antibody products administered as a single dose during an infant's first RSV season; the AAP recommends any licensed RSV immunization product appropriate for age and health status and does not prefer one product over another. Only children 8 through 19 months who meet high-risk criteria should receive RSV immunization in their second RSV season, and Nirsevimab is approved for this indication; clesrovimab is not.

### Effectiveness of a targeted infant RSV immunization strategy (2024–2025): a multicenter matched case-control study in a high-surveillance setting [^4e8f0ab3]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), was recently introduced to prevent infant RSV-related hospitalizations. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical trials, real-world data on targeted immunization strategies remain limited. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nirsevimab in preventing RSV-associated hospitalizations in infants under 12 months, within a seasonal program prioritizing infants born from April onwards.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, matched case-control study across seven Italian hospitals during the 2024–2025 RSV season. Infants hospitalized with PCR-confirmed RSV bronchiolitis were matched 1:2 by age and date of admission to controls hospitalized for non-respiratory causes. Data were collected via electronic medical records. Immunization effectiveness (IE) was estimated using conditional logistic regression adjusted for sex assigned at birth, gestational age, birth weight, and clinical risk factors. Two pre-specified stratified analyses and a sensitivity analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed.

Results

A total of 138 infants were included (46 cases, 92 controls). Adjusted IE was 89.5% (95% CI: 60.3–97.2%). Stratified analyses yielded similar results among infants born after April 1 (IE: 88.4%, 95% CI: 56.5–96.9%) and those without risk factors (IE: 88.1%, 95% CI: 45.7–97.4%). IPTW analysis confirmed protection (IE: 79.6%, 95% CI: 53.5–91.0%).

Conclusions

This study provides real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness of nirsevimab in a targeted seasonal immunization framework. These findings may inform phased implementation strategies and RSV prophylaxis policies in varied healthcare settings.

### Risk factors for severe disease among children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus [^b53ad79e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

For more than 2 decades, palivizumab has been the primary intervention for RSV prophylaxis; however, its high cost and monthly injection requirement limited its use to infants at high risk. Nirsevimab was introduced as the first long-acting monoclonal antibody among a group of several other candidates; it offers extended protection throughout the RSV season and is now the first immunization product for universal RSV prophylaxis among infants. Internationally, health agencies such as the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, European Medicines Agency, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and Spanish National Immunization Technical Advisory Groupall have broad recommendations for universal use of nirsevimab for infants and children up to 2 years old at high risk. Recent literature from Spain shows that implementation of nirsevimab for all infants younger than 6 months and those aged 6 to 24 months with high-risk conditions was associated with an 82% reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations. Similarly, in Luxembourg, nirsevimab resulted in a 69% reduction in RSV-related lower respiratory tract infections for infants younger than 6 months.

In this study, we describe sociodemographic characteristics and outcomes of children admitted to 2 large, Canadian, pediatric tertiary care hospitals with RSV-associated ARI from July 2022 to June 2023. Our primary goal was to identify risk factors for severe disease among hospitalized children with RSV-associated ARI, focusing on traditionally affected younger children as well as older children, whose incidence of RSV-associated ARI has increased in the post–COVID-19 era and has not yet been extensively studied. By understanding these potential changes in epidemiologic characteristics and risk factors, we aim to inform evidence-based strategies for preventing severe RSV disease.

### Estimating the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab versus standard of practice for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and infants in Spain: a cost-utility modelling study [^5649ccd8]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

As both prophylaxes are available in Spain, coverage rates were updated based on real-world evidence as reported by region in Spain. Coverages of nirsevimab were set at 90% for term infants, given that immunisation rates over 90% were already achieved across the Spanish regions during the 2023–2024 RSV season. For preterm and high-risk infants, the coverage rates associated with nirsevimab were established at 100%. Based on the same rationale, the coverage rates associated with palivizumab were set at 100%.

Health events: probabilities, costs and quality-of-life loss

The probability of health events including inpatient hospitalisations, PICU, MV, ER, PC, specialist visitsand RSV-related inpatient mortality, were applied based on infants' age (online supplemental table 5) and was all conditional to RSV infection. The basis for the selection of the respective sources was exhaustively described in the previous study conducted with this model, which was discussed again with the experts and revalidated in the face-to-face meeting. The rate of complications during the subsequent year after hospital discharge was derived from a national study conducted in Spain.

The probabilities of health events during the second RSV season for infants aged over 11 months were considered. In high-risk infants (palivizumab-eligible population), these risks were 0.4% for inpatient hospitalisation,17.1% for PICU (conditional to hospitalisation),2.7% for MV (conditional to hospitalisation),1.2% for ER visits,3.4% for PC visitsand 0.1% for specialist visits(data for preterm and term infants is summarised in online supplemental table 5). All these probabilities were conditional to RSV infection, determined by the infection rate per month (online supplemental table 4). Moreover, among the palivizumab-eligible infants, it was estimated that only 28.2% (1,315 high-risk infants) would be eligible for prophylaxis during the second season according to the Spanish recommendations.

Introduction

In July 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nirsevimab (Beyfortus, Sanofi and AstraZeneca), a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)–associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) among infants and children aged < 24 months. * Nirsevimab is administered as a 1-dose intramuscular injection shortly before or during the RSV season (typically fall through spring). † Since October 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Maternal and Pediatric RSV Work Group (Work Group) has reviewed data on RSV among infants and young children and evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of nirsevimab, and assessed the quality of the efficacy and safety evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. The Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework was used to develop recommendations. Evidence regarding potential use of nirsevimab was presented to ACIP at meetings during June 2022–August 2023. On August 3, 2023, ACIP recommended nirsevimab for infants aged < 8 months who are born during or entering their first RSV season and for infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and are entering their second RSV season.

### Cost-effectiveness of nirsevimab and maternal RSVpreF for preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants across Canada [^ca0412fe]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects virtually all children before the age of two. Most infections are mild and self-limiting, but some progress to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia and require hospitalisation. Globally, RSV is the primary cause of LRTIs in children under five, with the majority of hospitalisations occurring in infants under 1 year.

Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has been the only available defense against RSV disease in infants for the last twenty years. It must be given monthly, requiring five doses to extend protection through a full RSV season. Its price and frequency of administration mean it can cost up to $10,000 to protect a single infant against RSV for one season in Canada. Consequently, palivizumab is only given to high-risk infants, i.e. young, premature infants and infants with comorbidities such as congenital heart disease (CHD) and chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD). This leaves the majority of infants unprotected. Many prophylactic candidates for RSV are in development to fill this gap.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada have recently approved two prophylactics for preventing RSV disease in infants. Nirsevimab is a long-acting monoclonal antibody similar to palivizumab, with the distinct improvement that a single dose offers protection for an entire RSV season. The RSVpreF vaccine can be given to pregnant women in their third trimester, conferring immunity through transplacental antibody transfer.

While pricing and coverage decisions are pending in Canada, in the USA both nirsevimab and RSVpreF are considerably cheaper per dose than even a single dose of palivizumab. The lower price and comparative ease of single-dose administration for these products offer the potential to expand prevention efforts beyond the highest-risk infants. Both the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canada have recommended broad protection, but the cost-effectiveness of this expansion is still unclear. Nirsevimab has a higher efficacy than RSVpreF, but RSVpreF is cheaper under current US prices. RSVpreF requires 2 weeks for maternal antibody transfer; infants born before this time may not be fully protected and this could necessitate backup coverage with nirsevimab after birth. Questions remain as to which infants (if not all) should receive prophylaxis, and which prophylactic should be administered.

### RSV immunization for infants and young children… [^31098f20]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Because infant RSV antibodies do not activate the immune system, protection is likely most effective in the weeks after they are given and wanes over time. RSV antibodies do not provide long-term immunity to RSV disease but instead provide protection to infants in the 5 months after administration, when they are most at risk of getting severe RSV disease. As children get older, they are less likely to get severe symptoms from RSV infection. There are two infant RSV antibody products available: clesrovimab and nirsevimab. Either product is recommended for use in infants younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. There is no preferential recommendation for use of these products in this age group. For children ages 8 through 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season, only nirsevimab is recommended.

Storage and Handling of Infant RSV Antibody Proper storage and handling of infant RSV antibody products is essential to ensure they are effective in preventing severe RSV disease. Nirsevimab and clesrovimab are both supplied as pre-filled syringes. Pre-filled nirsevimab or clesrovimab syringes should be stored refrigerated between 36°F to 46°F. They should be stored in the original carton to protect from light until time of use. Do not freeze, shake, or expose to heat. Administering Infant RSV Antibody Route Administer infant RSV antibody intramuscularly. The preferred site of administration is the anterolateral thigh region for both clesrovimab and nirsevimab. Do not administer infant RSV antibody intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.

Dosage For nirsevimab:

- Age less than 8 months
- 50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg, administered as single dose
- 100 mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg, administered as single dose
- Age 8 through 19 months
- 200 mg, administered as two 100 mg injections. There is limited experience with administering infant RSV antibody with vaccine products. However, infant RSV antibody is not expected to interfere with the immune response to vaccine products. In clinical trials, when RSV antibody was given concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the co-administered regimen was similar to the childhood vaccines given alone.

### Expected impact of universal immunization with nirsevimab against RSV-related outcomes and costs among all US infants in their first RSV season: a static model [^2f42dd7c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the main cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in infants; approximately 90% of children younger than 2 years of age become infected, accounting for up to 40% of pediatric cases of pneumonia and 72% of cases of acute bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization. In the United States, RSV is a leading cause of infant hospitalization, with an overall RSV-related hospitalization rate in infants of 0.8%–2.6%, and mortality rate of 9 per 10 000 admissions. RSV is a seasonal virus, with the initiation and duration of circulation largely dependent on geographical location.

While preterm infants, especially those with chronic health conditions, have a greater risk for medically attended RSV-associated LRTIs (RSV-MALRTI) and the highest morbidity and mortality rates among infants, 72% of infants hospitalized with RSV are healthy term infants without underlying health conditions. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), is currently the only available option in the United States to prevent RSV and is only recommended for a small subset of infants < 2 years of age with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP), and infants born prematurely at < 29 weeks' gestational age (wGA). Palivizumab requires monthly administrations throughout the RSV season, resulting in both logistical and financial barriers for uptake. There is currently no approved or recommended prophylaxis option for healthy term and preterm infants born at ≥ 29 wGA, reflecting a need for broad measures that can protect infants across all gestational ages and risk factors.

Nirsevimab is a long-acting mAb being investigated for the prevention of RSV-MALRTI in infants. In term and preterm infants, nirsevimab demonstrated an overall efficacy of 79.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.9%–87.7%) in the prevention of RSV-MALRTI in prespecified, pooled analyses of the pivotal phase 2b (NCT02878330) and phase 3 MELODY (NCT03979313) studies. Previous modelling studies have evaluated the impact of prophylactic measures on the RSV disease burden; however, none have explicitly compared nirsevimab against the current standard of care (SoC) using the clinical trial efficacy results. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the health and cost outcomes associated with the use of nirsevimab against SoC in the prevention of RSV-MALRTIs in all infants in their first RSV season in the United States.

Objective

Review available data from clinical trials of nirsevimab for efficacy and safety in the setting of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in infants and children, while exploring nirsevimab's role in clinical practice and highlighting continuing questions.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed was conducted utilizing the phrases "nirsevimab" and "medi8897". Additional references were identified through found references. Organizational guidelines, medication labeling, and regulatory organization presentations were utilized.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant clinical trials investigating nirsevimab in infants and children were included as well as other references on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacoeconomics.

Data Synthesis

Nirsevimab, a once-a-season monoclonal antibody, demonstrated a 79.5% (95% CI, 65.9–87.7; P < 0.00001) lower incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (MA RSV-associated LRTI) and 77.3% (95% CI, 50.3–89.7; P = 0.0002) reduction in hospitalizations for RSV-associated MA-LRTI across 2 placebo-controlled studies. Nirsevimab demonstrated comparable safety to placebo with minor dermatologic reactions being the most common adverse event (0.9% vs 0.6%).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison With Existing Agents

Nirsevimab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and American Academy of Pediatrics for broad administration to infants entering their first RSV season and at risk patients during their second RSV season. Questions remain over efficacy in infants born < 29-week gestation and other economical considerations.

Conclusions

Nirsevimab demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing RSV-associated MA-LRTI and RSV-associated hospitalizations in infants and was well tolerated.

### Nirsevimab for prevention of hospitalizations due to RSV in infants [^0c19aadc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The safety of the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab and the effect of nirsevimab on hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection when administered in healthy infants are unclear.

Methods

In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, infants who were 12 months of age or younger, had been born at a gestational age of at least 29 weeks, and were entering their first RSV season in France, Germany, or the United Kingdom to receive either a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or standard care (no intervention) before or during the RSV season. The primary end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, defined as hospital admission and an RSV-positive test result. A key secondary end point was very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, defined as hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% and the need for supplemental oxygen.

Results

A total of 8058 infants were randomly assigned to receive nirsevimab (4037 infants) or standard care (4021 infants). Eleven infants (0.3%) in the nirsevimab group and 60 (1.5%) in the standard-care group were hospitalized for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, which corresponded to a nirsevimab efficacy of 83.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67.8 to 92.0; P < 0.001). Very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 5 infants (0.1%) in the nirsevimab group and in 19 (0.5%) in the standard-care group, which represented a nirsevimab efficacy of 75.7% (95% CI, 32.8 to 92.9; P = 0.004). The efficacy of nirsevimab against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 89.6% (adjusted 95% CI, 58.8 to 98.7; multiplicity-adjusted P < 0.001) in France, 74.2% (adjusted 95% CI, 27.9 to 92.5; multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.006) in Germany, and 83.4% (adjusted 95% CI, 34.3 to 97.6; multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.003) in the United Kingdom. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 86 infants (2.1%) in the nirsevimab group.

Conclusions

Nirsevimab protected infants against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection and against very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in conditions that approximated real-world settings.

### Nirsevimab administration and RSV hospitalization in the 2024–2025 season [^cb60bd57]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization for respiratory infections in infants. Hospitalization risk factors include younger age, prematurity, medical complexity, and lower socioeconomic status. Since 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended nirsevimab to prevent RSV for all infants younger than 8 months entering their first RSV season and high-risk infants aged 8 to 19 months between October and March, excluding those born to vaccinated mothers. Available nirsevimab data are from the 2023 to 2024 RSV season with limited drug supply. We conducted a cohort study of the 2024 to 2025 RSV season, hypothesizing that nirsevimab would be associated with reduced RSV-associated hospitalization.

Abstract

To characterize nirsevimab in the prevention of RSV, children from the Phase 3 MELODY trial were followed through their second RSV season.

### Cost-effectiveness of nirsevimab and maternal RSVpreF for preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants across Canada [^f3038570]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of strategies for preventing RSV disease in infants across Canada, with differentiation between southern Canada and three regions of northern Canada. Replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab — a more effective, less costly option — will be cost-saving nationwide, but the cost-effectiveness of expanding coverage beyond high risk palivizumab-eligible infants depends on product prices and regional variation in hospitalisation rates and resource use. Universal nirsevimab immunisation is the most cost-effective strategy in Nunavut as long as nirsevimab is under $753 per dose, while in southern Canada, nirsevimab would need to be under $112 per dose for universal administration to be cost-effective. For the Northwest Territories and Nunavik, the price per dose would have to be under $183 and $428, respectively.

With RSVpreF, expanded coverage beyond palivizumab-eligible infants is necessitated by its administration to pregnant mothers; we cannot determine which infants will be high risk entirely in advance. In every region, RSVpreF-only strategies were out-ranked by nirsevimab or nirsevimab-RSVpreF combination strategies.

Our model identified a different optimal strategy for every region. This highlights the importance of incorporating regional risk differentiation into cost-effectiveness estimates for RSV prophylactics in Canada. Palivizumab guidelines form a precedent for integrating regional risk into policy; they include specifications for infants living in remote northern communities. Our study is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of nirsevimab and RSVpreF to include detailed differentiation of Canadian northern regions and can help inform policy for these new prophylactics.

### Estimated effectiveness of nirsevimab against respiratory syncytial virus [^178624b0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, the prioritization of high-risk infants for immunization during the early roll-out phase may have introduced confounding by indication. However, we conducted several sensitivity analyses that suggest residual confounding by unmeasured factors is less likely. Second, although our study benefited from a large sample size, the low uptake of nirsevimab resulted in limited statistical power and wide confidence intervals for certain comparisons, such as effectiveness by dosage. Third, because few cases were immunized more than 14 weeks before RSV testing, the effectiveness estimates beyond this period have wide credible intervals and should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, our secondary analyses were exploratory and not adjusted for multiple comparisons; future studies with prespecified hypotheses are needed to confirm these findings. Fourth, incomplete documentation within the EHR may have led to underestimation of certain risk factors. Fifth, underascertainment of immunization or prior infections may have biased our results toward the null. However, the uptake of nirsevimab in our study is very similar to that reported by other US-based studies and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coverage estimates for Connecticut (7.7% uptake). Sixth, while all infants hospitalized with acute respiratory infection were tested for RSV as part of the YNHHS infection prevention protocols, outpatient RSV testing criteria were not as standardized. Consequently, testing decisions may have been influenced by the patients' prior immunization status. To evaluate any potential residual confounding due to differences in testing practices, we employed a negative control exposure approach using a sham vaccine, as previously described. The absence of an association between the sham vaccine and RSV infection supports the validity of our findings and suggests that residual confounding likely had minimal impact on our estimates of effectiveness.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^26e3e14c]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Future research and emerging long-acting monoclonal antibodies for RSV prophylaxis highlight nirsevimab and MK-1654, alongside vaccine development. Continued research examining RSV hospitalization rates in all groups of children thought to be at increased risk is needed, and the effect of immunoprophylaxis on medically attended outpatient visits should also be evaluated. Nirsevimab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody targeting a unique antigenic site on the prefusion RSV F protein; it is a much more potent inhibitor than palivizumab in vitro and has a substantially longer half-life, allowing for a single intramuscular dose for the entire RSV season. An initial study in premature infants from 29 to < 35 weeks' gestation demonstrated a 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3–81.2) lower incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections, and the product is currently in Phase 3 trials for potential use in all infants for prevention of RSV disease in their first season. MK-1654 is an extended half-life monoclonal antibody directed against an antigenic site (site IV) and is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials intended to be used in both term and preterm infants. Development of safe and effective RSV vaccines remains a high priority.

### Effectiveness of nirsevimab in preventing RSV-hospitalisation among young children in Western Australia 2024 [^c7ed439c]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes a significant burden of illness for children under 2 years of age. Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, was registered for RSV prevention in Australia in 2023. In April 2024, Western Australia (WA) launched the country's first state-wide nirsevimab program for all infants and high-risk children entering their second RSV season. This study describes the effectiveness of nirsevimab against RSV hospitalisation over a single epidemic season.

Methods

Between April and October 2024, children hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated acute respiratory infection (ARI) and test-negative controls were enrolled from three hospitals in WA. Demographic variables, medical risk factors, symptoms and outcomes were assessed. Nirsevimab effectiveness in preventing RSV-associated hospitalisation was estimated.

Results

Over 7 months, 284 children eligible for nirsevimab were enrolled including 184 RSV positive cases and 100 controls. Coverage of nirsevimab in RSV cases was 22.8% and 60.0% in controls. The overall adjusted effectiveness of nirsevimab against RSV-associated ARI hospitalisation was 88.2% (95% CI: 73.5, 94.7). RSV infection occurred in 42 (22.8%) children who had received nirsevimab; there was no significant difference in RSV illness severity among those immunised and unimmunised.

Conclusion

Nirsevimab was highly effective at preventing RSV-associated ARI hospitalisation in young children in the southern hemisphere.

Summary

This study is the first Australian study to provide nirsevimab effectiveness estimate against RSV hospitalisation over a single epidemic season. The adjusted estimate of nirsevimab effectiveness against RSV-associated ARI hospitalisation was 88.2%, similar to those reported from Northern Hemisphere countries.

RSV Immunization is administered much like vaccines. It should be administered through Intramuscular injection only and can be administered concomitantly with vaccines. In addition to mother's vaccination status, eligibility is determined by age at the time of administration. Infants born during the RSV season should receive RSV immunization within 1 week of birth. This can be given either in the hospital before discharge or at the doctor's office after discharge. Those with a prolonged hospital stay should get it shortly before or promptly after discharge. Safety data for use of RSV antibody in infants with a postmenstrual age of < 32 weeks or who weigh < 3. 5 lb are limited. Providers may consider administering RSV immunization to eligible hospitalized infants during their hospitalization, based on clinical judgment, considering the potential risks and benefits, as well as local RSV activity.

### Real-world uptake of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine, and RSV vaccines for older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e5fa8f16]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, two novel products for the prevention of severe RSV-associated disease have become available for infants: passive immunisation with the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab and maternal vaccination during pregnancy. Nirsevimab is a humanised IgG1k class monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life, remaining effective for up to six months after a single administration. It targets the RSV fusion (F) protein, binding its pre-fusion form and preventing the virus from entering the host cells. In clinical trials, nirsevimab has demonstrated high efficacy of 74%–83% in reducing RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and reducing the need for supplemental oxygen by 76% in infants under 12 months old.

The other product that has been approved for use is the maternal RSV F protein vaccine, which is recommended to pregnant individuals between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation (national vaccination recommendations vary) to induce transplacental transfer of anti-RSV antibodies. A randomised controlled trial found that the RSV maternal vaccine prevented approximately 82% of RSV-associated severe LRTI in infants up to three months old. However, the effectiveness of these products needs to be investigated in post-licensure studies to confirm the effects in real-world conditions and among individuals with diverse clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.

### Monoclonal antibody for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants and children: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0a1af52a]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory disease in children worldwide and is also the primary cause of hospitalization for viral respiratory infections and a major cause of overall mortality in infants and children, especially premature infants. With an estimated 2.1 million children younger than 5 years requiring inpatient or outpatient treatment for RSV infection each year, the overall mortality burden of RSV disease worldwide is 1 in 28 deaths among infants aged 28 days to 6 months. As most RSV deaths occur in the community and may be missed in hospital surveillance, the actual situation may be worse. Therefore, effective RSV prevention strategies are urgently needed to address this major public health issue and burden.

Respiratory syncytial virus passive immunization programs targeting protection during the first 6 months of life could substantially reduce RSV disease burden. The World Health Organization published documents in 2021 that already encouraged the development of preventive interventions for RSV. Palivizumab is currently the most widely used prophylaxis for preventing RSV disease in infants. Two meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) suggested that palivizumab could significantly reduce RSV-related hospitalizations by 51 to 55 per 1000 participants (baseline risk: 98–101 per 1000 participants) compared with placebo. Although the efficacy of palivizumab has been proved, it is not available in some countries, such as China. Meanwhile, the high price of palivizumab imposes a substantial economic burden on low- and middle-income families. Therefore, new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed, such as nirsevimab, which could protect infants from RSV-related infection and hospitalization during an entire RSV season with a single dose. Nirsevimab was assessed in 2 large, multicenter RCTs conducted in the northern and southern hemispheres, with strong practicability. In addition to palivizumab and nirsevimab, other mAbs were also under consideration, such as motavizumab, which could significantly shorten the length of RSV hospitalization. However, the relative efficacy and safety of different mAbs have not been compared comprehensively. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs to assess the benefits and harms of different mAbs for the prevention of RSV infection among infants and children.

### Efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and maternal vaccination for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus disease [^bef229f8]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. It can cause severe illness, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and can lead to hospitalization, particularly in premature infants and individuals with underlying medical conditions. RSV can also cause recurrent infection over the course of a person's life, leading to long-term respiratory morbidity. Cautionary measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have disrupted the typical seasonality of other respiratory viruses. RSV seasons, for example, are emerging at unexpected times and with increased intensity. This highlights an urgent need to protect vulnerable infants by developing highly effective RSV prophylactic agents.

The level of serum neutralizing antibodies (SNAs) is often used as a measure of protection against RSV infection. Newborns with high concentrations of SNAs are less likely to have symptoms or complications from RSV infection than infants with lower concentrations. A model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) demonstrated that SNAs represent an important correlate of protection for prevention of RSV disease across different populations, including the infant population.

Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has proven to be beneficial in providing protection against RSV. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, potent molecules that can target and neutralize RSV. Evidence from several clinical trials showed that mAbs protect against RSV disease in infants. In a randomized controlled trial, prophylactic administration of palivizumab, a humanized mAb, reduced the incidence of RSV hospitalization by 55% in preterm infants. The recombinant mAb nirsevimab showed > 75% efficacy against RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory tract infection (MALRI) in late-preterm and full-term infants. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial in high-risk infants showed that using motavizumab, another humanized mAb, as prophylaxis was 26% more effective than palivizumab in reducing the RSV hospitalization rate. Extended–half-life mAbs could offer more predictable and potentially long-lasting protection –.

### Estimating the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab versus standard of practice for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and infants in Spain: a cost-utility modelling study [^3ac7ac23]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes great morbidity and mortality among newborns. Nirsevimab represents a prophylactic alternative used in Spain for a universal prophylaxis strategy of all infants. The aim of this study was to estimate the economically justifiable price (EJP) of nirsevimab in Spain, being the price to consider nirsevimab efficient compared with the standard of practice (administration of palivizumab in eligible infants and no intervention in all other).

Methods

An economic model based on a decision tree was developed to conduct a cost–utility analysis. The RSV epidemiology, RSV-related health events, clinical variables, resources consumption, costs and utilities were derived from the scientific literature and agreed by a multidisciplinary advisory board. The analyses included the universal immunisation of all infants with nirsevimab, considering both payer and societal perspectives. The EJPs were estimated considering the following willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds: €0/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), €22 000/QALY and €30 000/QALY. Alternative scenarios (including immunisation strategy targeted at high-risk infants), deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also conducted.

Results

The prophylaxis with nirsevimab in all infants averted 215 878 RSV events, 9 deaths, avoided 1307 QALYs lost and reduced €48.4 and €17.3 million in direct and indirect costs. For a payer perspective, at those WTP thresholds, the EJPs resulted in €222.27, €320.52 and €356.25, raising to €281.47, €379.72 and €415.45 for a societal perspective. The robustness of the model and its results was confirmed by alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

Nirsevimab reduces RSV-related health events, leading to cost savings and avoided QALY loss associated with RSV infection in infants compared to the previous standard of practice. This study provides a range of cost-effective prices that would lead nirsevimab to be an efficient intervention, or even dominant (achieves better outcomes and produces cost savings), compared with the standard of-practice for RSV prevention, being key for decision-making in public health.

### Nirsevimab for prevention of hospitalizations due to RSV in infants [^81207d1e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study HARMONIE was published by Simon B Drysdale and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Respiratory syncytial virus infection. In the HARMONIE study, the trial question was: what is the role of nirsevimab for prevention of hospitalizations due to RSV infection in infants? In the HARMONIE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the HARMONIE study, the population was: 8058 patients (3863 female, 4195 male). The inclusion criteria were healthy infants ≤ 12 months of age, had been born at a gestational age ≥ 29 weeks, who were entering their first RSV season. The key exclusion criteria were congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; active confirmed RSV infection at the time of randomization; active lower respiratory tract infection at the time of randomization; known systemic hypersensitivity to any study intervention components. In the HARMONIE study, the interventions were: n = 4037 nirsevimab (a single intramuscular injection at a dose of 50–100 mg) n = 4021 standard care (no intervention). In the HARMONIE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (0.3% vs. 1.5%; ARD -1.2, 95% CI -1.91 to -0.49). In the HARMONIE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (0.1% vs. 0.5%; ARD -0.4, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.13) Borderline significant decrease in hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection from any cause (1.1% vs. 2.4%; ARD -1.3, 95% CI -2.6 to 0). In the HARMONIE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in grade 3 adverse events. In the HARMONIE study, the conclusion was: in healthy infants ≤ 12 months of age, had been born at a gestational age ≥ 29 weeks, who were entering their first RSV season, nirsevimab was superior to standard care with respect to hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection.

### Evolving strategies for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): a review article of preventive agents and vaccines for RSV [^1636d839]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to describe the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and recommendations for the use of newly approved preventive agents and vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and discuss their uptake during the 2023 to 2024 RSV season.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed was performed (January 2020 to February 2024) with the search terms RSV vaccine, preventive antibody, and RSV prevention. Utilization data were collected from TriNetX using the US Collaborative Network (May 2024) using the terms palivizumab, nirsevimab, and RSV prefusion F protein.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant English-language studies assessing the use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved preventive agents and vaccines for RSV in humans were considered. Population-level utilization data were extracted from TriNetX.

Data Synthesis

Nirsevimab was observed to have noninferior efficacy and safety compared with palivizumab with less frequent administration. Nirsevimab is recommended to replace palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis in all eligible infants. Arexvy and Abrysvo are effective at reducing the risk of RSV infection in adults aged ≥ 60 years, and Arexvy is indicated in adults aged ≥ 50 years. These vaccines are equally recommended for use in the elderly adult population, but only Abrysvo is indicated and recommended for maternal administration. Most infants only require prophylaxis through either maternal RSV vaccination or nirsevimab administrationRelevance to patient care and clinical practice:This review compares the indications for use, guideline recommendations, and clinical trial efficacy and safety data for palivizumab, nirsevimab, Abrysvo, and Arexvy to guide clinical decision-making.

Conclusions

Novel RSV preventive agents, including Abrysvo, Arexvy, and nirsevimab, offer less burdensome dosing and administration compared with palivizumab, show promising efficacy and safety data, and expand the populations eligible for RSV prevention. Updated clinical guidance supports immediate adoption of these agents in practice, and population-level data suggest these agents were used during the 2023 to 2024 RSV season.

### Nirsevimab prophylaxis and respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations among infants [^8c94110a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This multicenter cohort of 13 624 newborns found that nirsevimab prophylaxis was associated with reduction of RSV-related hospitalizations and milder disease course. However, prematurity and household exposure remained significant independent risk factors, highlighting the necessity for additional, targeted prevention measures in these susceptible groups. Collectively, our results strongly endorse the integration of nirsevimab into routine immunization schedules and emphasize the need for continued surveillance to maximize its benefits on infant health outcomes.

### Multicentre study on nirsevimab: Bayesian analysis reveals persisting risk for preterm infants [^dbe0252b]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

This study confirms the strong protective effect of nirsevimab against RSV-related disease severity and provides novel insights into the timing of protection. For the first time, we demonstrate that gestational age significantly influences the timing of RSV-related hospitalisation despite prophylaxis, with preterm infants remaining at higher risk of infection. These findings suggest that additional or modified prophylactic strategies may be necessary to optimise protection in high-risk populations.

MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, only a small proportion of hospitalized infants with ARI received nirsevimab, likely in part because of delayed availability in this first season of introduction and intermittent supply shortages, and infants who received nirsevimab were more likely to have underlying conditions. §§§ Thus, results might not be fully generalizable to all infants eligible for receipt of nirsevimab in their first RSV season. Second, the low number of case-patients who received nirsevimab did not allow for stratified estimates by time since receipt of nirsevimab. Third, because nirsevimab became available at most sites in the United States after seasonal RSV circulation began, some infants in this analysis might have had RSV infection before receipt of nirsevimab, which might have affected estimated effectiveness. Fourth, nirsevimab effectiveness was not estimated by dosage (50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg or 100 mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg) because nirsevimab dosage was not ascertained. Finally, the effectiveness estimate in this report is limited to the prevention of RSV-associated hospitalization. RSV among infants also causes a considerable increase in outpatient and emergency department visits; additional studies are warranted to assess nirsevimab effectiveness against these outcomes.

Implications for Public Health Practice

Receipt of a single dose of nirsevimab was highly effective against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants entering their first RSV season. This finding supports current CDC recommendations that all infants should be protected by maternal RSV vaccination or infant receipt of nirsevimab, to reduce the risk for RSV-associated hospitalization in their first RSV season.

### Maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^9232da4b]. ACOG (2023). High credibility.

RSV prevention: monoclonal antibody nirsevimab — CDC recommendations and benefit in infants and some young children are outlined. On August 3, 2023, the CDC recommended the use of nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody product, for the prevention of RSV in infants and some young children. The CDC recommends one dose of nirsevimab for all infants younger than 8 months, born during — or entering — their first RSV season. For some children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease, such as children who are severely immunocompromised, a dose of nirsevimab is recommended in their second season. Nirsevimab has been shown to reduce the risk of both hospitalizations and health care visits for RSV in infants by about 80%.

### Single-dose nirsevimab for prevention of RSV in preterm infants [^a6c90269]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, and a need exists for prevention of RSV in healthy infants. Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life that is being developed to protect infants for an entire RSV season with a single intramuscular dose.

Methods

In this trial conducted in both northern and southern hemispheres, we evaluated nirsevimab for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in healthy infants who had been born preterm (29 weeks 0 days to 34 weeks 6 days of gestation). We randomly assigned the infants in a 2:1 ratio to receive nirsevimab, at a dose of 50 mg in a single intramuscular injection, or placebo at the start of an RSV season. The primary end point was medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after administration of the dose. The secondary efficacy end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after administration of the dose.

Results

From November 2016 through November 2017, a total of 1453 infants were randomly assigned to receive nirsevimab (969 infants) or placebo (484 infants) at the start of the RSV season. The incidence of medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 70.1% lower (95% confidence interval [CI] 52.3 to 81.2) with nirsevimab prophylaxis than with placebo (2.6% [25 infants] vs. 9.5% [46 infants]; P < 0.001) and the incidence of hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 78.4% lower (95% CI, 51.9 to 90.3) with nirsevimab than with placebo (0.8% [8 infants] vs. 4.1% [20 infants]; P < 0.001). These differences were consistent throughout the 150-day period after the dose was administered and across geographic locations and RSV subtypes. Adverse events were similar in the two trial groups, with no notable hypersensitivity reactions.

Conclusions

A single injection of nirsevimab resulted in fewer medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations than placebo throughout the RSV season in healthy preterm infants. (Funded by AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02878330.).

### Multicentre study on nirsevimab: Bayesian analysis reveals persisting risk for preterm infants [^6e8a87cb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchiolitis is a viral lower respiratory tract infection that primarily affects infants under 12 months of age. The leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which remains the most frequent cause of hospital admission in this age group, contributing to a significant seasonal healthcare burden. Additionally, RSV infection is associated with long-term respiratory sequelae, including recurrent wheezing and asthma, reinforcing the urgent need for effective preventive strategies. Currently, no specific antiviral therapies have been proven effective, and management remains supportive, primarily focusing on respiratory support.

Given the substantial morbidity and absence of curative treatments, research has increasingly prioritised prevention as the most effective approach to mitigating RSV impact. Before September 2024, palivizumab was the only available option, but its short half-life and high cost limited its use to high-risk infants. In November 2022, the European Commission approved nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV fusion protein, a critical component for viral infectivity.

Clinical trials have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety profiles for nirsevimab. The MELODY trialreported that nirsevimab reduced RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections by nearly 75% over 150 days postadministration, along with a notable reduction in hospitalisations and severe RSV cases. The HARMONIE trialfurther reinforced these findings, reporting even higher efficacy rates. Real-world data from France, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg also confirmed that incorporating nirsevimab into national immunisation programmes resulted in marked reductions in RSV-related hospitalisations and intensive care admissions.

In Italy, nirsevimab was introduced following a 17 October 2024 deliberation, with Val d'Aosta piloting its implementation during the 2023–2024 season. Nirsevimab prophylaxis is administered to all infants born during the epidemic period, defined as between 1 September 2024 and 1 March 2025, as well as to children under 24 months of age with chronic conditions previously qualifying for palivizumab prophylaxis.

### RSV hospital admissions during the first 2 seasons among children with chronic medical conditions [^451759f9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among young children. For the past 3 decades, the only available preventive intervention was palivizumab, a short-lived monoclonal antibody administered monthly during the RSV season to a restricted group of children at high risk. In 2023, two new products were approved for RSV prevention in young children: RSVpreF, a vaccine administered during pregnancy, and nirsevimab, a single-dose long-acting monoclonal antibody administered to the child. Recognizing the high disease burden caused by RSV, National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) in North America and Europe recommended universal RSV immunization for infants entering their first RSV season instead of the restricted use of palivizumab only for children at high risk. They have also recommended nirsevimab for children who remain at increased risk during a second RSV season and those who are at high risk in their first season, regardless of maternal RSV vaccination. Other NITAGs recommended nirsevimab only for children at high risk for up to 2 RSV seasons, including those who traditionally received palivizumab. However, all these recommendations remain imprecise due to a lack of data on high-risk groups outside of children eligible for palivizumab or beyond a child's first RSV season.

Approximately 1% to 2% of children require hospitalization due to RSV in the first year of life. The highest rates occur within 3 months after birth for healthy, full-term infants. Medical fragility and reduced exposure to RSV after prolonged hospitalizations early in life may defer the risk from RSV infection beyond a first season among children with chronic medical conditions (CMCs). This persistent risk has been studied in specific groups of children, including those born preterm or born with chronic lung disease or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. However, we lack data for many other groups of children with CMCs.

In most countries, RSV antibody prophylaxis is administered on a seasonal basis. However, to our knowledge, no studies have broadly examined RSV disease rates in children with CMCs at the population level by season of exposure rather than age. This knowledge gap complicates the utility of data for refining public health recommendations in clinical settings. This highlights the need for studies that pragmatically quantify RSV outcomes among children with CMCs based on their eligibility at the start of the RSV season. This study aimed to identify groups of children with CMCs who were at higher risk of RSV hospitalization during their first and second RSV seasons.

### Infants receiving a single dose of nirsevimab to prevent RSV Do not have evidence of enhanced disease in their second RSV season [^b3d9972f]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) among infants worldwide, and a leading cause of hospital admission in the first year of life. Three approaches to the prevention of RSV have been pursued: passive immunization of infants through the direct administration of antibodies; maternal vaccination during pregnancy with transplacental transfer; or active immunization of infants. However, binding of non-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies binding to viral antigens at sub-neutralizing concentrations without adequately blocking or clearing infection has the potential to lead to the promotion of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE of infection) or enhanced disease severity (ADE of disease). In the 1960s, enhanced disease severity was observed following administration of a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine. Infants who were seronegative to RSV before vaccination experienced RSV LRTI more frequently and with more severe disease upon subsequent natural RSV infection, with 80% of vaccine recipients requiring hospitalization (vs 5% of the control group) and 2 fatalities among vaccinated infants. While the risk is greatest following active immunization, theoretically, any of these approaches to RSV prevention could result in ADE. To date, ADE has not been observed with the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, initially approved in 1998 for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract RSV disease in infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease. Nirsevimab, an extended half-life recombinant human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody, binds the RSV prefusion (pre-F) protein at the highly conserved antigen site Ø, locking it in the pre-F conformation to block viral entry into host cells. The extended half-life was engineered by substituting 3 amino acids (M252Y/S254T/T256E; YTE) within the Fc region of nirsevimab to give a > 3-fold longer serum half-life than a typical monoclonal antibody of 11–30 days to approximately 70 days in healthy late preterm and term infants. Nonclinical studies evaluating the potential for ADE in a cotton rat model of RSV using nirsevimab without YTE found no evidence of ADE at any dose evaluated, including doses below the amount needed to protect animals against RSV challenge. In the full-enrollment cohort of the Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MELODY trial (n = 3012; NCT03979313), nirsevimab demonstrated an efficacy of 76.4% (95% confidence interval 62.3–85.2) against medically attended (MA) RSV LRTI over 151 days, with a favorable safety profile to Day 361. Children from the MELODY full-enrollment cohort have now been followed through their second RSV season (remaining blinded) to evaluate the theoretical risk of ADE and whether prophylaxis with nirsevimab results in a shift of the burden of disease to the second year of life.

### Respiratory syncytial virus immunization coverage among infants through receipt of nirsevimab monoclonal antibody or maternal vaccination-United States, October 2023-March 2024… [^2bdb0ec0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

View suggested citation Summary What is already known about this topic. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of hospitalization among U. S. infants. In 2023, a long-acting monoclonal antibody for infants and a maternal vaccine were recommended to prevent RSV among infants. In the same year, data from state- and jurisdiction-level immunization information systems became available at CDC. What is added by this report. Cross-sectional analysis of data from IISs representing 33 states and the District of Columbia found that 29% of infants born during October 2023–March 2024 were immunized against RSV through receipt of nirsevimab or through maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy in the 2023–24 respiratory virus season, the first season that these products were available. State-specific immunization coverage from nirsevimab or maternal vaccination ranged from 11% to 53%.

Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the United States. A new RSV monoclonal antibody for infants and an RSV vaccine for pregnant women were recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in August and September 2023, respectively, to protect infants against RSV infection. Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of hospitalization among U. S. infants. On August 3, 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended use of nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for all infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. An analysis of data from an internet panel survey conducted by CDC during March 26–April 11, 2024, estimated that approximately double the percentage of U. S.

infants received protection against RSV through maternal RSV vaccination and nirsevimab during the 2023–24 season as the percentage estimated in this report. Finally, this report only included immunizations administered during the ACIP-recommended months for most geographic areas; some doses might have been administered outside those months. Preliminary data from the 2024–25 respiratory virus season suggest RSV immunization coverage among infants aged < 8 months through maternal vaccination or nirsevimab increased to 57% nationally.

### Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease by immunisation [^96448278]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal antibody: nirsevimab (Beyfortus, Sanofi/AstraZeneca)

Nirsevimab is a new long-acting monoclonal antibody providing passive immunity against RSV disease. It inhibits the membrane fusion required for viral entry, by targeting the pre-F protein, thus neutralising the virus. It has an extended half life (65–70 days), giving protection for at least 5 months based on both clinical and pharmacokinetic data. Nirsevimab was licensed in the UK in November 2022 to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants during their first RSV season. It is safe and effective in reducing medically attended RSV LRTI and RSV hospitalisation in both term-born and preterm infants. Nirsevimab's efficacy against hospitalisation for RSV-associated LRTI was 83.2% (95% CI 67.8% to 92.0%), and 75.7% (95% CI 32.8% to 92%) in very severe RSV-associated LRTI. Nirsevimab is suitable for high-risk children born preterm and/or with serious heart or lung disease. In Galicia, Spain, a universal nirsevimab immunisation programme was introduced to all infants born between September 2023 and March 2024. Early data have shown excellent uptake of nirsevimab with 91.7% coverage, and RSV-related LRTI hospitalisations were reduced by 89.8% (IQR 87.5–90.3) for infants given nirsevimab. The number needed to immunise to avoid one RSV-related LRTI hospitalisation was 25 (IQR 24–32).

### RSV immunization frequently asked questions… [^f752f8e8]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

How effective is RSV immunization and how long does the RSV protection conferred by nirsevimab and clesrovimab last. Protection from RSV immunization is expected to last at least 5 months, about the length of an RSV season, and is expected to reduce the risk of severe RSV disease by about 80%. Data from the 2024–2025 RSV season showed that nirsevimab was effective against RSV-associated emergency department encounters and hospitalization among infants in their first RSV season. Specifically, data from the VISION Multi-Site Network of Electronic Health Records of 160 emergency departments and 131 hospitals showed nirsevimab was 63% effective at preventing RSV-associated ED encounters and 79% effective at preventing RSV-associated hospitalization. Healthcare providers may choose to give nirsevimab or clesrovimab before the start of RSV season if they feel that the child may not return for a visit when RSV immunization would be recommended.

For example, a clinician may choose to give RSV immunization to an infant who presented for care in September who has not yet received a dose of RSV immunization and may be unlikely to return for a visit in October or November. Nirsevimab and clesrovimab have been shown to protect against severe RSV disease for at least 5 months, and the ideal timing of administration may differ depending on the clinical situation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends RSV immunization with nirsevimab only for:

- infants and children 8 through 19 months of age at high risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season, regardless of the RSV vaccination status of the pregnant parent or the child's prior receipt of nirsevimab or clesrovimab when < 8 months of age. High-risk criteria include the following:

What is the guidance for high risk infants who are 19–24 months of age, particularly given nirsevimab has been FDA approved for infants and toddlers 24 months of age and younger who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. A dose of nirsevimab is recommended for some children aged 8 through 19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV and who are entering their second RSV season. Nirsevimab provides at least 5 months of protection and should be offered to eligible children when entering the RSV season.

### Inequalities in health impact of alternative reimbursement pathways for nirsevimab in the United States [^bea4c768]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal virus typically circulating during cooler months in temperate countries, with notable geographic variation. In the United States, it is a common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age, leading to a high burden in hospitalizations. Two-thirds of those hospitalized infants do not have underlying conditions or risk factors. However, palivizumab, the current standard of care for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by RSV, is recommended only in preterm infants born at 29 weeks or less of gestational age, and those with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease of prematurity and congenital heart disease. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody with a 28-day duration of protection administered in 5 intramuscular doses across the RSV season, has been approved since 1999. Currently, this immune prophylaxis is accessed through a reimbursement pathway used for pharmaceuticals. Access and households' costs vary with individual insurance coverage. Insurers may restrict access to administration with the RSV season, establish strict eligibility criteria, and require authorization prior to use. Some commercial insurers could further deny coverage based on the infant's benefit plan.

There have been recent advances in the development of both vaccines and immune prophylaxis products for RSV prevention. Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life, is being developed to protect infants from RSV with a single intramuscular dose. It has been shown to reduce medically attended RSV-associated LRTIs and hospitalizations compared with placebo in preterm, healthy late preterm, and term infants during their first RSV season. If this product were licensed, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) might then provide use recommendations. A broad recommendation for use among infants in all groups independent of risk, whether they are born in or out of season, could be considered by ACIP given nirsevimab's safety, efficacy, and administration profile. A reimbursement pathway akin to a traditional vaccine pathway, such as coverage through the Vaccine For Children program, could minimize inequalities in access and health outcomes. In this study, we aimed to assess the distribution of health benefits across insurance groups when accessing nirsevimab through alternative reimbursement pathways.

### RSV immunization guidance for infants and young children… [^4ae5ea3a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview Nirsevimab and clesrovimab are monoclonal antibodies that prevent severe RSV disease and are recommended for infants. Nirsevimab is also recommended for some young children. Monoclonal antibodies are not vaccines. They do not activate the immune system. Rather, the antibodies themselves protect against disease. Healthcare providers should discuss both the RSV maternal vaccine and infant RSV antibodies with parents and consider patient preferences when deciding which product is best for their patient's family. Recommendation for some young children Nirsevimab is recommended for some children who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season. The following children ages 8–19 months are recommended to get nirsevimab shortly before or as early as possible during their second RSV season:

Flexibilities in the ACIP recommendations on the timing of infant RSV antibody administration should be considered to optimize patient access, including reimbursement of nirsevimab or clesrovimab.
- Infants with substantial increased risk for severe RSV disease Dosage Nirsevimab
- Age less than 8 months
- 50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg
- 100 mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg
- **Age 8 months through 19 months**:
- 200 mg, administered as two 100-mg injections Clesrovimab
- 105 mg for all eligible infants. Effectiveness Nirsevimab Early real-world data show that nirsevimab was at least 70% effective in preventing babies from being hospitalized with RSV. In clinical studies among infants who were born during or entering their first RSV season, efficacy was evaluated through 150 days after injection.

Pooled efficacy from Phase II and III clinical trials in preventing medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 79. 0% and efficacy in preventing RSV-associated LRTI with hospitalization was
80. 6%. Clesrovimab In clinical studies among infants who were born during or entering their first RSV season, efficacy for preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTI was 60. 4%, and efficacy for preventing RSV-associated LRTI with hospitalization was
90. 9% through 150 days after injection.

### Optimizing timing for respiratory syncytial virus prevention interventions for infants [^86994cb3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of pediatric respiratory infections, resulting in 2.1 million outpatient visits and 80 000 hospitalizations annually in children younger than 5 years. Infants younger than 1 year have the highest infection risk, and RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization. Prior to 2023, the only US Food and Drug Administration–approved intervention for preventing severe RSV infection was palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody requiring monthly injections, which is relatively costly and limited to high-risk infants (10% of infants). This leaves the remaining 90% of infants susceptible, and at least 75% of RSV-related hospitalizations occur in those without risk factors for severe disease.,

A maternal bivalent prefusion F vaccine (MV)and nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, were approved in 2023 to prevent RSV infection in the general infant population. Both are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for seasonal administration. MV can be administered to pregnant women at a gestational age (GA) of 32 to 36 weeks from September through January, while nirsevimab can be administered to the infant after birth if MV was not used. Both agents are viable options for RSV protection for infants born from October through February but differ in uptake, costs, efficacy, and waning protection, which may influence cost-effectiveness based on timing of administration. To our knowledge, no US-based economic evaluation has assessed both agents in the same analysis while considering timing. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of MV and nirsevimab compared with no intervention when (1) administered during different months throughout the RSV season or (2) when considering immunization from October through February.

### Current challenges and future directions for RSV prevention strategies in Japan [^a81024ae]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, particularly those under 6 months of age. In Japan, RSV seasonality in temperate regions has recently shifted from traditional winter peaks to more year-round circulation, with this change most pronounced in higher latitude areas such as Hokkaido, where outbreaks increasingly peak in summer. Japan has recently approved 2 RSV prevention tools: nirsevimab for infants and a maternal vaccine. However, challenges remain: maternal vaccines require out-of-pocket payment, and nirsevimab is reimbursed only for high-risk infants under national insurance and must be administered during the RSV season. These limitations call for policy and system-level improvements to ensure equitable access. A season-independent, risk-based prevention strategy-such as maternal vaccination at or after 28 weeks' gestation and nirsevimab for preterm or otherwise unvaccinated infants-may help optimize protection while minimizing overlap. Adapting implementation strategies to Japan's shifting epidemiology will be essential to efficiently protect all infants. Japan's experience may also provide insights for other countries facing changes in RSV transmission patterns and planning broader prevention approaches.

### What U.S. obstetricians need to know about respiratory syncytial virus [^791a6764]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in neonates, infants, and children worldwide. The virus is estimated to infect 97% of this population in the United States by the age of 2 years, leading to hospitalization for severe lower respiratory tract disease in 2–3% of infants younger than age 6 months. Two preventive options, prenatal administration of a maternal vaccine and administration of a long-acting monoclonal antibody to the infant, are now available for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended a new maternal vaccination, RSVPreF, to be administered between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants in the first 6 months of life. The monoclonal antibody nirsevimab was approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants younger than age 8 months who are born during or entering their first RSV season and for infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at high risk for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection and entering their second RSV season. Either maternal vaccination during pregnancy or monoclonal antibody administration to the infant is recommended to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection among infants, but both are not needed for most infants. Given that the availability of these products may vary as these recommendations are implemented, it is important that obstetricians and other prenatal practitioners have the information they need to counsel their pregnant patients about both options. We review the safety and efficacy of these products, current recommendations for their use, and relative advantages and disadvantages of both newly approved options for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants to assist obstetricians and other prenatal practitioners in their counseling of pregnant patients.

### Nirsevimab for prevention of RSV infections for immunocompromised children with cancer and stem cell transplant recipients: a single-center experience [^d3e8d45b]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody approved in 2023, offers single-dose seasonal protection. We conducted a single-center study to assess uptake, factors associated with receipt, and RSV outcomes among eligible patients during the 2024–2025 season. Of 42 eligible patients, 62% received nirsevimab. Delays and missed opportunities for administration were common. RSV occurred in both recipients and non-recipients, including one RSV-related death in an unvaccinated patient. Clinic type and healthcare contact influenced uptake. These findings highlight the need for improved implementation strategies to optimize RSV prophylaxis in immunocompromised pediatric populations.

Infants and Children Aged 8–19 Months at Increased Risk for Severe RSV Disease and Entering Their Second RSV Season

Infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and who are entering their second RSV season (timing of season as defined above) are recommended to receive nirsevimab. Replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab is expected to be cost saving, and ACIP recommends nirsevimab for eligible children entering their second RSV season, similar to groups of children recommended by AAP for palivizumab during their second RSV season (Box). In addition, research suggests that some American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) children experience high rates of severe RSV disease. A recent study found that incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization among some AI/AN children aged 12–23 months was four to 10 times that of similar-aged children across seven sites in the United States. These studies have been limited to specific populations and might not be broadly representative of risk in all AI/AN children. Some AI/AN communities live in remote regions, making transportation of children with severe RSV more challenging. Given the available evidence, ACIP also recommends nirsevimab for AI/AN children entering their second RSV season.

Precautions and Contraindications

When administering nirsevimab to children with increased risk for bleeding, providers should follow ACIP's general best practice guidelines for immunization. Nirsevimab is contraindicated in persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after a previous dose or to a product component. Adverse reactions might occur after administration of nirsevimab alone; these reactions may be reported to MedWatch online, by fax, by mail, or by contacting FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

Adverse reactions might occur after the coadministration of nirsevimab with a vaccine; these reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and reports should specify that the patient received nirsevimab on the VAERS form. ††††† Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available by telephone (1-800-822-7967) or online. When adverse reactions that occur after the coadministration of nirsevimab with a vaccine are reported to VAERS, additional reporting of the same adverse reactions to MedWatch is not necessary.

### Use of clesrovimab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025 [^0c21e091]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) burden and observed effectiveness of prevention products in U.S. infants: Before universal recommendations, RSV "led to an estimated 58,000–80,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations and 100–300 RSV-associated deaths annually among U.S. infants and children aged ≤ 5 years", with hospitalization "higher during the first 6 months of life, peaking at age 1 month and decreasing with increasing age". Most hospitalized infants had "no known risk factors for severe RSV", and therefore "all infants are at risk for severe RSV disease". Real-world data estimated that nirsevimab and maternal vaccination "offer protection against approximately 70%–80% of RSV-associated hospitalizations among infants", and in the 2024–2025 season, hospitalization rates among infants aged "0–7 months were 43% and 28% lower, respectively, compared with rates during pre–COVID-19 pandemic RSV seasons".

### Estimating the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab versus standard of practice for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and infants in Spain: a cost-utility modelling study [^99f6ac5e]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The fifth scenario considered the alternative immunisation strategy recommended by the Spanish Health Ministry, which consisted of targeting infants at risk, comprising all preterm infants (born before 35 weeks GA) and high-risk infants with CLD or CHD. Under this more restrictive immunisation strategy, 15 110 infants were immunised, and 10 991 RSV-related health events (excluding deaths) were estimated for the SoP (1095 were inpatient hospitalisations), which represented a spend of €10.1 million associated with their management. A total of 10 premature deaths were estimated, which caused indirect costs of almost €4.2 million, also considering the absenteeism of caregivers. For this immunisation strategy, the infants lost 308 QALYs according to the model estimates. Immunisation with nirsevimab for this cohort of infants averted 5196 RSV-related health events (excluding deaths), of which 525 were inpatient hospitalisations (including PICU and MV), with a reduction of €5.0 million in healthcare costs, which increased to cost savings of €7.0 million in total expenditures when considering indirect costs (excluding the cost of prophylaxis), and 153 total QALYs gained with respect to the SoP (online supplemental table 13). When considering the payer's perspective, the overall EJP for nirsevimab under the all-preterm and high-risk infants' strategy ranged from €1431 to €1834 at those WTP thresholds of €0 to €30 000 per QALY gained, respectively. The EJP rose to €1568–€1971 from a societal perspective (online supplemental table 14).

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults: a living systematic review and meta-analysis [^2a3d6507]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

In response, passive immunisation with nirsevimab for infants and the maternal vaccine (bivalent RSV prefusion F (RSVpreF) protein-based vaccine, (ABRYSVO, Pfizer)) for pregnant people between 24 and 36 completed weeks of gestation (varied by country) was approved in Europe in October 2022, the UK in November 2022 and the USA in July 2023. Several clinical trials have been conducted, demonstrating favourable safety and efficacy for these products. For the maternal vaccine, a clinical trial of the RSVpreF3 (AREXVY, GSK) was halted due to an observed increase in premature births. Only the ABRYSVO (Pfizer) vaccine has been licensed for use during pregnancy, but concerns about the risk of premature births remain. In addition, for older adults, three RSV vaccines — AREXVY (GSK), ABRYSVO (Pfizer) and mRESVIA (Moderna) — were also approved after demonstrating favourable efficacy and good safety profiles in clinical trials. However, clinical trials are often limited in their generalisability to real-world settings due to the exclusion of individuals with risk factors and the relatively small sample sizes as reflected in the wide 95% CIs. Rare or very rare serious adverse events such as hypersensitivity reactions, adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, pre-eclampsia) or cardiovascular or neurological conditions (eg, atrial fibrillation, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)) may not have been detected in clinical trials. Furthermore, the efficacy of the performance of nirsevimab and vaccines needs to be established in scenarios reflecting those encountered by public health agencies. Since their approval, routine RSV immunisation campaigns have been implemented in countries across Europe, including the UK, and in North America, providing real-world evidence. A growing evidence base demonstrating effectiveness and safety is vital primarily to provide reassurance and build confidence in the vaccines and immunisation programmes, as well as inform decision-makers and policy. To our knowledge, no systematic review has yet assessed the effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab and RSV vaccines using real-world data. To inform immunisation policy, address gaps in evidence from clinical trials and help decision-making, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness and safety of RSV prophylaxis in reducing RSV-related healthcare utilisation among infants and older adults in real-world settings.

### Effectiveness and efficiency of immunisation strategies to prevent RSV among infants and older adults in Germany: a modelling study [^49902c01]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Under-ascertainment in older adults

The comparison of published hospitalisation rates with our model derived estimates suggests that the RSV-specific ICD-10 codes underestimate the true burden in older adults of 55 + years by a factor 8–14 (Additional file 1: Fig. S11). For older adults, we thus scaled the hospitalisations and ICU admissions by a factor of 8 (strategies 1–3) or 8 and 14, respectively (strategies 4–6).

Immunisation strategies to protect infants

Our results indicate that switching from Palivizumab to Nirsevimab for high-risk infants aged 1–5 months (strategy 1) would prevent only median 288 (95% PI 275–301) RSV-specific hospitalisations annually in all age groups (Fig. 3 A), corresponding to 0.79% of all RSV-specific hospitalisations (Fig. 3 B) and 1.1% of all hospitalisations in < 1 year old under the current strategy. This strategy prevents also 20 (95% PI 19–21) ICU cases (1.1% of infants in the ICU).

### Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis – the story so far [^3e33e6ad]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common and highly contagious pathogen that infects nearly all children by the age of 2 years. It is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide among certain high-risk paediatric populations. Therapy is sub-optimal for RSV, thus treatment focuses on ameliorating symptoms. Since discovery of the virus in the 1950s, efforts have been ongoing to develop a safe and effective vaccine. These efforts have met with serious obstacles. Passive immunoprophylaxis presents a viable alternative to active immunization. In 1998, the genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) was granted FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval for prophylaxis of high-risk children in the United States; EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) approval followed in 1999 for Europe. It is now approved in over 45 countries worldwide. Palivizumab was shown to significantly reduce RSV-related hospitalizations in North America and Europe with few adverse effects. Clinical trial and outcomes data documenting experience with palivizumab to date continue to extend the initial safety and efficacy observations.

Discussion

An ideal preventative solution for newborns would protect them from RSV disease during the initial period after birth when their immature immune systems are unable to generate an active response. The prophylaxis should protect across an entire RSV season, but not hinder infants' adaptive immune systems (once able) from responding to subsequent exposures to RSV; we undertook this study to assess these characteristics of nirsevimab. Analysis from two randomized, placebo-controlled studies, which assessed the efficacy of nirsevimab in preventing medically attended RSV LRTI, found that baseline serum RSV NAb levels were higher in the MELODY study, likely due to the older gestational age providing additional time for transfer of maternal antibodies in this cohort (Fig. 1). Similarly, the correlation between gestational age and RSV antibody levels at baseline (Fig. 2) was consistent with previous reports that maternal antibodies are transferred later in the third trimester and may explain why premature infants are at increased risk of RSV disease. Baseline RSV pre-F and post-F antibody levels differed by as much as 1,000-fold (Fig. 3), demonstrating considerable variability in infants entering their first RSV season. As expected, levels decreased with increased age at randomization, with infants older than 6 months having the lowest RSV antibody levels. This finding may explain why older infants are still at risk for severe RSV disease as 10.8% and 6.1% of infants greater than 6 months of age in the placebo group had a medically attended RSV LRTI in the phase 2b and MELODY studies. This finding is in agreement with a systematic analysis performed by Li et al. which reported global hospitalization rates and hospital case fatality rates that ranged from 7.4% to 14.3% and from 0.4% to 1.2%, respectively, in infants 6–12 months of age. Of note, approximately 25% of term infants had unmeasurable NAb levels at baseline (Fig. 3), leaving them particularly susceptible to RSV infection during their first RSV season.

### Expected impact of universal immunization with nirsevimab against RSV-related outcomes and costs among all US infants in their first RSV season: a static model [^d4d9d106]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Another limitation, given the model structure, was the need for more granular data, which sometimes led to data gaps. In these situations, assumptions were made to fit the available data. For example, rates for ER and primary care visits were assumed to be consistent across all risk groups. Estimates for inpatient hospitalizations were also not always available by the month of age, and therefore the monthly trend for the overall population from Hall et al was assumed to be applicable to all subpopulations. Finally, for alignment and comparison with the analysis performed by Rainisch et al, we applied the same assumptions for the proportion of LRTIs in health events, which cites unpublished data from the CDC, and further information would be needed.

The differences in the reduction of outcomes with the use of nirsevimab by population were due to the differential risk of RSV-MALRTI and specific coverage rates. For palivizumab-eligible infants, while a noninferior efficacy was considered for nirsevimab versus palivizumab, the model assumed higher uptake rate of nirsevimab in the palivizumab-eligible population, due to likely better compliance with a single dose of nirsevimab versus monthly injection of palivizumab. For preterm and term infants ineligible for palivizumab, a consistent prespecified pooled efficacy was applied across all infants. Indeed, due to the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab, there is no basis by which to expect differential efficacy in the various infants' subpopulations. This has been borne out in the results of the pivotal studies of nirsevimab, designed to encompass all infants, where consistent levels of efficacy were demonstrated in preterm versus term subgroups, and across the spectrum of disease severity.

### Lower respiratory tract infections following respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody nirsevimab immunization versus placebo: analysis from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial (MELODY) [^7ae6318c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nirsevimab is an extended half-life, highly potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein, with efficacy in preventing RSV-associated medically attended (MA) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and medically vulnerable children (aged ≤ 24 months). This post-hoc exploratory analysis examined the incidence of LRTI from RSV and other respiratory pathogens during a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of nirsevimab, in healthy-term and late-preterm (i.e.g.estational age ≥ 35 weeks) infants entering their first RSV season (MELODY).

Methods

3012 participants were randomized to nirsevimab (n = 2009) or placebo (n = 1003). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants presenting with an LRTI and tested for 22 different respiratory pathogens using the BioFire® Respiratory 2.1 Panel. Incidence of RSV and non-RSV MA-LRTIs through Day 511 and LRTI severity per the ReSViNET scale were assessed.

Results

852 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 561 participants through Day 511: 519 swabs from 337 nirsevimab participants and 333 swabs from 224 placebo participants. RSV and non-RSV infections were detected in 193/852 (22.7%) and 551/852 (64.7%) swabs, respectively. RSV infection rates were lower with nirsevimab compared with placebo, including RSV-rhinovirus/enterovirus coinfections. Rates of other viral infections were similar between study arms. Approximately 70% of single RSV infections and RSV coinfections were adjudicated as mild, and 26.2% of single RSV infections and 24.5% of RSV coinfections required hospitalization.

Conclusions

Nirsevimab protected against RSV single and coinfections, with no evidence of replacement of RSV with other respiratory viruses.

### Respiratory syncytial virus vaccination and immunoprophylaxis: realising the potential for protection of young children [^99278073]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The search for safe and efficacious products to prevent severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in young infants has lasted more than 60 years. In high-income and middle-income countries, two new products have been authorised: an RSV monoclonal antibody for administration to infants (nirsevimab) and an RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine (RSVpreF [Pfizer, Puurs, Belgium]) for administration to pregnant people. These products are not yet available in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, where most RSV deaths occur. Other papers in this Series describe the acute burden of RSV disease in young children, the effects of RSV infection in early childhood on long-term lung health, and the burden of RSV disease and disease prevention products in older adults. In this Series paper, we briefly review the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of nirsevimab and RSVpreF maternal vaccine for protection of infants. We then explore potential regulatory, policy, and implementation pathways and provide case studies of intervention uptake in Spain and Argentina, and considerations for use in Kenya. We also explore the health economic evidence to inform product introduction decisions. With sufficient political will and affordable pricing, RSV disease prevention in infants can become a global reality.

### Monoclonal antibody therapies in respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis-an umbrella review [^5259504a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim was to gather an overview of the evidence of monoclonal antibody therapies in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in children. For this umbrella review of previous meta-analyses, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases in August 2023. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. One author extracted the data, and another author validated the data. We extracted all analyses focusing on clinical outcomes and comparing prophylaxis to placebo. Risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to analyze the risk of bias in the included reviews. AMSTAR-2 was used to evaluate the quality of the included reviews. After screening of 323 abstracts and 22 full reports, a total of seven systematic reviews with meta-analyses were included. The risk of bias was rated to be low in four and high in three of these. Three reviews were of moderate quality, one low, and three very low quality according to AMSTAR-2 classification. Six of the meta-analyses were direct comparisons, and one was a network meta-analysis. Five of the reviews focused on palivizumab, one in nirsevimab, and one included all monoclonal antibodies. Six reviews focused on preterm neonates and consisted of 42 comparisons to placebo of which 21 showed efficacy, and 21 had no evidence of a difference. The positive effect was seen in all reviews against RSV infection and RSV hospitalization in palivizumab and nirsevimab groups compared to placebo. None of the mortality comparisons showed efficacy. One meta-analysis focused on cystic fibrosis patients and had eight comparisons, but it was underpowered to detect any results. The overall evidence from previous meta-analyses shows that monoclonal antibodies are effective in preventing RSV infections and RSV hospitalizations in preterm infants. However, no effect on mortality was seen in these studies. Evidence certainty has been ranked mainly from low to moderate.

### Regulatory review of benefits and risks of preventing infant RSV disease through maternal immunization [^857724ef]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Alternative therapeutics to active immunization during pregnancy for prevention of RSV disease in infants include two RSV F protein inhibitor monoclonal antibodies that FDA approved for prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in infants and toddlers. FDA approved nirsevimab-alip injection on July 17, 2023 for prevention of LRTD caused by RSV from birth during a first RSV season and in children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease. Palivizumab injection was approved by FDA in 1998 for the prevention of serious LRTD caused by RSV in children at high risk of RSV disease.

A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study (NCT04424316) assessed the efficacy of Abrysvo in the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD in infants born to individuals vaccinated during pregnancy. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against severe LRTD due to RSV was established at all prespecified time points, including VE of 69.4% (97.6% CI 44.3%, 84.1%) in infants within 180 days after birth. VE for any LRTD due to RSV was 51.3% (97.6% CI 29.4%, 66.8%) in infants within 180 days after birth. A prespecified secondary endpoint also showed a statistically significant reduction in infant hospitalization due to RSV LRTD. In the subgroup of pregnant individuals vaccinated at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age, the point estimate of vaccine efficacy for prevention of severe LRTD due to RSV in infants was 76.5% (95% CI 41.3%, 92.1%) within 180 days after birth, while vaccine efficacy for preventing any LRTD due to RSV in infants was 57.3% (95% CI 29.8%, 74.7%) within 180 days after birth, mirroring the efficacy findings in the overall trial population.

### Multicentre study on nirsevimab: Bayesian analysis reveals persisting risk for preterm infants [^58113ec6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Methodological innovation: Bayesian approach

A key strength of our study is the use of Bayesian statistical modelling to address the methodological challenges posed by the natural reduction in RSV cases following nirsevimab prophylaxis. Unlike frequentist models, which rely on large sample sizes for statistical robustness, Bayesian methods provide stable estimates despite small sample sizes, allowing for a more precise assessment of nirsevimab impact on disease severity. Beyond this study, our findings highlight a broader shift in medical research methodology. As highly effective public health interventions reduce disease incidence, future evaluations will face similar challenges with low event rates. The growing role of Bayesian methods in clinical researchenables earlier and more robust conclusions, enhancing evidence-based decision-making for new preventive strategies. Their integration into future studies will be essential for optimising data interpretation and guiding public health policies in low-incidence contexts.

Clinical and public health implications

Our findings reinforce the critical role of nirsevimab prophylaxis in reducing RSV burden, both in terms of infection rates and disease severity. From a clinical perspective, the identification of gestational age-specific differences in protection timing suggests that current prophylaxis strategies may need refinement. Lower gestational age infants remain at higher risk of early RSV-related hospitalisation, raising the possibility that alternative dosing strategies (higher or more frequent doses) may be warranted in this subgroup.

Study limitations and future directions

Despite its strengths, our study has some limitations. The limited number of RSV cases requiring mechanical ventilation precluded definitive conclusions on nirsevimab impact on the most severe disease forms. While Bayesian methods improved inference, larger multicentre studies would further validate our findings. Additionally, our study lacked long-term follow-up on recurrent RSV infections or potential waning immunity over time. Furthermore, we were unable to assess circulating antibody levels at birth and after nirsevimab immunisation, which could have provided insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the differences observed in our cohort, particularly in preterm infants.

Future research should focus on expanding sample sizes through multicentre collaborations, confirming the observed trends and evaluating long-term protection durability, especially in preterm populations. Additionally, further studies should investigate biological mechanisms underlying differential immune responses, which could be critical for refining immunisation strategies and optimising dosing regimens across gestational age groups.

Clinical Guidance

Timing of Nirsevimab Administration

Providers should administer nirsevimab to infants aged < 8 months and to infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease beginning shortly before the start of the RSV season. On the basis of pre–COVID-19 pandemic patterns, nirsevimab could be administered in most of the continental United States from October through the end of March. Infants born shortly before or during the RSV season should receive nirsevimab within 1 week of birth. Nirsevimab administration can occur during the birth hospitalization or in the outpatient setting. Optimal timing for nirsevimab administration is shortly before the RSV season begins; however, nirsevimab may be administered to age-eligible infants and children who have not yet received a dose at any time during the season. Only a single dose of nirsevimab is recommended for an RSV season. Infants with prolonged birth hospitalizations related to prematurity or other causes should receive nirsevimab shortly before or promptly after hospital discharge. No evidence is available to support use of nirsevimab for prevention of hospital-acquired RSV infection, and nirsevimab is not recommended for this indication.

Because the timing of the onset, peak, and decline of RSV activity might vary geographically, providers can adjust administration schedules based on local epidemiology. RSV seasonality in tropical climates (including southern Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands) might differ from that of most of the continental United States or be unpredictable. In Alaska, RSV seasonality is less predictable, and the duration of RSV activity is often longer than the national average duration. Providers in these jurisdictions should consult state, local, or territorial guidance on timing of nirsevimab administration.

Coadministration with Routine Childhood Vaccines

On the basis of limited data from clinical trials, coadministration of nirsevimab with routine vaccines resulted in a similar rate of adverse events compared with administration of vaccines alone. Nirsevimab is not expected to interfere with the immune response to other routine childhood immunizations. In accordance with general best practices for immunization, simultaneous administration of nirsevimab with age-appropriate vaccines is recommended.

### Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the MATISSE (maternal immunization study for safety and efficacy) maternal respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine trial [^c6f7e1b2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)–associated illnesses in infants and children present a substantial global clinical burden. Infants are at morbidity and mortality risk from RSV-associated disease during their first months of life. Severe RSV illness is most commonly reported in infants aged younger than 6 months, and case fatality ratios are highest in infants aged younger than 3 months. Children and infants from outside high-income countries have substantially worse outcomes from RSV illness than those in high-income countries. Other than supportive care, no treatment options exist. Although the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab is effective at preventing RSV-associated disease in newborns and young infants, costs may be prohibitively high. If effective, widespread maternal vaccination with a bivalent RSV prefusion F protein (RSVpreF) vaccine could help reduce both infant RSV–lower respiratory tract illness global burden and RSV-associated health inequities.

The global MATISSE (Maternal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy) phase 3 maternal vaccination trial assessed the safety and efficacy of RSVpreF in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in newborns and infants. In the primary analysis that included 85% of scheduled follow-up data from 7,392 pregnant participants randomized and 7,128 newborns and infants enrolled from June 17, 2020, through October 2, 2022, RSVpreF demonstrated 81.8% and 69.4% efficacy in preventing severe RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory tract illness within 90 and 180 days after birth, respectively, meeting its primary endpoint and supporting authorization globally. – In addition, RSVpreF showed favorable safety profiles in pregnant individuals and their newborns and infants in this primary analysis. To augment and complement these primary results, the objective of this analysis is to present final descriptive efficacy data for primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints, up to 2 years' safety follow-up of children through study completion, and exploratory immunogenicity data from MATISSE.

### Expected impact of universal immunization with nirsevimab against RSV-related outcomes and costs among all US infants in their first RSV season: a static model [^6a26d40c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Target Population and Immunization Strategies

The entire US birth cohort served as the basis of the model, and infants were stratified into subpopulations to account for the differential individual risks of severe RSV-MALRTI. The subpopulations corresponded to the 3 groups assessed in the nirsevimab clinical trials: (1) term and late preterm infants (born at or after 35 wGA); (2) preterm infants (born between 29 wGA and 34 weeks, 6 days GA, not eligible for palivizumab); and (3) palivizumab-eligible infants (infants born before 29 wGA or those with CLDP or CHD per the latest American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations) (Table 1).

Table 1.
Model Inputs

The model compared 2 immunization strategies: (1) the current SoC for each subpopulation, consisting of up to 5 monthly administrations of palivizumab during the RSV season for eligible infants only, and no prophylaxis for other term and preterm infants; and (2) passive immunization with nirsevimab for all infants (Supplementary Figure 1). Both strategies employed a seasonal approach whereby prophylaxis was administered only at the beginning of or during the RSV season for all infants younger than 1 year in their first RSV season. In strategy 1, the first dose of palivizumab was administered at the start of the season (ie, October) for eligible infants born outside the RSV season (March–September) or at birth for those born within the RSV season (October–February). In strategy 2, a single dose of nirsevimab was administered at the start of the RSV season for infants born out of season and at birth for those born within season. Infants born in March were considered as born out of season due to the low circulation level of RSV.

### A single amino acid mutation alters multiple neutralization epitopes in the respiratory syncytial virus fusion glycoprotein [^e2a60262]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of infant hospitalization and the second leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. There are an estimated 33 million cases of RSV-associated acute-lower respiratory tract infections annually, over 100,000 of which lead to death. Immunocompromised and elderly populations are increasingly being recognized as vulnerable high-risk groups for severe disease. Despite the enormous disease burden presented by RSV, there are few effective antiviral therapies readily available for the treatment of active infection. Biologics in the form of prophylactic monoclonal antibodies provide a means of passive immunization and are the treatment of choice for RSV infection. Until recently, the prophylactic monoclonal antibody Palivizumab (PZMB) was the only preventative therapeutic available for high-risk infants. PZMB is administered monthly throughout the RSV season to only the highest-risk infants. PZMB is costly, has variable efficacy, and leaves a large population of infants and susceptible adults unprotected. In 2023, the FDA approved Nirsevimab for use in all infants under 8 months old entering their first RSV season, and Merck has a Phase III biologic - Clesrovimab - in development. In contrast to PZMB, Nirsevimab and Clesrovimab are more potent, and thus administration is only required once per RSV season. Two new adult vaccines created by Pfizer (Abrysvo) and GSK (Arexvy) were also approved for use in the elderly, and pregnant women respectively.

In light of these promising advancements, it is critical that we better understand how RSV might adapt to evade the selective pressures that are sure to be elicited by novel therapeutics. RSV is under consistent evolutionary pressure while circulating in the human population. While the primary burden of RSV is in infants, it continuously circulates in healthy adults and accounts for approximately 15–35% of all respiratory virus cases in any given season. The antiviral immune response mounted during the course of RSV infection places selective pressures on the virus that lead to quasi-species displaying an array of polymorphisms. Like other RNA viruses, RSV adapts readily while circulating in the population, particularly in the highly variable gene that encodes the attachment glycoprotein, RSV-G. Genetically distinct viruses impact viral load and pathology in humans during subsequent RSV seasons, which we have previously correlated with viral replication in tissue culture.

14.4 Prevention of MA RSV LRTI in Infants Born at < 35 Weeks Gestational Age and Infants with CLD of Prematurity or Hemodynamically Significant CHD (Trial 05)

The safety and PK of BEYFORTUS were evaluated in a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled multicenter trial (Trial 05) in pediatric subjects born less than 35 weeks GA and infants with CLD of prematurity or hemodynamically significant CHD. This trial was not powered for efficacy, but efficacy was assessed as secondary endpoint. The efficacy of BEYFORTUS in preterm infants (GA less than 35 weeks) during their first RSV season and in pediatric subjects up to 24 months of age with CLD or CHD during their first and second RSV season was established by extrapolation of efficacy of BEYFORTUS from Trials 03 and Trial 04 to the population enrolled in Trial 05 based on similar nirsevimab-alip exposures among subjects enrolled in Trial 04 and 05 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Trial 05: RSV Season One

Trial 05 enrolled infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease entering their first RSV season into one of two cohorts: preterm infants (GA less than 35 weeks) and infants with CLD of prematurity or hemodynamically significant CHD. A total of 925 infants were randomized 2:1 in each of the preterm (n = 615) and CLD/CHD (n = 310) cohorts to receive BEYFORTUS or palivizumab. Infants received a single IM dose of BEYFORTUS (50 mg if less than 5 kg body weight or 100 mg if greater than 5 kg body weight at the time of dosing), followed by 4 once-monthly IM doses of placebo, or 5 once-monthly IM doses of 15 mg/kg palivizumab, respectively. At randomization, in the preterm cohort, 77 infants (13%) were less than 29 weeks GA; and 499 (81%) were GA greater than or equal to 29 to less than 35 weeks. In the CLD/CHD cohort, 70% had CLD of prematurity; 34% had hemodynamically significant CHD; 123 infants (40%) were less than 29 weeks GA, 28% were greater than or equal to 29 weeks to less than 35 weeks GA; and 32% were greater than or equal to 35 weeks GA. In both cohorts together, 54% were male; 79% were White; 10% were Black; 5% were Asian; 2% were American Indian/Alaskan Native; 15% were Hispanic or Latino; and 57% weighed less than 5 kg. The median age was 3.5 months (range: 0.07 to 12.3 months); 45% were less than or equal to 3 months; 34% were greater than 3 months to less than or equal to 6 months, and 21% were greater than 6 months of age.

### Multicentre study on nirsevimab: Bayesian analysis reveals persisting risk for preterm infants [^2c810387]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study provides evidence that infants with lower gestational age remain at higher risk of RSV-related hospitalisation despite nirsevimab prophylaxis. This aspect has not been previously explored in detail, highlighting the need for gestational age-specific considerations in RSV prophylaxis strategies. We also confirmed the protective role of nirsevimab in reducing RSV-related hospitalisationsand provide compelling evidence of its ability to mitigate disease severity among hospitalised infants, when adjusted for the effect of gestational age and other relevant covariates. The significant reduction in non-invasive respiratory support requirements, combined with a trend toward lower mechanical ventilation rates, suggests that prophylaxis may modify the disease course in breakthrough cases.

Gestational age and protection timing

The increased risk of RSV hospitalisation in preterm infants despite nirsevimab prophylaxis raises important clinical considerations. Several factors may contribute to this increased vulnerability, including developmental immaturity of the immune system, altered pharmacokinetics and potential differences in the persistence of nirsevimab protective effect in preterm versus term infants. Additionally, reduced transplacental antibody transfer in preterm infants may play a role, aligning with observations from the post-COVID-19 RSV resurgence, where a hypothesised loss of maternal immunity due to curfews and reduced viral circulation led to increased RSV incidence.

These findings suggest that alternative or supplemental dosing regimens may be necessary to optimise RSV protection in this particularly high-risk population.

Reduction in disease severity

The Bayesian analysis provides compelling evidence of strong protective effects against HFNC and CPAP use, further supporting nirsevimab's role in mitigating disease burden, even when adjusted for gestational age and other relevant covariates. Consistently, a trend toward reduced mechanical ventilation and shorter hospital stay in RSV cases that underwent nirsevimab prophylaxis was detected. Interestingly, our findings suggest a longer length of stay for non-RSV cases following nirsevimab introduction. We speculate that this may be a consequence of the overall reduction in RSV hospitalisations, which have allowed clinicians to extend the duration of hospitalisation for non-RSV cases, ensuring comprehensive care and monitoring in the absence of RSV-related bed occupancy pressures. Further research is needed to validate this hypothesis and explore its potential implications for hospital resource allocation.

### The road to approved vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus [^2fb89595]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Infant protection from RSV disease

Protection of young infants from severe disease prior to their first exposure can be achieved by bolstering neutralizing antibody responses. One way to achieve this is by direct administration of potent neutralizing antibodies. Currently, the use of the site II-targeting mAb palivizumab is restricted to neonates with extreme prematurity (< 29 weeks' gestation) or infants with other selected risk factors due to high cost and the need for monthly administration. It is expected to be replaced by more potent antibodies with extended half-life "YTE" mutations (M252Y/S254T/T256E) in the Fc portion so a single administration can confer protection for an entire RSV season. Increased potency and durability of protection make extending coverage to all infants an achievable goal.

The most advanced mAb, nirsevimab (trade name Beyfortus), binds antigenic site Ø and has > 50-fold higher neutralizing activity than palivizumab. Nirsevimab has a comparable safety and side effect profile to palivizumab when compared in palivizumab-eligible infants, and in a phase 2b primary cohort of healthy late-preterm and term infants, a single 50 or 100 mg dose (based on size) prior to the RSV season demonstrated 75% protection against medically attended RSV-associated LRTI. It was similarly protective when evaluated in healthy preterm infants. A phase 3 trial (NCT03979313) showed an efficacy of 76% against medically attended LRTI, 77% against hospitalization due to RSV-associated LRTI, and 79% against very severe medically attended LRTI. A pooled analysis demonstrated that prophylaxis with nirsevimab was 80% effective against medically attended LRTI through to 150 days post-enrollment. Based on pharmacokinetic data, the efficacy is expected to be similar in full-term infants as well as those born prematurely or with chronic lung or congenital heart disease. Importantly, despite providing durable protection, nirsevimab does not appear to prevent the development of effective immune responses in infants later infected with RSV. While rare resistance mutations were identified in RSV F protein sequences isolated from infected infants that received nirsevimab, more than 99% of the F protein sequences obtained remained susceptible. Nirsevimab has been market-approved in Europe and the UK and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2023. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that a dose be given to all infants younger than 8 months entering their first RSV season and a second season dose for high risk groups, and has voted to include nirsevimab in the Vaccines for Children program which provides vaccines at no cost to those who might not be vaccinated because of inability to pay.

### Durability of neutralizing RSV antibodies following nirsevimab administration and elicitation of the natural immune response to RSV infection in infants [^0a0bc1ab]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Similar to other maternal antibodies, during the third trimester of pregnancy, RSV antibodies are transferred through the placenta and could provide some protection against RSV disease for approximately 3–6 months after birth –. However, levels of maternal antibodies against RSV at birth can be variable between infants and decline rapidly after birth –.

Nirsevimab is an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, with an extended half-life in vivo (68.7 days (ref.)). It targets an antigenic region on the pre-F conformation of the F protein (which is conserved among circulating RSV A and B isolates) and thereby prevents RSV fusion with the host cell. Most neutralizing activity from natural RSV infection is directed at the pre-F form of the F protein and thus forms a better target for monoclonal antibody development than the post-F form. The stabilization and structural characterization of the prefusion form of the F protein revealed that D25 (precursor to nirsevimab) binds to the highly neutralization-sensitive site Φ, which is exclusive to the pre-F surface. Based on the high potency and extended half-life of nirsevimab, healthy neonates and infants were enrolled in two pivotal, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to receive a single intramuscular (i.m.) dose of nirsevimab before the RSV transmission season for the prevention of RSV disease. Nirsevimab reduced the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI throughout an infant's first RSV season, corresponding to an efficacy of 70.1% in healthy preterm infants in a phase 2b study (gestational age ≥ 29 to < 35 weeks; median age at randomization 1.6 months)and 74.5% in healthy term and late preterm infants in the phase 3 MELODY study (gestational age ≥ 35 weeks; median age at randomization 2.6 months). Furthermore, a pooled analysis of infants who were administered nirsevimab at the approved dose regimendemonstrated an efficacy of 79.5% against medically attended RSV LRTI. Here we present our analysis of results from the phase 2b and phase 3 MELODY studies with the following objectives: (1) characterize baseline maternal RSV antibody levels in preterm and full-term infants entering their first RSV season; (2) determine the level and duration of RSV NAb levels provided by nirsevimab; (3) investigate the incidence of clinical (symptomatic) and subclinical (asymptomatic) RSV infections in the first year of life; and (4) evaluate whether infants can mount a natural immune response against RSV in the presence of nirsevimab. For the phase 2b study, this was a post hoc analysis and data were analyzed after completion of the study. For the MELODY study, this was a prespecified exploratory analysis with a data cut-off of 9 August 2021.

In the last several months, two different prevention strategies–nirsevimab, a monocolonal antibody treatment, and Pfizer's RSVpreF–have received approval in many countries for RSV prophylaxis in healthy infant populations. Nirsevimab was approved by the EMA in the European Union at the end of October 2022, the MHRA in the United Kingdom in November 2022, Health Canada in April 2023, and the FDA in the United States in July 2023; it is additionally awaiting approval in China and Japan. In August 2023, RSV PreF was approved for maternal immunization in the US, all 27 member states in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, for the prevention of severe RSV LRTI in infants from birth through 6 months; it was later approved in many other countries, including the UK, Canada and Australia in late 2023 to early 2024.,

In August 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the US recommended nirsevimab for all infants under eight months of age during their first week of life during or shortly before the RSV season. The RSV PreF maternal immunization is recommended between September and January at 32–36 weeks gestation. These recommendations were based on vaccine efficacies of 76.5% against severe medically attended RSV-LRTI, 57.3% against medically attended RSV-LRTI, and 48.2% against RSV-LRTI hospitalizations, within this interval. For nirsevimab, recent findings have demonstrated a 71.1–79.5% reduced risk of medically-attended RSV-LRTI, as well as potential risk reductions in RSV-LRTI hospital admissions of over 75%, relative to placebo.
