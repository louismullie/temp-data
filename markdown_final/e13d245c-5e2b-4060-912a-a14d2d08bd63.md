## Question

Can prednisone taper cause increase sleepiness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prednisone taper can cause increased sleepiness, and if so, how confident we can be and what mechanisms explain it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing increased sleepiness from fatigue. Then, I should verify the existence of a glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that includes hypersomnolence. Next, I will review evidence on sleep disturbances during taper versus during active therapy. After that, I need to consider mechanisms that could plausibly produce hypersomnolence during withdrawal. I should then check how often this occurs and who is at highest risk. Finally, I will examine practical tapering and monitoring guidance, and summarize a bottom-line answer with caveats and next steps for clinicians and patients.

> Let me first confirm the distinction, because conflating fatigue with sleepiness would mislead the conclusion. Sleepiness reflects an increased propensity to fall asleep, whereas fatigue is a sense of low energy or tiredness without increased sleep pressure, and both are common but not identical complaints in glucocorticoid-related states and sleep disorders more broadly [^114H4pVJ] [^116KYq2D].

> I will now examine whether there is a recognized glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that includes hypersomnolence. Yes, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is described in high-quality endocrine guidance and post-surgical cohorts of cured endogenous Cushing syndrome, and it includes fatigue, weakness, myalgias, sleep disturbances, and specifically hypersomnolence, with symptoms typically emerging days to weeks after dose reduction, supporting the plausibility of increased sleepiness during a prednisone taper [^113REYhV] [^1159BDJJ] [^111YTTML].

> Wait, let me verify whether the evidence emphasizes insomnia rather than sleepiness. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — during active supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy, insomnia and neuropsychiatric effects are indeed very common, but during withdrawal the balance can shift toward hypersomnolence and excessive sleepiness as part of the withdrawal phenotype, particularly as doses approach physiologic replacement levels and below, where both withdrawal symptoms and relative adrenal insufficiency may coexist [^111U9AtR] [^1153NSMq] [^111YTTML] [^114h7pGF].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology. Chronic exogenous glucocorticoids suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and during taper the axis attempts to recover with transiently rising ACTH, but the adrenal cortex may lag, creating a window of relative cortisol deficiency and pro-inflammatory rebound that can drive hypersomnolence and fatigue, with additional contributions from disrupted circadian cortisol rhythms that impair sleep–wake regulation and NREM/REM architecture [^1159BDJJ] [^113Eguj6] [^116KYq2D].

> I need to check how confident we can be in the clinical frequency. I should double-check the figures: in cohorts tapering after cure of endogenous Cushing syndrome, withdrawal symptoms including fatigue and sleep disturbances occurred in up to about 50%, and broader guidance notes withdrawal syndromes in roughly 40–67% of tapering patients in high-risk surgical cohorts, although exact prevalence in all prednisone-taper populations is less well quantified and likely lower than in post-adrenalectomy cohorts, so estimates should be applied cautiously outside that context [^113REYhV] [^1159BDJJ].

> Hold on, I should verify risk modifiers. The likelihood and severity of withdrawal symptoms including hypersomnolence rise with higher cumulative glucocorticoid exposure, longer duration, use of long-acting agents like dexamethasone, and rapid or aggressive tapers, and the risk of clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency increases notably when tapering below physiologic replacement thresholds, which can amplify fatigue and sleepiness, especially in sensitive individuals or those with comorbidities that further blunt recovery [^1171fF7m] [^112zPiSU] [^1119HRB1].

> Let me consider tapering and management implications. I should confirm best practices: guidelines advise slowing the taper as doses approach physiologic levels, consider temporary dose escalation if withdrawal symptoms are prominent, avoid late-day dosing to support circadian recovery, and use morning serum cortisol around physiologic doses to gauge HPA recovery. Symptom-guided strategies, individualized schedules, and patient education about expected withdrawal phenomena are emphasized, with many clinicians employing 1 mg decrements every 1–4 weeks near 5–10 mg prednisone equivalents while monitoring for overlapping adrenal insufficiency and disease flare [^111XXZCf] [^116V2dTx] [^113G6wSi] [^1119HRB1] [^114DSdhQ].

> But wait, what if increased sleepiness is actually primary adrenal insufficiency or disease flare? I should confirm differentiators: true adrenal insufficiency may show weight loss, hypotension or orthostasis, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia, whereas glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome typically occurs while the total daily dose remains supraphysiologic and often includes hypersomnolence rather than insomnia. Persistent or severe sleepiness merits reassessment of taper speed, consideration of a brief dose increase to the last tolerated level, and evaluation for concomitant contributors like sleep apnea, depression, anemia, or hypothyroidism, with morning cortisol or HPA testing as appropriate when tapering below physiologic ranges [^114h7pGF] [^113REYhV] [^111YTTML].

> Bottom line, I should synthesize: Yes, prednisone taper can cause increased sleepiness, most parsimoniously explained as part of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, which includes hypersomnolence and is well described during dose reductions after prolonged supraphysiologic exposure. Frequency varies with exposure and taper context, mechanistically relates to transient HPA dysfunction and circadian disruption, and management centers on slower taper, temporary dose adjustment, and monitoring for overlapping adrenal insufficiency and disease activity, with patient education to set expectations and prompt timely reassessment if sleepiness worsens [^111YTTML] [^113REYhV] [^116KYq2D] [^1119HRB1].

A prednisone taper can cause **increased sleepiness** through glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome [^113REYhV] [^1159BDJJ], which presents with fatigue, hypersomnolence, and mood changes as doses fall below physiologic levels [^111YTTML]. This sleepiness reflects **HPA axis suppression** and is distinct from adrenal insufficiency; it is most common when tapering below 7.5–10 mg/day or after prolonged high-dose therapy [^113REYhV] [^1159BDJJ]. Management includes slowing the taper, temporarily increasing to the last tolerated dose [^111XXZCf], and monitoring for adrenal insufficiency [^113REYhV] [^115YWoqk]; sleepiness typically improves with HPA recovery over weeks to months [^notfound].

## Mechanisms underlying increased sleepiness during prednisone taper

Several **interconnected mechanisms** contribute to sleepiness during prednisone taper:

- **Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS)**: Characterized by fatigue, hypersomnolence, mood changes, and myalgias [^111YTTML], GWS arises from dependence on supraphysiologic glucocorticoids and abrupt dose reductions [^113SGRav] [^1159BDJJ].

- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression**: Chronic prednisone suppresses the HPA axis [^112dAi4f]; tapering below physiologic levels can cause relative adrenal insufficiency, contributing to fatigue and sleepiness [^113JNJkX].

- **Circadian rhythm disruption**: Prednisone alters circadian cortisol rhythms; tapering can worsen sleep-wake disturbances, increasing daytime sleepiness [^111Ve9bU] [^111YTTML].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting increased sleepiness during prednisone taper

Clinical guidelines and studies document **sleepiness during prednisone taper**:

- **European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) guidelines**: GWS includes fatigue, hypersomnolence, and mood changes, occurring in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids after curative adrenalectomy for Cushing syndrome [^113REYhV] [^1159BDJJ].

- **Post-surgical studies**: Hypersomnolence is a hallmark of GWS after cure of endogenous Cushing syndrome, typically appearing 3–10 days postoperatively [^111YTTML].

- **Case reports**: Persistent fatigue and increased sleepiness have been documented during and after prednisone taper, reflecting prolonged HPA suppression [^115EH5nt].

## Factors influencing severity and occurrence of sleepiness

The likelihood and severity of **sleepiness during taper** vary with:

| **Factor** | **Influence on sleepiness** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration of prednisone therapy | Higher doses and longer durations increase risk of HPA suppression and withdrawal symptoms [^1171fF7m] [^1159BDJJ] |
| Rate of taper | Rapid tapers increase risk of withdrawal symptoms, including sleepiness [^112dAi4f] [^111YTTML] |
| Individual susceptibility | Genetic and physiological differences affect HPA recovery and withdrawal severity [^1163oa5D] [^1159BDJJ] |
| Underlying medical condition | Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases may exacerbate withdrawal symptoms during taper [^114h7pGF] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **individualized tapering** and monitoring:

- **Individualized tapering**: Adjust taper rate to patient response, slowing if withdrawal symptoms emerge [^113Eguj6] [^111XXZCf].

- **Temporary dose increase**: If GWS is severe, increase to the last tolerated dose and extend the taper [^113REYhV] [^111XXZCf].

- **Monitoring for adrenal insufficiency**: Assess clinically and biochemically when tapering below physiologic doses (4–6 mg prednisone) [^1171fF7m] [^115YWoqk].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Effective **management of sleepiness** during prednisone taper includes:

- **Slow, individualized taper**: Gradual dose reductions tailored to symptoms and HPA recovery [^114DSdhQ] [^111XXZCf].

- **Temporary dose increase**: Raise to the last tolerated dose if withdrawal symptoms are significant [^113REYhV] [^111XXZCf].

- **Monitoring and education**: Educate patients on withdrawal symptoms and monitor for adrenal insufficiency [^112de5Ha] [^1169c14X].

- **Supportive measures**: Address sleep hygiene, fatigue, and mood symptoms during taper [^116V2dTx].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Recovery of HPA function and resolution of sleepiness are **highly variable**; recovery may take weeks to months after taper completion [^115NiiPm]. Persistent sleepiness warrants evaluation for ongoing HPA suppression or other causes [^114H4pVJ].

---

Prednisone taper can cause **increased sleepiness**, primarily due to glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and HPA axis suppression [^111YTTML]. This sleepiness is common when tapering below physiologic doses or after prolonged high-dose therapy [^111YTTML]. Management includes individualized tapering, temporary dose increases, and monitoring for adrenal insufficiency, with recovery varying by patient and taper characteristics [^111XXZCf] [^115YWoqk].

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions — short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of < 3–4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

### Long-lasting behavioral changes following prednisone withdrawal… [^116G6pg9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Behavioral changes occurring during corticosteroid therapy are well recognized. 1–3 There have been few reports, however, of behavioral changes persisting well beyond the discontinuation of steroid treatment. 2–3 Freyberg et al3 described a corticosteroid "withdrawal syndrome" characterized by fatigue, anorexia, discouragement, and depression in approximately 21% of their patients with rheumatoid arthritis, subsiding after 2 to 8 weeks and possibly representing an emotional response to clinical relapse. Given what we now know about the direct effects of corticosteroids on the central nervous system, 4–6 it is possible that such withdrawal syndromes represent the sequelae of corticosteroid actions on the central nervous system. Because of the widespread use of corticosteroids, it is important to investigate such behavioral reactions.

We report here two cases of long-lasting behavioral disturbances that began during the tapering off of steroid medication, persisted for several weeks following steroid withdrawal, and were related.

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

### Corticosteroids for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [^113WbjiM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive or relapsing and remitting paralysing illness probably due to an autoimmune response which should benefit from corticosteroids. Non-randomised studies suggest that corticosteroids are beneficial. Two commonly used corticosteroids are prednisone and prednisolone. Both are usually given as oral tablets. Prednisone is converted into prednisolone in the liver so that the effect of the two drugs is usually the same. Another corticosteroid, called dexamethasone, is more potent and is used in smaller doses.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroid treatment compared to placebo or no treatment for CIDP and to compare the effects of different corticosteroid regimes.

Search Methods

On 27 October 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised trials of corticosteroids for CIDP. We searched three other databases for information to include in the Discussion, and clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials of treatment with any form of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone for CIDP, diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted the data and assessed risk of bias independently. The primary outcome was intended to be change in disability, with change in impairment after 12 weeks as a secondary outcome, and adverse events.

Main Results

In one non-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 35 eligible participants, the primary outcome for this review was not available. The trial had a high risk of bias. Twelve of 19 participants treated with prednisone, compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment, had improved neuropathy impairment scores after 12 weeks; the risk ratio (RR) for improvement was 2.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.52). Adverse events were not reported in detail, but one prednisone-treated participant died. In a double-blind RCT comparing daily standard-dose oral prednisolone with monthly high-dose oral dexamethasone in 40 participants, none of the outcomes for this review were available. The trial had a low risk of bias. There were no significant differences in remission (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45 in favour of monthly dexamethasone) or change in disability or impairment after one year. Eight of 16 in the prednisolone, and seven of 24 in the dexamethasone group deteriorated. Adverse events were similar with each regimen, except that sleeplessness and moon facies (moon-shaped appearance of the face) were significantly less common with monthly dexamethasone. Experience from large non-randomised studies suggests that corticosteroids are beneficial, but long-term use causes serious side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low quality evidence from one small, randomised trial did not show a statistically significant benefit from oral prednisone compared with no treatment. Nevertheless, corticosteroids are commonly used in practice. According to moderate quality evidence from one RCT, the efficacy of high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone was not statistically different from that of daily standard-dose oral prednisolone. Most adverse events occurred with similar frequencies in both groups, but sleeplessness and moon facies were significantly less common with monthly dexamethasone. Further research is needed to identify factors which predict response.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

### Tapering patients off of benzodiazepines… [^116kfy7z]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Case Scenario A 45-year-old woman with a history of anxiety and insomnia transferred to our clinic requesting alprazolam, which she had been taking for the past year. It was prescribed by another physician who had since retired, and she insisted that it was the only thing that helped her symptoms. Over the past several months, she had been taking more alprazolam during the day and at bedtime, because it had not been working as well as when initially prescribed. She was now taking 4 mg per day. The patient had been experiencing increased symptoms between doses, including anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, dysphoric moods, and a slight tremor. She requested a refill at the new higher dosage of 4 mg per day to help manage these "new" symptoms. We had concerns about prescribing such a high dosage, but we did not know how to respond. How should we counsel this patient, and what are some evidence-based strategies for tapering her down and off of the benzodiazepine.

Commentary When prescribed at a low dosage for a short time, benzodiazepines can effectively treat generalized and social anxiety, panic disorder, and sleep disorders 1, 2 Long-term use for anxiety and sleep disorders is not supported by research because it is associated with the development of physiologic and psychological dependence characterized by tolerance, withdrawal, and reluctance to reduce or discontinue use despite the objective lack of effectiveness. 1–3. Supratherapeutic doses can initially be reduced by 25% to 30%, then further reduced by 5% to 10% daily, weekly, or monthly as appropriate, based on how well the patient tolerates withdrawal symptoms during the taper. Addition of an anticonvulsant should be considered for high-dosage withdrawal.

BOTTOM LINE The best way to prevent benzodiazepine dependence for high-risk patients is to adhere to treatment recommendations and emphasize nonpharmacologic therapies for anxiety and insomnia. 6, 9 If benzodiazepines are used, they should be prescribed for short-term, intermittent use, intermittent brief courses, or occasional doses to limit the potential for new, long-term users. 9, 10.

Rationale

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome occurs due to dependence on supraphysiologic glucocorticoids while decreasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Patients should be informed that glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms are expected to occur during the glucocorticoid dose reduction and what the differences are between glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and underlying disease flare. It should be emphasized that an insufficient glucocorticoid supply is not expected to occur when the glucocorticoid dose is greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent. As exceptions, it should be noted that the glucocorticoid requirement may be significantly higher in the case of critical illness or that glucocorticoid absorption is not guaranteed in gastroenteritis. Many of the symptoms of the withdrawal syndrome are nonspecific and overlap with symptoms of the underlying disease, especially in inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders. Managing glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and glucocorticoid taper in these patients may be especially challenging. Patients should be educated on symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal to avoid anxiety related to unexpected symptoms or reactive, unnecessary, or excessive increase in glucocorticoids.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome. Duration of exogenous glucocorticoid use, glucocorticoid dose and type, and individual susceptibility likely impact the severity and duration of glucocorticoid withdrawal, but systematic studies are lacking. In a recent study investigating glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome in patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. Symptoms are thought to occur due to an abrupt decrease in glucocorticoid exposure leading to an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome overlap with those seen in patients with untreated or not optimally treated adrenal insufficiency (Table 5), and most patients with glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome do have concomitant adrenal insufficiency. Since symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal significantly overlap, good clinical guidance to differentiate between those is to consider the total daily dose of glucocorticoids with high doses making adrenal insufficiency less likely. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

Adrenal crisis — precipitating factors include, common to all patients with adrenal insufficiency, infections, acute illness including fever, physical trauma, surgery or other procedures requiring anesthesia, bowel procedures requiring laxatives or enema, labor and delivery, dental procedures, severe stress and pain including severe anxiety and bereavement, and strenuous exercise; factors specific to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency include abrupt glucocorticoid withdrawal during long-term treatment, tapering below physiological replacement doses, switching inhaled glucocorticoid types or doses leading to variability in systemic absorption, and initiation of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers that increase liver metabolism of several glucocorticoids.

### New guidelines on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency: the end of short synacthen test in rheumatology? [^1163oa5D]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolonged administration of GCs at supraphysiological levels suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by corticotropic cells in the anterior pituitary, ultimately leading to adrenal cortex atrophy. Incomplete recovery of the HPA axis following GC discontinuation may result in adrenal insufficiency associated with severe clinical outcomes, such as adrenal crisis and increased mortality. Therefore, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion in patients at risk of GIAI to facilitate rapid diagnosis and appropriate management. Assessing this risk is particularly challenging due to significant interindividual variation in HPA axis recovery after GC tapering or withdrawal. Key risk factors to consider include GC potency, route of administration, dose, duration of treatment and patient age. Genetic polymorphisms also play a role, although to a lesser extent, as they are not routinely assessed in clinical practice.

### Glucocorticoids for therapeutic immunosuppression: clinical pearls for the practicing neurologist [^113nU8Uz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Given widespread use of glucocorticoid therapy in neurologic disease, understanding glucocorticoid pharmacology and risk is paramount for the practicing neurologist. While dosing and tapering regimens vary depending on the neurological disease and indication being treated, there are important general principles of glucocorticoid prescribing and monitoring that can guide clinical decision-making. Glucocorticoid-related toxicities can occur across multiple organ systems, including hypertension; dyslipidemia; weight gain; hyperglycemia; osteoporosis and avascular necrosis; myopathy; gastrointestinal bleeding; infection; and neuropsychiatric effects with sleep, mood disturbance and cognition. This narrative review provides a practical framework for safe and responsible prescribing of this therapeutic class of medications, including appreciation of immunosuppressive consequences, risk mitigation strategies, dosing and tapering, and recognition of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically (Table 1).

Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even in physiologic daily dose equivalent, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible in the setting of continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime, when they can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend changing to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids, eg, inhaled steroids, in whom there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids or no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements, thus potentially enabling HPA axis to recover. For replacement of adrenal insufficiency, prednisone is usually provided as single morning dose, whereas due to shorter half-life hydrocortisone and cortisone acetate are divided into 2–3 doses with higher doses given in the morning and subsequent doses given at lunch and late afternoon if applicable.

### The short-term impact of methylprednisolone on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^115F8C8N]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

To summarize, few studies have examined the impact of standardized doses of corticosteroids on sleep by a longitudinal randomized controlled design in patients with advanced cancer. Given the high prevalence of both sleep disturbances and corticosteroid use in patients with advanced cancer, it is essential to know whether corticosteroids aggravate sleep in these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate patient-reported sleep, a predefined secondary outcome in the randomized Corticosteroids for Cancer Pain Trial (NCT00676936).

Regarding medical management for medication overuse headache, more specifically with respect to management of withdrawal symptoms, EFNS 2011 guidelines recommend to consider offering corticosteroids (at least 60 mg prednisone or prednisolone) and amitriptyline (up to 50 mg) for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117KMpCy]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — steroids for new-onset facial weakness improved complete recovery in randomized trials. Both studies enrolled patients within 3 days of the onset of facial weakness, used prednisone regimens of 60 mg/d for 5 days followed by a 5-day taper or 25 mg BID for 10 days, and employed masked outcome assessment with high follow-up. The 2 Class I studies demonstrated a significant increase in the probability of complete recovery in patients randomized to steroids (RD favoring steroids 12.8% and 15%), translating to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6 to 8, and it is highly likely that steroids are effective in increasing the probability of complete facial recovery. Adverse events (AEs) from steroids were generally minor and temporary, with insomnia and dyspepsia most commonly reported.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^116BYTxr]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

### Approach to the patient: diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults [^112o6UK9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 6 did not have autoantibodies, but an autoimmune cause was suspected as it is the most frequent form and some autoantibody positive cases turn negative over time. He was transferred to another hospital after a few years, and the fact that autoantibodies were absent at diagnosis was forgotten. Despite replacement therapy he experienced severe fatigue, sleepiness, and reduced energy, and his general health seemed to deteriorate over the years despite much effort to improve replacement therapy. He was adamant in withholding the high glucocorticoid replacement doses although they did not seem to increase his energy level. However, when he 10 years later developed grip changes and bradycardia, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed a picture typical of Steinert's disease, a form of dystrophia myotonica. He also had frontal balding, which is a typical feature. Sanger sequencing revealed a mutation in the DMPK gene, confirming the diagnosis. Dystrophia myotonica is caused by the expansion of repeated units of nucleotides in DMPK. Over 50 repeats are diagnostic, and our patient had 109. Typically, the symptom burden increases with the number of repeats. Type 2 dystrophia myotonica, which typically presents in adulthood, has less severe and more easily overlooked symptoms. However, type 2 can progress with increased disability, and there is a risk of serious complications including cardiac conduction disease. Case 6 illustrates several important clinical aspects. First, although the patient is diagnosed with a rare disease with subtle and common symptoms (PAI), all symptoms do not necessarily relate to adrenal insufficiency. Second, increasing the glucocorticoid replacement dose is not always the solution, even if the patient feels somewhat better. Luckily, despite using cortisone doses of 100 mg per day, he never developed Cushingoid side-effects. Third, confirming an etiological diagnosis both will increase understanding of the patient's symptoms and could provide alternative treatment options.

Corticotropin Test and Cortisol Measurements

The participants attended a screening visit at any time during the daytime, where an SST was performed. The participant rested 15 minutes in a seated position before a basal blood sample was drawn. Subsequently, 1 mL Synacthen (0.25 mg/ml, CD Pharma) was injected followed by a second blood sample after exactly 30 minutes. Serum/plasma cortisol was measured by LC-MS/MS (148 patients) or immunoassay (Roche Elecsys Cortisol II) (119 patients). The Roche assay displays a high agreement with LC-MS/MS with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. We defined AI as a stimulated 30-minute plasma cortisol less than 420 nmol/L (to convert to micrograms per liter, divide by 27.588).

Questionnaires

Participants completed electronic versions of the following questionnaires: AddiQoL-30, CushingQoL, and Single Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS). AddiQoL-30 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated for patients with primary AI. The 30 items focus on common symptoms of AI with response categories on a scale from 1 (none of the time/strongly disagree) to 6 (all of the time/strongly agree). Each item yields a score between 1 to 4 arbitrary units, with higher scores indicative of higher QoL, which adds up to a total score ranging from 30 to 120. The items cover 4 dimensions: fatigue, symptoms, emotions, and miscellaneous. We defined clinically significant symptoms of AI as an AddiQoL-30 score of 85 or lower since the mean score in patients with endogenous AI is 85, whereas a healthy random population sample exhibited a mean score of 97 (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). We subdivided our population into 2 groups according to AddiQoL-30 scores: 85 or lower (symptomatic group) and above 85 (asymptomatic group).

CushingQoL is a disease-specific questionnaire devised for patients with endogenous cortisol excess. The 12 items cover mental and physical adverse effects of GC excess, and scoring is normalized to a scale from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicating poor QoL. SQS is a single item questionnaire validated against more exhaustive instruments consisting of a 10-point numerical rating scale reflecting the overall sleep quality over the last 7 nights.

### The short-term impact of methylprednisolone on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^113Sj9Ec]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with advanced cancer often report poor sleep quality with a prevalence that varies from 40 to 96% across studies. The cancer disease and the cancer treatments are factors that probably contribute to sleep disturbances. Treatment with corticosteroids may be a precipitating factor involved in the development of insomnia in patients with cancer. Corticosteroids are associated with a variety of adverse effects in which sleep disturbance is one of the short-term effects. These drugs are frequently administered to patients with advanced cancer, but usage varies between countries. For instance, a cross-sectional study of European cancer patients using opioids showed that 34% in Germany, 49% in Norway, and 72% of patients in Italy were using corticosteroids. The indications for corticosteroid use in patients with advanced cancer are wide, including alleviation of distressing symptoms such as pain, anorexia, fatigue, and dyspnea as well as improving quality of life and sense of well-being. Some patients also use corticosteroids as a part of anti-cancer therapy or for other medical conditions.

Few studies have examined the impact of corticosteroids on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer. Mercadante et al. demonstrated an inverse relation between the use of corticosteroids and sleep assessed by the Athens Insomnia Scale in patients with advanced cancer. However, due to the cross-sectional design, causality between corticosteroids and sleep quality could not be assessed. Second, in a prospective survey on the use of dexamethasone in in and outpatients with advanced malignant disease, Hardy et al. demonstrated that mild sleep disturbance was reported by 17% of the patients after start of corticosteroid treatment. In another study, Hatano et al. demonstrated that 19% of patients with advanced cancer experienced sleep disturbance 1 week after start of dexamethasone given for anorexia. In the latter study, sleep was rated by healthcare workers according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Likert scales. However, as sleep disturbance was not assessed by patient-reported outcome measures, it is likely underestimated. Furthermore, none of these studies used standardized doses of corticosteroids nor did they include a control group. Finally, Yennurajalingam et al. performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the use of dexamethasone 4 mg orally twice daily for 14 days for cancer-related fatigue in patients with advanced cancer. They found no difference in sleep using a numeric scale (NRS), (0, no symptoms; 10, worst possible severity) between dexamethasone and placebo at day 15.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113Eguj6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^111dxzGD]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There are little data to support a specific steroid tapering schedule. Based on consensus, once the patient responds, the steroids should be weaned to an average daily dose of 1 mg/kg per day over 8–12 weeks. Reducing to an alternate day dosing schedule, often increasing the first day's dose while decreasing the second day's dose, can accomplish this. The dose should then be further tapered slowly to find the minimal maintenance dose necessary to keep the hemoglobin in the range of 80–100 g/l, the target level being determined by the individual patient's requirement to sustain growth and activity. The recommended maximum maintenance dose is ≤ 1 mg/kg every other day or ≤ 0.5 mg/kg daily. Steroids should be tapered more slowly, and with great care, below this level to reduce the risk of overshooting the minimal effective dose for that individual. If this occurs, the dose should be immediately increased to the previous level at which the hemoglobin was within target range. The hemoglobin should be monitored closely during this phase because a too rapid taper often necessitates the reinstitution of the initial 2 mg/kg per day dose to re-achieve response. If an acceptable hemoglobin cannot be sustained at the recommended dose, steroids should be tapered and discontinued. Some patients require very small doses for continued response.

### The efficacy, safety, and side effects of intrapericardial triamcinolone treatment in children with post-surgical pericardial effusion: a case series [^115EH5nt]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient 1

A 10-year-old girl with multiple congenital dysmorphisms and a spontaneously closed ventricular septal defect underwent surgical ASD closure. PE developed 1 month later and prednisone was started. In a period of 9 months prednisone was unsuccessfully tapered 4 times. Two months after prednisone initiation a Cushingoid face developed and after 5 months she developed fatigue (low energy levels, early bedtimes, and missing school). Additional treatment consisted of pericardiocentesis IVIG (twice) and colchicine, all without success. After 9 months of persisting PE pericardiocentesis was performed with administration of 420 mg triamcinolone and 80 mg gentamycin (sclerotherapy). Three days after triamcinolone administration, the morning cortisol concentration was < 0.02 µmol/L. Thereafter PE did not reoccur. However she developed extreme fatigue. Hydrocortisone supplementation (12 mg/m2) was added for 8 months because of those signs and symptoms. Five months after hydrocortisone initiation a small improvement in fitness was seen, but it took one year and 9 months (after triamcinolone administration) until the ACTH-test normalized.

Patient 2

An 11-year-old boy underwent epicardial pacemaker implantation for paroxysmal atrioventricular block. PE occurred 1 week later and prednisone was started. Because of progressive PE and echocardiographic signs of tamponade pericardiocentesis was performed. Two attempts were made to taper prednisone without success. Two months after the start of prednisone a Cushingoid face developed. After 2.5 months a second pericardiocentesis was performed with administration of 420 mg triamcinolone. On the same day colchicine was started and prednisone was continued. There has been no recurrence of PE after the triamcinolone administration. One week after triamcinolone administration he developed symptoms of fatigue, expressed by being easily tired, irritable, and bad-tempered. Prednisone and colchicine were tapered within 2 and 3.5 months, respectively. Because of fatigue symptoms, expressed by low energy levels, missing school, and not having fun, prednisone was restarted 9 months later and the dose increased considerably in the following months. His listless feeling and increased need of sleep persisted despite a "physiologic" morning dose of prednisone. No other explanation for the fatigue could be established. Symptoms persist to date and ACTH-tests remain inadequate.

### The short-term impact of methylprednisolone on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^117Csd1Z]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although corticosteroids are frequently used in patients with advanced cancer, few studies have examined the impact of these drugs on patient-reported sleep. We aimed to examine the short-term impact of methylprednisolone on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

Patient-reported sleep was a predefined secondary outcome in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that evaluated the analgesic efficacy of corticosteroids in advanced cancer patients (18+), using opioids, and having pain ≥ 4 past 24 h (NRS 0–10). Patients were randomized to the methylprednisolone group with methylprednisolone 16 mg ×2/day or placebo for 7 days. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (0–100) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI) (0–21) were used to assess the impact of corticosteroids on sleep at baseline and at day 7.

Results

Fifty patients were randomized of which 25 were analyzed in the intervention group and 22 in the control group. Mean age was 64 years, mean Karnofsky performance status was 67 (SD 13.3), 51% were female, and the mean oral daily morphine equivalent dose was 223 mg (SD 222.77). Mean QLQ-C30 sleep score at baseline was 29.0 (SD 36.7) in the methylprednisolone group and 24.2 (SD 27.6) in the placebo group. At day 7, there was no difference between the groups on QLQ-C30 sleep score (methylprednisolone 20.3 (SD 32.9); placebo 28.8 (SD 33.0), p = 0.173). PSQI showed similar results.

Conclusions

Methylprednisolone 16 mg twice daily for 7 days had no impact on patient-reported sleep in this cohort of patients with advanced cancer.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^116KYq2D]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Because of its lipophilic nature, cortisol readily penetrates the blood brain barrier and exerts numerous effects, in particular on sleep regulation. Conditions of hypercortisolism, whether due to a pathology or due to exogenous administration, are therefore associated with sleep disturbances. In Cushing's syndrome, deep NREM sleep is reduced, but interestingly, in patients with pituitary-dependent disease, adrenal secretory activity is still initiated predominantly during NREM sleep, suggesting the persistence of a link between pulsatile cortisol release and the ultradian NREM-REM cycle. Exogenous GCs, both natural and synthetic, taken near bedtime inhibit REM sleep. Hydrocortisone appears to stimulate slowwave sleep, whereas synthetic GCs such as dexamethasone inhibit slow-wave sleep.

Sleepiness is a condition where there is increased pressure to sleep and sleep will be easily initiated when an opportunity presents. In contrast, fatigue describes a condition of tiredness, exhaustion, and/or low energy but without increased pressure to sleep. Chronic fatigue syndrome is often associated with alterations in HPA axis activity such as mild hypocortisolism, attenuated amplitude of cortisol rhythm, enhanced negative feedback to the HPA axis, and blunted HPA axis responsiveness. A similar constellation of alterations of GC regulation may be seen in PTSD. In fibromyalgia, one study observed a slower decline of cortisol levels across the daytime period, with elevated concentrations, but another report found no evidence for disturbances of the 24-hour GC profile. All these conditions frequently include sleep disturbances, but there is no evidence for alterations in central pacemaker function. Whether eliminating or reducing the sleep disturbances could reduce the severity of the other neuropsychiatric and somatic symptoms is still an open question.

### Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome following treatment of endogenous Cushing syndrome [^111YTTML]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation and Pathogenesis of GWS

GWS occurs following withdrawal of supraphysiologic exposure to either exogenous or endogenous glucocorticoids of at least several months duration. After surgical cure of endogenous CS, GWS is usually characterized by biochemical evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with many signs and symptoms consistent with cortisol deficiency despite the use of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid replacement therapy. The degree of physical or psychologic glucocorticoid dependence experienced by patients may not correlate with the degree of HPA axis suppression.

GWS symptom onset is typically 3–10 days postoperatively, often after the patient has been discharged from the hospital. The first symptoms of GWS vary but usually consist of myalgias, muscle weakness, fatigue, and hypersomnolence. Anorexia, nausea, and abdominal discomfort are common, but vomiting should raise concern for hyponatremia, cerebrospinal fluid leak, hydrocephalus, or other perioperative complications. Mood changes develop more gradually and range from mood swings to depression, and the fatigue with myalgias can exacerbate mood changes. An atypical depressive disorder has been described in many patients after CD surgery. Weight loss should ensue in most patients but gradually and proportionate to the reduction in glucocorticoid exposure. It is important to complete a thorough symptom review and physical exam at postoperative visits, as the differentiation between GWS and bona fide AI – and even between GWS and recurrence of CS – can be challenging (Fig. 1). All three conditions are associated with symptoms of myalgias, weakness, and fatigue; however, rapid weight loss, hypoglycemia, and hypotension are suggestive of AI and the need for an increase in the glucocorticoid dose. In parallel, hypersomnia is more suggestive of GWS, while insomnia is more associated with recurrence of CS. Given the anticipation of GWS onset shortly after discharge and the potential for hyponatremia during this time, a widely employed strategy is a generous glucocorticoid dose for the first 2–3 weeks, at least until the first postoperative outpatient visit (Table 1).

### Glucocorticoid withdrawal schemes in chronic medical disorders. A systematic review [^114w1U6T]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This systematic review highlights the uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of glucocorticoid withdrawal in many chronic diseases, elucidating the need for further research in this area. The problem of glucocorticoid withdrawal seems to be good example for wide variation in physicians' approaches to weaning patients off glucocorticoids. This practice variation appears justified, given the well known extraordinary array of individual reactions to systemic glucocorticoid therapy [44], the obligation to individualize treatment, and scientific uncertainty. Moreover, only sparse information concerning health-related quality of life, well-being and symptoms, and socioeconomic sequelae after glucocorticoid withdrawal is available from published randomized trials. In conclusion, clinicians and patients need many more — and in a number of conditions, initial — high quality studies to assess the safety and efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid withdrawal schedules in chronic diseases.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

### Treatment of medication overuse headache – guideline of the EFNS headache panel [^1179GUpd]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Medication overuse headache is a common condition with a population-based prevalence of more than 1–2%. Treatment is based on education, withdrawal treatment (detoxification), and prophylactic treatment. It also includes management of withdrawal headache.

Aims

This guideline aims to give treatment recommendations for this headache.

Materials and Methods

Evaluation of the scientific literature.

Results

Abrupt withdrawal or tapering down of overused medication is recommended, the type of withdrawal therapy is probably not relevant for the outcome of the patient. However, inpatient withdrawal therapy is recommended for patients overusing opioids, benzodiazepine, or barbiturates. It is further recommended to start individualized prophylactic drug treatment at the first day of withdrawal therapy or even before. The only drug with moderate evidence for the prophylactic treatment in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse is topiramate up to 200mg. Corticosteroids (at least 60mg prednisone or prednisolone) and amitriptyline (up to 50mg) are possibly effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Patients after withdrawal therapy should be followed up regularly to prevent relapse of medication overuse.

Discussion and Conclusion

Medication overuse headache can be treated according to evidence-based recommendations.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with concomitant psychiatric disorder, AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor sleep closely during benzodiazepine tapering in patients with mood or psychotic disorders, particularly for patients with bipolar disorder, as sleep disturbance can trigger episodes of mania. Pause the taper if patients with a mood and/or psychotic disorder experience significant sleep disturbance, until the symptoms resolve due to the risk of destabilization.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

Subacute Care: The GWS and HPA Axis Recovery

When managing GWS symptoms, it is important to repeatedly emphasize to the patient that not only are GWS symptoms to be expected, but in fact these manifestations portend a favorable prognosis of sustained remission from CS. The most important treatment intervention is frequent reassurance to the patient that GWS typically resolves as the HPA axis recovers. Family members must be included in the conversation to help provide as much support as possible, as patients report that support from family and friends is the most helpful coping mechanism during the recovery process. When appropriate, it may be necessary to provide the patient with temporary disability documentation, since GWS symptoms may be so severe to preclude gainful employment. The patient must know that the myalgias reflect the body's attempts to repair the muscle damage, similar to the soreness experienced the day after resistance weight training, and these aches will eventually subside. Due to the challenges of differentiating between GWS and AI, a higher glucocorticoid dose can be briefly trialed to assess if this increased glucocorticoid exposure improves symptoms, but late-day dosing should be avoided to support recovery of the circadian rhythm. In parallel, the patient should be encouraged to adequately rest, particularly going to sleep early but limiting daytime sleep to short naps.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods to taper the dose, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose (Table 2). In the vast majority of cases, glucocorticoid taper does not cause any clinical endocrine concerns. In rare cases, however, when long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy has resulted in prolonged suppression of HPA axis (greater than 1 year), or when patients experience adrenal crises, referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered (see recommendation 2.11). However, it should be recognized that endocrinology providers have no specialized diagnostic approaches or therapies to facilitate unique care of glucocorticoid tapering. In this regard, the education and approach to stopping glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical process that every clinician who prescribes glucocorticoids should be familiar with.

R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

### Deflazacort [^113SGRav]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as deflazacort, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving deflazacort for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after deflazacort withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to consider switching long-acting corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting corticosteroids are no longer needed.

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and… [^115htuN9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses have suggested that corticosteroids may have a small benefit for acute cough and sore throat, but they included studies that were small or had a high risk of bias. 3, 4 The best evidence comes from several well-designed and adequately powered randomized trials. In the first, 565 children in the United Kingdom with mild to moderate sore throat were randomized to oral dexamethasone, 10 mg, or placebo. 5 The only benefit was a small reduction in symptoms at two days, but no improvements at other times or for other outcomes. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction.

This was true even for patients with wheezing on initial presentation. Regarding back pain, a study randomized 269 adults with sciatica to a 15-day course of prednisone, 60 mg once daily tapering to 20 mg once daily, or placebo, and found no reduction in pain, function, or other outcomes. 7 However, adverse effects such as insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite were more common in the prednisone group. Thus, the best evidence to date does not support a significant benefit for corticosteroids in patients with cough, sore throat, or back pain. However, there may be harms. A recent study identified 1. 5 million U. S. adults who had been continuously enrolled in a health insurance plan for two years. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone.

The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies. Patients receiving an oral corticosteroid in the previous year and those receiving an inhaled or intranasal corticosteroid were excluded, as were organ transplant recipients and patients with malignancies. The researchers found a clinically and statistically significant increase in the risk of serious complications during the five to 30 days after the corticosteroid was prescribed; this risk declined over the subsequent two months.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as EMFLAZA, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving EMFLAZA for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after EMFLAZA withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

Abstract

Hypersomnolence is one of the more common symptoms reported after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and often one of the most difficult to treat. This case series presents a cohort of patients with TBI related hypersomnolence associated with a de novo autoimmune process that successfully resolved with pulse dose corticosteroid treatment. When associated with an autoimmune inflammatory process, corticosteroids may serve to stabilize the blood brain barrier leading to the successful and sustained resolution of TBI induced sleepiness.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering", and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy". One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps", whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated". Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)". During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency", and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented".

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — additional preventive pharmacologic agents: Cromolyn sodium can reduce abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and cramps; benefit might extend to neuropsychiatric manifestations, and divided dosing with weekly upward titration might improve tolerance and adherence. Doxepin, a potent H1 + H2 antihistamine with tricyclic antidepressant activity, might reduce central nervous system manifestations in patients with MCAS or SM but might cause drowsiness and cognitive decline and might increase suicidal tendencies in children and young adults with depression. Aspirin might reduce flushing and hypotension in some patients but is contraindicated in those with allergic or adverse reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and clinical improvement might require a dosing increase up to 650 mg twice daily. For refractory signs or symptoms, a steroid taper/steroid burst might be useful at an initial oral dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/day, followed by a slow taper over 1 to 3 months, and it might be helpful to give 50 mg of prednisone 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before radiologic or invasive procedures when MC activation has been problematic.

### A retrospective study on weaning glucocorticoids and recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [^115PQUxd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are frequently used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and malignancies. It is estimated that 1% to 3% of the general population is taking systemic glucocorticoids, and in some countries the prevalence could be even higher due to inappropriate use. Adrenal insufficiency (AI), or more appropriately adrenal suppression, may result from the use of exogenous glucocorticoids, and a metanalysis has estimated that up to 50% of patients on oral steroids are at risk of adrenal suppression. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur when glucocorticoids are administered at doses of > 5 mg per day of prednisolone or equivalent glucocorticoid dose for 4 weeks or longer. Tertiary AI can occur with glucocorticoid administration via any route of administration and the risk rises with increasing cumulative dosage and longer duration of treatment.

Glucocorticoids cause a wide range of adverse effects when taken at supraphysiological doses. For this reason, anti-inflammatory doses of glucocorticoids are tapered down as soon as possible after disease control is achieved. Once the glucocorticoid dose is weaned down to a physiological replacement dose, it is helpful to assess for HPA axis suppression. This can be done clinically, without hormone measurement; however, formal biochemical assessment can be undertaken by measuring a morning serum cortisol before glucocorticoid administration. If the result indicates possible adrenal suppression, this is then followed by the 250-µg adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (AST), also known as the short Synacthen test. Recently, waking salivary cortisone has shown promise to be a useful adjunct in assessment of adrenal function and also has the advantage of being carried out at home.

### First-line treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis with prednisone or methotrexate [^1152nAF6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Prednisone is currently recommended as the first-line treatment for pulmonary sarcoidosis but is associated with many side effects. Methotrexate, which is recommended as a second-line treatment, appears to have fewer side effects than prednisone but a slower onset of action. Data are needed on the efficacy and side-effect profile of methotrexate as compared with prednisone as first-line treatment for pulmonary sarcoidosis.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial involving patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis who had not previously received treatment, we randomly assigned patients, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive prednisone or methotrexate according to a prespecified treatment schedule. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline to week 24 in the percentage of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), as estimated with the use of mixed models for repeated measures. The noninferiority margin for the primary end point was 5 percentage points.

Results

Of the 138 patients who underwent randomization, 70 were assigned to receive prednisone and 68 to receive methotrexate. The unadjusted mean change from baseline to week 24 in the percentage of the predicted FVC was 6.75 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.50 to 8.99) in the prednisone group and 6.11 percentage points (95% CI, 3.72 to 8.50) in the methotrexate group. Methotrexate was noninferior to prednisone with regard to the primary end point, with an adjusted between-group difference of -1.17 percentage points (95% CI, -4.27 to 1.93). Adverse events occurred in a similar percentage of patients in the two trial groups. Weight gain, insomnia, and increased appetite were the most common adverse events with prednisone, and nausea, fatigue, and any abnormal liver-function test were among the most common adverse events with methotrexate.

Conclusions

In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, initial treatment with methotrexate was noninferior to that with prednisone with regard to the change from baseline to week 24 in the percentage of the predicted FVC. Differences in the side-effect profile between methotrexate and prednisone may inform shared decision making by providers and patients about the appropriate treatment approach.

### Cancer-related fatigue in children during treatment: a 5-year cohort study of daily patient-reported outcomes with clinical implications [^113BvZiJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

AML trajectories showed a distinct pattern, with peak fatigue (59.1; 95% CI: 35.7, 82.5) during initial induction followed by progressive improvement in subsequent cycles. Cancer-related fatigue resolution aligned closely with shorter induction/consolidation phases in later phases (Δ +27.8, 95% CI: −3.6, 59.3), stabilizing post-induction. Similarly, NHL regimens demonstrated stable cancer-related fatigue profiles with minimal fluctuation, likely attributable to limited cumulative steroid dosing.

In contrast, HD patients experienced low cancer-related fatigue burden (82.8; 95% CI: 75.6, 90.0) following induction, persisting throughout treatment despite protocol-specified steroid tapering (Figure S4).

Sensitivity analyses imputing missing cancer-related fatigue scores using three different approaches (assigning all missing values score of 87 5, sampling from each patient's observed values, or sampling plus an additional 12 5) showed trajectories that were visually similar to the primary analysis (Figure S5).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

### Prednisone for the treatment of withdrawal headache in patients with medication overuse headache: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1127PKkS]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the efficacy of prednisone for treatment of withdrawal headache in patients with medication overuse headache (MOH).

Patients and Methods

In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel designed multicentre trial, 96 consecutive patients with MOH were randomized to withdrawal treatment with either 100 mg prednisone or placebo over 5 days. Patients were enrolled if they met the International Headache Society criteria for MOH and were diagnosed with migraine or episodic tension-type headache as primary headache. Exclusion criteria comprised significant neurological or psychiatric disorders. Withdrawal symptoms, including headache severity and intake of rescue medication, were documented for 14 days after randomization.

Results

Patients treated with prednisone did not experience fewer hours of moderate or severe headache than patients receiving placebo. However, patients requested less rescue medication within the first 5 days.

Conclusions

During withdrawal in MOH, prednisone reduces rescue medication without decreasing the severity and duration of withdrawal headache.

Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome — this table contrasts overlapping presentations: glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome includes general malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and mood change, with signs such as Cushingoid features common, especially earlier in the glucocorticoid taper; adrenal insufficiency shows signs including weight loss, hypotension, and orthostasis, and the risk of adrenal crisis is present if not optimally treated with glucocorticoid therapy; timing differs, with withdrawal symptoms occurring at any point during glucocorticoid taper and with higher risk after long-term supraphysiologic exposure, whereas adrenal insufficiency appears only when not treated with optimal glucocorticoid therapy; biochemistry in withdrawal shows normal electrolytes with possible glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, while adrenal insufficiency shows hyponatremia and hypoglycemia; HPA axis testing is not recommended in withdrawal, and in adrenal insufficiency there are initially low ACTH and cortisol with later normal-elevated ACTH and low cortisol; general remarks note that patients may be asymptomatic at baseline but can develop symptoms — from mild to life-threatening adrenal crisis — after triggers, and recurrence of underlying autoimmune diseases can occur during tapering, with symptom overlap between adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation comparative effectiveness — initial high-dose intravenous corticosteroids versus low-dose oral corticosteroids — is illustrated across efficacy, effectiveness, and observational designs with explicit eligibility, dosing, timing, and outcomes. Efficacy trial eligibility required Age > 50 yr, 20 pack-years or more smoked, and FEV1 < 50% of predicted. The efficacy oral intervention was initiated within 6 h of presentation with 40 mg/d x 10 d, while the intravenous comparator was initiated within 6 h using methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d. The efficacy primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 d of discharge. Effectiveness trial protocols initiated oral corticosteroids within 24 h of hospital admission at 40 mg/d x 10 d and intravenous corticosteroids within 24 h with methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d; patient-centered outcomes included return to baseline level of functional health, hospital length of stay, and readmission or death within 30 d. Observational definitions used ICD-9 discharge codes with Age > 50 yr and no exclusions; oral exposure was prednisone via mouth at least 40 mg/d for 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission, and intravenous exposure was methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h for at least 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission.

### Algorithm development for corticosteroid management in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial using consensus methodology [^112bXg4s]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Consensus criteria for tapering corticosteroids

At each RAPPORT study visit, the protocol requires the investigator to determine if the subject meets criteria for tapering corticosteroids (if applicable). The criteria identified by each nominal group were different. Therefore, all criteria were re-evaluated by the entire group even in areas of consensus to develop a single algorithm for corticosteroid taper. Consensus was facilitated by in-depth discussion of the performance and implications of the randomized placebo phase study design (led by BF), and how overly aggressive corticosteroid taper might be unsafe and result in disease flares, introducing an important confounder and impact study results. On the other hand, if the corticosteroid taper was too slow, it would result in higher corticosteroid doses than necessary and mask differences in response between the two study arms. The laboratory and clinical criteria required for corticosteroid taper in this trial as determined by consensus of the entire panel at the face-to-face meeting are shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Clinical and laboratory criteria for corticosteroid taper

*As determined by investigator (for example, non-ambulatory, not attending school, anorectic, losing weight).

LLN lower limit of normal; N/A not applicable.

Additionally, the panel decided that three options (taper, increase, or maintain steroid dose) would optimize retention of subjects in the study rather than forcing a taper under potentially unsafe clinical conditions that might lead to disease flare requiring an increase in corticosteroids. The inclusion of a global assessment of physical functioning by the investigator was identified as an important safety check, reflecting the clinical judgment of the physician caring for the patient. However, the following isolated clinical and laboratory features were deemed not useful in determining taper, including weight change, rash, fatigue, anorexia, fever, white blood count, hypoalbuminemia, hemoglobin level, platelet count, ESR or CRP. In addition, 85% of respondents agreed complete resolution of pericarditis, myocarditis, pleural effusion and/or pneumonitis documented by imaging was not required before tapering corticosteroids. The rate of taper determined by consensus was 10% of the current daily dose every two weeks. The expert panel delegated the decision on how to manage the corticosteroid taper to the PIs (NI, CS).

In summary, the consensus conference developed three options regarding corticosteroid dosing during the efficacy phase of RAPPORT (see Figure 1 and 2).

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

### The use and toxicity of steroids in the management of patients with brain metastases [^113CdL2U]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

To document the use of steroids and frequency of their side effects in patients with brain metastases.

Patients and Methods

A survey of oncologists who manage patients with brain metastases was conducted to document steroid prescribing practice in our institution. In addition, a retrospective chart review of 88 patients treated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), identified through the Palliative Radiation Oncology Program database, was conducted for a 6-month period to documents steroid doses prescribed, tapering schedules, and steroid side effects.

Results

Ninety percent of physicians responded to the survey. Forty-five percent routinely used dexamethasone 4 mg qid (16 mg/day). The others determined the dose of steroid according to the presence or absence of neurological symptoms. Sixty percent tapered the patient's steroids over the 4 weeks following completion of WBRT. The most common side effects noted by physicians were: increased appetite or weight gain (46%), insomnia (24%), gastro-intestinal symptoms (20%). In the retrospective study, dexamethasone 4 mg qid was prescribed to 52% patients prior and during WBRT. Sixty-six percent of patients were instructed to taper dexamethasone after WBRT, but details were not provided. The most frequently documented steroid-related side effects were: increased appetite (32%), proximal muscle weakness (28%), and insomnia (21%).

Conclusions

There is considerable variation in the prescribing practices even within a single institution, with many patients receiving high dose of steroids for considerable periods of time and developing related side effects. Strategies to reduce the amount and length of steroids may result in improved therapeutic ratio; we are currently accruing onto such a trial.

### Recommended treatment strategies for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness [^113ohxyv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common and bothersome phenomenon. It can be associated with insufficient sleep syndrome, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, shift work disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, or Parkinson's disease. Once the underlying cause of the excessive sleepiness is determined, clinicians must select the most appropriate behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to reduce daytime sleepiness, alleviate other symptoms, improve functioning, and ensure the safety of patients and those around them. Patient history, adverse effects, and efficacy in specific conditions should be considered in pharmacologic treatment options for patients with EDS.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114tSANd]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid tapering and persistent adrenal insufficiency — patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment/exposure presenting with manifestations of Cushing syndrome should be assumed to have a fully suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and managed accordingly, and we suggest evaluation by an endocrinology specialist if there is no recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent and also for patients on glucocorticoids with a history of adrenal crisis. Adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after cessation, and persistent impairment beyond four years suggests recovery is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued, with additional testing beyond four years considered case-by-case. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone, and education is necessary on adjusting substitution doses during stressful situations to prevent or manage adrenal crises.

### Medications for daytime sleepiness in individuals with idiopathic hypersomnia [^116cZaPF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic hypersomnia is a disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness, often accompanied by long sleep times or pronounced difficulty in awakening, in the absence of a known cause. The optimal treatment strategy for idiopathic hypersomnia is currently unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of medications for daytime sleepiness and related symptoms in individuals with idiopathic hypersomnia and, in particular, whether medications may: 1. reduce subjective measures of sleepiness; 2. reduce objective measures of sleepiness; 3. reduce symptoms of cognitive dysfunction; 4. improve quality of life; and 5. be associated with adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 4 February 2021: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 1 February 2021), and reference lists of articles. CRS Web includes randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialized registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including the Cochrane Epilepsy Group. We previously searched the WHO ICTRP separately when loading of ICTRP records into CRS Web was temporarily suspended.

Selection Criteria

Randomized studies comparing any medication to placebo, another medication, or a behavioral intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional data. We collected data on adverse events from the included trials.

Main Results

We included three trials, with a total of 112 participants. Risk of bias was low for the included studies. Two pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials compared modafinil with placebo, involving 102 participants, nearly all of whom had idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time. Modafinil significantly improved self-reported sleepiness on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale by 5.08 points more than placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 7.16; 2 studies, 101 participants; high-certainty evidence). Modafinil also significantly improved disease severity on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale by 1.02 points (95% CI 0.11 to 1.93; 1 study, 30 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and resulted in a greater proportion of participants who were "much improved" or "very much improved" on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (odds ratio (OR) for improvement 5.14, 95% CI 1.76 to 15.00; 1 study, 70 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ability to remain awake on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test was significantly improved with modafinil, by 4.74 minutes more than with placebo (95% CI 2.46 to 7.01; 2 studies, 99 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ratings of exhaustion and effectiveness/performance were improved with modafinil compared to placebo in one study. Number of naps per week was no different between modafinil and placebo across two studies. Participants receiving modafinil experienced more side effects, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 9.94; 2 studies, 102 participants; low-certainty evidence). One trial studying 20 participants with different disorders of sleepiness included 10 participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, with or without long sleep time, and compared clarithromycin to placebo. We only included the subset of trial data for those participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, per our protocol. There were no significant differences between clarithromycin and placebo for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, psychomotor vigilance testing, sleep inertia, other subjective ratings, or side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Modafinil is effective for the treatment of several aspects of idiopathic hypersomnia symptomatology, based on studies predominantly including participants with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep times, with low risk of bias, and evidence certainty ranging from high to low. There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether clarithromycin is effective for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. There is a clear need for additional studies testing interventions for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

### The short-term impact of methylprednisolone on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^112P95ov]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

This trial has several strengths. First, this was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using a standardized dosing of corticosteroids. Second, this trial recruited the predefined number of patients and had few dropouts compared with other trials in this patient group. Third, the patient-reported outcomes are consistent with the previously published investigator report of adverse effects (AEs) in the present trial. The presence of adverse effects was assessed by the investigator through semi-structured interviews (presence of predefined AE category [yes vs. no] at day 7). "Sleeplessness" was noted by four participants in the methylprednisolone group as compared with three participants in the placebo group. Finally, we consider these results important and relevant for clinical practice. The cohort studied represented patients with advanced cancer and a high symptom burden. As corticosteroids are commonly used, it is important to know that the use of methylprednisolone is well tolerated, also in terms of sleep.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

Quality of Life

The mean (SD) AddiQoL-30 score (219 patients) was 89 (10), and 75 participants (34%; 95% CI, 28% to 41%) scored 85 or lower (symptomatic group) (Table 2). The symptomatic group scored lower in all 4 dimensions but more so as regards fatigue and musculoskeletal symptoms (Table 2; eTable 3 in Supplement 1). The internal consistency of AddiQoL-30 was good with a Cronbach α of 0.90 and a McDonald ω of 0.90. For CushingQoL, Cronbach α was 0.87 and McDonald ω was 0.88. Participants in the symptomatic group also scored worse on CushingQoL (mean [SD] score, 51 [16] vs 76 [13]; difference, 25; 95% CI, 16–34; p = 0.01; q = .05) (Table 2), and rated their overall sleep quality worse with a difference of 1.9 (95% CI, −0.1 to 4.0) points on a scale from 1 to 10 (mean [SD] score, 4.7 [2.1] vs 6.7 [2.0]; p = 0.05; q = .08) (Table 2).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115sWmpJ]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society guideline — clinical scope and tapering principles: Chronic glucocorticoid therapy results in "at least 1% of the population" using it and "being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency", and this risk "is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility". Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it "necessitates careful education and management of affected patients". Tapering "can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency", and "in general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly with a supraphysiological dosage range, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing". The "degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure" and "recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals".

### Prednisone vs. placebo in withdrawal therapy following medication overuse headache [^115LZovf]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

This proof-of-concept study evaluated the efficacy of prednisone for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms in patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. Twenty patients were randomized and underwent in-patient withdrawal therapy. The total number of hours with severe or moderate headache within the first 72 and 120 h was significantly lower in the prednisone group. The results show that prednisone might be effective in the treatment of medication withdrawal headache.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115u9Dcp]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — non-biochemical tapering and monitoring: In Scenario 1, biochemical confirmation of normal cortisol production is not desired/feasible; the steps are to gradually taper down glucocorticoids and eventually stop, and to closely monitor the patient for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency/glucocorticoid withdrawal throughout the tapering period and after glucocorticoid discontinuation. If there are clinical concerns, options are to move to Scenario 2 or temporarily increase the glucocorticoid dose and taper down over a longer period.

### Dexamethasone (hemady) [^112dAi4f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as HEMADY, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving HEMADY for adrenal insufficiency after corticosteroid withdrawal and Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia while receiving corticosteroids. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if glucocorticoids are withdrawn abruptly and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiently produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The risk may be reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may have to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in glucocorticoid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

Glucocorticoid therapy — clinician-delivered patient education includes the directive, "We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)", with emphasis to educate on adverse manifestations of exogenous Cushing syndrome during long-term supraphysiologic use, inform about the risk of adrenal insufficiency especially when tapering below a physiologic daily dose equivalent, provide guidance on stress dosing, and anticipate glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome; education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crisis.

### Systemic steroids in COPD-the beauty and the beast [^115s6XpP]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, the study results support the recommendations in guidelines and strategy documents to stay away from the chronic use of systemic steroids in COPD. As a consequence, in patients in stable condition that are currently treated with systemic steroids this therapy should be tapered/stopped. This can be quite demanding: patients may develop fatigue, low blood pressure, joint pain, weakness and even psychotic symptoms. Importantly, discontinuation of chronic systemic steroid therapy did not result in an increase of COPD exacerbations. There is only one scenario where steroid cessation may be harmful: some patients with an asthma-COPD overlap may profit from long-term use of systemic steroids and may get worse when steroids are stopped.

Based on the cited literature and supported by the findings of Horita et al. there are some simple messages regarding the use of systemic steroids in COPD: a) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations oral steroids should be prescribed in a moderate dose (40 mg prednisolone) for 5 days, b) there is no place for systemic steroids in stable phase COPD, c) in patients treated with systemic steroids outside of an exacerbation steroid treatment should be withdrawn, d) before doing so therapy should be optimized and patients should be re-evaluated to make sure that they do not have an asthma-COPD overlap.

### The short-term impact of methylprednisolone on patient-reported sleep in patients with advanced cancer in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^113kRLSN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, methylprednisolone 16 mg twice daily for 7 days had no impact on patient-reported sleep in a cohort of patients with advanced cancer treated with opioids. The majority of patients in this cohort reported poor sleep quality at baseline, emphasizing the need to address and treat sleep disturbances. The effects of long-term administration of corticosteroids on sleep in patients with advanced cancer need to be examined in a future study.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114KSFp9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant withdrawal — Abrupt discontinuation or reduction in stimulant use can cause stimulant withdrawal syndrome, and many patients will experience 12 to 24 hours of somnolence and irritability — likely due to catecholamine depletion and sleep deprivation. During periods of abrupt stimulant reduction or discontinuation, clinicians should be attentive to the patient's physical and mental health signs and symptoms. The current standard of care for managing stimulant withdrawal focuses on ameliorating presenting signs and symptoms and minimizing risks. Behavioral and environmental interventions should be used to foster a calming environment.

Figure 25 — EULAR giant cell arteritis pharmacological treatment algorithm outlines initial glucocorticoid (GC) therapy and tapering, management of visual symptoms, escalation steps, and steroid-sparing therapy. When there is "Risk for or presence of glucocorticoid-related adverse events", the pathway states "Start GC 40–60 mg/d and go directly to Phase II". Tapering guidance specifies "Taper GCs to 15–20 mg/d within 2–3 mo and then to ≤ 5 mg/d after 1 y". For "GCA-related visual symptoms", it advises "Consider use of intravenous methylprednisolone 0.25–1 g/d for 3 d". Escalation options in the algorithm include "Increase GC to 40–60 mg/d" or "Increase GC to last effective dose". Subsequent therapy includes "Start Tocilizumab (or Methotrexate)", with GC tapering "to 0 mg at 6 mo with Tocilizumab", followed by "Taper tocilizumab or methotrexate", and if needed "Consult expert center".

### Sustained glucocorticoid tapering in the phase 3 trials of anifrolumab: a post hoc analysis of the TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials [^114BruKp]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Controlling disease activity and avoiding drug toxicity from glucocorticoid use are two of the most important treatment goals highlighted in SLE disease management guidelines. The primary aim of this study was to investigate clinically meaningful changes associated with sustained glucocorticoid taper and the associated impact of sustained glucocorticoid reduction on PROs. In our analysis of pooled data from the TULIP trials of anifrolumab in patients with moderate to severe SLE receiving standard therapy, we assessed the downstream effects of a sustained glucocorticoid taper regardless of original treatment assignment. Sustained glucocorticoid tapering was associated with a 32% reduction in the LS mean cumulative glucocorticoid dose used over 52 weeks. Patients with sustained glucocorticoid tapering were more likely to have meaningful improvements in fatigue, physical and mental health and reduced blood pressures compared with glucocorticoid non-responders. A sustained taper was also associated with numerically fewer SAEs, including infections. Anifrolumab treatment facilitated more glucocorticoid tapering compared with placebo, and anifrolumab-treated patients were more likely to achieve the combination of sustained glucocorticoid taper and reduced disease activity, as assessed by BICLA.

In SLE, persistent disease activity and higher glucocorticoid use are major predictors of organ damage. Thus, controlling disease activity with the lowest glucocorticoid dosage achievable is an important treatment goal for both clinicians and patients. Complete steroid-free clinical remission is difficult to achieve in the real world, particularly in those receiving prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. Nevertheless, reducing glucocorticoid exposure is beneficial and has been reported to limit the negative effects of glucocorticoids regardless of whether the patient reaches a low dosage (7.5 mg or less per day), as each 1 mg per day reduction in mean prednisone dosage is associated with an estimated 3–6% reduction in future organ damage risk. In the present study, a sustained glucocorticoid taper was associated with improvements in PROs, including less fatigue and improved physical and mental health. The mechanisms behind these improvements may, in part, be directly related to reduced glucocorticoid dosage as sleep disturbance, mood disorders and catabolic effects on muscle are recognized adverse effects of higher glucocorticoid dosages.

### A retrospective study on weaning glucocorticoids and recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [^112Typ6n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanism allowing HPA recovery is not clear, but the assumption is that once glucocorticoid levels fall to or below physiological levels the HPA axis will start to recover. Identifying the most appropriate glucocorticoid replacement dose in a patient with tertiary adrenal insufficiency is not straightforward. No formal glucocorticoid biomarkers are available to help titrate dosing, therefore in most cases conventional guidelines used in the treatment of patients with adrenal insufficiency are followed. The total physiological adult dose equivalent of hydrocortisone recommended by guidelines is 15 to 25 mg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses. Converting to hydrocortisone did not appear to allow faster reactivation of the HPA axis. A possible explanation for delayed recovery when converting to multiple dosing hydrocortisone is that peaks of hydrocortisone result in excess glucocorticoid exposure over at least 12 hours of the day from waking. Recently, once-daily administered modified-release hydrocortisone preparations with longer half-lives have become available, but their role in recovery of HPA axis remains unknown.

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

Rationale

Clinicians prescribing long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy should actively educate their patients about the potential development of adverse manifestations associated with exogenous Cushing syndrome during extended use. Furthermore, patients need to be informed about the risks of adrenal insufficiency, especially when tapering glucocorticoid medication below the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see Definitions section). Clinicians should also provide comprehensive guidance on the importance of stress dosing with glucocorticoids. (see recommendation 3.1). Informing patients of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids and methods to monitor and mitigate these outcomes is crucial to enhancing the beneficial aspects of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing the undesired adverse events and risks thereof. Education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crises. Lastly, all patients initiating a glucocorticoid taper should be educated on the possibility of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal have substantial overlap with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and in some cases a disease flare, and can impede the tapering of glucocorticoids (see recommendation 2.3). Anticipation of these potential symptoms can increase awareness and minimize the need for urgent care.

R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
