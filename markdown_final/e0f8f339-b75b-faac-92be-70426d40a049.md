## Question

What is most likely in patient with negative hepatitis b surface antigen, negative hepatitis b surface antibody, but positive total hepatitis b core antibody? What is the next step?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most likely diagnosis is for a patient with negative HBsAg, negative anti-HBs, and positive total anti-HBc, and what the next step should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the serologic pattern and what it implies. Then, I should verify the differential diagnoses for isolated anti-HBc. Next, I will assess risk factors that shift pretest probabilities. After that, I need to determine the immediate next test and why. Finally, I will outline management pathways based on HBV DNA results and special populations, and I will double-check for any exceptions or confounders that could change decisions.

> Let me first confirm the serologic pattern and its usual interpretation. Negative HBsAg with negative anti-HBs but positive total anti-HBc is the classic "isolated anti-HBc" profile, which can reflect past resolved infection with waning anti-HBs, occult HBV infection with low-level HBV DNA despite negative HBsAg, a false-positive total anti-HBc, or rarely a window-period acute infection before anti-HBs appears, and importantly, vaccinated individuals do not develop anti-HBc, so vaccination is not the explanation here [^6019e949] [^3a56696d] [^0fa599aa].

> Wait, let me verify the relative likelihoods. In immunocompetent, low-risk adults, the most common explanation is past resolved infection with loss of detectable anti-HBs over time, which is supported by population data showing isolated anti-HBc in about 0.8% of U.S. adults and by the known durability of anti-HBc versus the tendency of anti-HBs to wane [^6019e949] [^8dab497f]. I should also note that occult HBV infection, while less common overall, is more prevalent in high-risk groups and can be missed by standard HBsAg assays, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^6b8e3974].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check which risk factors meaningfully increase the chance of occult infection or reactivation so I can tailor testing and counseling. High-risk groups include people with HIV, those with HCV coinfection, patients on or facing immunosuppression including biologics or cytotoxic chemotherapy, individuals from high-endemic regions, and those with advanced liver disease; in these settings, isolated anti-HBc carries a higher probability of detectable HBV DNA and future reactivation risk, so I should have a lower threshold for HBV DNA testing and prophylaxis discussions [^bfa164a2] [^6b8e3974] [^f9d7a9b3] [^bb2f0765].

> Next, I should review the immediate next step. The correct next test is a sensitive HBV DNA assay to distinguish occult infection from resolved infection or a false-positive, because serology alone cannot reliably exclude low-level viremia in this scenario. Guidelines endorse HBV DNA testing in isolated anti-HBc, particularly when risk factors or immunosuppression are present, and this is standard in oncology, rheumatology, and HIV care pathways [^6019e949] [^bb2f0765] [^f9d7a9b3] [^7de87663].

> I will now examine management if HBV DNA is undetectable. If HBV DNA is negative, isolated anti-HBc most likely reflects resolved infection with waning anti-HBs or a false-positive, and the patient is generally not infectious. I should confirm results if the clinical context is discordant, consider repeating anti-HBc on a different platform if suspicion for false positivity is high, and offer HBV vaccination if anti-HBs remains negative because there is no durable protective immunity in this state [^6019e949] [^8dab497f].

> But wait, what if HBV DNA is detectable? If HBV DNA is positive, that indicates occult HBV infection, and I should treat this as active HBV with risk for transmission and reactivation. I need to check liver enzymes, assess liver disease stage, and consider antiviral therapy if there is evidence of active disease or if the patient will undergo immunosuppression; in patients facing high-risk immunosuppression such as anti-CD20 therapy or stem cell transplantation, prophylactic antivirals are recommended, whereas in lower-risk scenarios, close monitoring of HBV DNA and ALT with a low threshold to treat is acceptable [^bb2f0765] [^f9d7a9b3] [^49211ca4].

> Let me consider special populations where my threshold should be even lower. In people with HIV, isolated anti-HBc is common and HBV DNA positivity occurs in a meaningful subset, so I should routinely order HBV DNA and vaccinate if nonimmune. In patients starting biologics or cytotoxic chemotherapy, I should not delay cancer therapy to wait for HBV results and should either initiate prophylaxis or commit to frequent monitoring. In pregnancy, isolated anti-HBc in the mother warrants careful assessment of maternal HBV DNA to inform neonatal prophylaxis planning [^bfa164a2] [^bb2f0765] [^21e327b4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a false-positive anti-HBc might be as high as 10% in low-prevalence settings, but I should double-check that. The CDC notes total anti-HBc specificity around 99.8%, so false positives are uncommon, though they do occur, especially in the absence of risk factors; repeating the assay or using an alternate platform can help resolve discordant cases, and I should correct my earlier overestimate accordingly [^6019e949].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is that in a patient with negative HBsAg, negative anti-HBs, and positive total anti-HBc, the most likely diagnosis is past resolved HBV infection with waning anti-HBs, but I cannot exclude occult HBV infection or a false-positive without HBV DNA testing. Therefore, the next step is to order a sensitive HBV DNA assay, with urgency if the patient is immunocompromised or will receive immunosuppression, and then manage based on whether HBV DNA is detected and on the patient's risk profile [^6019e949] [^6b8e3974] [^bb2f0765].

The most likely diagnosis is **past HBV infection with waning anti-HBs** [^6019e949] or **occult HBV infection** [^6b8e3974]. The next step is to **order HBV DNA testing** [^6019e949] to distinguish occult infection from resolved infection, and if negative, **offer vaccination** if anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL [^6192b89a]. If HBV DNA is positive, manage as occult HBV with monitoring or treatment based on risk factors and clinical context [^6dc855a7].

## Interpretation of serologic results

| **Marker** | **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| HBsAg | Negative | No current active infection |
| Anti-HBs | Negative | No protective immunity |
| Total anti-HBc | Positive | Past infection or occult infection |

---

Total anti-HBc appears during acute infection and persists for life, so a positive result with negative HBsAg and anti-HBs most often reflects **past infection with waning anti-HBs** [^6019e949] or **occult HBV infection** (HBV DNA present despite negative HBsAg) [^6b8e3974].

---

## Clinical significance of isolated anti-HBc

Isolated anti-HBc is **relatively common**, with a prevalence of about 0.8% in the general U.S. population (approximately 2.1 million people) [^6019e949]. It carries **clinical implications**:

- **Past infection**: Most commonly reflects resolved HBV infection with loss of detectable anti-HBs over time [^8dab497f].
- **Occult infection**: A minority have low-level HBV DNA detectable in serum or liver, indicating ongoing viral replication despite negative HBsAg [^6b8e3974].
- **False-positive**: Rarely, a false-positive anti-HBc may occur, particularly in low-risk individuals without HBV exposure history [^6019e949].

---

## Risk factors for occult HBV infection

Certain populations have a **higher risk** of occult HBV infection:

- **HIV coinfection**: Prevalence of isolated anti-HBc is 7–19% in HIV-positive individuals, with HBV DNA detected in 1–36% [^bfa164a2].
- **HCV coinfection**: Higher prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and occult HBV infection [^89f9d4bf].
- **Immunosuppression**: Increased risk of reactivation and occult infection [^8dab497f].
- **High endemic regions**: Higher background prevalence of HBV infection [^8e92af2d].

---

## Recommended next steps

Given the serologic pattern, **the next step is to order HBV DNA testing** to distinguish occult infection from resolved infection [^6019e949]. Management depends on the result:

- **HBV DNA negative**: Indicates resolved infection. Vaccinate if anti-HBs is < 10 mIU/mL to restore protective immunity [^6192b89a].
- **HBV DNA positive**: Indicates occult HBV infection. Monitor ALT and HBV DNA periodically; consider antiviral therapy if immunosuppression is planned or if ALT is elevated [^6dc855a7].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

Management should be **individualized** based on risk factors, comorbidities, and clinical context:

- **Immunocompetent patients**: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA periodically; vaccinate if nonimmune [^6019e949].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider antiviral prophylaxis to prevent reactivation, especially before immunosuppressive therapy [^49211ca4].
- **HIV or HCV coinfection**: Regularly monitor HBV DNA and ALT; initiate antiviral therapy if indicated [^7de87663].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In a patient with negative HBsAg, negative anti-HBs, and positive total anti-HBc, the most likely diagnoses are **past HBV infection with waning anti-HBs** or **occult HBV infection**. The next step is to **order HBV DNA testing** to differentiate these entities [^6019e949]. If HBV DNA is negative, vaccinate if anti-HBs is < 10 mIU/mL; if positive, monitor or treat based on risk and clinical context [^6192b89a].

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^1629f0b8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

If testing in a low-prevalence population (eg, 1%–2%), even with 97% sensitivity, the negative predictive value of a test would still be extremely high approximately 99.9%. However, in higher-prevalence populations (eg, PWID with prevalence approximately 40%), the negative predictive value would only be 98%. At its current sensitivity, core Ag test would likely have to be used with a paradigm of testing all core Ag-negative/HCV antibody-positive tests for HCV RNA. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy would likely depend on the viremic prevalence among antibody-positive people, which will go down as more and more people are treated. Ultimately, the availability of HCV core Ag test could be helpful if algorithms could be designed to test core Ag, with a plan to treat if positive but follow-up with reflex antibody and then RNA testing in those who test core Ag negative/HCV antibody positive. The cost-effectiveness and efficiency of such a strategy would have to be assessed to determine in which settings it would be most useful. Development of a POC core Ag test, ideally with improved sensitivity over existing assays, would be a major advance and would likely be not only cost-effective but significantly cost-saving (Table 1).

Persons with Isolated Core Antibody

Persons with isolated anti-HBc should have their immune status and risk history considered before deciding next steps. Links to performance characteristics on all FDA-approved total anti-HBc assays are available (Supplementary Table 21,). The specificity of total anti-HBc tests is 99.8%. However, if a person does not have risk factors, the result might be a false positive; repeat testing with the same assay is warranted to confirm the results. A false-positive isolated core antibody result means the person is susceptible and should be offered HepB vaccine per current ACIP recommendations.

A 2001–2018 national survey found the prevalence of isolated positive anti-HBc to be 0.8% (approximately 2.1 million persons). Among patients exposed to HBV, an isolated positive anti-HBc result might be the result of loss of anti-HBs after past resolved infection, occult infection (i.e. HBsAg is negative, but HBV DNA is positive), being in the window period before appearance of anti-HBs, or an HBsAg mutant infection (i.e. an infection that is not picked up by an HBsAg test unable to detect mutants). Patients who are immunosuppressed should be considered at risk for HBV reactivation, and HBV DNA testing is recommended to assess for occult infection. Among infants, an isolated anti-HBc result might be a consequence of passive placental transfer from an HBsAg-positive mother, which is why testing for anti-HBc is not indicated before age 24 months.

Patient Education

Patient education should be conducted in a culturally sensitive, nonstigmatizing manner in the patient’s primary language (both written and oral whenever possible). Bilingual, bicultural, and medically trained interpreters should be used when indicated.

Reporting

Acute and chronic cases of HBV infection should be reported to the appropriate state or local health jurisdiction in accordance with requirements. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists publishes case definitions for the classification of reportable cases of HBV infection. CDC has updated guidance for health departments on viral hepatitis surveillance and case management.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^540f2929]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV—Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^3a56696d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection—serologic diagnosis relies on specific marker patterns. Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing. Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection, and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection, and total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

### Evaluation of the patient with hepatitis B [^e12af51e]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

The initial evaluation of a patient with hepatitis B virus infection should attempt to assess the disease activity and stage in the context of the known natural history of this infection and to properly assess the needs for treatment and surveillance. In addition to a medical history and focused physical examination, the initial evaluation usually requires serological, biochemical, and virological tests to confirm the diagnosis as well as an imaging study to establish a baseline for future monitoring. A liver biopsy is generally not needed but can provide useful information on prognosis, need for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and whether to recommend therapy. Follow-up monitoring is aimed at determining disease progression, development of complications, and reassessing the need for treatment. Monitoring frequency should be determined based on the activity and stage of disease. Initiation of screening for HCC should be based on age, race, sex, family history, and stage and duration of disease. The current recommended method of screening and surveillance for HCC is by ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein measurements every 6-12 months. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role of longitudinal application of noninvasive assays of fibrosis, such as serum fibrosis markers and transient elastography. Better biomarkers and imaging modalities are needed for early detection of HCC. Finally, studies are needed to better refine the indications and to balance the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^af3607f0]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Core concepts regarding chronic hepatitis B (CHB) phases and monitoring—Immune-tolerant is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive with HBV DNA >10,000,000 IU/mL and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) defined as <35 U/L for males and <25 U/L for females; HBeAg-positive immune active is HBeAg-positive with ALT elevated 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater and HBV DNA >20,000 IU/mL; HBeAg-negative immune active is HBeAg-negative with ALT elevated 2x ULN or greater and HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL; inactive is HBeAg-negative with normal ALT and HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL; and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative immune clearance has HBV DNA undetectable with ± antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). As persons transition across phases over the lifetime of infection, regular monitoring is essential to identify when a change of management is indicated, including use of antiviral therapy.

### Determination of hepatitis B phenotype using biochemical and serological markers [^1e69c838]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the validity of categorization of chronic hepatitis B viral infection into stages or phases based upon measures of disease activity and viral load, assuming these phenotypes will be useful for prognostication and determining the need for antiviral therapy. We assessed the phenotype of hepatitis B of 1,390 adult participants enrolled in the Hepatitis B Research Network Cohort Study, using a computer algorithm. Only 4% were immune tolerant, while 35% had chronic hepatitis B (18% e antigen positive and 17% e antigen negative) while 23% were inactive carriers. Strikingly, 38% of participants did not fit clearly into any one of these groups and were considered indeterminant. The largest subset of indeterminants had elevated serum aminotransferases with low levels of HBV DNA (less than 10,000 iu/mL). Subsequent determination of hepatitis B phenotype on the next available laboratory tests showed that 64% remained indeterminant. These findings call into question the validity of conventional staging of hepatitis B, in large part because of the substantial proportion of patients who do not fit readily into one of the usual stages or phases. Further studies are needed of the indeterminant category of chronic hepatitis B viral infection, including assessments of whether patients in this group are perhaps in transition to another phase or if they are a distinct phenotype with a need to assess liver disease severity and need for antiviral therapy.

### Responding to HBV exposures in health care settings (...) [^a745f186]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The triple panel test, which includes hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, should be used to identify if someone has been infected with hepatitis B. Learn more about CDC’s clinical testing guidance. If the clinician has anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg- negative, the clinician should receive an additional single HepB vaccine dose, followed by repeat anti-HBs testing 1–2 months later. Clinicians whose anti-HBs remains less than 10 mIU/mL should undergo revaccination with two more doses. Anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine.

Vaccinated clinicians with low anti-HBs levels For vaccinated clinicians with anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL after two complete HepB vaccine series, the source patient should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. If the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has unknown HBsAg status, the clinician should receive two doses of HBIG. The first dose should be administered as soon as possible after the exposure, and the second dose should be administered 1 month later. Unvaccinated clinicians exposed to HBsAg-negative source patients If the source patient is HBsAg-negative, the clinician should complete the HepB vaccine series according to the vaccination schedule. So that the clinician's response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed approximately 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose.

At-risk clinicians exposed to HBsAg-positive or unknown HBsAg status source patients Clinicians who have anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL and sustain an exposure to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status should undergo baseline testing for HBV infection as soon as possible after the exposure, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later. Testing immediately after exposure should consist of total anti-HBc, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later should consist of HBsAg and total anti-HBc.

HCV Core Antigen

An alternative to HCV RNA measurement is the use of HCV core antigen (Ag). As a direct measure of a structural viral protein, detection of core Ag in the blood is equivalent to detecting HCV RNA. HCV core Ag is highly specific and correlates well with HCV RNA but is less sensitive, with existing assays reporting an analytical sensitivity equivalent to approximately 3000 IU/mL of HCV RNA. Current core Ag platforms are automated but require a central laboratory and with current technology, POC assays have proven difficult to develop due to challenges with virion lysis, dissociation of the core Ag from antibody complexes, and the need for signal amplification to improve sensitivity. However, core Ag tests can be done on the same sample as HCV antibody tests.

Although core Ag test is cheaper than HCV RNA testing and could theoretically be used as a first-line test, the sensitivity may be a relevant issue. In a large study of 62 000 samples from patients with chronic HCV infection of varying genotypes, Freiman and colleagues reported that 97% of samples were above 1000 IU/mL and 95% were above 3000 IU/mL. Current commercial HCV RNA assays have sensitivity of 12–15 IU/mL and the GenXpert POC RNA test has a lower limit of detection of 40 IU/mL. Notably, Freiman et al found that the factors associated with an HCV RNA level below 1000 IU/mL were genotype 3 infection, HIV coinfection, and the presence of cirrhosis, populations that would be particularly concerning to miss. In large real-world studies of core Ag testing, sensitivity ranges from 87% to 94% compared to HCV RNA, with most core Ag-negative samples showing low HCV RNA levels. Mutations in the core region that interfere with detection may also give false-negative results. Despite this observation, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) has recommended that new assays for HCV viremia must only be able to detect samples equivalent to HCV RNA levels of 1000 IU/mL or greater.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^d51b8444]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical considerations—uniform definitions and HBV DNA threshold: Absent evidence from RCTs on the comparative utility of risk-based versus universal HBV screening or on predictors of HBV reactivation, the Panel highlights the need for consistent definitions and supports the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases definition of HBV reactivation and adverse clinical liver-associated outcomes as outlined in the 2018 HBV Guidance. To guide oncology practice for patients with past HBV infection, the PCO uses a simplified cut-off threshold of HBV DNA > 1,000 IU/mL to determine when further management is warranted, and notes that asymptomatic rises in HBV DNA are very different from clinical hepatitis flares and should be interpreted with caution. Case definitions include that chronic HBV infection refers to patients who are HBsAg-positive regardless of anti-HBc status, although most will be anti-HBc–positive, and past HBV infection refers to patients who have a negative HBsAg with positive anti-HBc, regardless of anti-HBs status.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to serologic testing, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a serological assay, either rapid diagnostic test or laboratory-based immunoassay, meeting minimum quality, safety and performance standards (with regard to both analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity) to detect HBsAg for the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged > 12 months) patients. Obtain laboratory-based immunoassays as the preferred assay format in settings where existing laboratory testing is already available and accessible. Obtain rapid diagnostic tests to improve access in settings where there is limited access to laboratory testing and/or in populations where access to rapid testing would facilitate linkage to care and treatment.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^0ba7259c]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection—testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2-3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Hepatitis B—serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic “window” from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient’s response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing and management before anti–TNF‑α therapy in pediatric IBD—recommended steps. Anti‑TNFα therapy is not recommended to be started in patients with active HBV infection. To document immunity and determine infection status before starting therapy, perform hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti‑HBs, and hepatitis B core antibody (anti‑HBc) testing. If anti‑HBc is the only antibody that is positive, a HBV DNA load should be measured; isolated anti‑HBc may reflect false‑positive reactivity from assay or serum interference, passive transfer from immunoglobulin products, or low‑level chronic carriage with loss of other markers. In such patients, HBV DNA in the blood should be determined; if HBV DNA load is negative, a true infection with HBV is unlikely. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be screened by laboratory testing, including liver enzymes and HBV DNA, every 2 to 3 months during and after cessation of immunomodulator therapy. Antiviral prophylaxis or therapy may be required in some patients or if there is viral reactivation; patients who test positive for HBV should also be tested for HIV and hepatitis A and C viruses. In health care settings, infected patients should be managed using standard precautions with special attention to safe injection procedures.

### Isolated anti-HBc: the relevance of hepatitis B core antibody – A review of new issues [^72c6383e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is considered the most sensitive serological marker for history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a subset of anti-HBc carriers, anti-HBc is present in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody-a serological pattern known as "isolated anti-HBc" (IAHBc). IAHBc has been of clinical interest over the past several years, with growing data to suggest its role as a serological marker for occult HBV infection (OBI). This article reviews the clinical significance and association of IAHBc with hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, risk of HBV reactivation during direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV as well as immune suppression, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B core-related antigen is also highlighted as an emerging laboratory assay that may identify OBI and predict HCC development in non-cirrhotic patients receiving nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapy.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection—diagnosis and screening in patients with HIV includes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommend screening patients with HIV infection for chronic HBV, and initial testing should include serologic testing for surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) (AII). In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on 2 occasions at least 6 months apart, and patients with chronic HBV infection should be further tested for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA; active disease, which can be HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive, can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. Patients whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg-negative with positive anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc, although covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) may remain in hepatocyte nuclei, and with severe immune suppression a patient may become serum HBsAg-positive again with HBV viremia. The presence of an isolated anti-HBc test result usually signifies infection with HBV in the past with subsequent loss of anti-HBs and occurs in 7% to 19% of patients with HIV infection, and incidence of HBV viremia in patients with HIV infection and isolated anti-HBc ranges from 1% to 36%.

### Hepatitis B surface antibody titres and hepatitis B reactivation with direct-acting antiviral therapy for hepatitis C [^223280cc]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

HBV reactivation can occur while undergoing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The role of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) has not been systematically explored. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to explore the role of the presence of HBsAb on the risk of HBV reactivation related to DAA therapy. We reviewed MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane Central for studies on DAA therapy and data on HBsAb in patients with resolved hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen-negative and hepatitis B core antibody-positive). We identified twenty-nine reports: thirteen case reports with HBV reactivation (10 HBsAb-negative and 3 HBsAb-positive patients) and sixteen cohort studies totalling 2528 patients with resolved HBV infection (1429 HBsAb negative, 1099 HBsAb positive). Reactivation was found in 12 (0.8%) HBsAb-negative and 7 (0.6%) HBsAb-positive individuals of cohort studies. All but two HBV reactivation occurred in patients with HBsAb titre <30 iU/L. The presence of HBsAb showed a trend towards delayed reactivation (median 12 weeks vs 9.5 weeks; P = .07). Importantly, with the exception of a patient with escape variant and an HIV-infected individual, no HBsAb-positive individual demonstrated clinical reactivation. HBsAb presence seems to protect from clinical HBV reactivation related to DAA therapy. The most pronounced prevention for reactivation may require titres greater than 30 iU/L.

Viral hepatitis and hepatitis A virus screening in HIV—Persons with HIV should be screened for evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection upon initiation of care by detection of HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), and antibody to hepatitis B total core antigen (anti-HBc or HBcAb), and if HBsAg is positive, HBV viral load should be ordered; persons with HIV should be screened for evidence of immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) with HAV immunoglobulin (IgG). Persons with HIV should be screened for HCV antibody upon initiation of care and, if positive, HCV RNA should be ordered to assess for active HCV infection; curative therapy should be offered to all who are diagnosed with active HCV. HCV RNA testing is indicated ≥12 weeks post- completion of anti-HCV treatment, HCV RNA should be used for screening if HCV infection within the last 6 months is suspected or there is a history of prior HCV infection that has cleared, and HCV RNA testing should be considered in persons with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count <200 cells/µL). Infants born to persons with HBV and/or HCV should be tested for HBV and HCV transmission, and persons who are not immune to HAV and HBV should be immunized according to current national guidelines.

In certain persons, anti-HBc is the only serologic marker detected. Isolated anti-HBc-positivity can be detected following HBV infection in persons who have recovered but whose anti-HBs levels have waned; in populations with a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti-HBc likely indicates previous infection with loss of anti-HBs. Some chronically infected persons with isolated anti-HBc-positivity have circulating HBsAg that is not detectable by a laboratory assay. HBV DNA has been detected in <10% of persons with isolated anti-HBc, although the presence of detectable HBV DNA might fluctuate. These persons are unlikely to transmit infection except under circumstances in which they are the source of a large exposure, such as a blood transfusion. Persons who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive can experience reactivation of infection during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, with reappearance of HBsAg. Infection with a mutant HBV strain can result in positive laboratory tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA, with a negative IgM anti-HBc.

Perinatal HBV infection in a child aged ≤24 months is typically asymptomatic although fulminant hepatitis can occur; a positive HBsAg test, positive HBeAg test, or detectable HBV DNA may be considered laboratory evidence of perinatal HBV in an infant born to an HBV-infected mother if timing criteria are met. Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detectable anti-HBc for up to 24 months after birth from passively acquired maternal antibody.

### Occult hepatitis B [^88d0d98c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the primary cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is one of the ten leading causes of death. Traditionally, people with chronic HBV infection have been identified with blood tests for HBV antigens and antibodies. Recently, another group of patients with chronic HBV infection has been identified by sensitive, molecular testing for HBV DNA. Members of this group are often referred to as having occult hepatitis B because they are HBV-DNA positive, but hepatitis B surface antigen negative. Occult hepatitis B occurs in a number of clinical settings. In this review, we examine occult hepatitis B in people co-infected with hepatitis C, in whom occult hepatitis B has been associated with advanced fibrosis and diminished response to interferon alpha. Although much more research is needed, existing reports justify a heightened awareness of the medical importance and means of testing for occult hepatitis B.

### Hepatitis B virus screening for patients with cancer before therapy: American Society of Clinical Oncology provisional clinical opinion update [^00548353]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This updated provisional clinical opinion presents a revised opinion based on American Society of Clinical Oncology panel consensus in the context of an evolving database.

Context

Despite the 2010 provisional clinical opinion recommendation, there is still evidence of suboptimal hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening among patients at high risk for HBV infection or HBV reactivation after chemotherapy. This updated provisional clinical opinion introduces a risk-adaptive strategy to identify and treat patients with HBV infection to reduce their risk of HBV reactivation.

Provisional Clinical Opinion

Medical providers should screen by testing patients for HBV infection before starting anti-CD20 therapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation. Providers should also screen patients with risk factors for HBV infection. Screening should include both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), because reactivation can occur in patients who are HBsAg positive/anti-HBc positive or HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive. Either total anti-HBc or anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (not immunoglobulin M) test should be used. Clinicians should start antiviral therapy for HBsAg-positive/anti-HBc-positive patients before or contemporaneously with cancer therapy and monitor HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients for reactivation with HBV DNA and ALT levels, promptly starting antivirals if reactivation occurs. Clinicians can initiate antivirals for HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients anticipating cancer therapies associated with a high risk of reactivation, or they can monitor HBV DNA and ALT levels and initiate on-demand antivirals. For patients who neither have HBV risk factors nor anticipate cancer therapy associated with a high risk of reactivation, current evidence does not support HBV screening before initiation of cancer therapy.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology—marker dynamics and diagnostic windows are described as follows: anti-HBs and HBsAg do not co-exist detectably in serum, and anti-HBs is seen only after HBsAg has been cleared. The chronic carrier state usually can be predicted by HBsAg seropositivity for more than 20 weeks. During a serologic window, hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc) appears 3–5 weeks after HBsAg. IgM anti-HBc appears during acute or after recent hepatitis B virus infection and is present for approximately 6 months. In contrast, vaccinated individuals will have only anti-HBs detectable in serum and not HBsAg or anti-HBc, and hepatitis B core antigen is not detectable outside of research laboratory assays, and tests for it should not be ordered clinically.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection [^068cfec1]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2000). Low credibility.

Many studies have shown that hepatitis B virus infection may also occur in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients. This occult infection has been identified both in patients with cryptogenic liver disease and in patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis, and much evidence suggests that it may be a risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma development. However several aspects of this occult infection remain unclear such as its prevalence and the factor(s) involved in the lack of circulating hepatitis B surface antigen. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the occult hepatitis B virus infection may contribute to chronic liver damage, considering that it is usually associated with a suppressed viral replication. Evidence and hypotheses concerning this fascinating field of bio-medical research are reviewed.

HBV-seropositive or anti-HBc–positive candidates—evaluation and risk: The prevalence of HBV infections ranges from 0-7% of patients on hemodialysis. A positive hepatitis B serology (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]) does not preclude transplantation but does require further evaluation. Positivity of HBsAg denotes actively replicating virus and should be further quantified using HBV DNA, with assessment for chronic liver disease and liver imaging to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma; expert consultation should be sought to determine antiviral therapy prior to transplantation. Positivity of anti-HBc with a negative HBsAg is evidence of prior infection, active replication should be ruled out with HBV DNA testing, patients with isolated anti-HBc positivity can undergo transplantation, and there is a small risk of reactivation (< 5%) post-transplant.

Purpose

This Provisional Clinical Opinion update presents a clinically pragmatic approach to hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management.

Provisional Clinical Opinion

All patients anticipating systemic anticancer therapy should be tested for HBV by 3 tests-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen-but anticancer therapy should not be delayed. Findings of chronic HBV (HBsAg-positive) or past HBV (HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive) infection require HBV reactivation risk assessment.Patients with chronic HBV receiving any systemic anticancer therapy should receive antiviral prophylactic therapy through and for minimum 12 months following anticancer therapy. Hormonal therapy alone should not pose a substantial risk of HBV reactivation in patients with chronic HBV receiving hormonal therapy alone; these patients may follow noncancer HBV monitoring and treatment guidance. Coordination of care with a clinician experienced in HBV management is recommended for patients with chronic HBV to determine HBV monitoring and long-term antiviral therapy after completion of anticancer therapy.Patients with past HBV infection undergoing anticancer therapies associated with a high risk of HBV reactivation, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or stem-cell transplantation, should receive antiviral prophylaxis during and for minimum 12 months after anticancer therapy completion, with individualized management thereafter. Careful monitoring may be an alternative if patients and providers can adhere to frequent, consistent follow-up so antiviral therapy may begin at the earliest sign of reactivation. Patients with past HBV undergoing other systemic anticancer therapies not clearly associated with a high risk of HBV reactivation should be monitored with HBsAg and alanine aminotransferase during cancer treatment; antiviral therapy should commence if HBV reactivation occurs.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^6192b89a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of <10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥35 years after vaccination (–). Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person’s immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1,).

### Late presentation of chronic viral hepatitis for medical care: a consensus definition [^9f8e7aa5]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 13 million adults are living with hepatitis B, and 15 million with hepatitis C, in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (commonly defined as the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen for six months or more) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (as determined by the persistence of hepatitis C nucleic acid or HCV core antigen for more than six or 12 1 months) ranges from 0.1% to 6% across Europe, with major differences between countries and population subgroups. Chronic HBV and HCV infections may remain clinically silent for decades, and symptoms do occur at a late stage. Diagnosis in the absence of widespread screening programmes may therefore be based on signs of late stage liver disease such as hepatic decompensation, variceal bleeding or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Many people with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection are go undiagnosed. Of those already diagnosed, many are not necessarily linked to parts of the healthcare system that are able to provide comprehensive care (e.g. to accurately classify the extent of liver disease and provide treatment when indicated). Consequently, a large (but undetermined) proportion of the chronically infected population enters comprehensive care only after developing liver disease-related clinical symptoms.

Effective and well tolerated treatments for both HBV and HCV infection have greatly improved our ability treat patients successfully, especially if they are diagnosed early. In asymptomatic individuals, treatment is indicated for those at increased risk of symptomatic chronic liver disease, and those at risk of transmitting the infection. All patients with symptomatic disease should be treated. For many, treatment can prevent further progression of liver disease to liver cirrhosis, and can even revert existing liver fibrosis.

In most European countries, it remains unknown as to what extent testing policies and strategies succeed in identifying the undiagnosed population during the course of their disease. The extent to which diagnosed patients are linked to and retained in sections of the healthcare system that are able to provide comprehensive care is also unknown.

To fully exploit the strategic use of treatment and to optimise its benefit, infected persons in need of treatment must enter comprehensive care before their liver disease progresses to considerable liver damage. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis may be considered as “late presenters”. Of these, a subgroup of individuals with “late stage liver disease”, such as decompensated liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension or hepatocellular carcinoma, can be further defined as a subgroup where there is indisputable evidence that earlier initiation of treatment would have provided significant benefit. These definitions will help quantify the proportion of cases missing timely diagnosis and treatment.

- family history of HCC (strong recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence)

- age > 40 years (a lower age may apply depending on the regional incidence of HCC) and with HBV DNA level > 20,000 IU/mL (if available) if there is no family history of HCC or evidence of cirrhosis.

### Hepatitis B [^0c835aa2]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B—HBsAg clearance and residual risk: Approximately 0.5% of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers will clear HBsAg yearly and most will develop anti‑HBs; however, low‑level HBV DNA may persist in up to half.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection: a covert operation [^6dc855a7]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Detection of occult hepatitis B requires assays of the highest sensitivity and specificity with a lower limit of detection of less than 10 IU/mL for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and <0.1 ng/mL for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). This covert condition is relatively common in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) that seems to exert some influence on the replicative capacity and latency of HBV. Detection of virus-specific nucleic acid does not always translate into infectivity, and the occurrence of primer-generated HBV DNA that is of partial genomic length in immunocompetent individuals who have significant levels of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) may not be biologically relevant. Acute flares of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that occur during the early phase of therapy for HCV or ALT levels that remain elevated at the end of therapy in biochemical nonresponders should prompt an assessment for occult hepatitis B. Similarly, the plasma from patients with chronic hepatitis C that is hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive (+/-anti-HBs at levels of <100 mIU/mL) should be examined for HBV DNA with the most sensitive assay available. If a liver biopsy is available, immunostaining for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) should be contemplated and a portion of the sample tested for HBV DNA. This is another reason for optimal collection of a specimen (e.g. two passes with a 16-guage needle under ultrasound guidance). Transmission of HBV to immunosuppressed orthotopic liver transplant recipients by donors with occult hepatitis B (OHB) will continue to occupy the interests of the transplant hepatologist. As patients with OHB may have detectable HBV DNA in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or liver that can be reactivated following immunosuppression or intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the patient needs to be either monitored or treated depending on the pretreatment serological results such as an isolated anti-HBc reaction or a detectable HBV DNA.

### Screening for hepatitis A and B antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease [^d21cbb79]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is highly prevalent, and hepatitis C is one of the leading causes. Acute hepatitis A or B in patients with chronic hepatitis C can lead to more severe hepatic injury and a higher fatality rate than in patients without hepatitis C. Thus, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend that persons with CLD be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV), and the ACIP and the National Institutes of Health recommend vaccination against both HAV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Because coinfection with HAV or HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C or CLD is common, antibody screening prior to hepatitis A or B vaccination can identify patients who are already immune to these viruses and thus do not need to be vaccinated. Selective hepatitis A vaccination (i.e., vaccination of patients who test negative for either HAV antibody immunoglobulin G or total antibodies to HAV) is most cost-effective in areas where the local prevalence of hepatitis A is higher than the national prevalence and in populations with higher background rates of HAV exposure compared with the general population, such as older adults, foreign-born patients, African Americans, and persons with CLD or hepatitis C. Although not usually recommended for healthy adults or those with compensated CLD because of virtually 100% postvaccination seroconversion, serologic testing after hepatitis A vaccination is recommended in patients with decompensated or advanced end-stage liver disease because of the much lower seroconversion rates in these patients. Selective vaccination against HBV in patients with CLD or hepatitis C is also recommended. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is considered the most efficient and reasonably cost-effective method to screen for hepatitis B serologic markers because HBsAg identifies individuals with both acute and chronic HBV infection, and anti-HBs identify those who are immune secondary to vaccination or past infection. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen is needed to further distinguish between immunity due to vaccination and immunity due to past infection, but it is not recommended as the only screening test for HBV immunity. Postvaccination testing for hepatitis B seroconversion is recommended in all patients with CLD, especially in those with more advanced disease, because the rate of seroconversion is generally lower than in healthy adults. If patients with CLD are not adequately protected after a standard course of hepatitis B vaccination, a repeat course of vaccination using the standard schedule or an accelerated schedule (days 0, 7, and 21) should be considered.

### Total HCV core antigen assay: a new marker of hepatitis C viremia for monitoring the progress of therapy [^66677252]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

The ability of the total hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen assay was evaluated for monitoring the therapeutic responses of HCV-infected patients treated with interferon. The ability to detect and quantitate an independent structural protein component of HCV, in the presence of circulating antibodies, makes this assay a valuable new tool in diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Measurement of total core antigen showed a strong dynamic correlation with HCV RNA data and may serve as an alternative direct marker of viral infection. In addition, with the advent of additional treatment protocols, a rapid, reliable assay for changes in HCV load may permit more frequent patient assessment and tailoring of the therapeutic regimen.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6b8e3974]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health burden. In 2019, an estimated 296 million people were chronically infected with HBV and more than 820 000 HBV-related deaths occurred worldwide.Only 10·5% of chronically infected people were aware of their infection in 2019,suggesting a pressing need for more effective strategies to identify and treat individuals who are infected. The WHO clinical guidelines advocate initial testing with HBsAg using laboratory-based immunoassays or rapid diagnostic tests.This approach also applies to high-risk populations, such as people living with HIV, people with hepatitis C virus infection, and people on haemodialysis, and those with advanced chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology.

However, these testing strategies are at risk of missing occult HBV infection, defined as the presence of replication-competent HBV DNA in the liver tissue or blood of individuals who have tested negative for HBsAg using chemiluminescent immunoassay or ELISA.HBV DNA should be detected by nucleic acid tests (NAT), including PCR, in blood samples or liver tissue, and the gold standard remains testing for episomal covalently closed circular DNA in the liver.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection and current perspectives on global WHO 2030 eradication [^1e2d4b82]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

The current World Health Organization (WHO) Hepatitis Elimination Strategy suffers from lack of a target for diagnosing or expunging occult HBV infection. A sizable segment of the global population has an undetected HBV infection, particularly the high-risk populations and those residing in countries like India with intermediate endemicity. There is growing proof that people with hidden HBV infection can infect others, and that these infections are linked to serious chronic hepatic complications, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the current diagnostic infrastructure in low-resource settings, the WHO 2030 objective of obliterating hepatitis B appears to be undeniably challenging to accomplish. Given the molecular basis of occult HBV infection strongly linked to intrahepatic persistence, patients may inexplicably harbour HBV genomes for a prolonged duration without displaying any pronounced clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease, and present histological signs of moderate degree necro-inflammation, diffuse fibrosis, and hence the international strategy to eradicate viral hepatitis warrants inclusion of occult HBV infection.

### Hepatitis B [^bb944231]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

HBV clinical term definitions—per Table 4—include the following: Chronic hepatitis B is defined as chronic necroinflammatory disease of the liver caused by persistent infection with hepatitis B virus and can be subdivided into HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B. Inactive HBsAg carrier state is persistent HBsAg without evidence of significant, ongoing necroinflammatory disease. Acute exacerbation or flare of hepatitis B is intermittent elevations of aminotransferase activity to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal and more than twice the baseline value. Reactivation of hepatitis B is reappearance of active necroinflammatory disease of the liver in a person known to have the inactive HBsAg carrier state or resolved hepatitis B. HBeAg clearance is loss of HBeAg in a person who was previously HBeAg positive. HBeAg seroconversion is loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe in a person who was previously HBeAg positive and anti-HBe negative. HBsAg reversion is reappearance of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative, anti-HBs positive.

What is the Transmission Route of HBV?

Today, we know that HBVs are highly infectious and are spread by exposure of mucosal membranes or nonintact skin to infected blood or other body fluids (saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid). In high endemic areas, HBV is most commonly transmitted from mother to child at birth (perinatal transmission) and during early childhood from infected to uninfected children (horizontal transmission). Most HBV infections in areas of low endemicity occur in adults in relatively well-defined risk groups, such as those at risk through sexual exposure, household members of an infected person, hemodialysis patients, incarcerated persons, injection-drug users, persons at risk for occupational exposure, developmentally disabled persons in long-term care facilities, and travelers to regions with moderate or high HBV endemicity. Today, only humans are a known reservoir for human HBV genotypes, but closely related HBV genotypes exist in higher primates [23]. Hence, a comprehensive control strategy could eventually lead to the eradication of HBV.

How is Hepatitis B Diagnosed?

Because clinical manifestations of hepatitis B are indistinguishable from other causes of viral hepatitis, a definitive diagnosis requires serological testing [24]. This testing uses different (combinations of) serologic markers to identify different phases of HBV infection and to conclude whether a person has acute or chronic HBV infection, or is immune to HBV as a result of prior HBV infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection. In Table 1 an interpretation of hepatitis B serologic test results is given.

Table 1. 
Interpretation of Serologic Test Results for Hepatitis B

Chronic infection is arbitrarily defined by the persistence of HBsAg (with or without concurrent HBeAg) in serum for at least 6 months. Anti-HBs are neutralizing antibodies and their presence in serum confers long-term immunity against HBV infection. In persons with acquired immunity through vaccination, anti-HBs is the only serological marker detected. In contrast to persons with a past HBV infection where anti-HBs are present concurrently with anti-HBc IgG.

During the initial, highly replicative phase of HBV infection patients are also seropositive for HBeAg, of whom some remain HBeAg positive for years. All HBsAg-positive persons should be considered infectious; however, the presence of HBeAg indicates that the blood and body fluids of the infected individual are highly contagious (ie, HBV DNA levels of 10 7 to 10 9 IU/mL). Although HBsAg has been detected in multiple body fluids, only serum, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid have been demonstrated to be infectious [25].

### Hepatitis B surface antigen quantification: why and how to use it in 2011-a core group report [^68092947]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Quantitative HBsAg had been suggested to be helpful in management of HBV, but assays were cumbersome. The recent availability of commercial quantitative assays has restarted the interest in quantitative serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in chronic hepatitis B. HBsAg level reflects the transcriptional activity of cccDNA rather than the absolute amount of cccDNA copies. Serum HBsAg level tends to be higher in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive than HBeAg-negative patients. Among patients with a low HBV DNA (<2000IU/ml), HBsAg <1000IU/ml in genotype D HBV infection and HBsAg <100IU/ml in genotype B/C HBV infection is associated with inactive carrier state in HBeAg-negative patients. The HBsAg reduction by nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) is not as pronounced as by interferon treatment. On peginterferon treatment, sustained responders tend to show greater HBsAg decline than the non-responders. The optimal on-treatment HBsAg cutoff to predict response needs further evaluation in HBeAg-positive patients, but an absence of HBsAg decline together with a <2 log reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 can serve as stopping rule in HBeAg-negative patients with genotype D HBV infection. A rapid serum HBsAg decline during NA therapy may identify patients who will clear HBsAg in the long-term. There are early reports among Asian patients that an HBsAg level of <100IU/ml might predict lower risk of relapse after stopping NA treatment. In clinical practice, serum HBsAg level should be used together with, but not as a substitute for, HBV DNA.

### Hepatitis B [^3a25f759]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B—monitoring of HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe-positive patients with normal ALT and low HBV DNA states that “HBeAg-negative patients with normal ALT and HBV DNA <2,000 IU/mL should be tested for ALT every 3 months during the first year to verify that they are truly in the ‘inactive carrier state’ and then every 6-12 months. (III)” and that “Tests for HBV DNA and more frequent monitoring should be performed if ALT or AST increases above the normal limit. (III).”

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^64bd4a6f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus screening and vaccination in Crohn’s disease—Before initiation of most advanced Crohn’s disease (CD) therapies, patients should be screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). If a patient is seronegative for hepatitis B, vaccination should be initiated, ideally before the introduction of biologic therapy, and assessment of serologic response is advocated after vaccination. If a patient is positive for HBsAg, antiviral prophylaxis should be initiated before starting biologic therapy; HBsAg-positive carriers receiving biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy should receive antiviral agents to avoid hepatitis B flare and liver failure, and those who are actively infected should defer acute biologic therapy initiation until adequate duration of hepatitis B antiviral therapy has been initiated. Patients who are anti-HBc positive and HBsAg negative require HBV DNA testing to assess potential reactivation risk; in anti-HBc positive patients with nonhematological diseases, the risk of HBV reactivation was 3.6%. All patients who are HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive should have HBV DNA assessed at diagnosis of HBc core positivity and periodically thereafter in addition to undergoing routine liver chemistry assessments. Other appropriate vaccinations, including pneumococcal, varicella, human papilloma virus, inactivated influenza, hepatitis A, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and herpes zoster, should be initiated ideally before use of biologic therapy; live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients using immunomodulator or biologic therapy, vaccination status should be reviewed and updated at diagnosis, and live vaccines should be avoided after initiation of systemic immune suppressive therapy.

### Isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen in human immunodeficiency virus type-1-infected individuals [^89f9d4bf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We screened 651 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected subjects for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Of a total of 387 subjects who tested negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, 142 underwent further testing for isolated presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Of these 142 subjects, 60 (42%) tested positive for anti-HBc (isolated anti-HBc). Individuals coinfected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were more likely to have isolated anti-HBc than were subjects with HIV-1 alone (80% vs. 16%, respectively). Our findings suggest that individuals with HIV-1/HCV coinfection for whom there is no serological evidence for hepatitis B virus when screened with HBsAg and anti-HBs will be positive for anti-HBc in >75% of cases. A screening strategy that tests only for HBsAg and anti-HBs in HIV-1-infected patients will miss a large number of individuals with isolated anti-HBc.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^0bc4f3cc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Serology-based counseling prior to anticancer therapy—patient messages should reflect specific HBV test patterns: Patients who have isolated anti-HBc may need further work-up because the HBV management for these patients depends on the type of anticancer therapy administered, and these patients are not at risk for transmission through sexual or close personal contact. Patients with a detectable anti-HBs but who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc can be counseled that they have protective levels of antibody from previous vaccination. Patients who are positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs have resolved hepatitis B infection and should be counseled that they are at risk, albeit lower than if they had a negative anti-HBs, of HBV reactivation. Patients who are negative for all HBV screening tests (negative HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) are considered not to be immune to HBV, have never been exposed to HBV, and may benefit from HBV vaccination, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing of anticancer therapy.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^2329787b]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HBV co-infection, AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend to decide on one of the two following approaches in patients with positive HBsAg not already receiving HBV suppressive therapy because of baseline HBV DNA level nor meeting treatment criteria:

- initiate prophylactic HBV antiviral therapy in patients with low or undetectable HBV DNA levels, and continue prophylaxis until 12 weeks after completion of direct-acting antiviral therapy

- monitor HBV DNA levels monthly during and immediately after direct-acting antiviral therapy, and initiate antiviral treatment for HBV in patients with previously undetectable or unquantifiable HBV DNA levels with rising HBV DNA > 10-fold above baseline or to > 1,000 IU/mL.
