## Question

Elevated creatinine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage elevated serum creatinine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and establishing a reliable baseline. Then, I should verify the clinical context and risk factors. Next, I will classify the pattern of creatinine change to distinguish AKI from CKD and acute kidney disease. After that, I need to determine etiology using a prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal framework. Then, I should assess severity and prognosis. Finally, I will outline immediate management, monitoring, and follow-up, including when to involve nephrology and how to handle special scenarios like ACEi/ARB-associated changes and drug-induced pseudo-AKI.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and establish a reliable baseline, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a spurious result or a transient fluctuation. I should double-check the lab value, repeat creatinine if the clinical context is discordant, and review prior values to document chronicity or acuity, since KDIGO and KDOQI emphasize not assuming chronicity from a single abnormal eGFR or creatinine and using the first documented value of the episode as the reference baseline when prior data are unavailable [^11462BoV] [^112Xhksn] [^1117AbJV].

> Wait, let me verify potential non-GFR determinants of creatinine before labeling this as kidney injury. Muscle mass, diet, hydration, and medications can shift creatinine independently of filtration, and assay interferences such as Jaffe-method cross-reactivity with nitromethane or paraproteins can cause pseudohypercreatininemia, so I should consider cystatin C or a confirmatory method if the clinical picture does not fit, especially in older adults or those with atypical body composition [^1155x1zw] [^1146SuLd] [^111evvix] [^11429waL].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and risk factors methodically. I need to check for acute illness, sepsis, surgery, contrast exposure, volume depletion, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes, hypertension, NSAIDs, and nephrotoxic drugs, and I should confirm whether the patient is on ACE inhibitors or ARBs, because these factors both predispose to AKI and shape interpretation of creatinine changes, and KDIGO recommends risk stratification and tailored monitoring in susceptible patients [^111NmB7g] [^113Rgd2X] [^1169pgFu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I will now classify the pattern of creatinine change to distinguish AKI from CKD or AKD using KDIGO criteria: AKI is an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days, whereas CKD requires decreased kidney function for at least 3 months, and AKD spans 7 to 90 days. I should confirm the timing relative to baseline and document urine output because oliguria strengthens the diagnosis and informs staging [^112LuMYS] [^11462BoV] [^111mg36D].

> I need to ensure I determine etiology using the prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal framework. Prerenal causes include hypovolemia, heart failure, liver disease, and NSAIDs, intrinsic causes include ATN, glomerulonephritis, and interstitial nephritis, and postrenal causes include obstruction, so I should examine volume status, obtain urinalysis with microscopy, calculate FeNa or FeUrea when appropriate, and use renal ultrasound if obstruction is suspected, especially in older men or those with risk factors [^111NmB7g] [^117E4SRg] [^1133HscU].

> Let me think about severity and prognosis next. I should stage AKI by KDIGO criteria and recognize that even small creatinine rises associate with worse short- and long-term outcomes, including mortality and CKD progression, so I need to communicate risk and plan close follow-up, and I should remember that in heart failure cohorts, even minor creatinine increases during hospitalization predict higher mortality and readmissions [^112LuMYS] [^114QCpNE] [^116pNAz5].

> I will now examine immediate management priorities. Stabilize hemodynamics with isotonic crystalloids if volume depleted, discontinue nephrotoxins including NSAIDs and adjust renally cleared medications, treat electrolyte disturbances and acid-base disorders, and initiate renal replacement therapy for refractory hyperkalemia, volume overload, or uremic complications. I should confirm drug dosing against kidney function and consider pharmacist support to reduce nephrotoxic exposures [^111NmB7g] [^1142XM1n].

> But wait, what if the creatinine rise followed initiation of an ACE inhibitor or ARB? I should verify the magnitude and timing, because a modest, early rise up to about 30 percent can reflect beneficial hemodynamic effects and may not mandate stopping therapy, whereas larger increases, especially beyond 30 percent, warrant reassessment for bilateral renal artery stenosis, volume depletion, or other contributors, and contemporary data show a dose–response relationship between ACEi/ARB-associated creatinine rises and long-term adverse outcomes, so I should monitor closely and individualize decisions rather than apply a rigid threshold reflexively [^113YNnPu] [^114UVwm5] [^115bTM7k].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence. For active AKI, I need to check creatinine and electrolytes frequently, often every 12 to 24 hours initially, and track urine output rigorously, while for ACEi/ARB starts or dose changes, repeating labs in 7 to 14 days is prudent, and after contrast in high-risk patients, rechecking creatinine at 12 to 72 hours is recommended. I should confirm that baseline uncertainty is addressed by repeating testing rather than imputing values [^111NmB7g] [^1125hA23] [^114c4sGP] [^1151CoVW].

> Hold on, I should verify when to involve nephrology. I need to consult for stage 3 AKI, AKI without a clear cause after initial workup, preexisting CKD stage 4 or higher, suspected glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, need for renal replacement therapy, or persistent AKI beyond 48 to 72 hours without improvement, because early specialty input can alter diagnostic and therapeutic trajectories [^111NmB7g].

> I will now examine special scenarios that can mimic kidney injury. Targeted oncology agents can inhibit tubular secretion and raise creatinine without reducing GFR, so I should double-check with cystatin C, BUN, and urine studies before altering cancer therapy, and I should remember that creatine supplementation can modestly increase measured creatinine without harming GFR, and that population data show even small outpatient creatinine rises carry short-term mortality signals, reinforcing the need for timely evaluation and follow-up [^111jDDwM] [^111wfonE] [^115K2rUH].

> Let me reconsider the long-term plan. After an AKI episode, I should arrange reassessment at about 3 months to determine resolution or evolution to CKD, continue risk-factor modification including blood pressure control and glycemic management, and align with guideline-based CKD care if chronicity is established, recognizing that AKI survivors remain at elevated risk for CKD, cardiovascular events, and mortality even if creatinine normalizes [^113Rgd2X] [^111FCq16] [^1142XM1n].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm the abnormality and exclude spurious causes, establish baseline and classify acuity, determine etiology with targeted testing, stage severity and risk, implement immediate supportive measures, monitor closely with context-specific intervals, involve nephrology when indicated, and plan longitudinal follow-up to mitigate the high risk of downstream CKD and adverse outcomes after AKI [^112LuMYS] [^111NmB7g] [^111FCq16].

Elevated creatinine reflects **reduced kidney function** or **increased production** and is never normal; even small rises signal higher risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and CKD progression [^114QCpNE] [^113aLH8Z] [^113tVgEZ]. Confirm with **repeat testing**, assess for **acute kidney injury** [^112LuMYS], and identify **reversible causes** (volume depletion, nephrotoxins, obstruction) [^111NmB7g]. Management includes correcting volume status, stopping nephrotoxins, treating the cause, and monitoring closely; **nephrology referral** is indicated for persistent elevation, AKI stage 3, or uncertain etiology [^111NmB7g]. Persistent elevation warrants evaluation for CKD and cardiovascular risk reduction [^1117AbJV].

---

## Physiological basis of creatinine elevation

Creatinine is a byproduct of **muscle metabolism** eliminated by the kidneys via filtration and secretion; serum levels reflect muscle mass, renal function, hydration, and assay factors [^1155x1zw]. Elevated serum creatinine indicates **reduced GFR** or increased production (e.g. high muscle mass, supplements) [^1155x1zw].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated creatinine

Elevated creatinine indicates **impaired renal function** and is associated with higher risks of mortality, cardiovascular events, and CKD progression [^1142XM1n]. Even small increases carry significant risk [^114QCpNE].

---

## Common causes of elevated creatinine

Elevated creatinine arises from **prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Prerenal | - Volume depletion <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Liver cirrhosis <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - ACE inhibitors/ARBs [^1133HscU] |
| Intrinsic renal | - Acute tubular necrosis <br/> - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis [^113EEpC4] |
| Postrenal | - Obstructive uropathy <br/> - Benign prostatic hyperplasia <br/> - Ureteral obstruction [^117E4SRg] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured evaluation includes:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat creatinine to exclude lab error [^113zXqz7].
- **History and exam**: Identify reversible causes and assess volume status [^111NmB7g].
- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis, electrolytes, BUN, eGFR, and consider cystatin C if creatinine is unreliable [^115JkMBh].
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound to assess obstruction or chronicity [^111NmB7g].
- **Specialized tests**: Urine protein/creatinine ratio, autoimmune serologies, or biopsy if indicated [^115nMn4q].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on correcting reversible causes, stopping nephrotoxins, and supportive care:

- **Prerenal azotemia**: Volume repletion and hemodynamic optimization [^111NmB7g].
- **Intrinsic renal injury**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. immunosuppression for glomerulonephritis) [^113Rgd2X].
- **Postrenal obstruction**: Relieve obstruction (catheterization, surgery) [^notfound].
- **General measures**: Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust drug dosing, monitor electrolytes, and provide nutritional support [^111NmB7g].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

Refer to **nephrology** for:

- Persistent elevation > 3 months (CKD) [^1117AbJV].
- AKI stage 3 or uncertain etiology [^111NmB7g].
- Rapidly rising creatinine or suspected glomerulonephritis [^115UnMZX].
- Need for renal replacement therapy [^111NmB7g].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Persistent elevation increases risks of CKD, ESRD, cardiovascular disease, and mortality [^111FCq16] [^111mg36D]. Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and comorbidities; **early detection and treatment improve outcomes** [^117E4SRg].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention centers on **risk-factor modification** and vigilant monitoring:

- **Control hypertension and diabetes**: Slow CKD progression [^1114ry3p].
- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize NSAIDs, contrast, and nephrotoxic drugs [^111NmB7g].
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate volume, especially in at-risk patients [^116639p6].
- **Monitor high-risk patients**: Regular creatinine and eGFR checks [^113Rgd2X].

---

Elevated creatinine signals **impaired renal function** and higher risks of adverse outcomes. A structured approach — confirm, identify causes, treat, and monitor — is essential, with nephrology referral for persistent or severe cases [^111NmB7g].

### Worsening renal function: what is a clinically meaningful change in creatinine during hospitalization with heart failure? [^116pNAz5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worsening renal function during hospitalization for heart failure, defined as elevation in creatinine during admission, predicts adverse outcomes. Prior studies define worsening renal function using various creatinine elevations, but the relative value of definitions is unknown.

Methods and Results

In a prospective cohort of 412 patients hospitalized for heart failure, we compared a spectrum of worsening renal function definitions (absolute creatinine elevations ≥ 0.1 to ≥ 0.5 mg/dL and 25% relative elevation from baseline) and associations with 6-month mortality, readmission, and functional decline. Creatinine elevation ≥ 0.1 mg/dL occurred in 75% of patients, and elevation ≥ 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 24% of patients. Risk of death rose with higher creatinine elevations (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89, 1.19, 1.67, 1.91, and 2.90 for elevations ≥ 0.1 to ≥ 0.5 mg/dL). Maximum sensitivity of any definition for predicting mortality was 75% and maximum specificity was 79%. High creatinine elevation was a more important predictor of death than was a single measure of baseline creatinine.

Conclusions

Larger creatinine elevations predict highest risk of death, yet even minor changes in renal function are associated with adverse outcomes. The choice of a "best definition" for worsening renal function has implications for the number of patients identified with this risk factor and the magnitude of risk for mortality.

### Urinary kidney injury biomarkers and urine creatinine normalization: a false premise or not? [^113eHktC]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Substantial research has focused on the discovery of urinary biomarkers to detect acute kidney injury (AKI) before a rise in serum creatinine. As in chronic kidney diseases, the concentrations of urinary AKI biomarkers have been normalized to urine creatinine concentration to account for creatinine clearance and urine flow. Waikar et al. challenge the assumption that normalization to creatinine clearance in a chronic disease state can be extrapolated to an acute state, in which creatinine clearance is, by definition, changing acutely.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^117QPeGE]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine is measured as a concentration and is therefore affected by variations in volume status. As a result, the diagnosis of AKI may be delayed or missed in patients with significant fluid shifts or fluid overload. This was highlighted in a post-hoc analysis of the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. It revealed that AKI was unmasked or classified differently in up to 18% of patients after serum creatinine levels were adjusted for net fluid balance and estimated total body water. Affected patients had mortality rates similar to those with AKI that was present before adjustment.

Another important limitation of all creatinine-based definitions of AKI is that they require a reference value to describe "baseline" renal function. Ideally, this value should reflect the patient's steady-state kidney function just before the episode of AKI. However, information on pre-hospital kidney function is not always available so that various surrogate estimates are frequently used. These may include inpatient results or the imputation of values such as back-calculating a baseline creatinine and using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m² in patients with missing data. Unfortunately, these methods can inflate as well as reduce the true incidence of AKI. At present, there is no standard approach to determining baseline renal function.

Creatinine-based criteria for AKI often do not take into account underlying renal reserve. In patients with normal kidney function, a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl may indeed be due to an important reduction in GFR. In contrast, in patients with underlying CKD, absolute rises in serum creatinine represent variable changes in GFR, and a rise by 0.3 mg/dl may be within the acceptable daily variation and simply reflect an inconsequential change in GFR. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing KDIGO AKI stage 3 which is defined by a rise in serum creatinine to > 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 353.6 μmol/l). A patient with a baseline serum creatinine of 3.9 mg/dl (345 μmol/l) who experiences a creatinine rise by 0.3 mg/dl in 48 h would be classified as having KDIGO AKI stage 3, whereas such a rise would be defined as AKI stage 1 in a patient with normal baseline renal function.

### Arsenic exposure, assessment, toxicity, diagnosis, and management: guidance for occupational and environmental physicians [^112WPpe5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Urine arsenic testing — specimen type, creatinine adjustment, dietary confounding, and alternative matrices are characterized as follows: Traditionally, a 24-hour urinary arsenic was considered the most definitive diagnostic laboratory test, but a spot urine arsenic is much easier to collect and is now more commonly used to assess individual patients and in large population studies. Adjusting the urine arsenic by the creatinine concentration may theoretically account for dilution or concentration of the spot urine (µg/g creatinine), and adjusting the arsenic concentration for creatinine concentration is recommended by some authors for spot urine arsenic samples; however, many population studies of drinking water arsenic exposure use spot urine arsenic levels, which are not adjusted for creatinine, and because creatinine concentration in the urine is significantly associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index, variations in µg/g creatinine may reflect the creatinine denominator rather than exposure. Ingestion of shellfish, fish, or seaweed can cause elevated total urine arsenic and confound the estimation of iAs exposure; speciation of urine arsenic levels allows the quantification of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites and shows organic forms, and a spot urine arsenic could be collected again after 1 to 2 weeks abstinence from seafood or fish consumption. Urine should be collected in metal-free polyethylene containers but not acid-rinsed containers, and if urine arsenic is normal and arsenic toxicity is still suspected, hair and nail testing may help identify arsenic exposure.

### Acute kidney injury in critical care: time for a paradigm shift? [^11517ZeP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute alterations in renal function are commonly encountered in various settings with varied clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. Our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been fairly stagnant, until recently largely limited by a lack of concerted efforts in the field. This review summarizes the recent advances and provides an overview of emerging trends in this field.

Recent Findings

One of the limitations in our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been the lack of a standardized definition and staging criteria for this disorder. New information on the epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury has emerged providing an opportunity to reappraise our approach to this disease. Also, there has been new work on the relationship of alterations of renal function to short and long-term outcomes, particularly mortality.

Summary

To translate advances from basic research to clinical application a multidisciplinary approach is required. New research in the field of biomarkers combined with clinical markers will lead to therapies that can be introduced earlier in the course of the disease and, hopefully, lead to a decrease in mortality from this potentially reversible condition.

### Prognosis and serum creatinine levels in acute renal failure at the time of nephrology consultation: an observational cohort study [^115SdCJB]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

We chose to calculate the percentage change in creatinine respect to its baseline because serum creatinine is modulated by muscle bulk. Therefore, smaller changes as 0.3 or 0.5 mg/dL will have distinct significance for patients with different genders and/or ages, whose normal baseline levels are different. For this reason, we found that a relative increase in creatinine was more accurate than an absolute increase one.

The higher presence of chronic renal failure in the < 101% increment group might be explained because concern about it could have induced earlier nephrology consultation, even if the patient did not present signs of ARF in that time. However, we must admit that 74 chronic renal failure patients (48.68%) might have presented an unstable serum creatinine value at hospital admission, thus underestimating the severity of ARF for them. Chronic renal failure was included in this study to represent the common clinical practice, and thereafter it was adjusted for in the analysis because of expecting different outcomes than the general population.

On the other hand, the higher proportion of cases of ARF developed in the community in the ≥ 101% increase group might suggest that nephrology consultation may have been delayed because of time spent before hospital admittance, giving serum creatinine an extra time to reach a higher value.

Our results about mortality in the Renal Replacement Therapy sub-group are consistent with previously reported, and it is of interest the higher mortality rate in patients in the ≥ 101% increase group. What we may learn here is that this group of patients is most likely to benefit from a more intensive treatment.

The degree of renal injury is likely to affect renal recovery. Patients where consultation was started with ≥ 101% creatinine increase had significant higher creatinine levels at discharge compared to their baseline levels, and many of them would be expected to develop chronic renal malfunction. Adjustment for confounding factors in the analysis was done, too.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114YTEht]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^115bTM7k]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Many post hoc analyses of clinical trials have examined the prognostic significance of a deterioration in renal function after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. In clinical trials of patients with heart failure, deterioration in renal function after starting ACEI/ARB treatment is commonly found. Although this deterioration is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients with preserved renal function, the overall benefits of ACEI/ARB treatment compared with placebo remain for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Our study does not undermine that evidence but flags that the risk-benefit ratio may differ among patients with marked changes in creatinine concentrations. This is particularly the case for other prescribing indications for which the clinical trial evidence is less clear.

The recommendation in many international guidelines to stop ACEI/ARB treatment if creatinine rises by 30% or more after initiation are founded on a single review of 12 clinical trials of ACEI/ARB treatment for diabetes and heart failure. Studies included in this review evaluated progression of renal disease among patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Of these studies, only six were double blinded and included a total of 1102 participants. These trials were published during 1993–97 and may not relate to patients receiving contemporary routine clinical care. The methods that define a cut-off level of creatinine increase at 30% for cessation are not clearly presented. In addition, the results provided by these studies are not supported by later trials. Recent reviews have not shown the superiority of ACEI/ARBs compared with other antihypertensive drugs for treating early non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, diabetes with normal renal function, and diabetes and chronic kidney disease. A UK multicentre interventional trial to compare the outcomes of continuation versus cessation of ACEI/ARB treatment is under way in response to observational evidence that stopping ACEI/ARB treatment may slow progression in advanced renal disease.

A fixed recommendation to stop ACEI/ARB treatment only if creatinine is increased by 30% or more is also hard to reconcile with the growing body of evidence related to acute kidney injury, which shows that even a small deterioration in renal function is associated with a subsequently increased risk of mortality and other adverse outcomes. It is important to consider that the prognostic significance of ACEI/ARB associated renal impairment may depend on the underlying cause and on subsequent changes in renal function if ACEI/ARB treatment is continued. Underlying causes may be different in the routine care setting, in which patients are older, have multiple comorbidities, and have more advanced kidney disease compared with patients who participated in early clinical trials.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1125hA23]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor for increased serum creatinine and for increased serum potassium levels when ACEis, ARBs, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used, or for hypokalemia when diuretics are used at routine visits and 7–14 days after initiation or after a dose change.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^111HQHz8]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a complex disorder that occurs in a variety of settings with clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. It is often under-recognized and is associated with severe consequences. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate the wide variation in etiologies and risk factors, describe the increased mortality associated with this disease (particularly when dialysis is required), and suggest a relationship to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progression to dialysis dependency. Emerging evidence suggests that even minor changes in serum creatinine are associated with increased in-patient mortality. ARF has been the focus of extensive clinical and basic research efforts over the last decades. The lack of a universally recognized definition of ARF has posed a significant limitation. Despite the significant progress made in understanding the biology and mechanism of ARF in animal models, translation of this knowledge into improved management and outcomes for patients has been limited.

During the last five years, several groups have recognized these limitations and have worked to identify the knowledge gaps and define the necessary steps to correct these deficiencies. These efforts have included consensus conferences and publications from the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) ARF Advisory group, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) groups. Additionally, the critical care societies have developed formal intersociety collaborations such as the International Consensus Conferences in Critical Care. Recognizing that future clinical and translational research in ARF will require multidisciplinary collaborative networks, the ADQI group and representatives from three nephrology societies (ASN, ISN, and NKF) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine met in Vicenza, Italy, in September 2004. They proposed the term acute kidney injury (AKI) to reflect the entire spectrum of ARF, recognizing that an acute decline in kidney function is often secondary to an injury that causes functional or structural changes in the kidneys. The group established the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) as an independent collaborative network comprised of experts selected by the participating societies to represent both their area of expertise and their sponsoring organization. AKIN is intended to facilitate international, interdisciplinary, and intersocietal collaborations to ensure progress in the field of AKI and obtain the best outcomes for patients with or at risk for AKI.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114mzS29]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — definition, staging, screening, and risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI): The first recommendation is that contrast-induced AKI be defined and staged using the KDIGO definition and staging criteria, while noting that most clinical studies have used thresholds including increments in serum creatinine level of ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% relative to baseline and/or an absolute change in serum creatinine level ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 2–5 days following iodinated contrast media. The applicability of the urine output criteria to the diagnosis and staging for this form of AKI is uncertain and most episodes of contrast-induced AKI are nonoliguric. For pre-procedure risk identification, measuring serum creatinine prior to all contrast-enhanced procedures is neither practical nor feasible; simple questionnaires have been shown to be effective for identifying patients at higher risk of abnormal underlying renal function, and in patients without a recent serum creatinine measurement it is reasonable to use such questionnaires to identify patients who should have serum creatinine measured prior to contrast administration. Additional risk factors to recognize include diabetes in the setting of renal impairment, heart failure, repeated contrast exposure over short periods, and concomitant nephrotoxin administration (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aminoglycosides).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^11462BoV]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation (assessment of chronicity), KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to do not assume chronicity based on a single abnormal level for eGFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio, as the finding could be the result of a recent AKI event or acute kidney disease.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^112gSqy1]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with serious short- and long-term complications. Early diagnosis and identification of the underlying aetiology are essential to guide management. In this review, we outline the current definition of AKI and the potential pitfalls, and summarise the existing and future tools to investigate AKI in critically ill patients.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^113tVgEZ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications

In routine primary care, most patients starting treatment with an ACEI/ARB have only minor changes in renal function. However, increases in creatinine concentrations of more than 10% after starting ACEI/ARB treatment affect more than 15% of patients and have important implications. We have shown that creatinine increases after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment were associated with cardiorenal risks in a "dose-response" relation, with no distinct cut-off at 30%, as previously suggested. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether ACEI/ARB associated changes in renal function unmask underlying pathophysiology or lead directly to adverse outcomes by causing permanent renal impairment in some patients. In addition, a better understanding of the overall risk-benefit ratio of continuing treatment after loss of kidney function for different prescribing indications is needed. Most importantly, patients with substantial increases in creatinine after starting ACEI/ARB treatment should be recognised as a very high risk group needing close ongoing monitoring. Review is needed of the risks and potential benefits of continuation of drug treatment for the specific prescribing indication for each patient.

### Practical guidance for the management of adverse events in patients with KRASG12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer receiving adagrasib [^1148dr6r]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood Creatinine Elevation

Treatment-related blood creatinine increase occurred in 26% of patients in cohort A of the KRYSTAL-1 study. Median time to onset was 11 days (IQR 8–46) and median time from onset to resolution was 19 days (IQR 14–36). The increase led to dose reductions and interruptions in 1 patient (1%) and 7 patients (6%), respectively.

Blood creatinine increases may represent pre-renal or post-renal causes, so volume status should be assessed and a low threshold for fluid replacement should be applied. Blood creatinine levels should be monitored regularly during treatment (every month for 3 months if the patient does not experience abnormalities). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen for pain) should be avoided or used with caution when creatinine is elevated. Preclinical models have not supported evidence for nephrotoxicity due to adagrasib. It should be noted that mild blood creatinine increases may be artificial (eg, due to multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 inhibition) and have no effect on the glomerular filtration rate.

7.2 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

Serum Electrolytes: [See Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Creatinine: Minor reversible increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients with essential hypertension treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride. Increases in creatinine are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Other (causal relationships unknown): Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride administration. Elevations of serum bilirubin and uric acid have been reported as have scattered incidents of elevations of liver enzymes.

### Varenicline-associated acute renal failure [^116rUCpT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an association between acute renal failure and varenicline.

Case Summary

A 53-year-old white male with preexisting moderate renal insufficiency was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure following a change in serum creatinine from 4 mg/dL at baseline to 10.6 mg/dL upon admission. One week prior to admission, the patient started taking varenicline (dose undetermined) for smoking cessation and had been stable on all other medications for 2 months prior to admission. All hospital workup tests were negative for prerenal azotemia, postrenal obstruction, and intrinsic renal disease. Varenicline was discontinued on admission. With no other changes in therapy, the serum creatinine level decreased each day of the patient's 5-day hospitalization to 8.6 mg/dL upon discharge, and it was 6.4 mg/dL at a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after discharge.

Discussion

Varenicline is a novel medication that is effective for smoking cessation. Adverse effects are generally mild and self-limiting, with gastro-intestinal effects most commonly reported. According to the package insert, varenicline does not change creatinine clearance to any appreciable extent, but it should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. It also states that varenicline can cause acute renal failure rarely; to our knowledge, this is the first published association of varenicline with renal effects. Use of the Naranjo probability scale showed varenicline to be the probable cause of renal dysfunction in this patient because of the temporal relationship and lack of alternative causes.

Conclusions

Although there was a probable relationship between varenicline and acute renal failure in this patient, the significant benefit of smoking cessation to overall health outweighs the risk of this rare adverse effect. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect and should monitor renal function upon initiation of varenicline therapy, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1155x1zw]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Appendix J. Creatinine-based eGFR — creatinine is an end-product of muscle metabolism, filtered by the kidney without reabsorption, and also secreted by renal tubules into urine, which accounts for 10–20% of creatinine elimination; blood levels reflect creatinine generation and elimination. Creatinine-based equations account for differences by age or sex and assume that for a given age and sex a person has average muscle mass, but may be inaccurate in extremes of body weight/habitus or diseases that significantly affect muscle mass. Vegetarian diets, high protein diets, or creatine supplements can alter creatinine generation and the accuracy of these equations, and medications that affect tubular secretion of creatinine can lead to higher creatinine levels that are not reflective of changes in GFR.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Prerenal success in chronic kidney disease [^1143fW5X]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics are commonly prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease to reduce systemic blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin inhibitors also reduce intraglomerular pressure. The lower pressures may result in initial increases in the serum creatinine. The long-term renoprotection provided by these therapies establishes the basis for tolerating the initial increases. However, physicians are sometimes reluctant to continue these treatments when the serum creatinine increases. Several reasons for this reluctance are discussed, including the failure to distinguish between hemodynamic- and parenchymal-mediated changes in kidney function. In addition, the lack of a formal term and place in our diagnostic algorithm for increases in serum creatinine that derive from ultimately beneficial hemodynamic alterations may be a hindrance. The term "prerenal success" is proposed to describe hemodynamic alterations associated with improved prognosis and is placed in a new algorithm. Finally, recent literature describing harmful effects of increases in serum creatinine in other cohorts is reviewed; these cohorts are sufficiently different from the stable chronic kidney disease patient that the results ought not to be extrapolated.

### Long-term outcomes of acute kidney injury [^111FCq16]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The goal of this review is to summarize the recent plethora of data that relate to long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury (AKI).

Recent Findings

Surviving patients with AKI are still at high risk for long-term adverse outcomes, even if serum creatinine returns to normal. After adjusting for potential confounders, many recent studies have demonstrated that AKI is independently associated with chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and premature death. Unfortunately, definitive evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that prevention or treatment of AKI prevents long-term adverse outcomes is not yet available.

Summary

AKI is clearly a prognostic marker for poor long-term outcomes, but more studies will be needed to determine whether AKI is truly causal and whether or not the risk is modifiable.

### Renal insufficiency as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in elderly individuals [^116LeeCb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between elevated creatinine levels and cardiovascular events.

Background

End-stage renal disease is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The association of mild to moderate renal insufficiency with cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective population-based study of subjects, aged > 65 years, who had a serum creatinine measured at baseline (n = 5,808) and were followed for a median of 7.3 years. Proportional hazards models were used to examine the association of creatinine to all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Renal insufficiency was defined as a creatinine level ≥ 1.5 mg/dl in men or ≥ 1.3 mg/dl in women.

Results

An elevated creatinine level was present in 648 (11.2%) participants. Subjects with elevated creatinine had higher overall (76.7 vs. 29.5/1,000 years, p < 0.001) and cardiovascular (35.8 vs. 13.0/1,000 years, p < 0.001) mortality than those with normal creatinine levels. They were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (54.0 vs. 31.8/1,000 years, p < 0.001), stroke (21.1 vs. 11.9/1,000 years, p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (38.7 vs. 17/1,000 years, p < 0.001), and symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (10.6 vs. 3.5/1,000 years, p < 0.001). After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical disease measures, elevated creatinine remained a significant predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), claudication, and congestive heart failure (CHF). A linear increase in risk was observed with increasing creatinine.

Conclusions

Elevated creatinine levels are common in older adults and are associated with increased risk of mortality, CVD, and CHF. The increased risk is apparent early in renal disease.

### Effect of elevated admission serum creatinine and its worsening on outcome in hospitalized patients with decompensated heart failure [^112XvsKj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Renal insufficiency (RI), as represented by elevated serum creatinine (> 1.5 mg/dl) on admission, is common and found in almost half of patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure. This finding is associated with prolongation of length of stay and rate of rehospitalizations after discharge and also has an independent unfavorable effect on 6-month mortality. Similarly, an increase in serum creatinine (> 0.5 mg/dl) in the hospital results in a significantly longer length of stay and has an independent effect on long-term mortality.

### Abemaciclib-induced pseudo-AKI: an underrecognised finding [^111jDDwM]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Targeted therapy-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) can complicate oncologic treatment. We present a case of creatinine elevation induced by abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitor used in advanced breast cancer which can also cause nephrotoxicity. A female patient in her mid-sixties was referred to nephrology for elevated serum creatinine after starting abemaciclib. Diagnostic workup, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum cystatin C, urine protein measurement, and serum electrolytes revealed no evidence of renal dysfunction. This case emphasises the importance of distinguishing creatinine elevation from true nephrotoxicity to avoid unnecessary treatment adjustments. Abemaciclib and other targeted therapies can induce creatinine elevation by inhibiting proximal tubule secretory transporters, rather than through direct nephrotoxicity. By incorporating additional assessments such as BUN, serum cystatin C, and additional biomarkers including urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule 1, clinicians can distinguish creatinine elevation from AKI to guide appropriate management of oncologic diseases.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^113LUECJ]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical importance of AKD needs to be further assessed. Retrospective cohort data based only on changes in serum creatinine values and with limited clinical context suggest a relevance for AKD: the population of patients who meet laboratory criteria for AKD but not CKD or AKI is relatively large, and these individuals have increased risks of incident and progressive CKD, kidney failure (formally referred to as "end-stage kidney disease"), and death, confirming the need to better define and classify AKD. Furthermore, a revised definition and classification of AKD could be better harmonized with both the definitions and classifications of AKI and CKD and tie to clinical management. As in adults, the AKI/AKD/CKD spectrum should be unified in children, and definitions should be the same for children and adults. A special consideration in children, as well as in adults with low muscle mass, is a reduced serum creatinine concentration, which may impact AKI diagnosis.

The assessment of renal recovery is still controversial, and its definition is essential given the implications for patients and clinicians. Issues related to assessment of recovery include changes in creatinine generation due to reduction in muscle mass, among others.

Advances in diagnosis of AKI

Serum creatinine and urine output continue to be the foundational measures for AKI diagnosis even though their limitations are well known. In the future, kidney damage biomarkers, biopsy, and imaging may be useful for staging AKI, classification of cause, prognosis, and treatment. However, currently there is insufficient information about any of these measures to warrant addition to the AKI definition. Given that the global availability of novel biomarkers is limited, incorporating them into definitions will be challenging. Measurements of real-time or kinetic GFR are research tools at present, and more evidence is needed regarding their clinical applicability (Table 2).

Both urine output and serum creatinine level should continue to be used; ideally, the new AKI guideline would provide further clarification as to the role of these measurements. If possible, both should be ascertained. However, if serum creatinine measurements are not immediately available, urine output criteria should be used.

### Short-term effects of vitamin D receptor activation on serum creatinine, creatinine generation, and glomerular filtration [^115keRKH]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D receptor activation may have pleiotropic effects in a variety of tissues. Experimental studies with vitamin D receptor activation demonstrate an ability to delay progression of renal disease. In humans, vitamin D receptor activation reduces albuminuria. Yet some clinical studies demonstrate that patients receiving vitamin D supplementation have an elevation in serum creatinine and a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. These observations may be explainable by an effect of vitamin D receptor activation on creatinine metabolism.

### Defining acute kidney injury: what is the most appropriate metric? [^116vMrdK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a reduction in GFR. GFR is, however, rarely measured in clinical practice; instead, serum markers (primarily creatinine) are used to define AKI. Because serum creatinine level is not linearly related to GFR, the performance of this marker is associated with ascertainment bias and poor sensitivity. In this article we discuss the limitations and pitfalls of using serum markers to define AKI, and offer some suggestions for the future.

Are There Other Causes of a Falsely Elevated Serum Creatinine Level?

The concentration of creatinine in serum is the most widely used and commonly accepted measure of renal function in clinical medicine. In renal failure, deterioration of renal function, results in the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products, including creatinine.

In the absence of renal failure, elevated creatinine levels may be due to factors influencing creatine production as well as elimination. The total muscle mass is the most important determinant of the creatine pool size and thereby of creatinine production. Hence serum creatinine is increased in people with increased muscle mass, those with a high-meat diet, users of anabolic steroids, and weight lifters. Trauma or febrile states have been associated with significant increases in the excretion of creatinine.

Rhabdomyolysis or extensive crush injury may result in an increase of serum creatinine, at times exceeding what can be accounted for by the decrement in renal function, the excess creatinine is generally assumed to derive from injured muscle. But it was found that phosphocreatine was present in muscle in sufficient amounts to serve as a direct intermediate in the conversion of phosphocreatine to creatinine.

Other substances that can cause false elevations of the measured serum creatinine determined by the Jaffe method include ketoacids, acetone, pyruvate, glucose, uric acid, proteins, creatine, ascorbic acid, dopamine, and certain cephalosporins. High concentrations of bilirubin can falsely lower the serum creatinine concentration determined by the Jaffe method. Enzymatic methods for determining serum creatinine concentration are not affected by the presence of nitromethane in serum. Substances that can interfere with this enzymatic method when present in the serum include creatine, bilirubin, dopamine, dobutamine, ascorbic acid, and calcium dobesilate.

What are Some Other Common Laboratory Analysis Cross-reactivities of Interest to Toxicologists?

The techniques for detecting the presence of drugs include a variety of chromatographic methods, immunoassays, and chemical and spectrometric techniques. A number of interferences resulting in "false-positive" results have been reported. Some common, important interferences resulting in false-positive results are listed in Table 1.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^115K2rUH]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The significant impact Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) has on patient morbidity and mortality emphasizes the need for early recognition and effective treatment. AKI presenting to or occurring during hospitalisation has been widely studied but little is known about the incidence and outcomes of patients experiencing acute elevations in serum creatinine in the primary care setting where people are not subsequently admitted to hospital. The aim of this study was to define this incidence and explore its impact on mortality.

Methods

The study cohort was identified by using hospital data bases over a six month period.

Inclusion criteria: People with a serum creatinine request during the study period, 18 or over and not on renal replacement therapy.

The patients were stratified by a rise in serum creatinine corresponding to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria for comparison purposes. Descriptive and survival data were then analysed.

Ethical approval was granted from National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee South East Coast and from the National Information Governance Board.

Results

The total study population was 61,432. 57,300 subjects with 'no AKI', mean age 64. The number (mean age) of acute serum creatinine rises overall were, 'AKI 1' 3,798 (72), 'AKI 2' 232 (73), and 'AKI 3' 102 (68) which equates to an overall incidence of 14,192 pmp/year (adult). Unadjusted 30 day survival was 99.9% in subjects with 'no AKI', compared to 98.6%, 90.1% and 82.3% in those with 'AKI 1', 'AKI 2' and 'AKI 3' respectively. After multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, baseline kidney function and co-morbidity the odds ratio of 30 day mortality was 5.3 (95% CI 3.6, 7.7), 36.8 (95% CI 21.6, 62.7) and 123 (95% CI 64.8, 235) respectively, compared to those without acute serum creatinine rises as defined.

Conclusions

People who develop acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care without being admitted to hospital have significantly worse outcomes than those with stable kidney function.

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wfonE]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that creatine supplementation is associated with a modest increase in serum creatinine levels but does not adversely affect glomerular filtration rate. These results indicate that creatine is likely safe for kidney function in healthy individuals and various clinical populations when used within standard dosing protocols. However, researchers and clinicians should interpret elevated serum creatinine levels in the context of supplementation with caution and consider more specific renal function markers for accurate assessment.

### Serum creatinine levels and renal insufficiency… [^111fzoVp]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

A rise in serum creatinine or potassium level may result in discontinuation of the drug or use of lower dosages than what is recommended because of concerns about safety and tolerability in patients with renal insufficiency. Bakris and Weir reviewed 12 randomized trials to determine if an initial reduction in the glomerular filtration rate or elevation of serum creatinine levels from use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs results in long-term protection against decline in renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal disease progression among patients with preexisting renal insufficiency was evaluated over a three-year period. The evaluations included patients with and without diabetes mellitus or systolic heart failure. GFR data was used if serum creatinine values were unavailable.

A limited elevation in serum creatinine level was seen following initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients who achieved their blood pressure goal. The increase usually occurred within two weeks of therapy. Regardless of the serum creatinine value, manifestations of renal failure were not apparent until the GFR was well below 30 mL per minute. Patients with the greatest degree of renal insufficiency experienced the greatest protection from renal disease progression. As renal disease increases, there is a loss of renal reserve as well as the autoregulatory ability of the kidney, resulting in a more acute fall in GFR following ACE inhibition. The studies also indicated that there is a low risk of hyperkalemia with use of drugs that block the reninangiotensin system. Results indicated that use of drugs that block the RAS is appropriate in patients with renal insufficiency.

Once marked elevations in serum creatinine levels are present and renal reserve is lost, the unique benefits of ACE inhibitors may not exceed that of achieving the recommended level of blood pressure reduction alone. Data from these studies in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease demonstrated that if an elevation in the serum creatinine level does occur, it stabilizes quickly and does not progressively worsen. In addition, this reduction in GFR is reversible. The authors conclude that no one should be denied a long-term trial of an ACE inhibitor because of a preexisting elevation of serum creatinine level or one that increases up to 30 percent from baseline and then stabilizes within two to three weeks. If elevations in serum creatinine of more than 30 percent occur on a chronic basis within the first month or if hyperkalemia occurs, the drug should be withdrawn.

### Fluctuations in serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^113oe6hz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Creatinine level–based eGFR may not accurately reflect the severity of the kidney injury in the acute setting, as creatinine levels are often not increased until several days after AKI has occurred. Despite this shortcoming, the use of creatinine level–based eGFR has distinct advantages compared with current risk stratification strategies, which focus on the presence of AKI and an increase in serum creatinine levels over time. First, reliance on the definition of AKI may fail to recognize clinical outcomes of patients with smaller serum creatinine increases or variable creatinine level fluctuations. Second, these approaches still require information on baseline serum creatinine levels, which is not always available. In addition, efforts to estimate baseline creatinine levels from in-hospital creatinine tests or by using other patient-based equations were inaccurate and resulted in misclassifications of AKI.

A possible explanation for our findings is that an observed decrease in kidney function during hospitalization might reveal an existing decreased kidney reserve, unmasked by the stress of acute illness. Even though kidney function may seem to be recovered at discharge, the persistent reduction in kidney reserve could have long-term implications. Setting the threshold for normal kidney function at an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m² revealed no associations with 1-year mortality, implying that more substantial kidney damage may be required to influence long-term outcomes.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^111mg36D]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden (within 7 days) loss of kidney function that is determined on the basis of reduced urinary output and/or increased serum creatinine levels. Acute kidney disease (AKD) includes a variety of acute and subacute kidney conditions, including AKI, lasting for up to 90 days. AKD can persist after incomplete resolution of an AKI episode or AKD can develop without ever meeting AKI criteria, for example, when kidney dysfunction evolves slowly. Kidney dysfunction lasting for > 3 months is referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

As the diagnostic markers of AKI, serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output (UO), have poor sensitivity and specificity, it is possible that a healthy individual with transient volume depletion could fulfill the diagnostic criteria of AKI without having kidney injury or long-term health implications. Therefore, clinical judgement is required to diagnose AKI and consider the clinical context. AKI persisting despite volume repletion likely reflects structural damage to the kidney. Similarly, drugs that affect glomerular filtration may cause small changes in SCr levels that are not necessarily indicative of kidney injury.

AKI is a syndrome affecting 10–15% of hospitalized patients and more than 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. AKI can be caused by different etiologies and the large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence demonstrates that the AKI burden extends beyond the acute phase with progression to CKD, recurrent episodes of AKI, increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and reduced long-term survival. Finding specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the fact that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Existing animal models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human AKI, which is often multifactorial. In addition, many clinical trials do not enroll patients with the precise mechanisms and timing modeled in animal experiments thereby limiting translation. Therefore, the main focus lies on preventing AKI development and progression. Recently, several trials have identified measures to prevent the development of AKI in different settings.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, AKI-CKD transition, preventive strategies, as well as the choice of endpoints for AKI prevention trials. A discussion of other AKI etiologies (e.g. glomerulonephritis, vasculitis), AKI management and renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Pseudohypercreatininemia after surgery for aortic dissection: a case report [^111evvix]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated creatinine concentrations often indicate acute renal injury and renal biopsies are considered in this situation. However, pseudohypercreatininemia is potential cause of elevated creatinine concentrations, and invasive interventions should be avoided.

Case presentation

A 54-year-old woman underwent surgery for descending aortic dissection. Nine days postoperatively, her creatinine concentration increased from 1 mg/dl to 5.78 mg/dl (normal range, 0.47–0.7 mg/dl). Azotemia and hyperkalemia were absent and physical examination findings were unremarkable. Cystatin C concentration was 1.56 mg/l (normal range, 0.56–0.8 mg/l) and pseudohypercreatininemia was suspected. Testing with different reagents showed a creatinine concentration of 0.84 mg/dl. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G was markedly elevated, and creatinine and IgG fluctuated in parallel, suggesting the cause of the pseudohypercreatininemia. IgG4 was also elevated at 844 mg/dl. Immunosuppressive steroid therapy effectively decreased the IgG concentration and resolved the pseudohypercreatininemia.

Conclusions

In cases of elevated creatinine concentration with the presence of abnormal proteins, pseudohypercreatininemia should be considered. We report a rare case of pseudohypercreatininemia caused by polyclonal IgG.

### Acute kidney injury [^114DQC2P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or oliguria, and classified by stage and cause. This type of injury occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, with major complications including volume overload, electrolyte disorders, uremic complications, and drug toxicity. Management includes specific treatments according to the underlying cause and supportive treatment to prevent and manage complications. Kidney replacement therapy is used when complications cannot be managed with medical therapy alone. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy remains approximately 50%.

### Ramipril [^112cZnAN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen

Increases in creatinine levels occurred in 1.2% of patients receiving ramipril alone, and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril and a diuretic. Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 3% of patients receiving ramipril with a diuretic. None of these increases required discontinuation of treatment. Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. As ramipril decreases aldosterone secretion, elevation of serum potassium can occur. Use potassium supplements and potassium sparing diuretics with caution, and monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].

Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit (a low value and a decrease of 5 g/dL or 5%, respectively) were rare, occurring in 0.4% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril plus a diuretic. No US patients discontinued treatment because of decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit.

Other (causal relationships unknown)

Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with ramipril administration. Elevations of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, uric acid, and blood glucose have been reported, as have cases of hyponatremia and scattered incidents of leucopenia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria. In US trials, less than 0.2% of patients discontinued treatment for laboratory abnormalities; all of these were cases of proteinuria or abnormal liver-function tests.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^111MKuJi]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension, heart failure, diabetic microalbuminuria, and proteinuric renal disease and after myocardial infarction. Patients may, however, have a sudden decline in kidney function after starting to take these drugs, owing to antagonism of angiotensin II mediated efferent arteriolar constriction. Despite unambiguous recommendations to detect sudden renal impairment by monitoring serum creatinine before and after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment and to discontinue treatment if creatinine concentrations increase by 30% or more, recent data show that only 10% of patients receive the recommended monitoring and only 20% of those with a creatinine increase of 30% or more after starting ACEI/ARB treatment discontinue the drugs.

Clinical trial data has indicated that ACEI/ARB induced renal impairment is uncommon. Patients seen in routine clinical practice are, however, on average older and have more comorbidity than those eligible for trials. As a consequence, the absolute risk of increases in creatinine of 30% or more in the community setting is not negligible. Although this level of creatinine increase after starting ACEI/ARB treatment raises concern about the long term balance of risks and benefits, smaller increases (< 30%) do not prompt consideration of treatment discontinuation according to current guidelines. The rationale for the 30% threshold in the context of adverse clinical outcomes is unclear, as little evidence is available on the actual risks associated with creatinine increases of less than 30%.

Considering the high prevalence of ACEI/ARB use in general practice, any additional previously unrecognised risks would have major clinical and public health implications. We therefore used real world data to examine the cardiorenal risks associated with different levels of increase in creatinine after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^116639p6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional, and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians, and other health-care professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^115bXUTo]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study suggests patients who develop acute SCr elevations in primary care and are not subsequently admitted to hospital have a significantly increased mortality compared to those whose SCr is stable. The increased mortality appears to be temporally associated with the acute SCr elevation, i.e. within 30 days, suggesting a direct association between the event and adverse outcome. This association persists even after multiple adjustments for potential confounders. Further studies are required to examine the potential causal association between these events in primary care and poor outcome. Clearly if there is a causal relationship this would be an important area in which to intervene.

### Case files of the California poison control system, San Francisco division: blue thunder ingestion: methanol, nitromethane, and elevated creatinine [^1146SuLd]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

In a human case report, a 20-year-old woman who had worked for 2 years using a mixture of trichlorotrifluoroethane (94%), methanol (6%), and nitromethane (0.25%) developed Parkinsonism in the absence of other potential etiologies. The authors concluded that exposure to nitromethane could have been the cause of the Parkinsonism. A 19-year-old man developed a primary, symmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy after a 2-month exposure to an industrial solvent composed primarily of 1-bromopropane, but also containing nitromethane and other components. The authors attributed the neuropathy to the 1-bromopropane exposure.

The limited acute toxicity of nitromethane suggests that exposures require only supportive care with no specific therapy. Although different racing car fuels contain varying concentrations of nitromethane and methanol, management of this mixed poisoning should focus on the appropriate treatment for methanol toxicity.

Why is There a False Elevation of Creatinine with Nitromethane?

Nitromethane cause spurious elevations of the serum creatinine when the Jaffe colorimetric method is used to determine serum creatinine concentration. This method involves injecting a sample of the patient's serum into an alkaline picrate solution. Creatinine in the sample combines with alkaline picrate to form a red-colored complex or chromophore, the light absorbance of which can then be measured in the 470–550 nm range using a double-beam spectrophotometer. The rate of absorbance is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration in the serum. Nitromethane also forms a red chromophore with alkaline picrate with an absorbance similar to that of the creatinine-picrate chromophore. Thus, when nitromethane is present in a patient's serum, the reaction of both creatinine and nitromethane with alkaline picrate can result in a significantly but spuriously elevated creatinine concentration.

### Apparent renal disease due to elevated creatinine levels associated with the use of boldenone [^1157kHk3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The widespread use of reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alongside serum creatinine has led to a heightened appreciation of renal disease. However, creatinine is recognized as an insensitive marker of true GFR and therefore can lead to misdiagnosis of renal dysfunction in the absence of true pathology. We report the case of a 37-year-old male referred due to abnormal eGFR and creatinine in the absence of clinical signs, symptoms or other biochemical abnormalities of renal disease. Subsequent investigations based on a high index of suspicion for exogenous substance abuse led to a novel observation of significantly raised creatinine due to the presence of boldenone, an equine anabolic steroid commonly abused in body building.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — implementation considerations — emphasize that "It is important to differentiate between progression of chronic disease and acute injury", and that "small changes in GFR could be consistent with AKI, whereas only large changes in GFR would indicate progressive CKD", so "Clinicians will need to attend to other clinical indicators to be able to accurately identify the cause of changes in GFR". They also note that "Change in eGFR may be due to true change in GFR or due to changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine concentrations, including assay fluctuations", and that "Differentiating between these requires serial assessments and consideration of potential changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine". Finally, "Use of validated prediction models for progression of kidney disease may be able to incorporate numerous clinical factors and provide a single prognostic metric, which can guide decisions", and "Incorporation of such models into laboratory systems may facilitate their use".

### Management of acute renal failure [^115vHPYG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is present in 1 to 5 percent of patients at hospital admission and affects up to 20 percent of patients in intensive care units. The condition has prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal causes, with prerenal conditions accounting for 60 to 70 percent of cases. The cause of acute renal failure usually can be identified through an appropriate history, a physical examination, and selected laboratory tests. The initial laboratory evaluation should include urinalysis, a determination of the fractional excretion of sodium, a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, and a basic metabolic panel. Management includes correction of fluid and electrolyte levels; avoidance of nephrotoxins; and kidney replacement therapy, when appropriate. Several recent studies support the use of acetylcysteine for the prevention of acute renal failure in patients undergoing various procedures. The relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.11 in patients undergoing radiocontrast-media procedures (absolute risk reduction: 19 percent) and 0.33 in patients undergoing coronary angiography (absolute risk reduction: 8 percent). In patients pretreated with sodium bicarbonate before radiocontrast-media procedures, the relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.13 and the absolute risk reduction was 11.9 percent. Dopamine and diuretics have been shown to be ineffective in ameliorating the course of acute renal failure.

### ACE inhibitor use and elevated creatinine levels… [^117AcskU]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

1 and editorial 2 on hypertension in patients with diabetes in American Family Physician. However, the editorial 2 by Dr. Bakris surprised me in its facile diagnosis and treatment recommendation of a rise in serum creatinine level after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Bakris states: "the most common cause of a rise in creatinine level is volume depletion. Rehydrating the patient with a fluid that contains salt, such as bouillon, will markedly reduce the creatinine level while the patient is taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker". A recent review 3 indicated that in patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure, a disruption in normal autoregulatory pathways blunts the "ability of the preglomerular circulation to dilate in response to a drop in the mean arterial pressure" causing "an exaggerated decrease in intraglomerular pressure" and an accumulation in creatinine.

In patients who do not have any particular acute conditions or a rise in creatinine of greater than 30 percent, the author recommends continuing ACE inhibitor therapy and following laboratory values closely to ensure that the creatinine stabilizes at the higher value, with the expectation that this initial decline in renal function will improve with long-term control of blood pressure. This is seen commonly in patients who are in nursing homes and in patients over 70 years of age who do not maintain adequate hydration. It is a method of rehydration without hospitalization to receive intravenous normal saline. The point of the comment is that people are denied agents that block the renin angiotensin system because of the perception that they have worsening renal function, when long-term outcome studies support just the opposite.

It also is true that not everyone who has a rise in creatinine levels while taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker has bilateral renal artery stenosis. This was in response to the editorial 2 that accompanied our article. While not wanting to speak for Dr. Bakris, we suspect that he is recommending this therapy as a short-term intervention in a patient who is volume depleted, not as a long-term treatment for elevation in the level of creatinine. A slight increase in creatinine is not unusual and usually has no clinically adverse significance as noted in the review article 3 cited by Dr. Steinberg. That article recommends continuing the ACE inhibitor in the presence of mild elevations in the level of creatinine. We agree with that recommendation and believe that acute volume depletion should be corrected.

### Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency: how concerned should we be by the rise in serum creatinine? [^1161tg2e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the association between the early rise in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the long-term renoprotective properties of these drugs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

Background

Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In patients with renal insufficiency, whether associated with diabetes mellitus or not, use of ACE inhibitors is associated with slowing in the progression of renal disease. In fact, patients who have the most advanced renal insufficiency at baseline are the ones who show the maximum slowing of the disease progression, but these patients are also more likely to show an early rise in serum creatinine levels after ACE inhibitor therapy. There is evidence that patients with renal insufficiency often do not receive ACE inhibitors. There is also evidence that patients with heart failure are not receiving this life-saving drug or are receiving it at dosages lower than that used in the clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is the underlying renal insufficiency or the rise in serum creatinine level after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.

Methods

The authors reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus or heart failure. Studies were included for review if they met the following criteria: subjects were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor; subjects were followed up for a minimum of 2 years; and most of the subjects had baseline chronic renal insufficiency (≥ 25% loss of renal function), irrespective of cause. Of the 12 studies that met these criteria, six were multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The other six were smaller randomized studies. The studies had a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 3.2 ± 0.3 years. One thousand one hundred two patients were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of these, 705 (64%) had data on renal function at baseline (within 6 months of the start) and at the end of the study. The authors examined the changes in serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in patients who were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors. The authors also assessed the blood pressures achieved in the trials.

Results

Patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency who achieved their blood pressure control goals were likely to demonstrate an early rise in serum creatinine levels, approximately 25% above the baseline (approximately 1.7 mg/dL) after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This rise in serum creatinine was more acute (by approximately 15% from the baseline) during the first 2 weeks of therapy and was more gradual (additional approximately 10%) during the third and fourth weeks of therapy (Figure 1). The serum creatinine level was likely to stabilize after about 4 weeks, provided patients had a normal salt and fluid intake. In addition, patients who did not show a rise in serum creatinine level during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, were less likely to experience one after that period, unless they were dehydrated from use of diuretics or gastroenteritis or had used a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). In spite of this early rise in serum creatinine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine level of ≥ 124 micromol/L or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, these patients receiving the drug showed a 55% to 75% lower risk of worsening renal function than those with normal renal function receiving the drug. The rate of risk reduction was inversely related to the severity of renal impairment at baseline, but data were limited on the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min). The authors noted that those aged 65 and older were likely to have much lower GFRs for given levels of serum creatinine than younger patients and were therefore likely to have advanced renal insufficiency at serum creatinine levels as low as 2 mg/dL (vs 4 mg/dL for younger patients). Patients with normal renal function were likely to show a much smaller rise in serum creatinine level (approximately 10% above the baseline of 0.9 mg/dL), mostly occurring during the first week after initiation of therapy, with subsequent stabilization, whereas patients with normal renal function suffering from heart failure, volume depletion, or bilateral renal artery stenosis experienced a significant rise (approximately 225% above baseline) in serum creatinine level, much higher in magnitude and rate than that experienced by those with renal insufficiency (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels in these patients sharply increased (by approximately 75% above baseline) in the 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, followed by an even sharper increase (another approximately 150%) during the subsequent 2 weeks. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) who received therapy with ACE inhibitors had about a five times higher risk of developing hyperkalemia than those with normal renal function, whereas presence of heart failure increased the risk of hyperkalemia by about three times over those without heart failure. Concomitant use of diuretics was associated with an approximately 60% reduction in risk of hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

The authors conclude that, in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL) treated with ACE inhibitors, there is a strong association between early (within the first 2 months) and moderate (not exceeding 30% over baseline) rise in serum creatinine and slowing of the renal disease progression in the long run. The authors recommend that ACE inhibitor therapy should not be discontinued unless serum creatinine level rise above 30% over baseline during the first 2 months after initiation of therapy or hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) develops.

### Acute kidney injury in older adults [^11113pzS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Aging kidneys undergo structural and functional changes that decrease autoregulatory capacity and increase susceptibility to acute injury. Acute kidney injury associates with duration and location of hospitalization, mortality risk, progression to chronic kidney disease, and functional status in daily living. Definition and diagnosis of acute kidney injury are based on changes in creatinine, which is an inadequate marker and might identify patients when it is too late. The incidence of acute kidney injury is rising and increases with advancing age, yet clinical studies have been slow to address geriatric issues or the heterogeneity in etiologies, outcomes, or patient preferences among the elderly. Here we examine some of the current literature, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest potential research questions regarding acute kidney injury in older adults. Answering these questions will facilitate the integration of geriatric issues into future mechanistic and clinical studies that affect management and care of acute kidney injury.

### Evaluation of renal disease in patients with cirrhosis [^113EEpC4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal dysfunction in cirrhosis is common and is associated with increased mortality. Identifying and treating reversible causes of renal disease can significantly improve outcomes. The etiology, approach, and evaluation of renal disease in this group of patients is similar to the noncirrhosis patient, with a few specific caveats. Renal disease may be unrelated to the cause of cirrhosis (eg, prerenal acute kidney injury, acute tubular necrosis), occur as a manifestation of the same systemic disease responsible for the liver disease (eg, chronic viral hepatitis B and C infection) or as a consequence of cirrhosis (hepatorenal syndrome). Kidney impairment may be underrecognized in patients with cirrhosis due to over-reliance on creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate equations used in clinical practice. The first steps of evaluation for the renal disease include a thorough medical history to identify the underlying cause of cirrhosis and any potential trigger for renal dysfunction, physical examination, and review of prior laboratory records for baseline renal function. Renal imaging and urinalysis should be performed on all cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction to establish the presence of urinary obstruction, chronicity and intrinsic renal disease.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^114UVwm5]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found that patients in routine clinical care who started treatment with ACEI/ARB and whose creatinine concentration had increased by 30% or more at their first follow-up monitoring visit were at increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and death, compared with patients with more stable creatinine values. Our study thus confirms data from clinical trials in a real world clinical setting. Moreover, we established that risks were also substantially increased for end stage renal disease. In general, risks were highest in the first year after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment but were sustained up to 10 years later for end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, and death. Importantly, we showed a "dose-response" relation between the level of increase in creatinine values and risk of adverse outcomes, indicating that all increases below 30% cannot be viewed as safe. Our results were consistent across calendar periods and patient subgroups in a range of sensitivity analyses. It is not clear whether increases in creatinine values after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment are due to pathophysiological processes representing a biomarker of increased risk or whether a direct causal relation exists between reduced renal function and adverse outcomes. These results therefore identify a group of patients at high risk but do not necessarily support discontinuation of ACEI/ARBs.

Lipid Elevations

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were observed at one month of exposure and remained stable thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters during the first 3 months of exposure in the placebo-controlled clinical trials are summarized below:

Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 19% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm.
Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 10% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 12% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm.
Mean LDL/HDL ratios were essentially unchanged in XELJANZ-treated patients.

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment levels in response to statin therapy.

In the long-term safety population, elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Serum Creatinine Elevations

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in serum creatinine were observed with XELJANZ treatment. The mean increase in serum creatinine was < 0.1 mg/dL in the 12-month pooled safety analysis; however with increasing duration of exposure in the long-term extensions, up to 2% of patients were discontinued from XELJANZ treatment due to the protocol-specified discontinuation criterion of an increase in creatinine by more than 50% of baseline. The clinical significance of the observed serum creatinine elevations is unknown.

### Acute kidney injury [^1142XM1n]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^113gSKbC]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114QCpNE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — small changes in serum creatinine: The AKIN definition was based on evidence that minor fluctuations in serum creatinine concentration were strongly associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized individuals, with the association remaining, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjustment. Subsequent studies have identified small changes in serum creatinine to be prognostically important, and even a 0.1-mg/dL increase appears to be associated with increased risk compared to no change. However, whether these small changes reflect clinically meaningful kidney function fluctuations or are merely markers of underlying conditions remains unresolved, and an implicit assumption is that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in an individual is constant over time and not subject to physiologic fluctuation.

### Evaluation of short-term changes in serum creatinine level as a meaningful end point in randomized clinical trials [^1177fkY5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown that acute change in kidney function (specifically, AKI) is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes. Thus, the outcome of acute change in serum creatinine level, regardless of underlying biology or etiology, is frequently used in clinical trials as both efficacy and safety end points. We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to quantify the relationship between positive or negative short-term effects of interventions on change in serum creatinine level and more meaningful clinical outcomes. After a thorough literature search, we included 14 randomized trials of interventions that altered risk for an acute increase in serum creatinine level and had reported between-group differences in CKD and/or mortality rate ≥ 3 months after randomization. Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, increased risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.89), and seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, reduced risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.74). However, pooled risks for CKD and mortality associated with interventions did not differ from those with placebo in either group. In conclusion, several interventions that affect risk of acute, mild to moderate, often temporary elevation in serum creatinine level in placebo-controlled randomized trials showed no appreciable effect on CKD or mortality months later, raising questions about the value of using small to moderate changes in serum creatinine level as end points in clinical trials.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not current practice in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk on the basis of either comorbidity or an intervention. There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may be the result of acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time, allowing for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting of AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address how differences in body composition (overweight, fluid overload) affect the interpretation of urine output, and whether these differences need to be considered in regard to the thresholds for AKI. Similarly, fluid status should be considered when evaluating for AKI. Fluid overload is associated with increased mortality and AKI, and it may impact the diagnosis of AKI through its impact on the volume of distribution of serum creatinine. Although there are research methods to define fluid overload, these are not routinely used in clinical practice, and it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to define a clinical threshold for fluid overload. In the next AKI guideline, fluid overload should be defined operationally through a rigorous literature review.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^1145JMAQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction: why focus on recovery?

While acute renal impairment is sometimes thought of as a relatively trivial insult defined purely by changes in serum creatinine, the introduction and subsequent acceptance of the concept of acute kidney injury (AKI) has gradually alerted critical care and nephrology clinicians to potential late complications in AKI survivors. It is well recognised that progressive or persistent impairment in renal function may occur following an episode of AKI, with the potential to progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with dialysis dependence. However, the outcome from an episode of AKI cannot simply be regarded as the binary administration for chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) or recovery. Several authors have highlighted the substantial risk of development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), short of ESKD which is in turn strongly associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. This association does not necessarily implicate causation but could also indicate a common underlying disease process (Fig. 1). The question thus arises 'What do we mean by renal recovery after AKI?' Furthermore, in the absence of an effective therapy to alter the acute course of established AKI, our current focus should be turned towards both AKI prevention and promotion of kidney repair in the recovery phase.

Complex interrelationship between cardiovascular disease, acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) as risk factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). High age, severe acute disease and possibly the modality of renal replacement therapy in patients with positive fluid balance are additional risk factors for progression to ESKD

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^1172daMY]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The association between acute elevations in SCr categorised by AKIN criteria and survival was examined. The primary outcome assessed was all cause mortality. The results were expressed as Kaplan-Meier survival curves, first unadjusted and then adjusted for age, gender, stage of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Charlson co-morbidity score. Cox regression survival analysis was then used to examine the temporal relationship between the incident creatinine and death. These results were expressed as hazard ratios.

Finally the probability of dying at 30 days and12 months was estimated using logistic regression analysis. To allow for possible confounding variables, a series of four models were fitted with varying adjustments for other variables to allow comparison between the categories

The models fitted were as follows:
Unadjusted relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death
The relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death, adjusted for age and sex only
The relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death, adjusted for age, sex, baseline CKD stage & using individual co-morbidities
The relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death, for age, sex, baseline CKD stage & Charlson score

There was a non-linear relationship between age and all outcomes, therefore a linear and squared term were included for age to best fit the observed relationships.

Around 22% of patients had missing comorbidity data, and thus potentially excluded from models 3 and 4. In order to retain these patients in the analysis, an additional 'missing' category was included for the Charlson score in model 4. Each of the individual comorbidities was missing for the same patients, and thus it was not possible to include an additional category for each of these. Instead it was assumed that the individual comorbidities were absent for those with missing data, and an additional variable, missing comorbidity or not, was included in the model. Since none of the patients with AIDS died within 30 days of the incident creatinine AIDS was omitted from the analysis of 30-day mortality.

The data was then re-analysed dividing patient s into 6 groups based on their AKI status, no AKI, AKIN1, AKIN1a, AKIN2, AKIN3 and AKIN3a. The aim of the all analyses was to compare between the six AKI groups. An additional variable was added to the model three and four to adjust for time between incident creatinine and baseline creatinine (models 5, 6, 7 & 8).

### Can bedside ultrasound assist in determining whether serum creatinine is elevated in cases of acute urinary retention? [^115ori1Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There are no guidelines to determine which patients with acute urinary retention (AUR) require blood testing (i.e., serum creatinine) to assess for renal failure.

Objective

To determine if hydronephrosis on bedside ultrasound correlates with an abnormal serum creatinine (Cr) level in cases of AUR.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study of subjects clinically diagnosed with AUR at two associated urban academic centers from October 2004 through August 2006. Emergency physicians completed a data form and performed a bedside ultrasound to determine the presence or absence of hydronephrosis. The data collected included suspected cause of AUR, amount of urinary output after Foley insertion, and blood test results. Follow-up was obtained by telephone and electronic medical record for 1 month. Standard statistics were employed.

Results

Among 96 enrolled subjects with AUR, 43 had a serum Cr level obtained on the initial visit, and 10 (23%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 11–36) of these had an elevated Cr (10% [95% CI 4–16] of the study cohort). The test characteristics of hydronephrosis on bedside ultrasound to detect elevation in Cr were a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 70%, 67%, 39%, and 88%, respectively.

Conclusion

In cases of AUR, the prevalence of elevated creatinine is high, and hydronephrosis based on bedside ultrasonography does not correlate with elevation in creatinine.

### Renal recovery [^111v3FML]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) research in the past decade has mostly focused upon development of a standard AKI definition, validation of early novel biomarkers to predict AKI prior to serum creatinine rise and predict AKI severity, and assessment of aspects of renal replacement therapies and their impact on survival. Given the independent association between AKI and mortality in the acute phase, such focus makes imminent sense. More recently, the recognition that AKI is associated with subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, with the attendant increase in mortality, has led to interest in the clinical epidemiology and the mechanistic understanding of renal recovery after an AKI episode in critically ill patients. We review the current knowledge surrounding renal recovery after an AKI episode, including renal replacement therapy initiation timing and modality impact, biomarker assessment and mechanistic targets to guide potential future clinical trials.

### Some biomarkers of acute kidney injury are increased in pre-renal acute injury [^1173aqMc]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, Singer et al. investigated whether urinary NGAL could be used to distinguish between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI in a cohort of 145 patients with AKI according to the RIFLE criteria on the day of enrolment. Patients were classified as pre-renal AKI (n = 33) when plasma creatinine returned to baseline within 3 days and the cause of increase in creatinine was determined to be factors that compromised renal perfusion, and there was no exposure to nephrotoxins. Patients were classified as intrinsic AKI when potential tubular necrosis–inducing events could be identified and there was no response to fluid resuscitation and/or hemodynamic stabilization (n = 75). A large number of patients (n = 38) could not be classified. Urinary NGAL concentrations were greater in the intrinsic than the pre-renal AKI groups. NGAL was also greater in those who went on to increase their RIFLE severity class or to die. FENa did not discriminate between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. Unfortunately, this study lacked a cohort of patients without AKI, which makes comparison with our study difficult, and the large number of unclassifiable patients calls the conclusions into some doubt as well. The approach of retrospectively determining the likely cause of increased creatinine and waiting to see which patients creatinine levels returned to normal may have resulted in choosing two cohorts with differing severity of parenchymal injury rather than a separate cohort with only a physiological response.

### Prevalence of high blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine level in the United States: findings from the… [^111GWbMS]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Elevated serum creatinine level was 8 times more common in hypertensive than normotensive individuals and 8 times more common in people already using medication for high blood pressure compared with people not using such medication. Figure 1 shows that the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level was markedly higher in individuals treated for hypertension compared with untreated individuals at every category of blood pressure. Among untreated individuals, prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level increased monotonically with higher blood pressure categories from 0. 8% to
13. 6%. Among treated individuals, the association of prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level with blood pressure was J-shaped.

Regardless of the number of medications they received, individuals with an elevated serum creatinine level had a slightly higher mean systolic blood pressure than individuals with a lower serum creatinine level. In contrast, their mean diastolic blood pressure was slightly, although often not significantly, lower with 48% of individuals prescribed only 1 medication. Individuals prescribed 2 medications had a lower mean blood pressure than individuals prescribed 1 medication, despite the tendency to prescribe more medications to individuals with more severe underlying hypertension. Our results show that approximately 5. 6 million individuals in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population have elevated serum creatinine levels, 25 times the number of prevalent ESRD cases, and 108 times the number of incident ESRD cases in
1991.

Elevated serum creatinine level is rare among young and middle-aged individuals with optimal blood pressure and becomes increasingly more common among individuals in higher blood pressure categories as well as among individuals using antihypertensive medications. The 470 HOT trial participants with a serum creatinine level of 132. 6 µmol/L or higher required more antihypertensive medications than patients with a lower serum creatinine level but achieved their blood pressure. These data suggest that blacks are at an approximately 1. 7 times higher risk of an elevated serum creatinine level progressing into ESRD compared with whites.

This observation also raises the question of whether competing causes of death differ between blacks and whites among patients with elevated serum creatinine levels.

### Are small changes in serum creatinine an important risk factor? [^113aLH8Z]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum creatinine levels are strongly associated with longitudinal risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Recent studies addressed whether worsening renal function - defined by small increases in creatinine - is independently associated with adverse outcomes. This review evaluates the recent literature on worsened renal function as an independent risk factor.

Recent Findings

Studies have evaluated worsening renal function as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in three settings: cardiac surgery patients, hospitalized heart failure patients, and ambulatory coronary artery disease patients. Small creatinine changes following cardiac surgery were strongly associated with mortality risk. One study found a J-shaped association between 48 h post surgery creatinine change and 30-day mortality risk. Compared with patients with creatinine decreases of 0–0.3 mg/dl, patients with creatinine increases less than 0.5 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted mortality risk and those with creatinine increases of at least 0.5 mg/dl had a nearly sixfold mortality risk; surprisingly those with decreases over 0.3 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted risk. Worsening renal function was also a strong predictor of mortality for hospitalized heart failure patients independent of baseline creatinine; the magnitude of creatinine rise appeared to be linearly associated with mortality risk. However, one study found no independent association between worsening renal function and cardiovascular or mortality risk over longer follow-up.

Summary

Acute elevations in serum creatinine had a linear association with increased risk for adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized for cardiac surgery or heart failure. Future studies should determine interventions to prevent and treat in-hospital worsening renal function to reduce the risk for adverse outcomes.

Conclusion

The presented case report demonstrates impressively the strong influence of non-GFR determinants on creatinine concentration and highlights that the choice of renal markers for assessing kidney function should be considered very cautiously, especially in older adults. Also, it indicates circumstances where cystatin C may be a superior biomarker for clinical decision-making and refers to situations where measured GFR should be considered.

Current diagnostic methods for AKI and their limitations

The diagnostic criteria for AKI primarily include the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease), AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network), and KDIGO (kidney disease: Improving Global Outcomes) standards, all of which emphasize the importance of SCr. Common adjunctive diagnostic methods also include urine output monitoring, imaging tests, and assessments of electrolytes and acid-base balance. In clinical practice, the KDIGO standard is widely used as it combines the advantages of the RIFLE and AKIN criteria, providing a more comprehensive basis for the diagnosis of AKI.

Serum creatinine

SCr is the most used diagnostic tool for acute changes in kidney function. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend the following criteria: an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/mL (≥ 26.5 µmol/L) within 48 h; a SCr increase of more than 1.5 times baseline within the past 7 days; urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/(kg·h) for more than 6 h.

Due to the long half-life of SCr and kidney functional reserve, changes in SCr are not significant during early kidney injury and may not reflect pathological changes in a timely manner. SCr values are influenced by factors such as muscle mass, metabolism, liver function, diet, hydration, and exogenous creatinine intake, and can also be affected by physiological and analytical variability. Drugs (such as cimetidine and trimethoprim) that inhibit tubular secretion or blood concentration (such as diuretics) may cause false elevation, while changes during pregnancy can also affect SCr levels. Additionally, prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal AKI can all lead to an increase in SCr, requiring a comprehensive interpretation in conjunction with the specific cause. Faster testing methods, such as creatinine clearance over 2–4 h, dynamic estimated GFR (kinetic eGFR), or plasma clearance of renal clearance-dependent compounds (such as iohexol), though not yet widely adopted in clinical practice, have been proposed as alternative tools to SCr testing.

Defining renal injury

Table 1 describes the terminology used to describe and define AKI throughout its course from that described by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and others.

Table 1
Defining renal injury

The definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as published by the KDIGO guidelines is outlined in Table 1, with the latest review including 'with implications for health' in an attempt to contextualize the notion that a variety of kidney functional anomalies may exist that will not have bearing on the patient's health long term. CKD has then been sub-classified based on cause, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or albuminuria category into stages 1–5.

Perhaps the most challenging area to define is that of renal recovery; however, this is of vital importance, as a consensus agreement would likely yield a framework for efficacy of assessment of novel emerging therapies. However, it is not without difficulty. Within the critical care arena some would consider renal recovery as the return of eGFR to pre-morbid baseline levels (whatever that means in the context of critical illness) whilst others may consider the absence of the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) as sufficient recovery. Studies reporting renal recovery are often ambiguous at best. There has been some attempt at the classification of renal recovery (Table 2).

Table 2
Potential definition of renal recovery

Data adapted from Schiffl and Fischer. AKI acute kidney injury, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, RRT renal replacement therapy

However, using a crude marker of renal function such as serum creatinine outside steady-state conditions has significant limitations. Serum creatinine is used as a surrogate for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during AKI in critically ill unstable patients. The GFR is rarely measured in clinical practice but equations, such as the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) and the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, estimate the GFR (eGFR) from the serum creatinine where differences in age, sex, and race are considered. However, as noted, creatinine is a biomarker for the GFR only under clinically stable conditions. In the critically ill there is a significant overestimation of the eGFR due to, for example, reduced creatinine levels due to reduced muscle bulk and creatinine generation. Several studies have compared formal measurement of the GFR and eGFR with considerable disparity observed. Most importantly, of course, is that there is a delay between renal injury and any observed rise in creatinine, which may be masked for up to 48 h.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.
