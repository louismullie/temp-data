insomnia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about insomnia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining insomnia and establishing diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the first-line treatment recommendation and its evidence base. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options, their indications, and safety. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities, including older adults, psychiatric comorbidity, and COMISA. Finally, I should review implementation, access, and follow-up, and close with a concise, clinically actionable algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, with dissatisfaction regarding sleep quantity or quality, accompanied by substantial distress and next-day impairment, and is considered chronic when symptoms occur at least three nights per week for at least three months; ICSD-3 and DSM-5 align on this threshold, and prevalence estimates for chronic insomnia are roughly 5–10% in industrialized nations, with occasional insomnia affecting 30–50% of adults [^113Jhmj3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before anchoring the first-line recommendation. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder in adults, with strong recommendations from AASM and ACP and endorsement from European and British guidelines; CBT-I yields durable benefits on sleep onset, maintenance, total sleep time, and daytime functioning, and its effects persist after treatment ends, which is a key advantage over medications [^1116CsqE] [^116NEnff] [^1173F5ek] [^113auRx1] [^117CfHiJ].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and practical delivery details so I don't overstate certainty. AASM's systematic review and meta-analysis of 124 studies supports CBT-I with a strong recommendation, and notes that in-person, one-on-one CBT-I is the most extensively evaluated and effective modality; however, brief therapies (1–4 sessions), digital CBT-I, and group formats are reasonable alternatives when access or cost is a barrier, and treatment typically spans 4–8 sessions with sleep diary monitoring to guide sleep restriction and stimulus control [^1116CsqE] [^117UKywH] [^1117uLTe].

> I should double-check the stance on sleep hygiene because it's often misused. Sleep hygiene education alone is not recommended as a standalone treatment for chronic insomnia disorder due to insufficient efficacy; it may be used as an adjunct within comprehensive care, but clinicians should prioritize evidence-based behavioral therapies and avoid substituting sleep hygiene for CBT-I or its components [^116gd2Ev] [^113pUoNH].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic options and their evidentiary footing, keeping in mind that medications are generally second-line or adjuncts. AASM pharmacologic guidelines issue weak recommendations for several agents for specific indications: eszopiclone for sleep onset and maintenance, zolpidem for sleep onset and maintenance, zaleplon for sleep onset, triazolam for sleep onset, temazepam for sleep onset and maintenance, ramelteon for sleep onset, doxepin 3–6 mg for sleep maintenance, and suvorexant for sleep maintenance; conversely, they recommend against trazodone, tiagabine, diphenhydramine, melatonin, tryptophan, and valerian for routine treatment of chronic insomnia in adults [^112JJKpB] [^111dLQ3K] [^117RCeRH] [^116Grf6z] [^111qwC6G].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought melatonin might be broadly helpful, but I need to correct that. AASM suggests against melatonin for chronic insomnia at typical doses (around 2 mg), citing limited efficacy; melatonin may have a role in circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, but that is a different indication than chronic insomnia disorder, so I should not conflate the two [^111qwC6G] [^112JJKpB].

> I will now examine safety and comparative effectiveness so I don't understate risks. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists show small-to-moderate short-term benefits but carry risks of cognitive and psychomotor impairment, dependence, and complex sleep-related behaviors; in older adults, benzodiazepines have a particularly unfavorable benefit–harm balance, with meta-analytic data showing modest gains offset by higher adverse events and cognitive effects, reinforcing caution and dose minimization [^117ADKCg] [^111Cwy36] [^1124oEgt].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults, because the risk calculus shifts. CBT-I remains first-line in older adults, and if medication is considered, start low, go slow, prefer shorter half-life agents, and avoid anticholinergic burden; benzodiazepines are especially discouraged in this group due to falls, cognitive effects, and delirium risk, aligning with geriatric-focused guidance and meta-analytic safety signals [^115G4aEM] [^111VPHpY] [^1124oEgt].

> I need to ensure I address psychiatric comorbidity, where insomnia often persists despite treatment of the primary disorder. Insomnia should be treated concurrently when present, as it contributes to worse outcomes and may impede recovery; CBT-I is effective across comorbid depression and anxiety, and sequential or combined strategies can be considered when insomnia remains refractory, though evidence for optimal sequencing is evolving [^1132qRXX] [^111wZ5S2] [^117CfHiJ].

> But wait, what if obstructive sleep apnea coexists with insomnia, the so-called COMISA phenotype. Co-occurring insomnia and OSA is common and associated with greater morbidity and reduced adherence to CPAP; emerging guidance supports prioritizing insomnia treatment early to improve CPAP uptake, and clinicians should screen for OSA in patients with insomnia symptoms such as loud snoring, witnessed apneas, or excessive daytime sleepiness, integrating diagnostic pathways accordingly [^111zBX3Z] [^112PU4s1].

> Next, I should review implementation and access, because even the best evidence fails patients if it's not available. Barriers include limited numbers of trained CBT-I providers, low insurance reimbursement for behavioral therapies, and low awareness among patients and clinicians; solutions include digital CBT-I, brief primary care–feasible protocols, provider training, and advocacy for coverage, all of which are emphasized in recent stakeholder analyses and guideline implementation notes [^111x9yHc] [^1128VzXe] [^1116CsqE].

> I should confirm follow-up and outcome assessment so care remains measurable. Pre- and post-treatment assessment of sleep quality or satisfaction and daytime functioning is recommended as part of quality measures, and clinicians should track sleep diaries during CBT-I to titrate sleep restriction and monitor progress; for pharmacotherapy, reassess at 2–4 weeks, use the lowest effective dose, and plan for discontinuation trials to mitigate dependence and tolerance risks [^1138MQHn] [^113Xs6Gk].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, confirm chronic insomnia disorder with history, sleep diary, and screening for comorbidities; second, offer CBT-I as first-line, selecting modality based on access and preference; third, if CBT-I is declined, unavailable, or ineffective after a reasonable trial, consider pharmacotherapy tailored to the predominant symptom (e.g., zolpidem or eszopiclone for mixed onset/maintenance, ramelteon for onset, doxepin or suvorexant for maintenance), using the lowest effective dose and shortest duration with planned reassessment; fourth, in older adults, avoid benzodiazepines and prioritize CBT-I; fifth, in psychiatric comorbidity or COMISA, treat insomnia concurrently and coordinate with specialty care; sixth, embed sleep hygiene within comprehensive care but never as a standalone therapy [^1116CsqE] [^112JJKpB] [^116NEnff] [^115G4aEM] [^111zBX3Z] [^116gd2Ev].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evidence gaps and future directions so we don't overpromise. Long-term comparative effectiveness of pharmacotherapies, optimal sequencing of CBT-I and medications, and phenotype-guided treatment matching remain active research areas; meanwhile, clinicians should apply current guideline-concordant care, monitor closely, and adjust based on patient response, values, and comorbidities [^117CfHiJ] [^111q5Jdx].

Insomnia is defined by **difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep** [^114D2CvF] with daytime impairment, and is considered chronic when symptoms occur at least three nights per week for three months or more [^113Jhmj3]. It is highly prevalent and associated with significant morbidity, including increased risks of depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and accidents [^117CfHiJ] [^114D2CvF]. CBT-I is the **first-line treatment** [^116NEnff] because it is safe and produces durable benefits [^117CfHiJ]; pharmacotherapy (e.g. eszopiclone, zolpidem, suvorexant) may be added if CBT-I is insufficient or unavailable, but should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration due to potential adverse effects and dependence risk [^112JJKpB] [^113Xs6Gk]. Management should be individualized, with attention to comorbidities, patient preferences, and safety, and regular follow-up to monitor efficacy and harms [^115KFRQc] [^116fCAL1].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Insomnia is characterized by **persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep** [^114D2CvF], or by non-restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunity, leading to significant distress or impairment [^114D2CvF]. Chronic insomnia is defined by symptoms occurring at least three nights per week for at least three months [^113Jhmj3] [^111MPucH].

---

## Prevalence and epidemiology

Insomnia is highly prevalent globally, affecting approximately **10–20% of adults** [^115Lz14p] [^114D2CvF]. Chronic insomnia affects about 5–10% of the general population [^113Jhmj3]. It is more common in women, older adults, and individuals with psychiatric or medical comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Insomnia is **multifactorial**, involving genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors [^115Lz14p]. Key contributors include:

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Depression, anxiety, PTSD [^notfound].
- **Medical conditions**: Chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, endocrine disorders [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Irregular sleep schedules, caffeine/alcohol use, screen exposure [^notfound].
- **Stress and life events**: Acute stressors, trauma, major life changes [^11381cKs].

---

## Clinical presentation and impact

Patients typically report difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, or early morning awakenings, with **daytime consequences** such as fatigue, irritability, cognitive impairment, and reduced functioning [^114D2CvF]. Chronic insomnia is associated with increased risks of depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and accidents, and with substantial healthcare costs [^114qBysg] [^114D2CvF].

---

## Evaluation and diagnosis

Evaluation relies on a thorough clinical history, sleep diary, and standardized tools (e.g. ISI, PSQI) [^115Lz14p]. Polysomnography is not routinely indicated unless suspected sleep apnea or other sleep disorders are suspected [^notfound]. The diagnosis is clinical, based on ICSD-3 or DSM-5 criteria [^116fCAL1].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Non-pharmacological treatments

CBT-I is the **first-line treatment** for chronic insomnia, with strong evidence for efficacy and durability [^116NEnff] [^117CfHiJ]. It includes sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation techniques [^1117uLTe]. Brief therapies and digital CBT-I are effective alternatives when access is limited [^1128Lf4T] [^1173F5ek].

---

### Pharmacological treatments

Pharmacotherapy is reserved for cases in which CBT-I is unavailable, declined, or insufficient [^116NEnff]. Options include:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepine receptor agonists | Eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon | Sleep onset/maintenance | Short-term use; risk of dependence, cognitive impairment [^112AiBos] |
| Orexin receptor antagonists | Suvorexant | Sleep onset/maintenance | Favorable safety profile; monitor for next-day somnolence [^notfound] |
| Melatonin receptor agonists | Ramelteon | Sleep onset | Minimal abuse potential; modest efficacy [^notfound] |
| Antidepressants | Doxepin (low dose) | Sleep maintenance | Sedating; monitor for anticholinergic effects [^notfound] |

---

Long-term pharmacotherapy is generally discouraged due to limited evidence of sustained benefit and potential harms; if continued, use the **lowest effective dose** with regular reassessment [^113Xs6Gk] [^113DtPb4].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Older adults**: CBT-I is first-line; avoid benzodiazepines due to falls, cognitive impairment, and delirium risk [^115G4aEM] [^1124oEgt].
- **Pregnancy**: Prefer non-pharmacological approaches; if medication is needed, use short-acting agents with caution.
- **Comorbid psychiatric disorders**: Treat insomnia concurrently; CBT-I is effective and may improve psychiatric outcomes [^1132qRXX] [^111wZ5S2].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess treatment response, adherence, and adverse effects. Adjust therapy based on patient preference, comorbidities, and clinical judgment [^116fCAL1].

---

Insomnia is a common, chronic disorder with significant morbidity. CBT-I is the **cornerstone of treatment**, with pharmacotherapy as adjunctive therapy when needed. Individualized care and ongoing monitoring are critical to optimize outcomes.

### Maintenance treatment of insomnia: what can we learn from the depression literature? [^113Pdycv]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Insomnia and depression are common problems with profound public health consequences. When left untreated, both conditions have high rates of persistence and recurrence. Maintenance treatment for depression is fairly well established, but there is no evidence-based consensus regarding the safety and efficacy of maintenance therapy for insomnia. Consequently, long-term treatment of insomnia is driven primarily by the individual choices of patients and their clinicians. This article compares and contrasts the current state of research in the maintenance therapy of depression and insomnia and highlights gaps in the insomnia literature.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tryptophan as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use valerian as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).

### Optimizing treatment for insomnia [^117Hf3YP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

By tailoring the mechanism of action and effects of therapy to the specific nature of each patient's insomnia and other conditions, clinicians can offer personalized care in an attempt to achieve an improved risk-benefit ratio compared to that of a "one-size-fits-all" treatment strategy. To move toward this personalization and optimization of treatment, clinicians need awareness of the specific effects of interventions and the subpopulations with insomnia who would benefit from each intervention. This report reviews insomnia treatments, focusing on effects associated with mechanism of action.

### British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus statement on evidence-based treatment of insomnia, parasomnias and circadian rhythm disorders [^115yJNBM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in the general population and even more so in clinical practice, yet are relatively poorly understood by doctors and other health care practitioners. These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines are designed to address this problem by providing an accessible up-to-date and evidence-based outline of the major issues, especially those relating to reliable diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A consensus meeting was held in London in May 2009. Those invited to attend included BAP members, representative clinicians with a strong interest in sleep disorders and recognized experts and advocates in the field, including a representative from mainland Europe and the USA. Presenters were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aimed to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was then circulated to all participants for comment. Key subsequent publications were added by the writer and speakers at draft stage. All comments were incorporated as far as possible in the final document, which represents the views of all participants although the authors take final responsibility for the document.

### Insomnia disorder: clinical and research challenges for the 21st century [^111q5Jdx]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Insomnia is a common and debilitating disorder that is frequently associated with important consequences for physical health and well-being.

Methods

An international expert group considered the current state of knowledge based on the most relevant publications in the previous 5 years, discussed the current challenges in the field of insomnia and identified future priorities.

Results

The association of trajectories of insomnia with subsequent quality of life, health and mortality should be investigated in large populations. Prospective health economics studies by separating the costs driven specifically by insomnia and costs attributable to its long-term effects are needed. Ignoring the heterogeneity of insomnia patients leads to inadequate diagnosis and inefficient treatment. Individualized interventions should be promoted. More data are needed on both the impact of sleep on overnight effects, such as emotion regulation, and the potential compensatory effort to counteract diurnal impairments. Another gap is the definition of neurocognitive deficits in insomnia patients compared to normal subjects after chronic sleep loss. There are also a number of key gaps related to insomnia treatment. Expert guidelines indicate cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia as first-line treatment. They neglect, however, the reality of major healthcare providers. The role of combined therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia plus pharmacological treatment, should be evaluated more extensively.

Conclusion

Whilst insomnia disorder might affect large proportions of the population, there are a number of significant gaps in the epidemiological/clinical/research studies carried out to date. In particular, the identification of different insomnia phenotypes could allow more cost-effective and efficient therapies.

### Advances in the management of chronic insomnia [^111CXbcd]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Chronic insomnia is a common condition that affects people worldwide and has negative effects on patients' health and wellbeing. The treatment of insomnia can be complex and time consuming for patients and providers. Although behavioral interventions are the first line therapy, there are barriers to access for these treatments. However, in recent years, alternative ways of providing these behavioral therapies that make them more widely available have been investigated. Drugs also play an important role in the treatment of insomnia and new drugs have been introduced as options for treating patients with sleep initiation and sleep maintenance insomnia. In this review, we will discuss advances in the past six years in both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for patients with chronic insomnia. We will also review the controversies surrounding some of the current drug treatments, as well as the role that technology and personal activity monitoring devices may play in treating insomnia.

### Insomnia [^113fzo6g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia-the unwelcome experience of difficulty sleeping-is common and can be acute, intermittent, or chronic. Insomnia can be the presenting symptom for several common sleep disorders, but it also often occurs comorbidly with mental and physical health conditions. Evaluating the symptom of insomnia requires assessing-largely by history-whether an underlying condition explains it. Insomnia disorder is the diagnostic term for the symptom of insomnia that merits specific attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the preferred treatment approach because of its efficacy, safety, and durability of benefit, but pharmaceutical treatments are widely used for insomnia symptoms.

### Recent developments in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia [^1172wVpr]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep/wake complaints, and specifically insomnia, are some of the more common problems encountered in the outpatient setting. Despite its prevalence, few clinicians are experts at diagnosing and treating this entity. Additionally, diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is a time-intensive process (often the initial interview takes at least 1 h, depending on the complexity of the insomnia). With a conservative estimate of the annual cost of insomnia between dollar 92.5 and dollar 107.5 billion dollars, it is becoming clear that insomnia has significant medical and public health implications. A problem that has hampered insomnia research is the lack of a standard definition of insomnia for use in research, as well as guidelines for assessment. In recent years, there have been important advances in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia with efforts to establish greater consensus in how to define and measure insomnia. Cognitive behavioral and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective treatment approaches. Insomnia is a complex entity, often multifactorial in its etiology; and as research and clinical guidelines are established and validated (leading to better data interpretation), continued enhancement of our understanding of this disorder is expected.

Importance

Insomnia is one of the most prevalent health concerns in the population and in clinical practice. Clinicians may be reluctant to address insomnia because of its many potential causes, unfamiliarity with behavioral treatments, and concerns about pharmacologic treatments.

Objective

To review the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of insomnia in adults.

Evidence Review

Systematic review to identify and summarize previously published quantitative reviews (meta-analyses) of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for insomnia.

Findings

Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. The prevalence of insomnia disorder is approximately 10% to 20%, with approximately 50% having a chronic course. Insomnia is a risk factor for impaired function, development of other medical and mental disorders, and increased health care costs. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors culminating in hyperarousal. The diagnosis of insomnia is established by a thorough history of sleep behaviors, medical and psychiatric problems, and medications, supplemented by a prospective record of sleep patterns (sleep diary). Quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) support the efficacy of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacologic interventions for insomnia. Brief behavioral interventions and Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy both show promise for use in primary care settings. Among pharmacologic interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although persistent concerns focus on their safety relative to modest efficacy. Behavioral treatments should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.

Conclusions and Relevance

Clinicians should recognize insomnia because of its effects on function and health. A thorough clinical history is often sufficient to identify factors that contribute to insomnia. Behavioral treatments should be used when possible. Hypnotic medications are also efficacious but must be carefully monitored for adverse effects.

### Insomnia disorder [^114D2CvF]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Insomnia disorder affects a large proportion of the population on a situational, recurrent or chronic basis and is among the most common complaints in medical practice. The disorder is predominantly characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep duration or quality and difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, along with substantial distress and impairments of daytime functioning. It can present as the chief complaint or, more often, co-occurs with other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as pain and depression. Persistent insomnia has been linked with adverse long-term health outcomes, including diminished quality of life and physical and psychological morbidity. Despite its high prevalence and burden, the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood. In the past decade, important changes in classification and diagnostic paradigms have instigated a move from a purely symptom-based conceptualization to the recognition of insomnia as a disorder in its own right. These changes have been paralleled by key advances in therapy, with generic pharmacological and psychological interventions being increasingly replaced by approaches that have sleep-specific and insomnia-specific therapeutic targets. Psychological and pharmacological therapies effectively reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and the time spent awake after sleep onset, and produce a modest increase in total sleep time; these are outcomes that correlate with improvements in daytime functioning. Despite this progress, several challenges remain, including the need to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie insomnia and to develop more cost-effective, efficient and accessible therapies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^11614ihX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Guideline recommendation scope and strength — these analyses yield recommendations for use of a limited number of drugs for a limited number of specific indications such as sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, and in all cases the recommendations are "weak", based on relatively limited and/or low quality evidence; many agents shown to be "statistically significantly superior" to placebo may nonetheless be "not recommended", reflecting differences between FDA criteria and the GRADE approach, which establishes evidence quality ratings and clinical significance thresholds not used in individual studies or FDA approval, and each prescriber bears responsibility for treatment determinations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116jL6Yv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — evidence grading and meta-analysis constraints states that quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias; since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE, and when heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. Meta-analysis requires specific data (numerical data for a given outcome, presented as mean and standard deviation), many studies do not report data in the required format, resulting in exclusion of substantial amounts of data from the formal meta-analyses, and while these studies are discussed and considered in formulation of recommendations, the inability to include such data in meta-analysis represents a distinct limitation.

### The veterans administration and department of defense clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders: what does this mean for the practice of sleep medicine? [^114ieQxg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

None

In 2017 the Veterans Administration (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) launched development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, with the goal of informing and improving patient care. The guideline development process followed GRADE methodology, considering studies and systematic reviews published over the 10-year period prior to guideline development. A total of 41 recommendations were made,18 related to the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 23 regarding chronic insomnia disorder. In contrast to other published guidelines, the VA DoD CPGs provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management of the two most common sleep disorders, including a discussion of the sequencing of diagnostic approaches and treatment options. Regarding OSA, strong recommendations were made for follow-up evaluation after non-diagnostic home sleep apnea tests, positive airway pressure therapy as first-line treatment, and the incorporation of supportive, educational and behavioral interventions for patients at high risk for PAP therapy non-adherence due to comorbid conditions. Strong recommendations were also made for the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia and against the use of kava (an herbal supplement) in the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder. These guidelines, while intended to directly inform care within VA and DOD, are broadly relevant to the practice of sleep medicine. The majority of scientific evidence was based on studies of non-military, non-veteran populations. The CPG is a major milestone for the VA and DOD in recognizing the importance of evidence-based treatments for sleep disorders in military personnel and veterans.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to establish how common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies should be used for managing insomnia [^113QnjZM]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many studies have now investigated the effects of common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies (ASRTs) following the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine for the management of insomnia. However, ASRT choice is currently based on personal clinical experience or patient preference. This study will review the common ASRTs reported in clinical trials and analyze their efficacy and safety for managing insomnia with or without co-morbidities.

Methods

English and Chinese databases will be thoroughly searched, and other potentially eligible trials will be obtained by reviewing reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of common clinical ASRTs to manage insomnia published in peer-reviewed journals will be considered. Sleep quality questionnaires or indices will be considered as the main outcome, while the secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters, daytime dysfunction, quality of life, and adverse effects. Two reviewers will independently investigate eligible RCTs, extract information, analyze their methodological quality, and employ Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate the strength of the evidence. The treatment impact of various ASRTs will be calculated using meta-analysis techniques, and the degree of study heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochrane's Q and I-squared statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be used to evaluate the reliability of the results.

Results

Our systematic review and meta-analysis will present up-to-date evidence on: 1) which common clinical ASRTs are beneficial for the management of insomnia; and 2) whether the effects of common clinical ASRTs on insomnia vary depending on clinical, participant, and treatment characteristics.

Conclusion

The results of our review should help decision-makers make educated choices regarding evidence-based non-pharmacological management options for insomnia.

Sleep disruption is common in older adults and is associated with many poor health outcomes. It is vital for providers to understand insomnia and other sleep disorders in this population. This article outlines age-related changes in sleep, and medical, psychiatric, environmental, and psychosocial factors that may impact sleep. It addresses the evaluation of sleep symptoms and diagnosis of sleep disorders. It aims to examine the evidence for non-pharmacological and pharmacologic treatment options for insomnia while weighing factors particularly germane to the aging adult.

### Quality measures for the care of patients with insomnia [^1138MQHn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned five Workgroups to develop quality measures to optimize management and care for patients with common sleep disorders including insomnia. Following the AASM process for quality measure development, this document describes measurement methods for two desirable outcomes of therapy, improving sleep quality or satisfaction, and improving daytime function, and for four processes important to achieving these goals. To achieve the outcome of improving sleep quality or satisfaction, pre- and post-treatment assessment of sleep quality or satisfaction and providing an evidence-based treatment are recommended. To realize the outcome of improving daytime functioning, pre- and post-treatment assessment of daytime functioning, provision of an evidence-based treatment, and assessment of treatment-related side effects are recommended. All insomnia measures described in this report were developed by the Insomnia Quality Measures Workgroup and approved by the AASM Quality Measures Task Force and the AASM Board of Directors. The AASM recommends the use of these measures as part of quality improvement programs that will enhance the ability to improve care for patients with insomnia.

### Behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^1128VzXe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — implementation and counseling for behavioral insomnia therapies emphasize practical barriers, expected timelines, and safety: Some challenges include the ability to attend sessions and adhere to recommendations, improvement is often not immediate, and CBT-I treatment typically ranges from 4–8 visits. Patients may become discouraged if results are not immediate; it is important for the treating provider to recognize these challenges and help set realistic expectations before starting treatment. When counseling, patients should be reminded that psychological and behavioral insomnia therapies typically produce gradual improvements in insomnia symptoms, but the benefits are durable beyond the end of treatment, and undesirable effects (eg, sleepiness and fatigue) are typically mild and resolve quickly for most patients. In selecting treatments, clinicians should additionally consider comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions that may change the balance of benefits vs harms.

### Developing a successful treatment for co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnoea [^112PU4s1]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Insomnia and sleep apnoea are the two most common sleep disorders, found in 6% and 23–50% of the general population respectively. These disorders also frequently co-occur, with 39–58% of sleep apnoea patients reporting symptoms indicative of co-morbid insomnia. When these disorders co-occur, clinicians are faced with difficult treatment decisions, patients experience the additive detrimental impacts of both disorders, and the effectiveness of discrete treatments for each disorder may be impaired. A common finding is that co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnoea (COMISA) is more difficult to treat than either disorder presenting alone. Co-morbid insomnia reduces the initial acceptance of, and later adherence to, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea. This has resulted in recent recommendations that treatment approaches should initially target COMISA patients' insomnia to remove this barrier to CPAP treatment, and improve patient outcomes. However, no randomised controlled trial outcomes investigating this treatment approach currently exist. The current article aims to review and integrate recent research examining the prevalence, characteristics, and theoretical mechanistic relationships between co-occurring insomnia and OSA, and discuss previous treatment attempts.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to establish how common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies should be used for managing insomnia [^112674CQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Insomnia, a highly prevalent clinical problem across the world, is frequently reported by patients and may be a significant sign of a number of sleep and medical illnesses. Indeed, epidemiological research has shown that the prevalence of insomnia among people of all ages is rising year on year. Insomnia places huge burdens on individuals, families, and society, but, despite this, insomnia has not received sufficient recognition nor management in clinical practice. An increasing number of clinical trials have reported that ASRTs guided by TCM theory are helpful for improving insomnia disorder and daytime functioning as well as being relatively cheap, convenient, available, and safe. ASRTs might represent a clinical treatment option that could be offered as a second-line treatment when first-line treatments are not viable or tolerated. In addition to acupuncture and acupressure, ASRTs have now evolved into numerous treatment techniques driven by clinical need, with acupoint selection varying from practitioner to practitioner. While several clinical common ASRTs for insomnia have been evaluated in previous systematic reviews, in the face of such a wide range of ASRTs, there is no conclusion on how ASRT clinicians should manage insomnia in clinical practice. To develop guidelines and further drive future clinical practice and research, a more thorough and comprehensive evaluation of all the existing literature is required. The clinically recognized acupoint stimulation techniques for the management of insomnia with or without comorbid physical or neuropsychiatric illnesses will be reviewed and assessed for efficacy and safety in this review. By doing this, we hope to provide answers to the issues of whether efficacy differs depending on the part of sleep being addressed as well as whether the effects vary depending on the precise acupoints used, the form of acupoint stimulation, or the type of insomnia present.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115g7Xwo]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) chronic insomnia pharmacologic guideline — introduction and scope — states that the paper includes a systematic review and meta-analyses forming the basis of the initial guideline and is intended to serve as one component in an ongoing assessment, providing recommendations regarding specific insomnia drugs once the decision has been made to use pharmacotherapy and not recommending one drug over another. Cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia (CBT-I) are identified as a standard of treatment and such treatment carries a significantly favorable benefit: risk ratio; therefore, based on these guidelines, all patients with chronic insomnia should receive CBT-I as a primary intervention. Pharmacotherapy, alone or in combination with CBT-I, must continue to be considered a part of the therapeutic armamentarium, as it currently is for perhaps 25% of the population, though only an estimated 3.5% to 7% of individuals receive prescription medication for sleep disturbance and knowledge gaps among prescribers exist regarding proper usage.

### Health economics of insomnia treatments: the return on investment for a good night's sleep [^114qBysg]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic insomnia is the most common sleep disorder among adults and is associated with a wide range of negative outcomes. This article reviews the economic consequences of the disorder and the cost effectiveness of insomnia treatments. First, the total costs of insomnia are reviewed; in aggregate these costs exceed $100 billion USD per year, with the majority being spent on indirect costs such as poorer workplace performance, increased health care utilization, and increased accident risk. Next, the deleterious impact of insomnia on quality of life and the impact of treatment on quality of life are briefly considered. Finally, ten published studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of both pharmacological and behavioral treatments for insomnia are reviewed in detail. A significant majority of studies reviewed found that the cost of treating primary and comorbid insomnia is less than the cost of not treating it. Treatments were generally found to be cost-effective using commonly employed standards, with treatment costs being recouped within 6–12 mo.

### The assessment and management of insomnia: an update [^112xjy2k]. World Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Insomnia poses significant challenges to public health. It is a common condition associated with marked impairment in function and quality of life, psychiatric and physical morbidity, and accidents. As such, it is important that effective treatment is provided in clinical practice. To this end, this paper reviews critical aspects of the assessment of insomnia and the available treatment options. These options include both non-medication treatments, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and a variety of pharmacologic therapies such as benzodiazepines, "z-drugs", melatonin receptor agonists, selective histamine H1 antagonists, orexin antagonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and non-selective antihistamines. A review of the available research indicates that rigorous double-blind, randomized, controlled trials are lacking for some of the most commonly administered insomnia therapies. However, there are an array of interventions which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in insomnia in trials with the above features, and whose risk/benefit profiles have been well characterized. These interventions can form the basis for systematic, evidence-based treatment of insomnia in clinical practice. We review this evidence base and highlight areas where more studies are needed, with the aim of providing a resource for improving the clinical management of the many patients with insomnia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112KFy6W]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE assessment and evidence synthesis specify that the GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence, with the task force using objective data whenever possible (e.g., polysomnography) and designating objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence. Recommendation formulation balanced quality of evidence, benefits versus harms, and patient values and preferences. For quality judgments, criteria included imprecision (when 95% CI cross the clinical significance thresholds), inconsistency (I2 cutoff of 75%), indirectness (study population), and risk of publication bias (funding sources), and quality was based exclusively on studies included in meta-analyses. For meta-analyses, pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adverse events presented as risk difference.

### Insomnia [^117CfHiJ]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Insomnia is highly prevalent in clinical practice, occurring in up to 50% of primary care patients. Insomnia can present independently or alongside other medical conditions or mental health disorders and is a risk factor for the development and exacerbation of these other disorders if not treated. In 2016, the American College of Physicians recommended that insomnia be specifically targeted for treatment. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, whether the underlying cause has been identified or not, is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Currently, there is no global consensus regarding which pharmacological treatment has the best efficacy or risk-benefit ratio. Both CBT-I and pharmacological intervention are thought to have similar acute effects, but only CBT-I has shown durable long-term effects after treatment discontinuation. Administering a combined treatment of CBT-I and medication could decrease the latency to treatment response, but might diminish the durability of the positive treatment effects of CBT-I.

### Non-pharmacological approaches for management of insomnia [^111MUYHN]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem associated with a constellation of negative health-related outcomes and significant socioeconomic burden. It commonly co-occurs with psychiatric and medical conditions, which may further exacerbate these comorbid conditions and hinder treatment response. There is much empirical evidence to support the clinical efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), in managing insomnia in a wide range of populations. This article reviews the research on the efficacy of CBT-I for primary insomnia and insomnia comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions, the empirical evidence regarding different CBT-I treatment modalities, the implementation of CBT-I across different age groups, and some initial evidence on the sequential combination of insomnia treatments. A brief overview of other non-pharmacological treatment with regard to complementary alternative medicine is also provided.

### Pharmacologic management of insomnia: past, present, and future [^115xnmxf]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Views on the etiology and morbidities associated with insomnia are evolving and affect clinicians' approach to the pharmacologic management of insomnia. Currently, benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) and a single melatonin receptor agonist are recognized as safe and efficacious hypnotics. Variability in BzRAs, pharmacokinetics, and manipulation of dose provide clinicians with options that meet the needs of most patients. Other drugs (eg, sedating antidepressants) also are used commonly in clinical practice to treat insomnia, but evidence is lacking to support this most cases. Improvement in managing insomnia will result from systematic research with these drugs, with drugs in development, and with novel uses, such as co-therapy.

### Secondary insomnia: diagnostic challenges and intervention opportunities [^1161g9t5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The assessment and treatment of secondary insomnia (SI), the most common form of insomnia, are often complicated. Establishing an accompanying disorder as causal rather than comorbid is the key to assessment, but can be difficult even for experienced clinicians. Treatment often focuses on the primary disorder. In many cases, however, there is reason to treat the insomnia directly (insomnia is partially independent, does not respond to treatment of the primary condition, or has been misdiagnosed as SI). Although hypnotic medications are frequently used, behavioral interventions may be the best treatment approach, providing better long-term management of symptoms. Older adults warrant special consideration as age-related illnesses, changes in drug absorption and metabolism, and polypharmacy make them especially susceptible to SI. Recent research suggests successful treatment of insomnia may also relieve the primary disorder and merits follow-up. Future research is also needed on the efficacy of psychological treatment for SI for specific disorders as well as for older adults.

### Insomnia in the elderly: cause, approach, and treatment [^111LwR3Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent problem in late life. Sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a subjective report of insufficient or nonrestorative sleep despite adequate opportunity to sleep. Despite the fact that more than 50% of elderly people have insomnia, it is typically undertreated, and nonpharmacologic interventions are underused by health care practitioners. This article will review the causes of insomnia in the elderly, the approach to patient evaluation, and the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of insomnia.

### Behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^1116CsqE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is prioritized and its delivery detailed: CBT-I is generally regarded as the treatment of choice and is the only approach to receive a Strong recommendation. CBT-I is a multicomponent intervention whose component makeup varies, and these variations did not appear to systematically impact the effectiveness of the treatment. For delivery, in-person one-on-one CBT-I by a trained provider is the most widely evaluated and is generally considered the best available treatment. Given variability in access and costs, clinicians should discuss different CBT-I delivery modalities with their patients and align the delivery modality based on availability, affordability, treatment format, duration and the patient's preferences and values.

### Pharmacological management of insomnia [^113DtPb4]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition associated with significant morbidity, reduction in quality of life, and increase in healthcare costs, and is a risk factor for multiple physical and mental disorders. The primary treatment modality is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) but this is associated with difficulties with access and higher cost as well as poor response in some patients. Therefore, pharmacotherapy for insomnia is common and hypnotic agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Older medications for insomnia are limited by their side effect burden and narrow therapeutic window. Newer hypnotics, on the other hand, have been shown to have a better safety profile and longer term efficacy. While some studies have shown that long-term hypnotic use is associated with adverse outcomes, the current evidence is equivocal. The decision to treat chronic insomnia disorder with long-term hypnotics should be individualized and balance the potential risks of continuing hypnotic medication use with the risks of untreated persistent insomnia and associated functional limitations. This clinical review discusses the currently available medication options to treat insomnia, their mechanisms of action, dosing, and side effect profiles. This review also provides guidance on long-term management of hypnotics and the use of these medications in the elderly, those with medical comorbidities, and other special populations.

​​ Insomnia is a common feature of many psychiatric disorders but can also be a comorbid disorder, often contributing to poor outcomes and treatment failure. For some patients who do respond to psychiatric treatment, their insomnia persists after their mood symptoms have remitted, indicating that their insomnia needs to be a separate focus of treatment. In this CME Academic Highlights, Drs Ruth Benca and Daniel Buysse discuss how to effectively evaluate patients with psychiatric disorders for comorbid insomnia, as well as how to safely and effectively implement both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments. ​​​​​​​.

### Management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116NEnff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### The effect of insomnia definitions, terminology, and classifications on clinical practice [^1113J2FL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short-term (up to 3 weeks), and long-term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative-hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long-lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive-behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116h4D8y]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — adverse events and patient preference considerations explains that beyond the quality of evidence for or against use of a given drug for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, the task force also considered the relative benefit:harm ratio and the likelihood that an informed patient would use a specific agent, and that assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events often rely on spontaneous reporting by research participants with frequencies so low that reported studies are underpowered to find a difference from placebo. It adds that this implies the effect size for a TEAE would be very small and that it is unlikely the clinical significance of TEAEs has been underestimated, but some TEAEs are very infrequent yet very serious when they occur (for example, sleep-related behaviors with BzRA), clinical trials are likely to underestimate such risks due to the limited number of patients and limited duration of treatment, and as a result assessment of potential harms is largely derived from clinical experience and theoretical considerations rather than well-documented evidence; additionally, the task force judged likelihood of patient use and in most cases these judgments were in agreement with recommendations, while in certain cases (e.g., melatonin) informed patients may be likely to use a specific drug even when data do not clearly support a recommendation for use.

### The role of insomnia in depression and anxiety: its impact on functioning, treatment, and outcomes [^1132qRXX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common yet often unrecognized symptom in patients with depression and anxiety. Because of its association with functional impairment, medical conditions, and disturbances in multiple body systems, insomnia must be included in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. If left untreated, insomnia may increase the risk of episode recurrence, severe illness course, and poor treatment response. However, these risks may be diminished with effective insomnia treatment.

### How would you manage this patient with chronic insomnia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111MPucH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Insomnia, which is characterized by persistent sleep difficulties in association with daytime dysfunction, is a common concern in clinical practice. Chronic insomnia disorder is defined as symptoms that occur at least 3 times per week and persist for at least 3 months. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) published recent guidelines on behavioral and psychological treatment as well as pharmacologic therapy for chronic insomnia disorder. Regarding behavioral and psychological approaches, the only intervention strongly recommended was multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Regarding pharmacologic treatment, the AASM, based on weak evidence, suggested a limited number of medications that might be useful and others that probably are not. Here, 2 clinicians with expertise in sleep disorders-one a clinical psychologist and the other a physician-debate the management of a patient with chronic insomnia who has been treated with medications. They discuss the role of behavioral and psychological interventions and pharmacologic therapy for chronic insomnia and how the primary care practitioner should approach such a patient.

### Prevalence, associated risks, and treatment patterns of insomnia [^1156L7o1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Insomnia, the most commonly reported sleep problem, affects about one third of the adult American population. Insomnia impairs the individual's functioning, diminishes his or her quality of life, and contributes to accidents, health care costs, and problems at work. Insomnia is frequently comorbid with physical and mental illness, as either a consequence or a contributing factor. In particular, considerable research supports a strong association between insomnia and depression. Because the majority of individuals who have trouble sleeping attempt to treat the problem independently using over-the-counter medications or alcohol, insomnia is undertreated by health care providers, despite its serious consequences.

### Insomnia causes, consequences, and therapeutics: an overview [^11381cKs]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

There is growing interest in insomnia both from the perspective of recent advances in clinical management as well as research aimed at elucidating its pathophysiology. This theoretical overview of insomnia describes the negative impact, etiological considerations, and pharmacological and behavioral treatments for the disorder, with an emphasis on areas receiving increased research attention. Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder, affects 10–15% of the general population. In population-based studies severe insomnia has been shown to last for a median of 4 years. In addition, insomnia has a significant negative impact on an individual's work, physical, and social performance as well as overall quality of life. Furthermore, the economic cost of insomnia related to lost productivity, work-related accidents, absenteeism, and health-care costs are enormous. There is increasing evidence linking the precipitation of insomnia to stress, and converging evidence from cognitive, endocrine, neurological, and behavioral domains provide clear evidence for hyper-arousal in insomnia. However, there remains no consensus regarding the specific etiological mechanisms of this disorder. Although the pathophysiology of primary insomnia remains an enigma, numerous treatments both pharmacological and behavioral have been developed and found to be efficacious in controlled studies. Despite the wide availability of pharmacological treatments and increased knowledge of behavioral interventions, the vast majority of individuals with insomnia do not appear to be receiving adequate treatment. The inadequate treatment of insomnia leads to several important and under-recognized consequences including subsequent development of psychiatric disease and increased substance use.

### Behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116gd2Ev]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — alternatives to CBT-I and stance on sleep hygiene: Whereas CBT-I is the treatment of choice for most patients, BTIs, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control, and relaxation therapy are also potentially useful interventions with minimal undesirable effects, and thus all received Conditional recommendations. Some single-component therapies (paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining, biofeedback, cognitive therapy and mindfulness) lacked sufficient evidence for stand-alone recommendations, but the TF felt that these therapies should still be considered as viable treatment alternatives when CBT-I is not available or not desired by, or appropriate for, the patient. Sleep hygiene is not recommended to be used by itself as a single-component therapy due to lack of efficacy, although common-sense principles may help within comprehensive care, and education of front-line providers on more effective alternatives to sleep hygiene is needed. The TF judged that any resources utilized for a treatment without sufficient evidence may be considered unfavorable, and the TF determined that the vast majority of well-informed patients would not choose sleep hygiene or benefit from it as a single-component therapy for chronic insomnia disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116EqHNr]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Approach and interpretation of recommendations — direction, strength, public comment, and definitions indicate that the task force assigned a direction (for or against) and strength (STRONG or WEAK) for each recommendation statement. Public input was solicited for a two-week period on the AASM website, and based on comments the task force decided to include data from clinicaltrials.gov, which allowed development of a recommendation for the use of suvorexant; due to a conflict of interest, a task force member did not participate in that recommendation. The guideline states it should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other reasonable methods, defines a STRONG recommendation as one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, always be following when pharmacological treatment is indicated, and states that a WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in appropriateness and requires that the clinician use his/her clinical knowledge and experience and refer to the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

### Psychological and behavioral interventions for managing insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^111ijSmS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Psychological and behavioral interventions are frequently used for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess benefits and harms of psychological and behavioral interventions for insomnia disorder in adults.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO through September 2015, supplemented with hand-searching.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of psychological or behavioral interventions that were published in English and enrolled adults with insomnia disorder lasting 4 or more weeks.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Sixty trials with low to moderate risk of bias compared psychological and behavioral interventions with inactive controls or other psychological and behavioral interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved posttreatment global and most sleep outcomes, often compared with information or waitlist controls (moderate-strength evidence). Use of CBT-I improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Multicomponent behavioral therapy improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Stimulus control improved 1 or 2 sleep outcomes (low-strength evidence). Evidence for other comparisons and for harms was insufficient to permit conclusions.

Limitations

A wide variety of comparisons limited the ability to pool data. Trials did not always report global outcomes and infrequently conducted remitter or responder analysis. Comparisons were often information or waitlist groups, and publication bias was possible.

Conclusion

Use of CBT-I improves most outcomes compared with inactive controls. Multicomponent behavioral therapy and stimulus control may improve some sleep outcomes. Evidence on other outcomes, comparisons, and long-term efficacy were limited.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to establish how common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies should be used for managing insomnia [^113VB1LW]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Each different ASRT has its own advantages and disadvantages. In clinical practice, the choice of ASRT is variable and flexible according to clinical experience or patient preference rather than a sound evidence base. Therefore, a thorough systematic review with strict inclusion criteria is required to shed light on the efficacy and safety of various common clinical ASRTs in patients with insomnia to inform clinical recommendations. Given the efficacy of ASRT depends on the choice of acupoints, the method of acupoint stimulation, and the pathophysiological condition of patients, this meta-analysis will: 1) assess the effectiveness of the most frequently used common clinical ASRTs including MA, EA, laser acupuncture, ACE, acupressure, moxibustion, and TEAS as monotherapies or adjuncts to recommended treatments (hypnotic drugs or CBT-I) for primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia; and 2) undertake subgroup analyses to detect potential ASRT effect confounders such as treatment features (eg, acupoint selection, stimulation technique, and treatment duration) and patient characteristics (eg, age, comorbidities, severity, and course of insomnia).

### Increasing access to evidence-based insomnia care in the United States: findings from an American Academy of Sleep Medicine stakeholder summit [^111x9yHc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Challenges exist in access to high-quality care for insomnia disorder. After the recent publication of a clinical practice guideline on behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia in adults, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) hosted a 1-day virtual Insomnia Summit in September 2022 to discuss improving care for patients with insomnia disorder. Fifty participants representing a variety of organizations (eg, medical, psychological, and nursing associations; patient advocacy groups; and federal institutions) participated in the event. Videos highlighting patient perspectives on insomnia and an overview of current insomnia disorder treatment guidelines were followed by thematic sessions, each with 3 to 4 brief, topical presentations by content experts. Breakout groups were used to brainstorm and prioritize issues in each thematic area. Top barriers to care for insomnia disorder include limited access, limited awareness of treatment options, low perceived value of insomnia treatment, and an insufficient number of trained clinicians. Top facilitators of high-quality care include education and awareness, novel care models to increase access, expanding the insomnia patient care workforce, incorporating research into practice, and increasing reimbursement for psychotherapies. Priorities for the future include increasing awareness among patients and providers, increasing the number of skilled behavioral sleep medicine providers, increasing advocacy efforts to address insurance issues (eg, billing, reimbursement, and performance measures), and working collaboratively with multidisciplinary organizations to achieve common goals. These priorities highlight that goals set to improve accessible, high-quality care for insomnia disorder will require sustained, coordinated efforts to increase awareness, improve reimbursement, and grow the necessary skilled health care workforce.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The task force evaluated a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically relevant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that underpin the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific behavioral and psychological therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adult patients. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience, and to strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action. 1. We recommend that clinicians use multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (STRONG). 2. We suggest that clinicians use multicomponent brief therapies for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 3. We suggest that clinicians use stimulus control as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 4. We suggest that clinicians use sleep restriction therapy as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 5. We suggest that clinicians use relaxation therapy as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 6. We suggest that clinicians not use sleep hygiene as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

### The use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care: rational approaches. A consensus meeting summary [^116DJasT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To formulate a rational approach to the pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia, and to develop clinical guidelines regarding indications, target populations, and parameters for the use of these medications, especially by community-based pediatricians.

Participants

A multidisciplinary task force developed under the auspices of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which included experts in pediatric sleep medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, neurology, and general pediatrics.

Evidence

Review of existing data regarding current use of over-the-counter and prescription medications for pediatric insomnia in the primary care practice setting, and of empirical data on the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of medications commonly used for the treatment of pediatric insomnia.

Consensus Process

Group consensus definition of pediatric insomnia and clinical guidelines; working group recommendations regarding special populations and future directions.

Conclusions

Use of medications for pediatric insomnia should be diagnostically driven, and should be implemented in conjunction with empirically-based behavioral treatment strategies and adequate sleep hygiene. Specific target populations include children with neurodevelopmental disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, chronic medical conditions, and psychiatric disorders. Additional research, including clinical trials, is critically needed to provide an evidence-based approach to the use of these medications in clinical practice.

### Aiding sleep in type 2 diabetes: therapeutic considerations [^111Aycns]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are more prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general population. Both insomnia and OSA have been linked to cardiometabolic alterations (eg, hypertension, increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and systemic insulin resistance) that can exacerbate the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Improvement of sleep in patients with diabetes could therefore aid the treatment of diabetes. To help health practitioners choose the best clinical tool to improve their patients' sleep without detrimentally affecting glucose regulation, this Review critically analyses the effects of common treatments for insomnia and OSA on both sleep and glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes. These treatments include pharmaceutical sleep aids (eg, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, melatonin) and cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, continuous positive airway pressure for OSA, and lifestyle interventions.

### Use of sleep hygiene in the treatment of insomnia [^114oRGfW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Sleep hygiene (SH) refers to a list of behaviors, environmental conditions, and other sleep-related factors that can be adjusted as a stand-alone treatment or component of multimodal treatment for patients with insomnia. This paper presents a review of SH, how this concept has been applied and often modified over the past 24 years, and how it relates to the modern sleep disorder nosology, particularly Inadequate Sleep Hygiene. Although a recognized and commonly utilized treatment option, there is no absolute consensus about which steps must be included to constitute SH treatment, and there is much overlap between SH and other cognitive-behavioral treatments for insomnia such as Stimulus Control Procedures and Sleep Restriction Therapy. The literature on the effects of manipulations of individual components of SH under experimental conditions (e.g. effects of presleep alcohol or caffeine intake) in normal sleepers show mixed results. Empirical data demonstrating the role of poor SH as a contributor to insomnia, or showing that good SH improves sleep in patients with insomnia, is not available. Instead of evaluating the impact of a comprehensive list of SH recommendations, a focus on guidelines for use of individual rules is needed.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^112vKY7M]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which first-stage treatment is optimal for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia, and which second-stage treatment offers the best added value for patients whose insomnia has not remitted?

Findings

In a randomized clinical trial of 211 adults with insomnia disorder, first-stage treatment with behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem produced significant improvements for various daytime outcomes, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, functional impairments, and mental health, that were no different between groups. Adding a second-stage therapy offered an added value for further improving daytime functions with immediate and delayed effects observed for treatment sequences starting with zolpidem and BT, respectively.

Meaning

These findings support the comparable efficacy between sequential treatments starting with BT and zolpidem for addressing the daytime consequences of insomnia.

### Behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^1146CE4W]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this systematic review is to provide supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline on the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adult populations.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of 9 experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that addressed behavioral and psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the treatments produced clinically significant improvements in a range of critical and important outcomes. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process was used to evaluate the evidence for making specific treatment recommendations.

Results

The literature search identified 1,244 studies; 124 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 89 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. Evidence for the following interventions is presented in this review: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, brief therapies for insomnia, stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training, sleep hygiene, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining, and mindfulness. This review provides a detailed summary of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits vs harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### The value of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of insomnia [^111GLQ1M]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Insomnia is the most common reported sleep disorder with limited treatment options including pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Pharmacotherapy can be complicated by tolerance and significant side-effects and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia providers are limited in number. This article reviews mindfulness meditation as an additional therapy for insomnia.

Recent Findings

Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) have been studied in the treatment of insomnia. Randomized controlled studies of MBSR and MBTI have shown overall reduction in sleep latency and total wake time and increase in total sleep time after mindfulness therapy using both patient reported outcome and quantitative measures of sleep. Mindfulness techniques have been shown to be well accepted by patients with long-lasting effects. A three-arm randomized study with MBSR, MBTI, and self-monitoring showed similar improvement in insomnia between the MBSR and MBTI groups, with possibly longer duration of efficacy in the MBTI group. Recent data show that MBTI is also an effective and accepted treatment for insomnia in older patients.

Summary

Increasing evidence shows that mindfulness meditation, delivered either via MBSR or MBTI, can be successfully used for the treatment of insomnia with good patient acceptance and durable results.

### Chronic insomnia [^115TsdDM]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent complaint in clinical practice that can present independently or comorbidly with another medical or psychiatric disorder. In either case, it might need treatment of its own. Of the different therapeutic options available, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (BzRAs) and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) are supported by the best empirical evidence. BzRAs are readily available and effective in the short-term management of insomnia, but evidence of long-term efficacy is scarce and most hypnotic drugs are associated with potential adverse effects. CBT is an effective alternative for chronic insomnia. Although more time consuming than drug management, CBT produces sleep improvements that are sustained over time, and this therapy is accepted by patients. Although CBT is not readily available in most clinical settings, access and delivery can be made easier through use of innovative methods such as telephone consultations, group therapy, and self-help approaches. Combined CBT and drug treatment can optimise outcomes, although evidence to guide clinical practice on the best way to integrate these approaches is scarce.

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^112AiBos]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

Study Selection

35 randomized, controlled trials of at least 4 weeks' duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and that reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies that reported harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists; and product labels for all agents.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia, fractures, and major injury. The FDA documents reported that most pharmacotherapies had risks for cognitive and behavioral changes, including driving impairment, and other adverse effects, and they advised dose reduction in women and in older adults.

Limitations

Most trials were small and short term and enrolled individuals meeting stringent criteria. Minimum important differences in outcomes were often not established or reported. Data were scant for many treatments.

Conclusion

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term global and sleep outcomes for adults with insomnia disorder, but the comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapies for insomnia are not known. Pharmacotherapies for insomnia may cause cognitive and behavioral changes and may be associated with infrequent but serious harms.

### Classifying insomnia in a clinically useful way [^114BwuNw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent complaint that may arise from myriad causes. Therefore, patients who present for insomnia evaluation and treatment represent a rather heterogeneous group that merits a reliable and valid diagnostic system. This review article considers the general purposes of diagnostic classification per se and highlights the factors that influence the development of diagnostic nosologies. Various past and current insomnia nosologies are described, and data supporting the reliability, validity, and general utility of these systems are presented. In addition, the limitations of existing nosologies are discussed, and factors that will lead to improved insomnia nosologies in the future are considered. The panel discussion that follows this review highlights the limitations of current nosologies and notes barriers that must be overcome to improve upon the currently available classification systems.

Approximately 30–50% of patients with OSA report clinically significant insomnia symptoms, and 30–40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfil diagnostic criteria for OSA. Compared to either insomnia or OSA alone, co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) is associated with greater morbidity for patients, complex diagnostic decisions for clinicians, and reduced response to otherwise effective treatment approaches. Potential bi-directional causal relationships between the mechanisms and manifestations of insomnia and OSA could play an integral role in the development and management of COMISA. A greater understanding of these relationships is required to guide personalized diagnostic and treatment approaches for COMISA. This review summarizes the available evidence of bi-directional relationships between COMISA, including epidemiological research, case studies, single-arm treatment studies, randomized controlled treatment trials, and objective sleep study data. This evidence is integrated into a conceptual model of COMISA to help refine the understanding of potential bi-directional causal relationships between the two disorders. This theoretical framework is essential to help guide future research, improve diagnostic tools, determine novel therapeutic targets, and guide tailored sequenced and multi-faceted treatment approaches for this common, complex, and debilitating condition.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep disorders [^112VcmYy]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

More than 70 million people in the United States experience primary insomnia (PI) at some point in their life, resulting in an estimated $65 billion in health care costs and lost productivity. PI is therefore one of the most common health care problems in the United States. To mollify the negative effects of PI, scholars have sought to evaluate and improve treatments of this costly health care problem. A breadth of research has demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention for PI. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of CBT for PI, including evidence regarding treatment efficacy, effectiveness, and practitioner considerations.
