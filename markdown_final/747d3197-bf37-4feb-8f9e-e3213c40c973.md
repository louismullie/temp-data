## Question

Is C3 and C4 low in SLE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether complement components C3 and C4 are low in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology (immune complex–driven classical pathway activation and complement consumption). Then, I should verify how low complement is treated in modern classification frameworks and clinical guidelines. Next, I will review how C3/C4 behave with disease activity, especially lupus nephritis and special situations like pregnancy. After that, I need to consider exceptions and confounders (acute-phase compensation, genetic C4 copy number, quiescent disease) and the differential for low complement. Finally, I will examine whether more dynamic complement biomarkers outperform static C3/C4 and integrate these points into a concise clinical answer.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. In SLE, immune complexes activate the classical complement pathway, consuming C4 and C3; serum levels typically fall when activation outpaces hepatic synthesis, especially during active disease and organ inflammation, which fits the biologic model for hypocomplementemia in SLE flares [^111hGqnx] [^112c7pMh] [^113DxXC4].

> Hold on, I should verify how this is reflected in formal criteria. Low complement (C3, C4, and/or CH50) appears as an immunologic item in the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria; I almost said "diagnostic criteria", but wait, I should correct myself — these are classification tools used primarily for research and standardization, not strict diagnostic rules, though they guide clinical reasoning in practice [^112KtaWP] [^111hGqnx] [^117AFf3k].

> I will now examine the link to activity and organ involvement. Low C3/C4 correlates with active global disease and is particularly associated with lupus nephritis; guideline panels recommend serial complement assessment for surveillance because trends often parallel activity and impending renal flares, though with imperfect sensitivity [^113DxXC4] [^112ocfpB] [^1153uydx].

> Let me consider pregnancy, since physiology shifts the baseline. I need to check whether the expected gestational rise in C3/C4 occurs in SLE; data show that failure of the normal increase — especially persistently low C4 at preconception — is linked to higher flare risk during pregnancy, which reinforces the activity signal embedded in complement trends [^113TtQAj].

> But wait, what if C3/C4 are normal — does that exclude SLE activity? I should double-check the limitations. Acute-phase hepatic synthesis can partially compensate for consumption, genetic variability in C4 copy number broadens "normal", and quiescent disease typically normalizes complement; importantly, severe flares with normal complement can occur, so a normal C3/C4 does not rule out active SLE and must be interpreted in clinical context [^111hGqnx] [^113fg1Bb] [^113zuQzf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specificity either. I need to ensure we remember other causes of low complement levels: various infections, immune complex glomerulonephritides, cryoglobulinemia, protein-losing states, and other complementopathies can depress C3 and/or C4, so attribution to SLE requires the right clinical-serologic setting and exclusion of alternatives [^112yvUy1] [^114Rhusm] [^112ZkVD8].

> Next, I should review whether more dynamic complement biomarkers outperform static C3/C4. Let me verify: the iC3b:C3 ratio better discriminates active from inactive SLE and associates with nephritis; plasma/renal C4d and the C4d/C4 ratio track proliferative LN activity and treatment response; and cell-bound complement activation products (e.g. EC4d, BC4d) appear earlier/more frequently in suspected SLE than low C3/C4, while functional assays can capture pathway activity that static levels miss [^1125qLvc] [^112FfJwK] [^1167hmnj] [^111hGqnx] [^116YMDg3].

> Let me consider treatment effects and monitoring cadence. I should confirm guideline surveillance: complements are commonly checked at each visit (not more than monthly) to trend activity, and hydroxychloroquine exposure has been associated with complement normalization over time, suggesting that therapeutic control of immune complex–mediated activation can raise C3/C4 in responders [^112ocfpB] [^115d4s87].

> Integrating this, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise. Yes, C3 and C4 are characteristically low when SLE is active — most notably in lupus nephritis — and low complement is embedded in EULAR/ACR classification; however, normal complements do not exclude active disease because of compensatory synthesis, genetic variation, organ-limited activity, or heterogeneous flare biology, so complements should be interpreted alongside anti-dsDNA, urine protein/urinalysis, and, when available, dynamic markers such as iC3b:C3 or C4d to refine assessment and anticipate flares [^112KtaWP] [^111hGqnx] [^112ocfpB] [^1125qLvc].

---

Yes, C3 and C4 are often low in SLE due to **complement consumption** from immune complex–driven classical pathway activation [^111t4ytM], especially during flares and in lupus nephritis [^113DxXC4]. Low C3/C4 are included in SLE classification criteria [^112KtaWP] and are used to monitor disease activity, but they are **not specific** to SLE and can be low in other conditions [^112ZkVD8] or due to genetic variation [^111hGqnx]. Persistent hypocomplementemia is linked to higher flare risk [^1153uydx] and organ damage, so serial measurement is recommended for monitoring [^112ocfpB].

---

## Pathophysiological basis for low C3 and C4 in SLE

- **Immune complex formation**: Autoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA) form immune complexes that activate the classical pathway [^1131mXeg], consuming C3 and C4 [^113DxXC4].

- **Classical pathway activation**: C1q binds immune complexes [^112c7pMh], triggering C4 and C2 cleavage, forming C3 convertase (C4b2a) and consuming C3/C4 [^113DxXC4].

- **Complement consumption**: Ongoing activation during flares [^112KtaWP], especially in lupus nephritis, leads to sustained low C3/C4 [^111t4ytM].

---

## Clinical significance of low C3 and C4 levels in SLE

- **Disease activity marker**: Low C3/C4 correlate with active disease [^111hGqnx] and are included in EULAR/ACR criteria [^112KtaWP].

- **Lupus nephritis**: Low C3/C4 are strongly associated with lupus nephritis [^111t4ytM] and correlate with renal disease activity.

- **Flare prediction**: Persistent low C3/C4 predict flares [^114ca3WR] and organ damage [^115d4s87], supporting their use in monitoring.

---

## Frequency of low C3 and C4 levels in SLE

Approximately **40–60%** of patients with SLE have low C3/C4 during active disease [^111hGqnx], particularly with renal involvement [^111t4ytM]. In **lupus nephritis**, low C3/C4 are especially common and correlate with renal disease activity [^111t4ytM].

---

## Clinical implications of persistently low C3 and C4 levels

Persistent hypocomplementemia is associated with an **increased flare risk** [^114ca3WR] and organ damage [^115d4s87]. For **monitoring and management**, serial C3/C4 measurements are recommended to guide therapy and detect flares early [^112ocfpB].

---

## Limitations of using C3 and C4 levels as biomarkers

Low C3/C4 **lack specificity**, as they can occur in other conditions (e.g. infections, other autoimmune diseases) [^112ZkVD8] [^112yvUy1]. **Genetic variability**, particularly C4 copy number variation, can cause low C4 independent of disease activity [^111hGqnx] [^114e1PAt]. During the **acute phase response**, hepatic upregulation can mask consumption, limiting the sensitivity of C3/C4 as activity markers [^111hGqnx].

---

## Alternative and complementary biomarkers

- **Complement split products**: iC3b [^1125qLvc] and C4d [^114oizgG] may better reflect real-time activation than C3/C4 alone [^111hGqnx].

- **Anti-dsDNA antibodies**: Often rise with flares and complement consumption, aiding activity assessment [^112KtaWP].

- **Cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs)**: May detect activation earlier than low C3/C4 [^1167hmnj] [^111hGqnx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

For **routine monitoring**, regular C3/C4 measurements are recommended to assess activity and detect flares [^112ocfpB]. For **interpretation in context**, use C3/C4 alongside clinical features and other biomarkers to guide decisions [^112KtaWP] [^116LmdJU].

---

Low C3 and C4 are **common in SLE** due to classical pathway activation [^112c7pMh] and are useful for monitoring activity and flares, especially in lupus nephritis [^111t4ytM]. They are **not specific** [^112ZkVD8] and can be affected by other conditions or genetic variation [^111hGqnx], so results should be interpreted in clinical context with additional biomarkers.

### New biomarkers in SLE: From bench to bedside [^111hGqnx]. Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Complement is a double-edged sword in SLE, protecting from the disease on one hand but mediating organ damage on the other. A huge amount of data supports the clinical value of complement measurement in the disease. The detection of complement components in tissues is routinely employed to evaluate immune complex deposition in target organs. Decreased concentrations of complement components in blood are strongly associated with active disease and are predictive of flares. Low levels of serum complement 3 (C3) and C4 are included in the classification criteria developed by EULAR and ACR.

However, the detection of C3 and C4 levels suffers from well-known limitations. Complement activation is increased in active disease, but the diminished levels of C3 and C4 are partially compensated by the acute phase production of the two proteins. Moreover, variability in C4 gene copy number in the population leads to a wide interval of 'normal' C4 levels. Applying the analysis of C4 gene copy number to SLE patients, it has been reported that 3 out of 11 SLE patients with persistently low C4 levels, in spite of low disease activity, are carriers of only two copies of the C4 gene.

Thus, the measurement of C3 and C4 levels is not a sensitive tool to study SLE patients and does not accurately reflect ongoing complement activation in SLE sera. More information can be gained using functional assays that explore the whole complement cascade, such as the capacity of erythrocyte lysis (haemolytic potential) or the levels of solid phase or soluble membrane attack complex.

### Lupus nephritis [^111t4ytM]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis is associated with several clinical and laboratory features. These include increased serum creatinine, decreased serum complement C3 and C4, and increased urine protein. The disease is often linked with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the presence of anti-double stranded DNA antibodies. Patients may exhibit symptoms such as cloudy urine, hematuria, and the presence of red blood cell casts in the urine. Other associated features include ankle swelling, hypertension, and a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test.

Lupus nephritis is more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, including African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, and is also seen in individuals with other autoimmune disorders. While it can affect both sexes, it is notably prevalent in males compared to other forms of lupus.

### Taming renal inflammation: Signaling pathways and therapeutic advances in lupus nephritis [^113DxXC4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

The complement system involves over 30 serum proteins that belong to the innate immune system. The activation of complement involves three pathways: classical, alternative, and lectin. These pathways culminate in the generation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which "pokes holes" in the cellular membrane, causing cellular death. In lupus nephritis (LN), it is the classical complement pathway that is commonly activated when C1q in the C1 complex recognizes the Fc portion of the antibody (either free or in immune complexes) within renal tissue. Upon Fc binding, the C1 complex cleaves C4 and C2 to activate C3 convertase (C4b2a) and ultimately C5 convertase (C4b2a3b).

C5 cleavage leads to the formation of C5a, which not only recruits C6–9 proteins to assemble into the MAC but also serves as a potent anaphylatoxin that recruits inflammatory cells to the kidney, exacerbating injury. Excessive complement activation in LN occurs due to the presence of autoantibodies and immune complexes, which are poorly cleared by dysregulated macrophages. Given the close interplay between Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) and complement activation, aberrant FcγR signaling can further potentiate complement-mediated inflammation and exacerbate renal damage. To this end, low serum C3 and C4 levels correlate with disease severity. Moreover, deficiencies in C1q or accumulation of anti-C1q antibodies impair the clearance of apoptotic cells, leading to flare-ups that further worsen kidney function.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: A review [^112KtaWP]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and immune-mediated injury to multiple organ systems, including the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic, and kidney systems. Approximately 3.4 million people worldwide have received a diagnosis of SLE.

Approximately 90% of people with SLE are female. Although there are no uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria for SLE, the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly the European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria developed for scientific study are an estimated 96.1% sensitive and 93.4% specific for SLE. These classification criteria include both clinical factors, such as fever, cytopenia, rash, arthritis, and proteinuria, which may be indicative of lupus nephritis; and immunologic measures, such as SLE-specific autoantibodies and low complement levels. Approximately 40% of people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and an estimated 10% of people with lupus nephritis develop end-stage kidney disease after 10 years.

The primary goal of treatment is to achieve disease remission or quiescence, defined by minimal symptoms, low levels of autoimmune inflammatory markers, and minimal systemic glucocorticoid requirement while the patient is treated with maintenance doses of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. Treatment goals include reducing disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and organ damage due to the disease or treatment toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is standard.

### Renal deposits of complement factors as predictors of end-stage renal disease and death in patients with lupus nephritis [^111RZ2Ui]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Since lupus nephritis (LN) elevates the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death, estimating these risks poses a challenge. Complement factors, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of LN, are often deposited in the kidneys as C1q and C3. This study examines whether these deposits can predict ESRD and death in LN patients.

Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were collected from 183 adult patients diagnosed with LN classes II–V via a first native kidney biopsy. The pathological data comprised the localization and intensity of immunofluorescence staining of C1q and C3. Dates of incident ESRD and death were sourced from the United States Renal Data System and National Death Index. Survival curves and hazard ratios for ESRD and death, both as composite and separate outcomes, were evaluated.

The analysis indicated that the presence and intensity of C1q and C3 deposits in glomeruli, tubular walls, and vascular walls varied among classes. These deposits were associated with known unfavorable prognostic factors, including hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocomplementemia. However, over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, neither the presence nor the intensity of these deposits correlated with survival free of ESRD and death, nor with hazard ratios for ESRD and death.

In conclusion, renal deposits of complement factors did not predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

### Usefulness of erythrocyte-bound C4d as a biomarker to predict disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1144BHGY]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by abnormal complement activation. Numerous new biomarkers have recently been used to diagnose or monitor disease activity in patients with SLE. We checked the levels of erythrocyte-bound C4d (E-C4d), an activation-derived fragment of C4 that is deposited on the erythrocytes, under different conditions of SLE to correlate these levels with disease activity.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional investigation of three groups of patients: (i) 63 patients with SLE; (ii) 43 patients with other diseases; and (iii) 26 healthy controls. Erythrocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the levels of E-C4d.

- **Results**: We found a significant elevation in the mean levels of E-C4d in SLE patients compared with patients with other diseases or healthy controls. In SLE patients, the levels of E-C4d were correlated with the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and inversely correlated with serum C3/C4 levels. In the subgroup of SLE patients with hemolytic anemia (HA), a significantly higher level of E-C4d was observed than in SLE patients without HA. However, in SLE patients with HA, there was no correlation between the levels of E-C4d and other markers of disease activity, including SLEDAI and levels of anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4.

- **Conclusion**: E-C4d levels are useful diagnostic markers for SLE and can serve as biomarkers of disease activity in patients with SLE. However, E-C4d is of limited value in monitoring disease activity in SLE patients with HA.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^11773dsk]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Sixty-nine patients with probable SLE completed a follow-up visit 9–18 months after enrollment. Follow-up visits were conducted at all sites, and there were no differences in age, sex, time since diagnosis, race/ethnicity, or fulfillment of SLICC criteria or individual ACR criteria between the group of patients who had a follow-up visit in this time frame (n = 69) and those who did not (n = 23) (data not shown). Disease activity was slightly higher in the group that did not attend a follow-up visit (nonserologic SELENA–SLEDAI 2.09 versus 1.09; P = 0.04).

Of the 69 patients who completed a follow-up visit, 20 (29%) fulfilled ≥ 1 additional ACR criterion. Hematologic disorder was the criterion fulfilled with highest frequency (50%), followed by oral ulcers (19%), immunologic disorder (8%), serositis (8%), arthritis (8%), photosensitivity (4%), and rash (4%). Of the 13 patients who fulfilled an additional hematologic criterion at follow-up, 10 had lymphopenia as their sole feature. Of these, 3 were receiving medications that might have affected lymphocyte counts: azathioprine 50 mg/day, methotrexate 15 mg/week, and/or mycophenolate 2,000 mg/day plus prednisone 2.5 mg/day. Investigators concluded that the lymphopenias were due to SLE.

Fulfillment of the SLICC criteria at enrollment did not predict fulfillment of the ACR criteria 18 months later. Of the 69 patients with probable SLE who completed a follow-up visit, 26 (38%) had fulfilled SLICC criteria at enrollment, and 43 (62%) had not. Ten of the 26 patients with probable SLE who had fulfilled SLICC at enrollment.

### C4A deficiency and elevated level of immune complexes: the mechanism behind increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus [^116Pj51j]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Studies of an Icelandic cohort showed that susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in individuals with C4A deficiency was increased only in the presence of increased concentrations of immune complexes. We investigated the interaction of C4A deficiency with elevated concentrations of immune complexes in healthy individuals; specifically, how different levels of C4A affected the activation of C4 and C3 and subsequent binding of increased immune complex load to human red blood cells (RBC).

Forty-five healthy individuals with varying levels of C4A were studied: 8 with homozygous C4AQ0, 12 with heterozygous C4A deficiency, and 25 with normal C4A. For comparison to the complement status present after prolonged disease activity, 5 patients with SLE and homozygous C4AQ0 were also studied.

The results showed that intact immune complex-RBC binding is dependent on the levels of immune complex-bound C3 fragments, which correlate to the levels of IC-bound C4Ad (R = 0.677, p = 0.02), but not on levels of IC-bound total C4d (R = 0.451, p = 0.16). Immune complex binding to RBC was also evaluated under increasing immune complex load. C4A deficient sera had less ability to bind the increased immune complex load to RBC than sera with normal C4A. These results are consistent with the presence of increased amounts of poorly opsonized immune complexes in C4A deficiency, leading to increased precipitation in tissues and initiation of a self-perpetuating cycle.

Susceptibility to SLE is increased in individuals with C4A deficiency as C3 opsonization pathways are altered, resulting in complex precipitation and tissue accumulation.

### Serum amyloid P component-DNA complexes are decreased in systemic lupus erythematosus: Inverse association with anti-dsDNA antibodies [^1168Sris]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine serum levels of serum amyloid P component (SAP) and SAP-DNA complexes in a population-based cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

- **Methods**: The study population included 82 unselected patients of predominantly Scandinavian ancestry with SLE, classified according to established criteria. Serum samples were collected at baseline and serially over a period of up to 2 years. Levels of SAP component and SAP-DNA complexes were measured using ELISA. Associations between SAP-DNA and clinical manifestations or serological findings were analyzed. Ninety healthy, age-matched blood donors served as controls.

- **Results**: SLE patients exhibited normal serum concentrations of SAP, while SAP-DNA complexes were decreased. Notably, two-thirds of SLE patients consistently tested negative for SAP-DNA complexes. There was no observed relationship between SAP-DNA complex occurrence and clinical manifestations. However, SAP-DNA-negative patients exhibited lower leukocyte counts and complement C3 levels, along with higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C3d levels compared to SAP-DNA-positive patients. An inverse association was identified between the occurrence of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies and SAP-DNA complexes. Only one SLE patient demonstrated the co-occurrence of SAP-DNA complexes and anti-dsDNA antibodies, suggesting that 81 out of 82 patients were discordant for the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and SAP-DNA complexes.

- **Conclusion**: The reduced levels of SAP-DNA complexes in SLE patients, combined with the inverse relationship between these complexes and anti-dsDNA antibodies, support the proposed concept that [Discussion is cut off].

### Lessons of the Elwha River: Managing health hazards during dam removal [^112yvUy1]. Environmental Health Perspectives (2012). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased serum complement C3 can result from burn injury, lupus nephritis, infective endocarditis, invasive meningococcal disease, or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. It may also be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, partial lipodystrophy, complement factor H deficiency, hereditary C3 deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or protein-losing enteropathy. Additionally, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, hepatitis C virus infection, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease are potential causes.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^112yDZUs]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The study presents results concerning patient characteristics at baseline from the CASTLE study involving 159 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient demographics include 89.3% female participants, with an ethnic distribution of 57.9% African American and 42.1% European descent. The average age was 41.3 years with a standard deviation of 13.6 years.

With respect to the SLE characteristics, 67.8% of the patients were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies. Additionally, 37.1% were administered a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone, defined as more than 7.5 mg/day, where the mean dose was 16.1 mg/day with a standard deviation of 14.5 mg/day. Furthermore, 18.2% of the subjects presented with at least one renal manifestation, which included conditions such as urinary casts, proteinuria, hematuria, or pyuria. The mean SLEDAI-2K disease activity score was recorded at 5.14 with a standard deviation of 5.74. Blood iC3b levels averaged 4.47 μg/ml with a range of 0.7 to 21.0 μg/ml, and the iC3b:C3 ratio averaged 5.01 μg/mg, ranging from 0.66 to 74.51 μg/mg.

Please refer to Supplementary Table 1 on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website for details regarding the 48 healthy control subjects.

### Consumption of erythrocyte CR1 (CD35) is associated with protection against systemic lupus erythematosus renal flare [^116kHaF8]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Erythrocyte complement receptor type one (E-CR1) is thought to protect against immune complex (IC) disease through interactions that lead to E-CR1 consumption. Low E-CR1 levels are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that E-CR1 consumption can predict or mark SLE flare.

Recurrently active SLE patients [n = 43; 28 with past or present major renal manifestations (SLER) and 15 without (SLENR)] were evaluated every 2 months by detailed protocol testing (mean follow-up 22 months), including direct measurements of E-CR1 levels using a radioimmunoassay. Detectable E-CR1 levels fluctuated widely through acute periods of consumption and regeneration in all patients, preventing the use of any single value as a baseline. However, when individual chronic baseline values were used, determined as the mean of all E-CR1 values 4 months or more from a flare, a clear trend was observed. In 16 of 16 instances of non-renal flare in SLER patients, E-CR1 levels decreased at flare (mean decrease 34%, P < 0.0001).

In contrast, no consistent difference was observed for flare in SLENR patients or for renal flare in SLER patients. Changes in E-CR1 levels did not correlate with plasma CR1 levels. In conclusion, single occurrences of E-CR1 consumption did not generally predict or mark SLE flare. However, compared to the average E-CR1 levels measured during no-flare intervals, E-CR1 consumption in SLER patients at flare was strongly associated with freedom from signs of renal involvement. We postulate that E-CR1 consumption reflects underlying imbalances in disease activity rather than serving as a reliable predictor for SLE flare.

### Novel assays to assess the functional capacity of the classical, the alternative and the lectin pathways of the complement system [^116p2JF4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Deficiencies in many of the complement proteins and their regulatory molecules have been described, and a variety of diseases, such as recurrent infections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and renal diseases, may be linked to deficiency in the complement system. Screening for complement defects is therefore of great importance. In this study, we present novel improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the functional assessment of the three individual pathways of the complement system. The method is applicable at high serum concentrations, and we demonstrate that it minimizes both false negatives as well as false positives. In particular, for the functional mannose-binding lectin activity, it represents an improvement on the existing assays. In this respect, the present assays represent novel improved diagnostic protocols for patients with suspected immunodeficiencies related to the complement system.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^1167hmnj]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate the frequency of cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs) as a marker of complement activation in patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we investigated the usefulness of this biomarker as a predictor of the evolution of probable SLE into SLE as classified by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

- **Methods**:
	- Patients with suspected SLE, fulfilling three ACR classification criteria (probable SLE), were enrolled alongside patients with established SLE, classified by both the ACR and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. Patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and other rheumatic diseases were also included. Individual CB-CAPs were measured through flow cytometry, comparing positivity rates to commonly assessed biomarkers, including serum complement proteins (C3 and C4) and autoantibodies. We also evaluated the frequency of a positive multianalyte assay panel (MAP) that includes CB-CAPs, with probable SLE cases followed up prospectively.

- **Results**:
	- The 92 patients with probable SLE were diagnosed more recently than the 53 patients with established SLE, and their use of antirheumatic medications was lower. At the enrollment visit, more patients with probable SLE were positive for CB-CAPs (28%) or MAP (40%) than those with low complement levels (9%) (P = 0.0001 for each). In probable SLE cases, MAP scores of > 0.8 at enrollment predicted fulfillment of a fourth ACR criterion within 18 months (hazard ratio 3.11, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**:
	- The study supports the utility of CB-CAPs and MAP scores in predicting the progression of probable SLE to ACR-classified SLE. The significant difference in complement levels and MAP scores at enrollment demonstrates the potential for these biomarkers in clinical practice for SLE progression prediction.

### Hydroxychloroquine improves low complement levels [^115d4s87]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Low credibility.

Having a low complement level is associated with clinical systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity and future organ damage. We studied the association of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) whole blood levels with changes in complement levels.

- **Methods**: We performed two analyses on data prospectively collected from an SLE cohort. In the first analysis, termed "new starts on HCQ", we compared changes in complement levels between those starting HCQ and those not starting it. The second analysis evaluated the association between HCQ whole blood levels and low complement levels in all cohort visits using conditional logistic regression.

- **Results**: In the "new starts on HCQ" analysis, a higher percentage of patients starting HCQ (as reflected by HCQ blood levels > 50) experienced a normalization of C4 levels compared to those not starting HCQ (23 of 57 [40%] vs. 9 of 56 [13%]; P = 0.011), as well as a significantly greater increase in both C3 and C4 levels (P = 0.048 and P = 0.017, respectively). In the "all cohort visits" analysis, there was a statistically significant higher probability of having normal C4 levels in visits with higher HCQ whole blood levels (odds ratio 1.8–2.6 depending on the levels). This relationship was most pronounced for whole blood HCQ levels of 200 ng/mL or more.

- **Conclusion**: We observed significant improvement in complement levels when HCQ was started and among those with higher whole blood levels of HCQ, particularly with respect to C4. Modulating the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to complement consumption may be one mode by which HCQ prevents poor outcomes in SLE.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^112heuRd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The lateral flow assay employed in this study offers rapid and precise measurements of iC3b, with results obtained in 20 minutes and an accuracy comparable to an ELISA. A cassette that measures C3 using a lateral flow assay has recently been produced, and data from a prototype have shown accuracy similar to that of nephelometry. Thus, following additional validation, dual measurements of iC3b and C3 levels could potentially be obtained to generate the iC3b:C3 ratio as a point-of-care test.

Lower blood iC3b levels were independently associated with higher odds of active disease for a given iC3b:C3 ratio, anti-dsDNA antibody level, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone. This finding is surprising because the production of iC3b should increase with complement activation. We initially speculated that the expression levels of complement receptors in SLE might influence iC3b levels. The surface density of the iC3b receptors CR1 and CR2 is inversely correlated with SLE disease activity. CR1 can bind to C3b, inactivate it into iC3b, and further into C3dg and C3c. Thus, in those with more active disease, less iC3b may be formed due to a decrease in CR1 expression. Conversely, decreased CR2 expression in active disease could result in increased iC3b levels due to reduced clearance. Furthermore, proteins important in SLE (interferon-α and the downstream product of iC3b proteolysis, C3d) are also ligands for CR2, which may further increase iC3b levels due to receptor occupancy.

### Erythrocyte C4d and complement receptor 1 in systemic lupus erythematosus [^116h1iWf]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Complement activation and ineffective clearance of complement-bearing immune complexes via erythrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Abnormally high levels of erythrocyte C4d and low levels of complement receptor 1 (CD35) have been reported in SLE and might have diagnostic utility. We investigated whether erythrocyte C4d and complement receptor 1 were specific for SLE and whether there was any association with disease activity.

- **Methods**: Expression of complement receptor 1 (CD35) and complement protein C4d on erythrocytes was measured by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry on the same day as the blood draw, in patients with SLE, patients with rheumatic disease, and in normal controls.

- **Results**: Within the SLE population, there was no association with disease activity measured by the physician's global assessment or SELENA SLE Disease Activity Index, nor with past or lupus nephritis. Assays were not specific for SLE, with higher levels also seen in antiphospholipid syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: Overlap of erythrocyte C4d and CD35 between SLE and other rheumatic diseases limits their utility as diagnostic tests. However, longitudinal investigation of these assays is warranted, especially given the higher levels in some patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome.

### The innate immune perspective of autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions [^113nF474]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The complement system

Various proteins are utilized by the innate immune system, including the complex complement system. This system encompasses a cascade of activated and regulatory proteins that eventually recognize and eliminate pathogens by direct killing of infected cells or initiation of phagocytosis. A deficiency of complement proteins is linked with immune deficiency (e.g. meningococcal infections), autoimmunity, and other immune-mediated conditions (e.g. hereditary angioedema). Notably, the complement system is essential for the production of immune complexes and, as such, is activated concomitantly during innate and adaptive responses.

- **Activation pathways**: The activation of the complement system initiates a proteolytic cascade through one of three pathways: classical, alternative, or lectin.

	- Typical complement activation and consumption in certain autoimmune diseases is mediated by one of these three specific pathways. In this manner, differences in the complement pattern of deficiencies may be unique to each disease.

	- Low or absent levels of classical pathway components are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like syndromes in humans and animal models. Abnormal activation of the classical pathway is also linked to cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. This small vessel vasculitis may be monoclonal, mixed, or polyclonal, and one of its hallmarks is the consumption of C4, C1q, and abnormal CH50.

	- In contrast, ANCA-associated vasculitis involves the alternative pathway, with a pivotal role of C5a in the stimulation and degranulation of neutrophils. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HScP), another vasculitic disease, is related to the…

### Differentiating between activation via the lectin or the classical complement pathway in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^112c7pMh]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Complement activation is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can proceed through the classical (CP), lectin (LP), or alternative pathway (AP). When managing SLE patients, pathway-specific complement activation is rarely monitored as clinical assays are unavailable. In this study, we aim to differentiate between CP- or LP-mediated complement activation in SLE patients by quantifying pathway-specific protein complexes, namely C1s/C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) (CP-specific activation) and MASP-1/C1-INH (LP-specific activation). Levels for both complexes were assessed in 156 SLE patients and 50 controls using two newly developed ELISAs. We investigated whether pathway-specific complement activation was associated with disease activity and lupus nephritis (LN).

Disease activity stratification was performed using SLEDAI scores assessed at inclusion. C1s/C1-INH concentrations were significantly increased in active SLE patients (SLEDAI ≥ 6) when compared with SLE patients with low disease activity (SLEDAI < 6, P < 0.01) and correlated with SLEDAI score (r = .29, P < 0.01). In active LN, MASP-1/C1-INH plasma concentrations were significantly increased compared with nonactive LN (P = 0.02). No differences in MASP-1/C1-INH plasma concentrations were observed between active SLE patients and patients with low disease activity (P = 0.11), nor did we observe a significant correlation with disease activity (r = 0.12, P = 0.15). Our data suggest that the CP and the LP are activated in SLE. The CP is activated in active SLE disease, whereas activation of the LP might be more specific to lupus nephritis.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^112ezcaR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine correlations between blood levels of complement split product 3b and serum component C3 with clinically meaningful changes in disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

- **Methods**: A total of 159 consecutive patients, diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria, were enrolled in a prospective observational study called Complement Activation Signatures in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Patients with 1–7 study visits were included in this longitudinal analysis. In addition, 48 healthy volunteers were enrolled to establish a normal reference value for the ratio of blood 3b to serum C3 concentrations. Serum C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometry, and blood 3b levels were measured by a lateral flow assay. Disease activity was monitored with the Responder Index 50 instrument of the Disease Activity Index 2000.

- **Results**: Relative changes in the 3b:C3 ratio, levels of anti-double-stranded (anti-ds) antibodies, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone (> 7.5 mg/day) each independently correlated with disease activity, as determined in multilevel multiple logistic regression analyses. Only the 3b:C3 ratio was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity among patients who were receiving a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone. The 3b:C3 ratio outperformed C3 and C4 levels with regard to discriminating active from inactive states, as well as major flares from no disease activity.

### Plasma C4d levels correlate with treatment response and renal activity in proliferative lupus nephritis [^112FfJwK]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Investigation of complement factors in lupus nephritis (LN) was conducted in relation to treatment response and the impact of underlying genetics of C4.

Seventy-seven patients with active LN, confirmed by a kidney biopsy and who underwent second biopsies after immunosuppressive treatment, were included in the study. Complement factors C3, C4, C4d, and the C4d/C4 ratio were evaluated at biopsy time points. The gene copy number variations of C4 (C4A and C4B) were also investigated.

At baseline, 60 patients had class III/IV ± V proliferative LN (PLN), and 17 had class V membranous LN (MLN). After treatment, levels of C3 and C4 increased, while C4d and the C4d/C4 ratio decreased (p < 0.0001). These changes were observed in treatment-responding PLN patients but not in MLN. C4d, C4, and C4d/C4 at second biopsies were associated with clinical response in PLN. Low C4d levels were found in PLN with histopathological response (p = 0.008). The renal activity index at second biopsies correlated with C4d and C4d/C4, but not with C3 or C4. C4 gene copy number variations were not associated with clinical or histopathological response.

All complement markers were affected by immunosuppressive therapy and associated with response to therapy. Levels of C4d and C4d/C4 at follow-up biopsies showed a strong association with both clinical and histopathological response in PLN. The correlation with elevated C4d and C4d/C4 and persisting high activity index on repeated biopsies strengthens the findings on C4d as a promising biomarker for treatment response in PLN. The C4 genetic variations did not influence C4 levels.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^116CKQR1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

We also studied patients with SS, since they can exhibit numerous autoantibodies and low serum complement levels. We observed an increased frequency of positive CB‐CAPs compared to low serum complement levels (10% versus 2%) in SS patients, but these were not significantly different from frequencies in the control group with other rheumatic diseases. However, the MAP did show a higher positivity rate than in the control group (27% versus 4%), possibly because of the high titers of ANA found in our SS cohort (data not shown), which can influence the results of the algorithm. Since only 2% of the SS patients exhibited low serum C3 or C4 levels, it is possible that our group of 50 patients is not representative of the large cohorts that have been studied in the past.

A limitation of this study is the small cohort size of patients with probable SLE for whom we have follow‐up data, as well as the relatively short follow‐up period. However, 20 of the 69 patients (29%) who had a follow‐up visit within 18 months fulfilled a fourth ACR criterion in this time frame, confirming our expectation that this cohort from academic lupus centers might be more likely to progress to classifiable SLE than prior studies have suggested. Another limitation is that retrospective determination of whether patients fulfill classification criteria is dependent on a comprehensive review of prior medical records and laboratory test results (including the presence of leukopenia or lymphopenia), and these may not have been available for all patients at every site.

### Complement in systemic lupus erythematosus across time and space: From tolerance to tissue injury and from extracellular to intracellular functions [^116YMDg3]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). High credibility.

The complement system plays a paradoxical role in systemic lupus erythematosus physiopathology, acting both as a protective mechanism and as a driver of tissue injury, depending on the disease stage. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) further exacerbate disease activity by promoting complement activation and autoantigen exposure, forming an amplifying inflammatory loop. Lupus nephritis remains challenging to monitor using conventional complement biomarkers such as CH50, C3, and C4. The utility of anti-C1q, anti-ficolin, and anti-C1s antibodies, along with tissue-based markers such as renal C4d and C5b-9 deposits, as markers of disease activity and prognosis, is discussed.

Interestingly, noncanonical functions of complement, including intracellular roles in immune cell metabolism regulation, have been recently described. Understanding the crosstalk between complement, NETs, and immune metabolism may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^111T4ktf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The study illustrates better discrimination of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity using the iC3b:C3 ratios compared to low C3 or low C4 levels. We evaluated the ability of the iC3b:C3 ratio to differentiate between active and inactive SLE. This was assessed in comparison to the discriminative abilities of iC3b, C3, and C4 levels by performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.

The iC3b:C3 ratio was the most effective in discriminating active disease with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.6594 (95% CI 0.6076–0.7112), followed by anti-dsDNA antibody levels (AUC 0.6578, 95% CI 0.6066–0.7091), C3 levels (AUC 0.6444, 95% CI 0.5896–0.6993), iC3b levels (AUC 0.5909, 95% CI 0.5384–0.6435), and C4 levels (AUC 0.6177, 95% CI 0.5615–0.6738). We confirmed these findings using the serology-free SLEDAI-2K RI-50 scores to measure changes in disease activity. Again, the iC3b:C3 ratios (AUC 0.5931, 95% CI 0.5406–0.6456), anti-dsDNA antibody levels (AUC 0.5688, 95% CI 0.5178–0.6199), and C3 levels (AUC 0.5807, 95% CI 0.5275–0.6339) demonstrated statistical significance in distinguishing active disease from inactive disease, whereas iC3b levels (AUC 0.4487, 95% CI 0.3965–0.5010) and C4 levels (AUC 0.5489, 95% CI 0.4944–0.6033) did not show any significant ability to differentiate between active and inactive disease (Figure 4 B).

### Complement C4 copy number variation is linked to SSA/Ro and SSB/La autoantibodies in systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases [^114e1PAt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases are a group characterized by inflammation in multiple organs and the presence of antibodies targeting different ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (myositis) are all categorized as systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases. In SLE, multiple tissues and organs such as the skin, joints, cardiovascular system, and kidneys are commonly affected, whereas a more specific involvement is seen with lacrimal and salivary glands affected in primary SS, and muscle as well as connective tissues in myositis. Despite different patterns of tissue and organ involvement, the three diseases share important features, including clinical manifestations, presence of autoantibodies to nuclear antigens, and several genetic loci.

The complement system plays an important role in the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Impaired removal of cellular debris may lead to exposure of cellular self-antigens and loss of tolerance. Although mainly studied in SLE, the complement system has also been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of primary SS and myositis. Particularly relevant are the genes in the early classical complement pathway, for which a deficiency in any of the genes C1Q, C1R, C1S, C2, or C4 may lead to SLE or lupus-like disease. Furthermore, low plasma levels of C3 and C4 are routinely used in the clinical setting as biomarkers for complement activation associated with disease activity and flare.

### Complement and its breakdown products in SLE [^1173HvmK]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The complement system plays a crucial role in providing protective functions in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, when inappropriately activated, it can cause tissue damage. Complement deficiency predisposes individuals to infections and the development of autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). At the same time, complement is involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. This review discusses various aspects of this dual role. It provides an overview of the activation pathways and products, along with a description of autoimmunity against complement and the potential of complement regulation in future therapeutics.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^116iGKUQ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

To examine correlations between blood levels of complement split product iC3b and serum component C3 with clinically meaningful changes in disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a total of 159 consecutive patients with SLE, diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria, were enrolled in CASTLE (Complement Activation Signatures in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), a prospective observational study.

Patients with 1–7 study visits were included in this longitudinal analysis. In addition, 48 healthy volunteers were enrolled to establish a normal reference value for the ratio of blood iC3b to serum C3 concentrations. Serum C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometry, and blood iC3b levels were measured by a lateral flow assay. SLE disease activity was monitored with the Responder Index 50 instrument of the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000.

- **Results**: Relative changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio, levels of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone (> 7.5 mg/day) each independently correlated with SLE disease activity, as determined in multilevel multiple logistic regression analyses. Only the iC3b:C3 ratio was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity among patients with SLE who were receiving a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone. The iC3b:C3 ratio outperformed C3 and C4 levels with regard to discriminating active SLE from inactive SLE.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^117AFf3k]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of diverse autoantibodies and activation of the complement system. The classification criteria for SLE by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and more recently by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) — both developed for research purposes — recognize this clinical and laboratory heterogeneity. Low levels of serum complement protein (C3 and C4) are included in the SLICC criteria as well as the classification criteria newly developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the ACR, due to the relatively high specificity of complement activation leading to low serum complement in SLE.

Despite the specificity of hypocomplementemia, its frequency in SLE is low. We have previously shown that complement activation, measured reliably by assessing cell‐bound complement activation products (CB‐CAPs), especially C4d bound to erythrocytes (EC4d) and to B lymphocytes (BC4d), can be detected in SLE with greater frequency than by assessing high anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) and low serum complement proteins.

Many patients with suspected SLE who do not fulfill ACR criteria have been designated as having "probable, possible, latent, or incomplete" SLE. There is no consensus definition or nomenclature for these patients. However, some patients develop classifiable SLE over time. Currently, there are no biomarkers to reliably distinguish who, among patients with probable or latent SLE, will progress to a classifiable form of SLE.

### Variations of C3 and C4 before and during pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus: Association with disease flares and obstetric outcomes [^113TtQAj]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The objective was to analyze complement level variations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pregnancies, focusing on disease flares and obstetric complications.

- **Methods**: SLE pregnancies were prospectively followed by multidisciplinary teams from 1987 to 2018 in two Italian rheumatology centers and were retrospectively analyzed. As a reference, pregnancy-modified ranges of normal levels of C3 and C4 were derived from 175 pregnancies in the general obstetric population (GOP), as previously described by the group.

- **Results**: Two hundred forty-six pregnancies in 172 patients with SLE were analyzed. Eighty-nine percent were live births. Thirty-five flares occurred in 30 pregnancies (12.2%), and obstetric complications were present in 47 pregnancies (19.1%), including 27 pregnancy losses, 11 severely preterm births (2 resulting in perinatal death), and 15 hypertensive disorders. C3 and C4 levels were higher in the GOP than in patients with SLE at any time point. C3 and C4 levels progressively increased during pregnancy in both GOP and SLE pregnancies without flare and obstetric complications; however, this physiological increase was not observed in pregnancies with flares or obstetric complications. A significantly higher frequency of low C4 was found in pregnancies with flares (at preconception and in each trimester) and preterm births (at preconception). In multivariate analysis, low C4 at preconception was associated with flares (odds ratio 13.81, 95% CI 3.10–61.43, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Low C4 at preconception was found to be an independent risk factor for SLE flare during pregnancy.

Adult patients were enrolled in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration from 2015 to 2017. Central or internal review boards at seven academic institutions approved the study, and all subjects provided informed consent. Patients were recruited from lupus cohorts and faculty practices overseen by an experienced SLE investigator.

Patients with SLE fulfilled both the ACR classification criteria and the SLICC classification criteria for SLE at enrollment. Patients with probable SLE were enrolled if they fulfilled three ACR criteria, irrespective of whether they fulfilled the SLICC criteria, and if the investigator had a high suspicion of the diagnosis of lupus. Patients with probable SLE could not be enrolled if they had proteinuria of > 200 mg or biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. Investigators were asked to examine the historical electronic records for clinical, hematologic, and immunologic features. The date of diagnosis for probable SLE was the date on which the third ACR criterion was confirmed.

### All things complement [^111QxZKh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The complement (C) cascade is an ancient system of proteins whose primary role is to initiate and modulate immune responses. During C activation, circulating proteins are cleaved, and nascent cleavage fragments participate in a broad range of downstream innate and adaptive immune functions. Although the majority of these functions are either homeostatic or protective, a large body of experimental and clinical evidence also highlights a central role for the C system in the pathogenesis of many types of glomerular disease.

From classic pathway activation in lupus nephritis to alternative pathway dysregulation in C3 glomerulopathy, our understanding of the spectrum of C involvement in kidney disease has expanded greatly in recent years. However, the characteristics that make the glomerulus so uniquely susceptible to C-mediated injury are not fully understood, and this remains an area of ongoing investigation.

Several C inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, and additional C inhibitory drugs are in development. The use of these drugs in patients with kidney disease will expand our understanding of the benefits and limitations of C inhibition.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^114Quq4o]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

When we examined the strength of the association of iC3b:C3 ratios with the presence of lupus rash only, in comparison to that in patients with no active disease, no correlation was observed [Figure 5 D]. Moreover, none of the other biochemical measures (anti-dsDNA antibody levels, C3 levels, C4 levels, ESR, or iC3b levels) correlated with the presence of lupus rash. This establishes that the iC3b:C3 ratio may not correlate with all disease manifestations in SLE.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^114oizgG]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Recently, serum and plasma levels of C3dg and plasma levels of C4d have been shown to be useful in distinguishing between subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and healthy controls. Additionally, plasma C4d levels correlate with disease activity in patients with SLE and are predictive of the future recurrence of nephritis. In summary, complement split products appear to offer promise as biomarkers of SLE disease activity.

Compared to CB-CAPs, soluble complement split products confer the advantage of shorter half-lives and more rapid turnaround of results. One such split product, iC3b, is the breakdown product of C3b, with a half-life of approximately 90 minutes, compared to 2 minutes for C3a and C3b, and 50 hours for C3d. These properties suggest the potential for employing iC3b to measure complement activation at the time of sampling. The extremely short half-lives of C3a and C3b may prevent their detection, as the sample processing time may be longer, while the longer half-life of C3d may not accurately reflect complement activation.

Two prior studies utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine iC3b levels in SLE patients found that plasma and serum iC3b levels were increased in patients with active SLE compared to healthy controls. However, these data may have been confounded by in vitro activation of C3, which may lead to artifactually elevated iC3b levels, thereby limiting past determinations of iC3b to serve as a useful biomarker of complement activation.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^1125qLvc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

The association of the iC3b:C3 ratio with the presence of lupus nephritis but not rash was noted. We observed that 16.5% of patients with active SLE had normal iC3b:C3 ratios (Figure 1 A). We hypothesized that certain disease manifestations may not drive sufficient systemic complement activation for detection of abnormalities in the blood. Therefore, we evaluated two common manifestations of SLE that we speculated would drive different levels of complement activation, namely rash and lupus nephritis (defined as having any non-zero score in the urinary cast, hematuria, proteinuria, or pyuria domains of the SLEDAI-2K RI-50 score).

We first compared the presence of lupus nephritis in SLE patients to a status of no disease activity (patients with a SLEDAI-2K RI-50 score of 0). In the univariate regression analyses, relative changes in iC3b levels, the iC3b:C3 ratio, C3 levels, ESR, and anti-dsDNA antibody levels, as well as race and number of visits, each correlated with the presence of lupus nephritis (Figure 5 A). In the multivariate regression analyses, only changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio, anti-dsDNA antibody levels, and ESR, along with the use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone, independently correlated with the presence of lupus nephritis (Figure 5 B). A 1-unit increase in the iC3b:C3 ratio increased the odds of lupus nephritis by 45%.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^112EJLP6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Since we recruited patients from academic sites where large lupus cohorts were being followed up, the likelihood of an SLE diagnosis was based on expert opinion. We surmised that a higher percentage of these selected patients with probable SLE would be more likely to develop a fourth ACR criterion over 2–3 years than those in a more loosely defined probable SLE group. This is supported by the observation that 35 of 92 patients with probable SLE (38%) who did not meet the ACR classification for SLE did meet the SLICC classification criteria at enrollment. This suggests that the investigators considered ≥ 1 SLICC feature in their evaluations to not be definitely related to SLE, since those patients could have been included in the SLE group instead of the probable SLE group. This also highlights an important difference between classification criteria and diagnosis. A similar percentage of SLICC criteria fulfillment was found in a recently described cohort of patients who fulfilled 3 ACR criteria. Furthermore, in the present study, 29% of the 69 patients with a follow-up visit within 18 months acquired a fourth ACR criterion. This represents a much higher rate in a shorter period of time than shown in prior studies.

### The evolving landscape for complement therapeutics in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases [^1111cqeR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The complement system is increasingly understood to play a major role in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Because of this situation, there are rapidly expanding commercial efforts to develop novel complement inhibitors and effector pathway-modulating drugs. This review provides insights into the evolving understanding of the complement system components, mechanisms of activation within and across the three pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin), how the pathways are normally controlled and then dysregulated in target tissues, and what diseases are known to be, in large part, complement-dependent through the successful development and approval of complement therapeutics in patients.

Mechanisms of complement activation in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and thrombotic microangiopathies are also illustrated. In addition, the specific therapeutic drugs that are both approved and under development are discussed in the context of both nonrheumatic and rheumatic diseases. Finally, the methods by which the complement system can be assessed in humans through biomarker studies are outlined, with the goal of understanding, in specific patients, how the system is functioning.

### Rheumatic syndromes associated with complement deficiency [^114gHhVg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Deficiency of an early component of the classical complement pathway, such as C1q, C1r/C1s, C4, or C2, regularly produces autoimmunity in humans, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus. It has long been suggested that disruption of this pathway would lead to inappropriate handling of immune complexes. An intriguing hypothesis, building on this idea, relates to a defect in the clearance of one's cellular debris, namely apoptotic cells. An attractive aspect of this emerging concept is that blebs on apoptotic cells are decorated with antigens to which much of the autoantibody specificity is directed in systemic lupus erythematosus.

A second hypothesis, primarily derived from complement deficiencies, relates to impairment in the humoral immune response or regulation of autoreactive B cells. This review begins by summarizing the recognized autoimmune manifestations of complement deficiency and then describes new data derived from targeted gene deletions of complement proteins.

### Complement and systemic lupus erythematosus [^1131mXeg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that the complement system plays multiple roles in systemic lupus erythematosus. Activation of the classical pathway by immune complexes leads to the generation of inflammatory mediators, thus promoting tissue injury. Complement activation also plays an important role in the maintenance of tolerance to self-antigens. This review discusses recent insights into the role of complement in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.

- **Recent findings**: The antiphospholipid syndrome is a major feature of systemic lupus erythematosus. New findings have clearly demonstrated that the prothrombotic effects seen in a mouse model of this syndrome depend on complement activation, whereas the protective effects of heparin are due to its anticomplementary effects rather than its anticoagulant action. Secondly, a potential mechanism explaining the association of anti-C1q autoantibodies with lupus glomerulonephritis has been elucidated in a mouse model system.

- **Summary**: New findings have helped to reinforce the role of complement in the etiology and tissue damage of systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings point to more precise, mechanism-based therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory disease.

### Treat-to-target in systemic lupus erythematosus: Recommendations from an international task force [^116LmdJU]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in relation to the goals of treatment, T2T 2014 guidelines recommend setting the following treatment targets:

- **Remission of symptoms and organ manifestations**: Strive to reach complete remission of systemic symptoms and organ-specific manifestations.

- **Lowest possible disease activity**: If remission cannot be achieved, maintain the lowest possible disease activity. This should be measured by a validated lupus activity index and/or by organ-specific markers.

- **Prevention of flares**: Focus on preventing flares, with particular attention to severe flares.

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome management**: Prevent and manage morbidity related to antiphospholipid syndrome.

- **Prevention of damage accrual**: Aim to prevent the accumulation of damage over time.

### Case report: Lupus nephritis with autoantibodies to complement alternative pathway proteins and C3 gene mutation [^113fg1Bb]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Lupus patients usually have low C3 and C4 levels during disease flares due to the activation of the complement system by immune complexes (ICs). However, during remission periods, complement levels return to normal values. Activation of the complement system by deposited ICs causes tissue damage. On the other hand, components of the classical pathway (CP) play a protective role by facilitating the clearance of ICs and apoptotic bodies. Their deficiency increases the risk of SLE. This association is explained not only by the removal of ICs from circulation, but also by other mechanisms, including the reduction of activation thresholds of lymphocytes and loss of self-tolerance.

### Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are deficient in complement-dependent prevention of immune precipitation [^116aUpmc]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

A functional deficiency of complement has been implicated but not conclusively demonstrated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To test this, we studied several aspects of complement in 44 patients with SLE, 46 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 102 blood donors.

- **Methods**: Prevention of immune precipitation (PIP) was measured by an enzyme immunoassay; levels of C1q, C4, and C3 by rocket immunoelectrophoresis; C4A, C4B, and C3d by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); complement haemolysis (CH50) by standard methods; and C4 allotypes by high-voltage agarose electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

- **Results**: PIP was significantly reduced in SLE (P < 0.001); the defect was revealed by a sensitive assay measuring this function of complement but not by the other tests employed. The patients were clinically well at the time of the study, and levels of C3d, which have been shown to correlate with disease activity, were normal. The defect was more common in patients with early disease (P = 0.009), supporting a role in aetiology or early pathophysiology. PIP was positively correlated with levels of C4 (P = 3 x 10(-5)) and in particular the C4A isotype (P = 9 x 10(-10)), whereas C4B was redundant.

Our results reveal a defect in the prevention of immune precipitation in SLE that is apparent at an early stage in the disease and correlates with low levels of C4A. These results indicate that subtle deficiencies of complement may predispose individuals to SLE.

### Complement classical pathway components are all important in clearance of apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells [^116kkFCK]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Inherited deficiencies in components of the classical complement pathway are strong disease susceptibility factors for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with a hierarchy among deficiency states. The strongest association is with C1q deficiency. We investigated the relative importance of different complement pathways regarding the clearance of apoptotic cells.

Phagocytosis of labeled apoptotic Jurkat cells by monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of sera from individuals with complement deficiencies was studied, as well as C3 deposition on apoptotic cells using flow cytometry. Sera from individuals deficient in C1q, C4, C2, or C3 all showed decreased phagocytosis. Mannose binding lectin (MBL) and the alternative pathway did not influence phagocytosis. Notably, the components of the complement classical pathway, including C1q, were equally important in the clearance of apoptotic cells. This indicates that deposition of C3 fragments is of major significance; we therefore studied C3 deposition on apoptotic cells.

Experiments with MBL-deficient serum depleted of C1q or factor D confirmed the predominance of the classical pathway. At low dilution, sera deficient in C1q, C4, or C2 supported C3 fragment deposition, demonstrating alternative pathway activation. In conclusion, we have found that complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, particularly those undergoing secondary necrosis, are mainly dependent upon an intact classical pathway. The alternative pathway is less important but may play a role in some conditions.

This table highlights the hazard ratios (HRs) of biomarkers in predicting the fulfillment of ACR classification criteria within 18 months in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

### Renal deposits of complement factors as predictors of end-stage renal disease and death in patients with lupus nephritis [^111BjfHk]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) occurs in up to two-thirds of patients with SLE and causes increased risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death. These risks can be estimated based on clinical and pathological factors, including race/ethnicity, hypertension, proteinuria, anemia, serum levels of creatinine, complement factors, anti-dsDNA antibodies, the pattern of glomerular damage, the extent of tubulointerstitial inflammation, and the extent of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, but with variable certainty. The effect of treatment to reduce these risks, which often remains disappointing, is also poorly estimated with these factors; thus, a prognosis is difficult to establish.

The complement system plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of LN. Immune complexes are deposited or formed in the kidneys and bind complement factor C1q. Due to activation by C1q and other unknown mechanisms, complement factor C3 is deposited as well. The co-deposition of Igs, C1q, and C3 is characteristic of LN. Circulating C3 and C4 are often depressed due to their consumption and associated with disease activity. Complement activation is also associated with subclinical and flaring disease. Some cases have been successfully treated with the complement inhibitor eculizumab; other complement inhibitors are currently being developed for treatment.

The relevance of renal deposition of complement factors for the prognosis and treatment of LN has, nonetheless, been little studied. Such a role has been demonstrated in other renal diseases with dysregulation of the complement system.

### Complement consumption in systemic lupus erythematosus leads to decreased opsonophagocytosis [^113e8Tz9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The high prevalence of infections in SLE is attributed to both the disease and its treatments. The complement system plays an important role in host immune responses against invading microorganisms. We sought to provide the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the hypothesis that low levels of complement factors cause defective complement-mediated opsonization in patients with SLE.

- **Methods**: Staphylococcus aureus was opsonized with sera from healthy individuals (n = 16), SLE patients with normal (n = 5) or low complement (n = 8) levels. Phagocytosis of S. aureus by healthy human neutrophils was analyzed by an imaging flow cytometry-based method. We retrospectively examined the infection incidence in relation to complement levels in a cohort of 165 patients with SLE during a 1.5-year period. The association was analyzed for infection incidence and disease-related variables.

- **Results**: Uptake of S. aureus by neutrophils was decreased when S. aureus was opsonized with sera from SLE patients with low complement levels compared to sera from healthy individuals and SLE patients with normal complement. In our SLE cohort, 44% of patients had at least 1 infection during the 1.5 years. No significant association was observed between complement levels and infection risk. Importantly, high-dose glucocorticoids (GC; prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day) were the most important predictive factor for infections in patients with SLE.

- **Conclusion**: Low complement levels affect opsonophagocytosis in SLE patients.

### Low complement levels in paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus and the risk of bacteraemia [^114F8Yj1]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This report describes an 11-year-old girl with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who has long-standing low levels of complement proteins. A disease period with lupus nephritis (class IIIa) was complicated by *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteraemia and osteomyelitis. She was treated with high-dose immunosuppressants and six weeks of high-dose intravenous antibiotics. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of bacteraemia in patients with SLE who have secondary complement deficiency.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^112UzgKP]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the frequency of cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs) as a marker of complement activation in patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the usefulness of this biomarker as a predictor of the evolution of probable SLE into the classified form by the American College of Rheumatology criteria.

- **Methods**: Patients in whom SLE was suspected by lupus experts and who fulfilled three classification criteria for probable SLE were enrolled, along with patients with established SLE as classified by both the American College of Rheumatology and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria, patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome, and patients with other rheumatic diseases. Individual CB-CAPs were measured by flow cytometry, and positivity rates were compared to those of commonly assessed biomarkers, including serum complement proteins (C3 and C4) and autoantibodies. The frequency of a positive multianalyte assay panel, which includes CB-CAPs, was also evaluated. Probable SLE cases were followed up prospectively.

- **Results**: The 92 patients with probable SLE were diagnosed more recently than the 53 patients with established SLE, and their use of antirheumatic medications was lower. At the enrollment visit, more patients with probable SLE were positive for CB-CAPs (28%) or autoantibodies (40%) than had low complement levels (9%) (P = 0.0001 for each). In probable SLE, CB-CAP scores of > 0.8 at enrollment predicted fulfillment of a fourth classification criterion within 18 months (hazard ratio 3.11, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Complement activation occurs in some patients with probable SLE and can be detected with higher frequency by evaluating CB-CAPs and autoantibodies than by assessing traditional biomarkers.

### Renal deposits of complement factors as predictors of end-stage renal disease and death in patients with lupus nephritis [^1111G4Gn]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) increases the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death, but these risks are difficult to estimate. Since complement factors play an essential role in the pathogenesis and are deposited in the kidneys as C1q and C3, we studied whether these deposits predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

- **Methods**: We collected demographic, clinical, and pathological data from 183 adult patients with LN classes II-V, diagnosed with a first native kidney biopsy. Pathological data included the localization and intensity of immunofluorescence staining of C1q and C3. We obtained dates of incident ESRD and death from the United States Renal Data System and National Death Index, respectively, and evaluated survival curves and hazard ratios for ESRD and death as a composite outcome and as separate outcomes.

- **Results**: The presence and intensity of deposits of C1q and C3 in glomeruli, tubular walls, and vascular walls differed between classes and were associated with known unfavorable prognostic factors such as hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocomplementemia. However, over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, their presence and intensity were associated with neither survival free of ESRD and death nor hazard ratios for ESRD and death.

- **Conclusion**: Renal deposits of complement factors did not predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus multiorgan flare with quiescent serologic markers [^113zuQzf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can affect almost every organ with differing degrees of severity. Typically, SLE activity is associated with hypocomplementaemia and elevated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) levels. In this case, we describe a severe multiorgan lupus flare, including lupus cerebritis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, lupus nephritis, and lupus myopericarditis, with normal complement and dsDNA levels. This case highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneous nature of SLE flares.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^116XCZiq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, our data show that positive CB‐CAPs alone or in the MAP algorithm are present in a higher percentage of patients with SLE and patients with probable SLE compared to antibodies to dsDNA or low serum complement levels. The relatively high positivity rate of CB‐CAPs and the MAP in the probable SLE group suggests that complement activation might occur early in the evolution of SLE and may be a feature in patients with suspected lupus. In addition, patients with probable SLE who had a MAP score of > 0.8 or an EC4d MFI of > 20 at enrollment were more likely to fulfill a fourth ACR criterion during a relatively brief follow‐up; these biomarkers predicted the transition to SLE better than other clinical and laboratory parameters. The detection of complement activation in patients with probable lupus who do not fulfill ACR criteria or even SLICC criteria could have implications with regard to treatment, as early appropriate therapy in these patients may potentially slow the rate of disease progression.

### Predictors of renal flares in systemic lupus erythematosus: A post-hoc analysis of four phase III clinical trials of belimumab [^1153uydx]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

High baseline proteinuria levels, hypoalbuminaemia, and C3 consumption were associated with renal flare development in this clinical trial setting comprising patients with active SLE yet no severe ongoing renal disease.

In addition to anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P protein antibody positivity may prove a valuable early signal of impending renal flares in belimumab-treated patients, whereas anti-Sm antibody positivity may predict renal flares in patients treated with non-biologic standard therapy. While low C3 and positive anti-dsDNA levels constitute serological features of known importance in the surveillance of renal SLE, levels of serum albumin, anti-Sm antibodies, and anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies are less established biomarkers in SLE.

Further investigation of the predictive properties of these traditional markers as well as combined biomarker panels in SLE populations has merit.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^113hJQvS]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Figure 4 demonstrates that the iC3b:C3 ratio can effectively differentiate between active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inactive SLE, as well as distinguish major flares from no disease activity. Receiver operating characteristic curves utilizing the iC3b:C3 ratio, along with blood levels of iC3b, C3, C4, and anti–double‐stranded (anti‐dsDNA) antibodies, were employed to discriminate active from inactive SLE using the complete Disease Activity Index 2000 (2K) Responder Index 50 (RI-50) score (A), active from inactive SLE using the serology-free 2K-50 score (B), and major flare from no disease activity (C). The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values are provided.

We further explored whether the iC3b:C3 ratio could discriminate between patients presenting with a major SLE flare (according to the Fortin definition) and those with no disease activity (SLEDAI-2K RI-50 score of 0). The iC3b:C3 ratio was superior in discriminating a major disease flare (AUC 0.6611, 95% CI 0.5761–0.7461) compared to iC3b levels (AUC 0.6112, 95% CI 0.5252–0.6971), C3 levels (AUC 0.6273, 95% CI 0.5379–0.7166), and C4 levels (AUC 0.5989, 95% CI 0.5071–0.6907) (Figure 4 C), although it was inferior to the discriminative ability of anti-dsDNA antibody levels (AUC 0.7395, 95% CI 0.6662–0.8128).

### New biomarkers in SLE: From bench to bedside [^111oYnSy]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

iC3b is the breakdown product of C3b, thus reflecting complement activation via the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. Its half-life in serum (90 minutes) is long enough to allow detection but short enough to reflect ongoing complement activation. iC3b detection by lateral flow assay minimizes serum handling and in vitro activation of complement. Evaluation, expressed as the ratio of blood iC3b to serum C3 levels, has been proposed as a useful tool to analyze complement activation in sera. This ratio identifies active disease and is strongly associated with nephritis.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^115VXrfM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

We first assessed the association of iC3b:C3 ratios with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease status. The distribution of iC3b:C3 ratios was compared among patients with active disease, patients with inactive disease, and healthy controls. Patients with active SLE exhibited an elevated iC3b:C3 ratio, averaging 7.03 ± 7.84 μg/mg, compared to those with inactive SLE, who averaged 4.30 ± 2.03 μg/mg, and healthy controls, who averaged 1.69 ± 0.57 μg/mg. The Kruskal‐Wallis H statistic was 132.5 (P < 0.001).

When the iC3b:C3 ratio was employed to classify active disease, accurate classification occurred in only 50.2% of the cases. The persistence of elevated iC3b:C3 ratios during periods of disease inactivity corroborates prior findings concerning C3 hypercatabolism in the majority of patients with SLE.

### Complement factor H deficiency accelerates development of lupus nephritis [^114Sp5qf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Complement factor H (CfH) is a key regulator of the alternative pathway, and its presence on mouse platelets and podocytes allows the processing of immune complexes. Because of the role of immune complexes in the pathophysiology of lupus nephritis, we studied the role of CfH in the development of nephritis in MRL-lpr mice, an animal model of lupus. At 12 weeks, CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice had significantly more albuminuria and higher BUN levels than MRL-lpr controls. CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice also experienced earlier mortality: at 14 weeks, 6 of 9 CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice had died of renal failure, whereas all 11 littermate CfH-sufficient MRL-lpr mice were alive (P ≤ 0.001). Histologically, CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice developed severe diffuse lupus nephritis by 12 weeks (glomerulonephritis scores of 2.6 ± 0.4 versus 0.4 ± 0.2 in littermate controls, P = 0.001).

Immunofluorescence staining showed extensive linear C3 staining along glomerular capillary walls, similar to other CfH-deficient mouse models on nonautoimmune backgrounds. IgG was present in the mesangium and peripheral capillary walls, along with excessive infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Ultrastructurally, there were subendothelial and subepithelial immune deposits and extensive podocyte foot process effacement. In summary, the loss of CfH accelerates the development of lupus nephritis and recapitulates the functional and structural features of the human disease. This illustrates the critical role of complement regulation and metabolism of immune complexes in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^111uuetg]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

A possible limitation to the use of complement split products for the evaluation of SLE disease activity is that not all manifestations may be related to detectable systemic activation of complement. Dermoepidermal junction deposition of C3d and C4d are observed in the skin of patients with active SLE rash, suggesting that complement split products are generated. Nevertheless, we found that lupus rash alone did not correlate with changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio. This suggests that a certain threshold of complement activation, perhaps combined with the perfusion characteristics of the inflamed organ, is required.

We observed that CRP levels were independently associated with active disease based on the serology-free SLEDAI-2K RI-50 scores. CRP levels were found to poorly correlate with anti-dsDNA antibody levels and low complement levels, and thus this measure is thought to be poorly associated with disease activity in SLE. Nevertheless, increases in the CRP level of approximately 15 mg/liter have been observed during flares, particularly in patients with serositis. We agree with the findings of others that increases in the CRP level during active disease are attenuated as compared to what might be anticipated; this could explain why a signal was observed only when anti-dsDNA antibody levels and hypocomplementemia were removed from the analysis.

We acknowledge that there may be variability in how iC3b:C3 ratios behave depending on as-yet undiscovered patient disease characteristics. However, our data demonstrate that the measurement of iC3b:C3 ratios is more informative than traditional methods.

### Immunodeficiency: Complement disorders [^112ZkVD8]. Allergy and Asthma Proceedings (2024). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased serum total complement can be caused by angioedema, malaria infection, bacteremia, glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, partial lipodystrophy, prolidase deficiency, hereditary C3b inhibitor deficiency, C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, hereditary C3 deficiency, and hereditary C2 deficiency.
