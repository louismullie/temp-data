## Question

Treatment of hyper triglycerides

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify hypertriglyceridemia by severity and define treatment goals. Then, I should verify the universal first-line role of lifestyle therapy and secondary cause evaluation. Next, I will examine pharmacologic choices for moderate elevations where ASCVD risk reduction is the priority, followed by severe elevations where pancreatitis prevention is paramount. After that, I need to check special populations and acute pancreatitis management. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, targets, and a practical algorithm, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the classification and goals, because everything downstream depends on this. Moderate hypertriglyceridemia is typically 150–499 mg/dL, where the clinical priority is ASCVD risk reduction, whereas severe hypertriglyceridemia is ≥ 500 mg/dL, where the priority is pancreatitis prevention, with particular urgency at ≥ 1000 mg/dL. I should double-check that these thresholds align with major guidelines, and yes, AHA/ACC and Endocrine Society both use ≥ 500 mg/dL as the key inflection point, and ≥ 1000 mg/dL as very high risk for pancreatitis [^01d72f97] [^804c54c9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications before addressing fundamentals. Universal first-line therapy for all severities is lifestyle modification and identification of secondary causes, including diet, weight, alcohol, physical inactivity, and medications that raise triglycerides, plus evaluation for diabetes, hypothyroidism, liver or kidney disease, and genetic disorders. I need to ensure I emphasize that this step precedes pharmacotherapy, and guidelines consistently place lifestyle and secondary cause management first [^d0091dde] [^5761bf97] [^c2631c92].

> For moderate hypertriglyceridemia, I should confirm the pharmacologic hierarchy. Statins are first-line when ASCVD risk is elevated because they reduce cardiovascular events and lower triglycerides by about 10–30% depending on dose and baseline TG, with high-intensity regimens achieving larger reductions. I initially thought statins lower TG by 7–18% on average, but wait, let me verify the upper bound; yes, high-dose atorvastatin or rosuvastatin can lower TG by 25–30% in some patients, so I should correct that range to 7–30% depending on regimen and baseline TG [^b123e085] [^08982cda].

> Next, I should review when to add triglyceride-specific therapy in moderate HTG. After statin optimization and lifestyle measures, if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL in high-risk patients, adding icosapent ethyl (EPA-only) 4 g/day reduces major adverse cardiovascular events by about 25% in REDUCE-IT, whereas EPA+DHA combinations have not shown consistent cardiovascular benefit and may increase bleeding or atrial fibrillation risk. I need to ensure I distinguish EPA from EPA+DHA and anchor the dose at 4 g/day, which is supported by AHA science advisory and contemporary guidelines [^5c8cc94c] [^037ba022] [^200dbc88].

> But wait, what if the patient has severe hypertriglyceridemia? I should confirm that the goal shifts to pancreatitis prevention. For TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, and especially ≥ 1000 mg/dL, fibrates are first-line to rapidly lower TG by 30–50%, and a very low-fat diet with avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol is essential. Statins are not appropriate monotherapy here, though they may be layered later for ASCVD risk once TG is safer. I should double-check that this is consistent across guidelines, and yes, Endocrine Society and AHA/ACC align on fibrates first-line for severe HTG and on very low-fat dietary measures [^61abcbab] [^87b1e1f6] [^ee119c0b].

> I will now examine omega-3s in severe HTG. Prescription omega-3s at 4 g/day lower TG by about 30% and are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts to fibrates, with EPA-only avoiding the LDL-C rise sometimes seen with EPA+DHA. I should confirm that outcome data for pancreatitis prevention are limited, so shared decision-making is key, and indeed, evidence is stronger for TG lowering than for hard pancreatitis endpoints, which remain indirect [^5c8cc94c] [^200dbc88].

> Let me consider special populations and acute management, because I need to ensure safety nets are in place. In acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis can be considered if TG remain ≥ 1000 mg/dL despite conservative care, but I should verify that plasmapheresis is not first-line; Endocrine Society advises against routine plasmapheresis as initial therapy, reserving it for refractory cases with expert input. For familial chylomicronemia syndrome, a very low-fat diet is mandatory and genetic testing is appropriate when TG are severely elevated without clear secondary causes [^5177134a] [^2feb04f6] [^ea60c11e].

> Next, I should review monitoring and targets to keep this clinically actionable. Reassess fasting lipids 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, target non-HDL cholesterol as a secondary goal in moderate HTG when appropriate, and in severe HTG prioritize getting TG below 500 mg/dL urgently and ideally below 200 mg/dL for long-term pancreatitis risk reduction. I need to ensure I note that non-HDL-C or apoB can be more informative than calculated LDL-C in hypertriglyceridemia, which is why guidelines emphasize these markers in this setting [^ace50d19] [^2feb04f6] [^52e1f70b].

> Hold on, I should verify how to integrate conflicting guidance on omega-3s. AACE 2025 suggests EPA-only for moderate HTG in high-risk patients on statins but issues a conditional recommendation against EPA+DHA due to lack of benefit and potential harms, whereas ESC/EAS suggests considering EPA in high- or very high-risk patients with TG 135–499 mg/dL despite statins. I should reconcile this by emphasizing EPA-only at 4 g/day for those with ASCVD or diabetes plus additional risk factors, and avoid EPA+DHA for ASCVD risk reduction pending stronger evidence [^200dbc88] [^037ba022] [^9ef54c15].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First, classify severity and confirm with fasting lipids if nonfasting TG are ≥ 400 mg/dL. Second, implement lifestyle and correct secondary causes universally. Third, for moderate HTG with elevated ASCVD risk, optimize statins and consider adding EPA 4 g/day if TG persist ≥ 150 mg/dL. Fourth, for severe HTG, initiate fibrates and very low-fat diet, consider prescription omega-3s, and avoid statin monotherapy initially. Fifth, reassess in 4–12 weeks and escalate or add therapies as needed, including combination approaches once TG are safer. This stepwise approach mirrors contemporary ACC/AHA, Endocrine Society, and AACE guidance and balances pancreatitis prevention with ASCVD risk reduction [^01d72f97] [^1bcbd2ef] [^ec92db30].

---

Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia centers on **lifestyle first** [^c2631c92] and **risk-based pharmacotherapy**. For TG 150–499 mg/dL, prioritize weight loss, exercise, alcohol restriction, and a low-carb, high-fiber diet [^a302b9c0]; add statins if ASCVD risk is elevated [^ef771320], and consider icosapent ethyl 4 g/day [^5c8cc94c] if TG persist ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins to reduce events [^037ba022]. For TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, implement a very low-fat diet [^d56ea003], eliminate alcohol, and initiate fibrates or high-dose omega-3s [^5c8cc94c] to prevent pancreatitis; add statins if ASCVD risk is high [^33d893f9]. Address secondary causes (diabetes, hypothyroidism, medications) [^d0091dde] and monitor fasting lipids every 3–6 months [^01d72f97]; escalate therapy or combine agents if targets are not met [^5119330d].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line for all severities** [^c2631c92] and can lower TG by 20–50% [^notfound].

- **Diet**: Reduce saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars; increase omega-3 intake; limit alcohol [^a302b9c0] [^d56ea003].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction in overweight/obese patients [^5761bf97].
- **Exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [^notfound].
- **Alcohol**: Eliminate or strictly limit intake, especially in severe HTG [^d56ea003].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacotherapy is added when lifestyle measures are insufficient or risk is high, with **agents chosen by TG level and ASCVD risk** [^5119330d].

| **Triglyceride level** | **First-line pharmacotherapy** | **Second-line/add-on therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| 150–499 mg/dL | Statins if ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% [^33d893f9] | - Icosapent ethyl 4 g/day if TG persist ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins [^5c8cc94c] [^037ba022] <br/> - Consider fibrates or omega-3s if TG remain elevated [^2f3cd834] |
| ≥ 500 mg/dL | - Fibrates (fenofibrate preferred) [^060a826d] <br/> - Or high-dose omega-3s (EPA 4 g/day) [^5c8cc94c] | - Add statin if ASCVD risk is high [^33d893f9] <br/> - Combine fibrates and omega-3s if needed [^notfound] |

---

## Management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL)

Severe HTG requires **aggressive therapy to prevent pancreatitis** [^c2631c92]:

- **Very low-fat diet**: ≤ 10–15% of calories from fat [^060a826d].
- **Alcohol elimination**: Strict abstinence [^d56ea003].
- **Fibrates or omega-3s**: Initiate promptly; consider combination if TG remain ≥ 500 mg/dL [^060a826d].
- **Statins**: Add if ASCVD risk is elevated [^33d893f9].
- **Acute pancreatitis**: Use insulin infusion and consider plasmapheresis if TG > 1,000 mg/dL [^0662ce56].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring ensures **adequate response and adherence**. Check fasting lipids every 3–6 months initially, then every 6–12 months once stable. Assess adherence and secondary causes at each visit, and adjust therapy based on response and tolerance [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Secondary causes**: Actively treat diabetes, hypothyroidism, and medication-induced HTG (e.g. corticosteroids, estrogens) [^d0091dde].
- **Genetic disorders**: Consider familial chylomicronemia syndrome if TG > 1,000 mg/dL without secondary causes; manage with very low-fat diet and specialist care [^ea60c11e].
- **Combination therapy**: Use statin plus fibrate or omega-3s when TG remain elevated despite monotherapy, with caution for interactions [^a602c445].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Lifestyle**: First-line for all; diet, weight loss, exercise, alcohol restriction [^c2631c92].
- **Moderate HTG**: Statins if ASCVD risk high; add icosapent ethyl if TG persist ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins [^037ba022].
- **Severe HTG**: Fibrates or high-dose omega-3s; add statins if ASCVD risk high [^060a826d].
- **Monitoring**: Fasting lipids every 3–6 months; address secondary causes and adherence [^notfound].

---

Effective HTG management requires **lifestyle first**, **risk-based pharmacotherapy**, and **regular monitoring** to reduce pancreatitis and cardiovascular risk [^c2631c92].

### Contemporary and novel therapeutic options for hypertriglyceridemia [^8d695875]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this review was to outline the current and emerging therapeutic options for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, with an emphasis on emerging therapies.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted with the use of PubMed and Embase for articles on hypertriglyceridemia, with a focus on therapeutics, pharmacology, and management. Abstracts from recent international meetings were also reviewed for presentations of Phase I and II data on agents with triglyceride-lowering effects. A further review of the references identified from these articles was also performed.

Findings

Consistent with the multifactorial cause of hypertriglyceridemia, the therapeutic options are broad and numerous. This review explores the current and potential therapeutic options for treating hypertriglyceridemia and outlines the potential mechanisms of action. However, the mechanism of triglyceride reduction is complex, multifactorial, or not fully elucidated for some of these agents. The magnitude of triglyceride reduction and findings of outcome studies are described.

Implications

Management of hypertriglyceridemia is about to enter an exciting phase, with multiple emerging therapies in the final stages of development. However, caution is warranted, because studies of therapeutic agents over the previous decade have often not found cardiovascular outcome benefits despite encouraging effects on triglyceride concentrations.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^7d21865f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, e-mail discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. The initial treatment should be lifestyle therapy; a combination of diet modification and drug therapy may also be considered. In patients with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, a fibrate should be used as a first-line agent.

### Pharmacologic approaches for the management of patients with moderately elevated triglycerides (150–499 mg / dL) [^61e10dba]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, now affects over one-quarter of the US adult population and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Available guidelines for managing hypertriglyceridemia vary with respect to TG thresholds and severity of disease. Lifestyle modifications and management of secondary causes (eg, diabetes) remain the first step in managing hypertriglyceridemia, with pharmacotherapy reserved to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and/or further reduce TG levels. Several classes of lipid-lowering agents are available with variable TG-lowering efficacy. Although there is no consensus regarding the choice of initial TG-lowering pharmacotherapy, there is general agreement that the decision depends on the degree of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This review will discuss available and emerging lipid-lowering therapies for the management of moderately elevated TG, defined as TG 150 to 499 mg/dL.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^c2631c92]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most common lipid abnormalities encountered in clinical practice. Many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, but in most patients triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol misuse, and various commonly used drugs. Correcting these factors and optimizing lifestyle choices, including dietary modification, is important before starting drug treatment. The goal of drug treatment is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. This review discusses the various genetic and acquired causes of hypertriglyceridemia, as well as current management strategies. Evidence supporting the different drug and non-drug approaches to treating hypertriglyceridemia is examined, and an easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy is presented.

### Treatment options for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: strategies based on the best-available evidence [^a602c445]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

A severe elevation in triglycerides (TG; ≥ 500 mg/dL) increases the risk for pancreatitis. TG levels ≥ 200 mg/dL are associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). However, no outcomes trials exist to assess the efficacy of TG lowering for preventing pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Similarly, no completed prospective outcomes trial exists to support or refute a reduction in CHD risk resulting from lipid-altering therapy in patients specifically selected for the presence of hypertriglyceridemia. This review examines the available evidence for the use of statins, omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin in the management of hypertriglyceridemic patients. Results from CHD outcomes trials support statins as the first-line lipid-altering drug therapy to reduce CHD in hypercholesterolemic patients, and subgroup analyses suggest statins are efficacious in hypertriglyceridemic patients with fasting TG levels < 500 mg/dL. Omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates are reasonable first drug options for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL and often are used to lower TG levels with the objective of reducing pancreatitis risk, although a statin or niacin may also be reasonable options. Combination lipid drug therapy may be needed to achieve both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals for CHD prevention in patients with elevated TG levels, particularly those with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL. Additional clinical outcomes data are needed to provide a more evidence-based rationale for clinical lipid management of hypertriglyceridemic patients.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1c1efe90]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society summary of recommendations — screening and diagnostic basis states that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia increase the risk for pancreatitis, whereas mild or moderate hypertriglyceridemia may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; therefore, similar to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidance, we recommend screening adults for hypertriglyceridemia as part of a lipid panel at least every 5 yr, and we recommend basing the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia on fasting triglyceride levels and not on nonfasting triglyceride levels.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^24ab6980]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or are at increased risk for ASCVD, AACE suggests for the use of EPA (IPE) in addition to statins (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of EPA (IPE) in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (no recommendation, insufficient evidence). For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have ASCVD or are at increased risk for ASCVD, AACE suggests against the use of EPA plus DHA in addition to statin therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of EPA plus DHA in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (no recommendation, insufficient evidence).

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b123e085]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### Cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl for high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment [^3fa6418d]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl from a US health care perspective for high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment?

Findings

This economic evaluation including 8179 patients found that icosapent ethyl at a cost of $4.16 to $9.28 per day had a high probability of costing less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. At the lower cost, treatment with icosapent ethyl may be a dominant strategy, offering better outcomes at lower cost.

Meaning

This study suggests that, for high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment, icosapent ethyl may be cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^f1f1d3ee]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides are a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles. A fasting triglyceride level < 150 mg/dL is accepted widely as the upper limit of normal range. Guidelines for hypertriglyceridemia are variable without a global consensus on classification and goals for triglyceride levels. A general classification of hypertriglyceridemia is mild < 200 mg/dL, moderate = 200 to 500 mg/dL, moderate to severe = 500 to 1000 mg/dL, and severe > 1000 mg/dL. Because moderate hypertriglyceridemia does increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to determine the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management. This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, based on 3 common scenarios encountered in clinical practice. Initial steps in management include evaluating for secondary contributors, especially diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions include lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption and use of statin and nonstatin therapies.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^57bcc668]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — management of hypertriglyceridemia recommends lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals as the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia; for severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis; we recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines; we recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis; we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels; and we recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, although statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ace50d19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — treatment targets in moderate hypertriglyceridemia: We recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-HDL cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines. Non-HDL cholesterol (total serum cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) reflects the amount of cholesterol in all atherogenic lipoprotein particles, and measurement of non-HDL cholesterol is recommended in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia both for risk stratification and as a secondary target for therapy. Alternatively, the blood level of atherogenic lipoprotein particles can be assessed by measuring the concentration of apoB, and because measurement of apoB is helpful in the differentiation of FCHL from FHTG, apoB levels may be measured during an initial evaluation of a hypertriglyceridemic patient; non-HDL cholesterol can then be followed as the therapeutic target.

Elevated cholesterol levels are clearly independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Another class of lipid particles, triglycerides, is also abundant in the human body and has been found in atherosclerotic plaques. Recent observational studies have demonstrated an association between elevated triglyceride levels and increased risk for future cardiovascular events. With this knowledge and the discovery of effective agents to lower triglyceride levels, the management of triglycerides is currently undergoing a renaissance. Unfortunately, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been completed to date, proving that lowering triglycerides will reduce cardiovascular events. In this review we highlight some of the evidence that led to this stage and discuss the current data on pharmacologic intervention of triglyceride levels and the effect on clinical outcomes. Lastly, we want to give the reader insight on what the most recent lipid guidelines state about clinical triglyceride management, mention new pharmacological agents, and highlight the clinical evidence for safe and effective lowering of triglycerides levels with life style modification.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b7475761]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — severe and very severe management: For severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Determination and treatment of underlying causes of very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be considered first. Restriction of both saturated and unsaturated dietary fat, particularly at initiation of therapy and in LpL deficiency, assists in lowering triglyceride acutely, and design of the dietary intervention may benefit from input from nutrition specialists; regain of weight loss might exacerbate pancreatitis risk.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^61abcbab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Clinical considerations for the management of… [^ea60c11e]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1 A low-carbohydrate diet is also a good strategy for managing hypertriglyceridemia. However, it should not be a universal recommendation in patients with triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg per dL because some of these patients may have familial chylomicronemia syndrome, a rare genetic disorder where loss-of-function mutations limit the ability to effectively break down triglycerides. Instead of a low-carbohydrate diet, patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome should be placed on a very low-fat diet. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with triglyceride levels greater than 1, 000 mg per dL without an obvious secondary cause; occurrence at a young age; and debilitating physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms. 1 For patients with significant hypertriglyceridemia leading to acute pancreatitis, we suggest that other medications be considered to reduce pancreatitis-associated morbidity and mortality.

Insulin has been successfully used in the hospital setting and is supported in the literature. 2, 3 Physicians without experience using insulin and other intensive therapies for this indication should consult an expert. Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic condition that should be considered if hypertriglyceridemia is refractory to traditional management, including nutrition, exercise, and medication. Lowering fat intake is important to consider in the management of familial chylomicronemia syndrome because of the inability of lipoprotein lipase to metabolize triglycerides and fat. Reduction of refined carbohydrates, including sucrose and fructose, is critical in the management of familial chylomicronemia syndrome because of their conversion in the liver to triglycerides. A diet lower in refined carbohydrates, higher in lean protein, and lower in fat can be an option for patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome.

5 REDUCE-IT is the first study of its kind, demonstrating a reduction of mortality in high-risk patients who have elevated triglycerides despite statin therapy. However, another similarly designed study did not show benefit. 6 Additionally, drug therapy should always be the last resort. The most cost-effective therapy is a healthy diet, physical activity, and nonpharmaceutical interventions to lower cardiovascular risk.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: impact and treatment [^e791beb8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is standard medical practice supported by conclusive outcome data. Less definitive information exists for hypertriglyceridemia. Only in the setting of severe hyperchylomicronemia is the benefit of triglyceride lowering clear: it is a means to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. The relationship of triglycerides and cardiovascular disease is still unclear. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of reducing triglycerides and of using triglyceride-lowering medications remain unproved. Nonetheless it has become almost standard to reduce the levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are a major component of plasma non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^5c8cc94c]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions and answers [^0662ce56]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders. Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity. Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is pertinent to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years). Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, although this has not been studied in clinical trials. For patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis should be considered if triglyceride levels remain at 1,000 mg per dL or higher despite conservative management of acute pancreatitis.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the management of ASCVD risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^6f3fc4f1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical ASCVD with LDL-C of 70 to 99 mg/dL and persistent fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dL — there is an evidence gap regarding the comparative efficacy of treatment with additional LDL-C–lowering therapies, adding IPE, or both; although there is a lack of comparative efficacy, an LDL-C risk-based approach may be preferable, and the treatment decision to begin with either LDL-C risk-based therapies or triglyceride risk-based nonstatin therapy should be made in the context of a patient-clinician discussion of the expected benefits versus risks, the cost of therapy, and patient preferences; LDL-C–risk-based therapies should be implemented according to the 2018 AHA/ACC multisociety guideline, and if an initial LDL-C–risk-based approach is taken and adequate lowering is achieved, the clinician should readdress lifestyle and medication adherence and reconsider possible secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and in the absence of these factors, it may be reasonable to consider the addition of IPE as the next step; if an initial triglyceride risk-based approach is taken and triglyceride levels are optimized, LDL-C–risk-based therapies should subsequently be optimized as per the 2018 AHA/ACC multisociety cholesterol guideline.

Hypertriglyceridemia in primary prevention — the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline recommended the use of elevated triglycerides as a "risk-enhancing factor" in primary ASCVD prevention and recommended optimizing diet and lifestyle first, ruling out secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and considering statin therapy in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and elevated 10-year ASCVD risk; in those with severe elevation (triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and especially ≥ 1,000 mg/dL), primary triglyceride lowering was recommended as a reasonable option to reduce pancreatitis risk, and studies have shown that despite statin therapy, ASCVD event rates remain high in patients with elevated triglycerides.

### Management of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^f28af990]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is highly prevalent globally, and its prevalence is rising, with a worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity and diabetes. This review examines its current management and future therapies.

Methods

For this review, HTG is defined as mild-to-moderate elevation in the levels of triglyceride (TG): a fasting or nonfasting TG level of ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL. We reviewed scientific studies published over the last 30 years and current professional society recommendations regarding the evaluation and treatment of HTG.

Results

Genetics, lifestyle, and other environmental factors impact TG levels. In adults with mild-to-moderate HTG, clinicians should routinely assess and treat secondary treatable causes (diet, physical activity, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and reduction or cessation of medications that elevate TG levels). Because atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is the primary clinical concern, statins are usually the first-line treatment. Patients with TG levels between ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is treated adequately with statins (at "maximally tolerated" doses, per some statements) and have either prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus along with at least 2 additional cardiovascular disease risk factors should be considered for added icosapent ethyl treatment to further reduce their cardiovascular disease risk. Fibrates, niacin, and other approved agents or agents under development are also reviewed in detail.

Conclusion

The treatment paradigm for mild-to-moderate HTG is changing on the basis of data from recent clinical trials. Recent trials suggest that the addition of icosapent ethyl to background statin therapy may further reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with moderate HTG, although a particular TG goal has not been identified.

### Hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction [^7e78dcbb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are prevalent among the US population, often occurring in persons who are overweight or obese, or who have type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. There is evidence that elevated TG levels may be a significant independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in women.

Objective

This article reviews data on the epidemiology, associated risks, treatment, and prevention of hypertriglyceridemia, including recommended TG goals and available TG-lowering agents.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for articles published from 1990 through 2006 using the terms hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease, with subheadings for risk, statins, niacin, fibrates, thiazolidinediones, and omega-3 fatty acids. The reference lists of relevant articles were examined for additional citations. Publications discussing the epidemiology of hypertriglyceridemia, CHD risk, treatment guidelines for lipid management, clinical trials involving TG-lowering drugs, and outcomes for lipid-modifying therapies were selected for review.

Results

Concern over the increasing rate of hypertriglyceridemia and its deleterious health consequences is reflected in the most recent National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Several lipid-lowering agents are available, including statins, fibrates, niacin, thiazolidinediones, and prescription omega-3 fatty acids. Clinical trials of these drugs have reported lowering of TG by 7% to 50%. Along with lifestyle changes, the use of combination pharmacotherapy to reduce lipid levels (including TG) may be an effective strategy in patients with dyslipidemia.

Conclusion

Use of strategies to manage TG levels, along with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, is warranted to help reduce the risk of CHD.

### Investigation and management of hypertriglyceridaemia [^5438fd0b]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

While the precise definition of hypertriglyceridaemia remains contentious, the condition is becoming more common in western populations as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus rise. Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that hypertriglyceridaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is has been difficult to demonstrate this by drug intervention studies, as drugs that reduce triglycerides also raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Precise target values have also been difficult to agree, although several of the new guidelines for coronary risk management now include triglycerides. The causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are numerous. The more severe forms have a genetic basis, and may lead to an increased risk of pancreatitis. Several types of hypertriglyceridaemia are familial and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are also numerous and it is important to exclude these before starting treatment with specific triglyceride-lowering agents. Lifestyle management is also very effective and includes weight reduction, restricted alcohol and fat intake and exercise.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^d50a3a2d]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Mendelian randomization data strongly suggest that hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and so triglyceride (TG) level-lowering treatment in HTG is now more strongly recommended to address the residual ASCVD risk than has been the case in (generally earlier) published guidelines. Fibrates are the best-established agents for TG level lowering and are generally used as first-line treatment of TG levels greater than 500 mg/dL. Statins are the best-established agents for ASCVD prevention, and so are usually used as first-line treatment of TG levels less than 500 mg/dL.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^d41448aa]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence and provide updated and new recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These recommendations are intended for use by clinicians, health care team members, patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders.

Methods

This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary task force of content experts and guideline methodologists based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or cohort studies from database inception to November 7, 2023. An updated literature search was completed for any additional articles published by May 31, 2024. Clinical questions addressing nonstatin medications and patient-important outcomes were prioritized. The task force assessed the certainty of the evidence and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. All recommendations were based on the consideration of the certainty of the evidence across patient-important outcomes, in addition to issues of feasibility, acceptability, equity, and patient preferences and values.

Results

This guideline update includes 13 evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia focused on patient-important outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction. The task force issued a good practice statement to assess the risk of ASCVD events for primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia. The task force suggested the use of alirocumab, evolocumab, or bempedoic acid for adults who have ASCVD or who are at increased risk for ASCVD in addition to standard care. The task force suggested against the use of these medications in adults without ASCVD. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the addition of inclisiran. For adults with hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD, the task force suggested the use of eicosapentaenoic acid but not eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid and strongly recommended against the use of niacin. There was insufficient evidence for recommendations regarding pharmacologic management in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). The task force suggested a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goal of < 70 mg/dL in adults with dyslipidemia and ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD.

Conclusions

Pharmacotherapy is recommended in adults with dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of ASCVD events. There are several effective and safe treatment options for adults with dyslipidemia who have ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD who need additional lipid-lowering medications. Shared decision-making discussions are essential to determine the best option for each individual.

Clinical ASCVD patients who are not at very high risk should be monitored using lipid-centric outcomes, and persistent hypertriglyceridemia warrants targeted management: Percent LDL-C and absolute LDL-C and non-HDL-C reductions should be the primary treatment outcomes for patients with clinical ASCVD who are not at very high risk; patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite adherence to lifestyle modifications and medications should be treated according to the 2021 ACC ECDP on management of hypertriglyceridemia; because hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and pancreatitis (especially in patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 500 mg/dL), treatment of persistent hypertriglyceridemia beyond statin and nonstatin LDL-C-lowering therapies may be warranted in patients with clinical ASCVD who are not at very high risk.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy selection by triglyceride level — states that when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (fibric acids, high-dose [2–4 g/d] long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid) should be the first-line agent if the fasting triglyceride concentration is ≥ 1000 mg/dL. For patients with triglycerides of 500 to 999 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin (if no history of pancreatitis) may be reasonable first-line drug options. For patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), a statin will generally be first-line drug therapy, and if maximum tolerated statin therapy does not lower non–HDL-C below goal levels in patients with triglycerides 200 to 499 mg/dL, adding an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and VLDL-C may help to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals. Subgroup analyses from cardiovascular outcome studies provide suggestive evidence of reduced ASCVD event risk with the addition of a triglyceride-lowering agent to statin therapy, particularly in patients with the combination of elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C.

### Hypertriglyceridemia [^8ced6ef3]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a commonly encountered lipid abnormality frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic derangements. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends obtaining a fasting lipid panel in adults over the age of 20. The discovery of hypertriglyceridemia should prompt an investigation for secondary causes such as high fat diet, excessive alcohol intake, certain medications, and medical conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism). In addition, patients should be evaluated for other components of the metabolic syndrome. These include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high triglyceride, and hypertension. Hypertriglyceridemia is classified as primary hypertriglyceridemia when there are no secondary causes identified. Primary hypertriglyceridemia is the result of various genetic defects leading to disordered triglyceride metabolism. It is important to treat hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis by reducing triglyceride levels to < 500 mg/dL. Furthermore, lowering triglycerides while treating other dyslipidemias and components of the metabolic syndrome will reduce coronary events. However, it is controversial how much isolated hypertriglyceridemia correlates directly with coronary artery disease and further studies are needed to clarify whether treatment for this condition leads to meaningful clinical outcomes. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are the first line of treatment for hypertriglyceridemia. These changes include a low saturated fat, carbohydrate-controlled diet, combined with alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, and regular aerobic exercise. High doses of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements will lower triglyceride levels significantly. When patients do not reach their goals by TLC, drug therapy should be started. In cases of isolated hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates are initially considered. When elevated low-density lipoprotein levels accompany hypertriglyceridemia, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are preferred. In patients with low HDL levels and hypertriglyceridemia, extended release niacin can be considered. A combination of the medicines may be necessary in recalcitrant cases.

Recommendation 1.3 — lipoprotein testing in hypertriglyceridemia states: We recommend against the routine measurement of lipoprotein particle heterogeneity in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (1⊕⊕⊕○). We suggest that measurement of apoB or Lp(a) levels can be of value, whereas measurement of other apolipoprotein levels has little clinical value (2⊕⊕○○). Supporting evidence notes it is not necessary to measure LDL size or density; however, measurement of non-HDL cholesterol and/or apoB levels can indicate the presence of increased numbers of LDL particles, and several reports also show that measurement of apoB is superior to measurement of LDL or even non-HDL cholesterol as an indicator of global CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have not provided conclusive evidence that measurement of HDL size contributes to risk prediction, and for these reasons, assessment of lipoprotein heterogeneity is not recommended in the assessment of hypertriglyceridemia. Regarding Lp(a), studies over the past decade have confirmed and more robustly demonstrated a risk factor role for cardiovascular disease; however, there are limited treatment options to alter its level and a current lack of outcome evidence supporting its use as a specific therapeutic target.

For the ≥ 885 mg/dL branch, the stated goal is "pancreatitis prophylaxis" with "low fat diet, fibrate and/or omega-3 FA", then "Reassess in 8–12 weeks"; if "Persistent TG ≥ 885 mg/dL or ≥ 10 mmol/L", the algorithm lists "DNA testing for FCS" and "Lipidologist referral". For the 150–884 mg/dL branch, clinicians should "Evaluate: global cardiovascular risk"; if "High/intermediate", "Start statin; monitor LDL-C or non-HDL-C or Apo B", whereas if "Low", "Focus on lifestyle behavior changes". After treatment, "Reassess in 8–12 weeks" and check "LDL-C target attained?"; if "Yes: consider icosapent ethyl for TG 150–500 mg/dL (1.7–5.6 mmol/L)", and if "No: follow LDL-C algorithm". Across all HTG patients, the figure lists "Clinical assessment and fasting lipids", "Address 2° causes", and "Lifestyle intervention: diet, weight loss" to "Optimize cardiovascular risk factors".

### Fasting or nonfasting lipid measurements: It depends on the question [^afe303ed]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association Guideline (AHA) on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment thresholds have been replaced with a focus on global risk. In this context, we re-examine the need for fasting lipid measurements in various clinical scenarios including estimating initial risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in a primary prevention patient; screening for familial lipid disorders in a patient with a strong family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or genetic dyslipidemia; clarifying a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome so it can be used to make lifestyle counseling more effective; assessing residual risk in a treated patient; diagnosing and treating patients with suspected hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis; or diagnosing hypertriglyceridemia in patients who require therapy for other conditions that may further elevate triglycerides. Posing a specific question can aid the clinician in understanding when fasting lipids are needed and when nonfasting lipids are adequate.

### Effectiveness of a novel ω-3 krill oil agent in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia: a randomized clinical trial [^8255e75a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ω-3–phospholipid/free fatty acid (ω-3–PL/FFA), a naturally derived krill oil with both free fatty acid and phospholipid ω-3s, an effective and safe treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia?

Findings

In pooled data from 2 randomized clinical trials including 520 patients, blood triglyceride levels were reduced by 26.0% in the ω-3–PL/FFA group and 15.1% in the placebo group at 12 weeks, for a significant mean treatment difference that persisted at 26 weeks. ω-3–PL/FFA was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

Meaning

This study found that ω-3–PL/FFA reduced triglyceride levels and was safe and well tolerated in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

ACC 2021 persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia 500–999 mg/dL — management includes emphasizing a low-fat diet and that it is reasonable to consider a very low-fat diet in select patients, with consideration of fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids to reduce risk of pancreatitis; for the right-column pathway, actions also include to increase intensity of statin therapy and optimize statin adherence while continuing the same diet and triglyceride-lowering options. Fenofibrate is specified as the preferred fibrate due to safety and interaction profile, and the narrative notes it is reasonable to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very-low-fat diet (10% to 15%), avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and prescription omega-3. The text also states that the initial step in guideline-based management of severe hypertriglyceridemia is to provide lifestyle counseling.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 40 years with diabetes mellitus, no ASCVD, and fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL or nonfasting triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL and triglycerides < 500 mg/dL — management emphasizes LDL-C risk-based therapy, for which maximally tolerated statin therapy is the treatment of choice; in patients with a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%, it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. High-intensity statin therapy is consistently associated with greater triglyceride reduction compared with moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy. After lifestyle interventions, optimization of statin therapy, consideration of ezetimibe at 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%, and improved glycemic control, a repeat fasting lipid panel should be performed. For persistent hypertriglyceridemia, the primary prevention cohort of REDUCE-IT supports the consideration of IPE for adults aged ≥ 50 years with diabetes mellitus, at least 1 additional ASCVD risk factor, and fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 with triglycerides < 500 mg/dL; in this subgroup, treatment with IPE resulted in a 12% nonsignificant relative risk reduction compared with placebo (HR: 0.88; 0.70–1.10) and an absolute between-group difference of 1.4 percentage points, while the larger secondary prevention cohort experienced a 27% relative risk reduction (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.65–0.81; P value for interaction = 0.14). Adults aged < 50 years with diabetes or aged ≥ 50 years with no additional ASCVD risk factors and fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 and triglycerides < 500 mg/dL have a paucity of randomized controlled trial evidence for ASCVD risk reduction with triglyceride risk-based nonstatin therapy.

The Panel believes there is insufficient evidence to permit definition of targets for triglycerides or HDL-C for these high-risk patients. Instead, the Panel proposes that treatment should be tailored to the individual to achieve desirable levels below (for triglycerides or non-HDL-C) or above (for HDL-C) the recommended cut-offs (Box 6). The Panel acknowledges that other expert bodies recommend apo B as a secondary therapeutic target in hypertriglyceridaemic patients. but considers that the precise clinical yield of this approach has yet to be demonstrated. The Panel also recognizes the limitations of the current evidence base for fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, including the lack of hard outcome data for statin–niacin and statin–omega-3 fatty acid combination therapies. Clearly, there is a need for well-defined trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic combinations in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA ± DHA) — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have CVD or are at increased risk for CVD and are taking statins, the task force issued a conditional recommendation for the use of EPA after shared decision-making because EPA monotherapy results in a small reduction in MI with some potential adverse effects, whereas in the same population it issued a conditional recommendation against EPA plus DHA due to trivial benefits and moderate adverse effects. Recommendations are grounded in trials evaluating doses of ≥ 1.8 g/day, approaching recommended prescribing doses in the range of 2 to 4 g/day, and should not be applied to doses < 1.8 g/day.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates and niacin as therapeutic options in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: a review of the literature [^08982cda]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia affects approximately 33% of the US population. Elevated triglyceride levels are independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and severe hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Guidelines for the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 5.6 mmol/L [≥ 500 mg/dL]) recommend immediate use of triglyceride-lowering agents; however, statins remain the first line of therapy for the management of mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (1.7–5.6 mmol/L [150–499 mg/dL]). Statins primarily target elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but have also been shown to reduce mean triglyceride levels by up to 18% (or 43% in patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 3.1 mmol/L [≥ 273 mg/dL]). However, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia may need additional reduction in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnant particles to further reduce residual CVD risk. A number of guidelines recommend the addition of fibrates, niacin, or long-chain omega-3 fatty acids if elevated triglyceride or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels persist despite the use of high-intensity statin therapy. This review evaluates the impact of fibrates, niacin, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It also assesses the adverse effects and drug-drug interactions associated with these triglyceride-lowering agents, because although they have all been shown to effectively reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, they differ with regard to their associated benefit-risk profiles. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be a well-tolerated and effective alternative to fibrates and niacin, yet further large-scale clinical studies are required to evaluate their effects on cardiovascular outcomes and CVD risk reduction in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

In adults 40 to 75 years of age with moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to reevaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently elevated triglyceride level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy. In adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL), and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L), it is reasonable to identify and address other causes, and if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^457fc1a9]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic and genetic studies have established that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants as important contributors to ASCVD while severe hypertriglyceridaemia raises risk of pancreatitis. While low-density lipoprotein is the primary treatment target for lipid lowering therapy, secondary targets that reflect the contribution of TRL such as apoB and non-HDL-C are recommended in the current guidelines. Reduction of severely elevated triglycerides is important to avert or reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Here we discuss interventions for hypertriglyceridaemia, including diet and lifestyle, established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid preparations and emerging therapies, including various biological agents.

Very severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis — treatment goals and measures are outlined as follows: concomitant fibrate therapy to maintain triglyceride levels below 2000 mg/dl is stated as beneficial to prevent recurrence, and a treatment goal of less than 1000 mg/dl is recommended; below this level the focus should shift to atherosclerosis prevention. The guideline states, "We do not recommend the use of heparin infusions or plasmapheresis" in this setting, and indicates that addressing underlying causes with dietary fat restriction and long-term fibrate therapy should suffice.

Who should promote and perform pragmatic cardiovascular outcome lipid trials?

The purpose of healthcare stakeholders of evolving toward personalized evidence‐based medicine calls for pragmatism in future lipid trials, in order to inform physicians and patients about the real cost‐effectiveness of a treatment in certain candidates for the treatment. The design of some new studies suggests that things are hopefully starting to move in this direction.

REDUCE‐IT 60 was aimed to evaluate the efficacy in reducing residual cardiovascular risk of a 4 g daily dose of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk on LDL‐C–lowering drugs with fairly well‐controlled LDL‐C levels (median 74 mg/dL) and baseline fasting TG levels between 150 and 500 mg/dL (median 216 mg/dL). Even though the effect of the therapy on TG levels was mild (18.3%; −39.0 mg per deciliter), the treatment produced, after 5 years, a 25% reduction of the primary cardiovascular end point. To what extent these effects are the result of TG lowering is not clear, as omega‐3 have many other putative cardioprotective pleiotropic effects. Yet, the trial pragmatically tested a coherent hypothesis in candidates suitable for the intervention in the real‐world clinical practice, responding to a frequent question of physicians: can we reduce residual risk in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia through omega‐3 fatty acids?

Propitiously, STRENGTH, 61 another pragmatic randomized placebo‐controlled trial with omega‐3 fatty acids in statin‐treated patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events, with well‐controlled LDL‐C, hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 180 to < 500 mg/dL), and low levels of HDL‐C (< 42 mg/dL in men or < 47 mg/dL in women) is ongoing, and the results are awaited by the end of 2019.

Another example of a pragmatic TG‐lowering trial in high‐risk patients is the ongoing PROMINENT trial, 62 a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled cardiovascular outcome trial with the novel fibrate compound Pemafibrate. The PROMINENT trial plans to recruit high‐risk patients with diabetes with and without cardiovascular disease, and, for the first time in fibrate outcome trials, all the patients will have TGs > 200 mg/dL and low HDL‐C despite best evidence‐based treatment, including high‐intensity statin therapy. The results of the PROMINENT trial are awaited by 2022.

Management of hypertriglyceridemia — We recommend lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals as the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Dietary evidence notes a quantitative linear relation between replacement of dietary carbohydrate with fat and reduction in serum triglycerides, and saturated, monounsaturated, and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids all lower serum triglycerides when they replace carbohydrate, with no clear difference between fatty acid classes in this action. It is recommended that reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, whether composed mainly of high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose, is an important part of lowering serum triglycerides, and fructose as contained in sweetened beverages may have stronger triglyceride-raising effects than glucose. The glycemic index, defined as the rise in blood glucose of 50 g of carbohydrate in a specific food compared with either 50 g of glucose or white bread, may correlate with the extent of rise of serum triglyceride after eating carbohydrate-rich foods. Compared with a diet that emphasized carbohydrate, a similar diet that emphasized protein decreased triglyceride levels further, and this decrease was about twice the effect of a diet that emphasized unsaturated fat; African-Americans have lower serum triglyceride levels than other racial or ethnic groups, and in a study in which 50% of the population was African-American, diet modification had less effect on triglyceride levels than in a Caucasian population when matching baseline triglyceride levels. Exercise can modulate postprandial triglycerides; exercise the day before a high-fat meal is associated with a marked dampening of the postprandial triglyceride increase, and although the minimum effective dose is undetermined, a period of 30–60 min of intermittent aerobic exercise or mild resistance exercise has been shown to be effective in lowering plasma and VLDL triglycerides.

Causes of elevated triglycerides — pathophysiology notes that triglycerides are the most dense form of calories and serve as an important source of energy; dietary triglycerides are assembled in the gut into chylomicrons; and their interaction with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells leads to liberation of free fatty acids from triglyceride, and free fatty acids are able to traverse cell membranes.

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

Hypertriglyceridemia severity thresholds and clinical implications: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., 200–999 mg/dl, is due to excess circulating VLDL. In patients with severe or very severe triglyceride levels (≥ 1000 mg/dl), the LpL removal system is saturated, and triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl can rapidly increase after a fat-rich meal. Very severe triglyceride levels (> 2000 mg/dl) are associated with lipemic serum and risk of pancreatitis in the chylomicronemia syndrome. Foods that contain potent substrates for triglyceride production such as simple sugars, fructose, and alcohol can substantially increase triglyceride levels in susceptible people.

Hypertriglyceridemia pathophysiology — production, clearance, and lipoproteins: Plasma triglyceride level reflects the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons), and the concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apoB is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased triglyceride production, or reduced triglyceride catabolism, or both, and clearance of VLDL from the circulation is reduced in many patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in part due to saturation of triglyceride clearance. Defective lipolysis is linked to genetic defects in LpL or apoC-II, impaired association of LpL with the vascular wall, or defective intracellular LpL processing, and severe hyperchylomicronemia also occurs when a secondary cause such as diabetes or pregnancy is superimposed on an underlying genetic defect. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL particles are heterogeneous and often have a high apoC-III/apoE ratio, causing reduced clearance and increased conversion to LDL. The common forms of hypertriglyceridemia emerge as adults get older and become overweight and sedentary and develop insulin resistance.

Figure 2
Overview of Triglyceride Management Adapted From the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia

Used with permission of the publisher. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; TG = triglycerides.

Although this patient's triglycerides are the primary concern, his LDL-C is well below 100 mg/dL, which may reduce the urgency for statin therapy. However, if triglycerides remain elevated and the patient's ASCVD risk increases (ie, a 10-year risk ≥ 5% or a diagnosis of diabetes), statin therapy should be initiated or intensified and would likely provide the greatest benefit for ASCVD risk reduction. In such cases, statins are recommended to target appropriate LDL-C or non-HDL-C thresholds, as they offer protection against both cardiovascular events and further elevations in triglycerides. In the setting of hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C calculations may be less accurate (especially if the older Friedewald calculation is used), and a more accurate assessment of atherogenic risk may require the usage of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB to help decide on the intensity of lipid lowering. In these cases, it is important to emphasize the role of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB as elevations in either should prompt consideration of statin therapy prior to triglyceride-specific lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypertriglyceridemia, omega-3 fatty acids, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adding eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester to reduce the risk of CVD in adult patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dL; > 1.7 mmol/L) on statins and having either ASCVD or diabetes plus two additional risk factors.
