## Question

Migraine treatment with propanol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using propranolol for migraine treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the indication and scope, because propranolol is for prevention, not acute treatment. Then, I should verify the regulatory status and labeled dosing. Next, I will appraise the efficacy evidence from guidelines and pivotal trials, including comparative data. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations, practical prescribing, and how to integrate propranolol with other options like behavioral therapy and CGRP-targeted drugs, before summarizing a bottom-line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the indication and scope so I don't misstate anything. Propranolol is a preventive therapy for migraine, not an acute abortive, and it is FDA-approved for migraine prophylaxis in adults, which aligns with its use to reduce attack frequency and severity over time rather than to treat an ongoing attack [^543440c6] [^f93d91a2].

> I should confirm the regulatory status and labeled dosing next. The FDA labeling supports propranolol for migraine prevention, with typical dosing starting around 80 mg/day in divided doses and maintenance commonly in the 160–240 mg/day range; extended-release formulations are also labeled for migraine prevention with similar total daily doses, and twice-daily regimens are generally acceptable based on pharmacokinetics and clinical practice, though some trials used TID/QID schedules [^543440c6] [^f93d91a2] [^488d868a] [^42e3b481] [^b0d1622c].

> Now, I will examine the efficacy evidence base. Multiple high-quality guidelines list propranolol as a first-line preventive option: the AAN/AHS gives propranolol a Level A recommendation, the VA/DoD suggests propranolol with moderate-quality evidence, and the AAFP recommends propranolol or metoprolol as first-line; the ACP also includes propranolol among first-line monotherapy options for episodic migraine prevention in nonpregnant adults [^58e286e1] [^4f782cf9] [^51a59dcd] [^9a69061c].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit so I don't overstate it. The VA/DoD review of three RCTs found propranolol reduced monthly migraine days versus placebo, though the ≥ 50% responder rate did not reach statistical significance in that pooled analysis; broader meta-analytic data for beta-blockers show modest but real reductions in headache frequency, and a large Cochrane review concluded propranolol is superior to placebo for short-term prophylaxis despite methodological limitations in older trials [^6d51fc3f] [^675a1966] [^74ab2205].

> Hold on, I should review comparative effectiveness so clinicians have context for choosing among first-line agents. Head-to-head and guideline syntheses indicate propranolol has efficacy comparable to metoprolol, topiramate, and valproate, with no consistent superiority among these options; for example, a randomized trial found propranolol 160 mg/day was non-inferior to topiramate 100 mg/day for chronic migraine, and older comparative studies show similar efficacy between propranolol and topiramate or valproate, supporting the concept of choosing based on comorbidity and tolerability rather than expecting major efficacy differences [^8ecc2ca0] [^b8a02c0e] [^0e8c784c].

> I need to ensure I address combination therapy claims carefully. A randomized trial adding propranolol to topiramate in chronic migraine patients inadequately controlled on topiramate alone did not show added benefit, so routine combination with topiramate is not supported; however, a separate RCT in frequent episodic migraine showed that adding a beta-blocker to optimized acute treatment only improved outcomes when combined with behavioral migraine management, suggesting synergy with behavioral therapy rather than with topiramate [^dd3b26b9] [^8052c14f].

> Next, I should review safety, contraindications, and monitoring so I don't miss practical pitfalls. Common adverse effects include fatigue, dizziness, exercise intolerance, and sexual dysfunction; propranolol is contraindicated in asthma, severe bradycardia, heart block, and decompensated heart failure, and should be used cautiously with calcium channel blockers due to bradycardia risk; guidelines advise considering an ECG in patients with cardiac disease and tapering slowly to avoid rebound phenomena [^6d51fc3f] [^4f782cf9] [^6240930a].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics. Evidence in children is limited and heterogeneous, with a high placebo response; the AAN/AHS notes propranolol may possibly increase the likelihood of a ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency, but many pediatric RCTs fail to show superiority to placebo, so shared decision-making and short therapeutic trials are emphasized; if used, typical pediatric dosing is 20–40 mg three times daily, and clinicians should counsel on modest evidence and potential benefits/risks [^a7d36a25] [^4310b20b] [^11585863].

> I should double-check pregnancy considerations. Propranolol is generally considered acceptable for migraine prophylaxis in pregnancy when benefits outweigh risks, though it is not first-line in pregnancy and nonpharmacologic strategies are preferred when possible; if a beta-blocker is chosen, propranolol is commonly used given its track record and safety profile relative to alternatives like valproate, which is contraindicated in pregnancy [^notfound].

> Now, I will translate this into practical prescribing steps. Start low, titrate slowly to effect and tolerability, and reassess after about 2–3 months; typical adult dosing begins at 40–80 mg/day in divided doses or 80 mg/day ER, with a target of 160–240 mg/day if tolerated; monitor blood pressure and heart rate, watch for fatigue, sleep disturbance, and exercise intolerance, and taper gradually if discontinuing; in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, obtain an ECG and coordinate with cardiology as needed [^488d868a] [^42e3b481] [^4f782cf9].

> But wait, what if propranolol is ineffective or not tolerated? I should confirm escalation pathways. Guidelines suggest switching within first-line classes or to other first-line agents such as metoprolol, topiramate, valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline, and if multiple conventional preventives fail, consider CGRP monoclonal antibodies or gepants; behavioral migraine management can be layered onto pharmacotherapy, and in frequent migraine, combining beta-blocker with behavioral therapy improved outcomes beyond optimized acute treatment alone in a high-quality RCT [^9a69061c] [^23faa4a3] [^8052c14f].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility briefly to ensure internal consistency. Although the exact mechanism is not fully defined, propranolol likely modulates migraine via central effects on noradrenergic pathways, potential inhibition of cortical spreading depression, and autonomic modulation; preclinical data suggest prevention of chronic sensitization in trigeminovascular circuits, which aligns with clinical prophylaxis rather than acute abortive effects [^53762292] [^5540b526].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating certainty. Propranolol is a first-line, FDA-approved preventive for episodic migraine in adults with modest but real efficacy, a favorable safety profile in appropriately selected patients, and comparability to other first-line agents; it is not for acute treatment, requires careful selection and monitoring in patients with cardiopulmonary disease, and may be less convincing in pediatrics where placebo response is high; when used, employ slow titration, reassess at 2–3 months, and integrate with behavioral strategies or escalate to newer classes if needed [^58e286e1] [^4f782cf9] [^9a69061c] [^8052c14f].

---

Propranolol is a **first-line preventive** [^51a59dcd] for episodic migraine, with **moderate-quality evidence** [^4f782cf9] showing a modest reduction in migraine frequency and severity [^6d51fc3f]. Typical dosing is 80–240 mg/day [^488d868a], titrated to effect and tolerability [^42e3b481]. Common adverse effects include fatigue, dizziness, and exercise intolerance [^6d51fc3f]; contraindications include asthma, bradycardia, and heart block [^5f119175]. Propranolol is **less effective than topiramate** [^notfound] but has a favorable safety profile and is often preferred in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or when weight gain is a concern [^notfound]. It is not effective for acute migraine treatment [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of action

Propranolol's preventive effect in migraine is **multifactorial**, though the exact mechanism remains incompletely understood [^c8dbbaba]. Proposed mechanisms include:

- **Β-adrenergic blockade**: Inhibition of peripheral and central β-adrenergic receptors, reducing sympathetic outflow and potentially modulating trigeminovascular activation [^53762292].

- **Cortical spreading depression (CSD) modulation**: Animal studies suggest propranolol may inhibit CSD, a phenomenon implicated in migraine aura and pathogenesis [^5540b526].

- **Central pain modulation**: Propranolol may influence descending pain pathways, including noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, thereby reducing pain perception and frequency of attacks [^53762292].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Propranolol has been extensively studied for migraine prophylaxis, with **moderate-quality evidence** supporting its efficacy [^4f782cf9]:

- **Reduction in migraine frequency**: Clinical trials consistently demonstrate a modest reduction in migraine frequency, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing a ≥ 50% reduction in attack frequency [^53762292].

- **Reduction in migraine severity**: Propranolol also reduces the severity and duration of migraine attacks, improving overall quality of life [^6c844c93].

- **Comparison with other agents**: Propranolol is comparable in efficacy to other first-line preventive agents such as metoprolol, topiramate, and valproate, though individual patient response may vary [^b8a02c0e] [^0e8c784c].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

The **recommended dosage** of propranolol for migraine prophylaxis is:

| **Formulation** | **Initial dose** | **Maintenance dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Immediate-release | 80 mg/day | 160–240 mg/day | Divided doses (bid-qid) |
| Extended-release | 80 mg/day | 160–240 mg/day | Once daily |

---

Titration should be gradual, based on clinical response and tolerability, with **regular monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate** [^4f782cf9].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Propranolol is **generally well-tolerated**, but adverse effects are common:

- **Common adverse effects**: Fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and sexual dysfunction [^6d51fc3f].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm (contraindicated in asthma), and depression [^c8ab091d].

- **Withdrawal**: Gradual tapering is recommended to avoid rebound hypertension and tachycardia [^6240930a].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Propranolol is **contraindicated** in patients with:

- Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^c8ab091d].
- Bradycardia or heart block.
- Cardiogenic shock.
- Severe peripheral arterial disease.

Precautions include use in patients with diabetes mellitus (may mask hypoglycemia symptoms), depression, or cardiovascular disease [^6240930a].

---

## Comparison with other migraine preventive medications

Propranolol is **comparable in efficacy** to other first-line preventive agents, including beta-blockers (metoprolol, timolol), anticonvulsants (topiramate, valproate), and antidepressants (amitriptyline) [^b8a02c0e] [^0e8c784c]. The choice of medication should be individualized based on patient comorbidities, side-effect profile, and patient preferences [^d64255bb].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Propranolol is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but careful monitoring is recommended.

- **Pediatric population**: Limited evidence supports the use of propranolol in pediatric migraine, with modest efficacy and favorable tolerability [^a7d36a25] [^1a9fa33d].

- **Elderly patients**: Caution is advised due to increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major headache societies and guidelines consistently recommend propranolol as a **first-line preventive therapy** for episodic migraine, including the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Headache Society (AHS), and the American College of Physicians (ACP) [^58e286e1] [^9a69061c].

---

Propranolol is a **first-line preventive** [^51a59dcd] treatment for episodic migraine, with moderate-quality evidence supporting its efficacy and safety [^4f782cf9]. It is particularly suitable for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate other preventive medications. Regular monitoring and individualized dosing are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Propranolol for migraine prophylaxis [^74ab2205]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Propranolol is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for migraine prophylaxis.

Objectives

We aimed to determine whether there is evidence that propranolol is more effective than placebo and as effective as other drugs for the interval (prophylactic) treatment of patients with migraine.

Search Strategy

Potentially eligible studies were identified by searching MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to May 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2003), and by screening bibliographies of reviews and identified articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials of at least 4 weeks duration comparing clinical effects of propranolol with placebo or another drug in adult migraine sufferers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted information on patients, methods, interventions, outcomes measured, and results using a pre-tested form. Study quality was assessed using two checklists (Jadad scale and Delphi list). Due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures and insufficient reporting of the data, only selective quantitative meta-analyses were performed. As far as possible, effect size estimates were calculated for single trials. In addition, results were summarised descriptively and by a vote count among the reviewers.

Main Results

A total of 58 trials with 5072 participants met the inclusion criteria. The 58 selected trials included 26 comparisons with placebo and 47 comparisons with other drugs. The methodological quality of the majority of trials was unsatisfactory. The principal shortcomings were high dropout rates and insufficient reporting and handling of this problem in the analysis. Overall, the 26 placebo-controlled trials showed clear short-term effects of propranolol over placebo. Due to the lack of studies with long-term follow up, it is unclear whether these effects are stable after stopping propranolol. The 47 comparisons with calcium antagonists, other beta-blockers, and a variety of other drugs did not yield any clear-cut differences. Sample size was, however, insufficient in most trials to establish equivalence.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Although many trials have relevant methodological shortcomings, there is clear evidence that propranolol is more effective than placebo in the short-term interval treatment of migraine. Evidence on long-term effects is lacking. Propranolol seems to be as effective and safe as a variety of other drugs used for migraine prophylaxis.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol added to topiramate in chronic migraine [^dd3b26b9]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of adding propranolol to topiramate in chronic migraine subjects inadequately controlled with topiramate alone.

Methods

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Clinical Research Collaboration, expected to randomize 250 chronic migraine subjects inadequately controlled (≥ 10 headaches/month) with topiramate (50–100 mg/day) to either propranolol LA (long acting) (240 mg/day) or placebo. Primary outcome was 28-day moderate to severe headache rate reduction at 6 months (weeks 16 to 24) compared with baseline (weeks -4 to 0).

Results

A planned interim analysis was performed after 48 sites randomized 171 subjects. The data and safety monitoring board recommended ending the trial after determining that it would be highly unlikely for the combination to result in a significant reduction in 28-day headache rate compared with topiramate alone if all 250 subjects were randomized. No safety concerns were identified. At study closure, 191 subjects were randomized. The 6-month reduction in moderate to severe 28-day headache rate and total 28-day headache rate for combination therapy vs topiramate alone was not significantly different: 4.0 vs 4.5 days (moderate to severe 28-day headache rate; p = 0.57) and 6.2 vs 6.1 days (total 28-day headache rate; p = 0.91).

Conclusions

This study does not provide evidence that the addition of propranolol LA to topiramate adds benefit when chronic migraine is inadequately controlled with topiramate alone.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that propranolol LA, added to topiramate, is ineffective in chronic migraine patients who fail topiramate monotherapy.

### Acupuncture versus propranolol in migraine prophylaxis: an indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis [^1a308f28]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Propranolol is recommended as first-line treatment for preventing migraine attacks; acupuncture has not been compared with propranolol in a head-to-head trial.

Objective

To compare acupuncture with propranolol using indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis.

Method

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture or propranolol with sham acupuncture, placebo, waiting-list control or usual care were included. We extracted information from the included trials using a standardized extraction form. The primary outcome was migraine episodes. The secondary outcomes included migraine days, migraine frequency, and adverse events.

Results

We included 19 RCTs (n = 3656) after screening 1078 articles. The analysis showed that acupuncture had a significant advantage over propranolol in reducing migraine episodes over a 4-week period (SMD - 0.74, 95% CI - 1.04 to - 0.44). Acupuncture also had a significant advantage over waiting-list control in decreasing migraine frequency (SMD - 1.57, 95% CI - 2.08 to - 1.06). Acupuncture caused fewer adverse events than propranolol (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.11–5.94).

Conclusions

Acupuncture had a better effect than propranolol in reducing migraine episodes in indirect comparison. The result should be confirmed in subsequent head-to-head studies. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42018108585.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^425db46a]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the preventive treatment of migraine headache. The clinical question addressed was: What pharmacologic therapies are proven effective for migraine prevention?

Methods

The authors analyzed published studies from June 1999 to May 2009 using a structured review process to classify the evidence relative to the efficacy of various medications available in the United States for migraine prevention.

Results and Recommendations

The author panel reviewed 284 abstracts, which ultimately yielded 29 Class I or Class II articles that are reviewed herein. Divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity (Level A). Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine (Level A). Lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention (Level A).

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in preventive headache treatment.

Recent Findings

Migraine may be a progressive disorder. Aggressive treatment may stop progression. Propranolol, the beta-blocker, and the anticonvulsant topiramate are effective for migraine prevention. Feverfew, montelukast and acupuncture have not proven effective.

Summary

New drugs and other treatment strategies expand the spectrum of preventive migraine treatments.

Propranolol for migraine prevention — Recommendation 10: We suggest propranolol for the prevention of migraine (Weak for | Reviewed, Not changed). No new evidence on propranolol for the prevention of migraine headache was retrieved during this update; an SR of three RCTs (n = 238) from the 2020 VA/DoD Headache CPG suggested propranolol decreases migraine headache days when compared with placebo. The SR found the ≥ 50% responder rate was not statistically significant when compared with placebo, and no statistically significant differences were seen in all-cause study withdrawal or withdrawal because of adverse events versus placebo. Adverse events of propranolol can include fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and sexual dysfunction. The systematic evidence review did not provide specific dosing recommendations or dosing strategies.

### Spreading depression: from serendipity to targeted therapy in migraine prophylaxis [^1a87945f]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the relatively well-characterized headache mechanisms in migraine, upstream events triggering individual attacks are poorly understood. This lack of mechanistic insight has hampered a rational approach to prophylactic drug discovery. Unlike targeted abortive and analgesic interventions, mainstream migraine prophylaxis has been largely based on serendipitous observations (e.g. propranolol) and presumed class effects (e.g. anticonvulsants). Recent studies suggest that spreading depression is the final common pathophysiological target for several established or investigational migraine prophylactic drugs. Building on these observations, spreading depression can now be explored for its predictive utility as a preclinical drug screening paradigm in migraine prophylaxis.

### Practice pointers… [^76add3af]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The AHRQ review concludes that NSAIDs and triptans are first-line treatments of acute migraines. Four systematic reviews comparing NSAIDs with various interventions, including placebo and triptans, found that NSAIDs lead to pain relief and resolution at all time points with a number needed to treat of less than 10 in all studies for two-hour migraine pain relief and 24-hour sustained pain relief. Triptans improved pain and function at two and 24 hours compared with placebo in nine systematic reviews with an NNT of less than 10 in all studies. Higher doses of triptans were significantly more effective; 100 mg of sumatriptan was significantly more effective at 24-hour pain relief than a 50-mg dose. However, an increase in doses of triptans was also associated with an increase in harms compared with placebo = 5. 2], 50 mg, and 25 mg).

Adverse events included nausea, dizziness, paresthesias, somnolence, and chest discomfort. Earlier treatment during the mild phase of the migraine appeared to be more effective, although none of the studies were intentionally designed to evaluate timing of administration. 6 Two systematic reviews found that combining a triptan and an NSAID is effective and well tolerated, leading to relief of moderate to severe headaches at two hours compared with placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness, nausea, dyspepsia, paresthesia, somnolence, dry mouth, and chest discomfort. 1, 7 The AHRQ review confirms that opioids should not be used in the acute treatment of migraines. Most of the studies that included opioids found them to be less effective and associated with more adverse events compared with other medications or placebo in the treatment of episodic migraine.

1 Physicians should avoid opioids for the acute treatment of migraine in all settings if possible. This is consistent with the Choosing Wisely recommendation from the American Headache Society.
8. The review supports the guidance that physicians should use NSAIDs for acute treatment of mild or moderate migraines and triptans for treatment of moderate or severe migraines.

### TOP-PRO study: a randomized double-blind controlled trial of topiramate versus propranolol for prevention of chronic migraine [^8ecc2ca0]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the TOP-PRO-study, a double-blind randomized controlled trial, was to assess the efficacy (non-inferiority) and tolerability of propranolol compared to topiramate for the prevention of chronic migraine.

Background

Except for topiramate, oral preventive treatment for chronic migraine lacks credible evidence.

Methods

Chronic migraine patients aged above 18 years and less than 65 years of age, not on any preventive treatment were randomly allocated to receive topiramate (100mg/day) or propranolol (160mg/day). The primary efficacy outcome was the mean change in migraine days per 28 days at the end of 24 weeks from baseline. A mean difference of 1.5 days per four weeks was chosen as the cut-off delta value. Multiple secondary efficacy outcomes and treatment emergent adverse events were also assessed.

Results

As against the planned sample size of 244, only 175 patients could be enrolled before the spread of the corona virus disease-2019 pandemic and enforcement of lockdown in India. Of the 175 randomized patients, 95 (topiramate 46 and propranolol 49) completed the trial. The mean change in migraine days was -5.3 ± 1.2 vs -7.3 ± 1.1 days (p = 0.226) for topiramate and propranolol groups respectively. Propranolol was found to be non-inferior and not superior to topiramate (point estimate of -1.99 with a 95% confidence interval of -5.23 to 1.25 days). Multiple secondary outcomes also did not differ between the two groups. Intention to treat analysis of 175 patients and per-protocol analysis of 95 patients yielded concordant results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups.

Conclusion

Propranolol (160mg/day) was non-inferior, non-superior to topiramate (100mg/day) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine and had a comparable tolerability profile. Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Registry-India CTRI/2019/05/018997).

### Medications for migraine prophylaxis [^2c743868]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Sufficient evidence and consensus exist to recommend propranolol, timolol, amitriptyline, divalproex, sodium valproate, and topiramate as first-line agents for migraine prevention. There is fair evidence of effectiveness with gabapentin and naproxen sodium. Botulinum toxin also has demonstrated fair effectiveness, but further studies are needed to define its role in migraine prevention. Limited evidence is available to support the use of candesartan, lisinopril, atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, fluoxetine, magnesium, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), coenzyme Q10, and hormone therapy in migraine prevention. Data and expert opinion are mixed regarding some agents, such as verapamil and feverfew; these can be considered in migraine prevention when other medications cannot be used. Evidence supports the use of timed-release dihydroergotamine mesylate, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^4f782cf9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

VA/DoD headache guideline — propranolol for migraine prevention is suggested for the prevention of migraine, with the recommendation categorized as Reviewed, Not changed and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence described as moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations including small sample size, limited duration of follow-up (12–16 weeks), and imprecision, and the benefits of propranolol slightly outweighed the potential harms and AEs. In patients with a history of cardiac disease, electrocardiograms (ECG) might be needed for monitoring, and propranolol is used to treat hypertension and certain types of tremors and might be effective for patients with these comorbid conditions.

### Topiramate in migraine prophylaxis – results from a placebo-controlled trial with propranolol as an active control [^b8a02c0e]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Topiramate (TPM) has shown efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in two large placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trials. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of topiramate vs placebo for migraine prophylaxis, with propranolol (PROP) as an active control. Subjects with episodic migraine with and without aura were randomised to TPM 100 mg/d, TPM 200 mg/d, PROP 160 mg/d (active control), or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the change in mean monthly migraine frequency from the baseline phase relative to the double-blind treatment phase. Five hundred and seventy-five subjects were enrolled from 61 centres in 13 countries. TPM 100 mg/d was superior to placebo as measured by reduction in monthly migraine frequency, overall 50% responder rate, reduction in monthly migraine days, and reduction in the rate of daily rescue medication use. The TPM 100 mg/d and PROP groups were similar with respect to reductions in migraine frequency, responder rate, migraine days, and daily rescue medication usage. TPM 100 mg/d was better tolerated than TPM 200 mg/d, and was generally comparable to PROP. No unusual or unexpected safety risks emerged. These findings demonstrate that TPM 100 mg/d is effective in migraine prophylaxis. TPM 100 mg/d and PROP 160 mg/d exhibited similar efficacy profiles.

### EFNS guideline on the drug treatment of migraine – revised report of an EFNS task force [^1ae71ec2]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is one of the most frequent disabling neurological conditions with a major impact on the patients' quality of life.

Objectives

To give evidence-based or expert recommendations for the different drug treatment procedures in the particular migraine syndromes based on a literature search and the consensus of an expert panel.

Methods

All available medical reference systems were screened for the range of clinical studies on migraine with and without aura and on migraine-like syndromes. The findings in these studies were evaluated according to the recommendations of the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) resulting in level A, B, or C recommendations and good practice points.

Recommendations

For the acute treatment of migraine attacks, oral non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and triptans are recommended. The administration should follow the concept of stratified treatment. Before intake of NSAID and triptans, oral metoclopramide or domperidone is recommended. In very severe attacks, intravenous acetylsalicylic acid or subcutaneous sumatriptan are drugs of first choice. Status migrainosus can be treated by cortoicosteroids, although this is not universally held to be helpful, or dihydroergotamine. For the prophylaxis of migraine, betablockers (propranolol and metoprolol) flunarizine, valproic acid, and topiramate are drugs of first choice. Drugs of second choice for migraine prophylaxis include amitriptyline, naproxen, petasites, and bisoprolol.

Beta-blockers — metoprolol and propranolol for episodic migraine prevention show that metoprolol (200 mg/day) was more effective than aspirin (300 mg/day) for achieving 50% migraine frequency reduction (responder rate metoprolol = 45.2%; aspirin = 29.6%; mean difference 15.65; CI 4.43–26.88), with attack frequencies changing from 3.36 to 2.37 for aspirin and from 3.55 to 1.82 for metoprolol; a small Class II study reported metoprolol 47.5–142.5 mg/day had similar efficacy to nebivolol 5 mg/day. For propranolol, a Class II study found 80 mg/day was more effective than placebo and as effective as cyproheptadine 4 mg/day, with attack frequency reduction differences of propranolol −2.85 ± 0.2 (SEM), cyproheptadine −3.09 ± 0.31, combination 3.12 ± 0.1, and placebo −1.77 ± 0.44 (all p < 0.05 vs placebo), and combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy (p < 0.05). Conclusions state metoprolol is established as effective for migraine prevention (2 Class I studies) and is possibly as effective as nebivolol or aspirin (1 Class II study each), and propranolol is established as effective for migraine prevention (multiple Class I studies) and is possibly as effective as cyproheptadine (1 Class II study).

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^0e8c784c]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Topiramate for episodic migraine prevention — evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness — has Class I and II support and shows placebo-controlled and active-comparator efficacy. Results of 5 Class II studies support those of the Class I studies showing topiramate as effective for migraine prevention, with four demonstrating significant improvement over placebo and one suggesting equivalence of topiramate (100, 200 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day); two studies comparing topiramate and amitriptyline (25–150 mg/day) reported no difference in efficacy for primary endpoints, and one Class II 24-week pilot study failed to show a difference between topiramate 200 mg and placebo. Topiramate is established as effective for migraine prevention (4 Class I studies, multiple Class II studies; 1 negative Class II study), and topiramate is probably as effective for migraine prevention as propranolol, sodium valproate, and amitriptyline as noted on-page with their respective study class counts.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^c8dbbaba]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are commonly used for migraine treatment, although the mechanism of action in migraine is incompletely understood. There were four studies of propranolol in VM and one of metoprolol. Propranolol was associated with reductions in vertigo frequency and severity using before-and-after comparisons. Doses in the studies varied: 40 mg twice daily for weight < 60 kg and 60 mg twice daily for weight > 60 kg, up to 80 mg twice daily,10 mg once dailyand 40 mg and 80 mg once daily (two different treatment arms). A retrospective, uncontrolled studyfollowed 38 patients prescribed propranolol 80–120 mg daily for between 6 and 32 months. Due to the variable follow-up, the authors attempted to standardize the duration of symptoms by converting symptom frequency to 1 year. The mean 'annual duration of symptoms' was 115 days before treatment and 13 days after treatment (P < 0.001); however, this was an extrapolation and likely to have been inaccurate. Mean vertigo severity (VAS 0–10) reduced from 7.52 to 1.34 (P < 0.001) and the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), a well-validated measure of the impact of dizziness disability, reduced from 50.21 to 9.31 (P < 0.001). The vertigo symptom scale (VSS) and a quality-of-life measure (vestibular activities of daily living scale, VADL) were also lower after treatment. An unblinded RCT comparing propranolol 40–160 mg daily (n = 26) and venlafaxine 37.5–150 mg daily (n = 26) for 4 months found no significant differences between the two treatments, except that propranolol was inferior for depressive symptoms. A before-and-after analysis was also performed, and patients receiving propranolol showed marked reductions in mean monthly vertigo frequency (from 12.6 to 1.9, P < 0.001), DHI (55.8–31.3, P < 0.001), VAS vertigo severity (7.3–2.1, P < 0.001) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Two small observational studies compared outcomes in patients receiving multiple treatments including propranolol. These studies found improvements in subjective measures of vertigo and headache severity from pre- to post-treatment but were underpowered to detect between-group differences. Propranolol has never been compared to a placebo (or a control group without placebo) in VM and thus some of the benefits seen in the studies could be due to this confound.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^79dbaeb2]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations

In patients with apparent late-onset migraine, suspect an underlying cause.
In older people, consider the higher risks of secondary headache, comorbidities and adverse events with older age.
In children and adolescents with migraine, bed rest alone might suffice; if not, use ibuprofen for acute treatment and propranolol, amitriptyline or topiramate for prevention.
In pregnant or breastfeeding women, use paracetamol for acute treatment and avoid preventive medication whenever possible.
In women with menstrual migraine, consider perimenstrual preventive therapy with a long-acting NSAID or triptan.

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^38cb29b5]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The migraine-preventive drug propranolol is efficacious in reducing pain from temporomandibular disorder, suggesting potential modifying or mediating effects of comorbid migraine.

Methods

In this randomized controlled trial, myofascial temporomandibular disorder patients were treated with propranolol or placebo for 9 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in a facial pain index derived from daily symptom diaries. Linear and logistic regression models tested for a migraine×treatment-group interaction in reducing facial pain index. Counterfactual models explored changes in headache impact and heart rate as mediators of propranolol's efficacy.

Results

Propranolol's efficacy in reducing facial pain index was greater among the 104 migraineurs than the 95 non-migraineurs: For example, for the binary ≥ 30% reduction in facial pain index, odds ratios were 3.3 (95% confidence limits: 1.4, 8.1) versus 1.3 (0.5, 3.2), respectively, although the interaction was statistically non-significant (p = 0.139). Cumulative response curves confirmed greater efficacy for migraineurs than non-migraineurs (differences in area under the curve 26% and 6%, respectively; p = 0.081). While 9% of the treatment effect was mediated by reduced headache impact, 46% was mediated by reduced heart rate.

Conclusions

Propranolol was more efficacious in reducing temporomandibular disorder pain among migraineurs than non-migraineurs, with more of the effect mediated by reduced heart rate than by reduced headache impact.

Topiramate head-to-head trials — 50 mg/day versus propranolol 80 mg/day or sodium valproate 400 mg/day — show within-group clinical improvements and adverse event profiles consistent with efficacy comparable to established agents. Two additional Class I studies report topiramate as effective as propranolol or sodium valproate, with one study showing topiramate 50 mg/day reduced mean migraine frequency from 6.07 ± 1.89 to 1.83 ± 1.39 (p < 0.001) at 8 weeks, decreased intensity VAS from 7.1 ± 1.45 to 3.67 ± 2.1 (p < 0.001), and shortened duration from 16.37 ± 7.26 hours to 6.23 ± 5.22 hours (p < 0.001), while reporting paresthesias (23%), weight loss (16%), and somnolence (13%); propranolol 80 mg/day produced frequency decreases from 5.83 ± 1.98 to 2.2 ± 1.67 (p < 0.001), intensity from 6.43 ± 1.6 to 4.13 ± 1.94 (p < 0.001), and duration from 15.10 ± 6.84 hours to 7.27 ± 6.46 hours (p < 0.001). In a crossover Class I trial comparing topiramate 50 mg/day with sodium valproate 400 mg/day, average monthly migraine frequency decreased by 1.8 times with sodium valproate versus a 3-time reduction with topiramate, headache intensity decreased by 3.7 with sodium valproate versus 3.6 with topiramate, and episode duration decreased by 13.4 hours with sodium valproate versus an 11.9-hour reduction with topiramate; adverse events included for topiramate weight loss (18.8%), paresthesias (9.4%), or both (25%), and for sodium valproate weight gain (34.5%), hair loss (3.1%), and somnolence (3%).

### Nonpharmacologic treatment of migraine with low-dose propranolol or amitriptyline [^7b1e8d36]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic measures combined with low-dose propranolol or amitriptyline for treating severe pediatric migraine. Data were collected from the medical files of 118 patients (mean age, 12.54 ± 3.14 years S.D.). All were treated with nonpharmacologic measures. In addition, 93 children received propranolol (mean initial dose, 0.4 ± 0.17 mg/kg/day S.D.), and 25 received amitriptyline (mean initial dose, 0.26 ± 0.1 mg/kg/day S.D.). Twenty patients were switched from propranolol to amitriptyline during treatment. In both groups, headache frequency was reduced by > 50% per month in ~80% of patients. Patients without aura responded significantly better to propranolol than patients with aura (P = 0.02). No significant difference was evident in response to pharmacologic treatment by migraine frequency or type (episodic chronic). No significant difference was evident in response to amitriptyline between patients with or without aura. The response rate was higher than previously reported for placebo. Low-dose propranolol and low-dose amitriptyline, when combined with nonpharmacologic measures, are equally effective in reducing the frequency of migraine in children. Propranolol is preferred because of its lower risk of side effects. An additive effect of nonpharmacologic measures may allow for a reduction in drug dose.

### The effect of blood pressure lowering medications on the prevention of episodic migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^675a1966]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, only a few specific blood pressure-lowering medications are recommended for migraine prevention. Whether benefits extend to other classes or drugs is uncertain.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized control trials on the effect of blood pressure-lowering medications compared with placebo in participants with episodic migraine. Data were collected on four outcomes - monthly headache or migraine days, and monthly headache or migraine attacks, with a standardised mean difference calculated for overall. Random effect meta-analysis was performed.

Results

In total, 50 trials (70% of which were crossover) were included, comprising 60 comparisons. Overall mean age was 39 years, and 79% were female. Monthly headache days were fewer in all classes compared to placebo, and this was statistically significant for all but one class: alpha-blockers -0.7 (95% CI: -1.2, -0.1), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors -1.3 (95% CI: -2.9, 0.2), angiotensin II receptor blockers -0.9 (-1.6, -0.1), beta-blocker -0.4 (-0.8, -0.0) and calcium channel blockers -1.8 (-3.4, -0.2). Standardised mean difference was significantly reduced for all drug classes and was separately significant for numerous specific drugs: clonidine, candesartan, atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol, nicardipine and verapamil.

Conclusion

Among people with episodic migraine, a broader number of blood pressure-lowering medication classes and drugs reduce headache frequency than those currently included in treatment guidelines. Trial Registration: The study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017079176).

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^ccc4970a]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist indicated for migraine prevention. Its analgesic effect has been attributed to inhibition of central pain processing in the trigeminal pathway and blockade of peripheral nociception. In addition, propranolol reduces nociception through interaction with the cardiovascular system via reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, and through indirect parasympathomimetic effect via increase in HRV. The noradrenergic pathways are significant in both cardiovascular regulation and pain transmission and serve as the basis for the extensive interaction between these two systems. These interactions can be modulated by changes in baroreflex sensitivity, impairment in descending noradrenergic pain inhibitory pathways, and/or activation of pain facilitatory pathways.

In our recent RCT entitled "Study of Orofacial Pain and PropRANOlol" (SOPPRANO), we demonstrated the efficacy of propranolol in achieving ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% reduction in TMD pain. However, potential variation in drug efficacy between migraineurs and non-migraineurs was not assessed, and the mechanisms that may mediate the effect of propranolol on TMD pain were not evaluated.

The current study evaluates two exploratory aims of the SOPPRANO trial: i) whether the efficacy of propranolol for TMD pain is greater in participants with comorbid migraine compared with those without migraine; ii) whether the efficacy of propranolol for TMD pain was mediated by the reduction in headache impact or the change in heart rate secondary to propranolol use.

### Comparative effects of traditional Chinese and Western migraine medicines in an animal model of nociceptive trigeminovascular activation [^5540b526]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers, including propranolol, are established migraine preventives used clinically, although their mechanism of action is unclear. Chronic administration of propranolol at 20 mg/kg per day in rats is able to reduce the frequency of cortical spreading depression, which is considered to be the experimental correlate of migraine aura. It has also been shown that propranolol inhibits dural nociceptive trigeminothalamic neurons, when applied directly into ventroposteromedial thalamic (VPM) nucleus using microiontophoresis, suggesting a potential central locus of action. Our data demonstrate that propranolol (3 mg/kg) had no effect on ongoing spontaneous firing, but effectively inhibited nociceptive dural-evoked neuronal firing in the trigeminocervical complex after 60 minutes. The data act as a useful positive control.

Levetiracetam is a pyrrolidone derivative with a distinctive anti-epileptic pharmacologic profile. It is thought to exert its effects on the synaptic vesicle protein (SV2A) brain binding site, which differs from the targets of other anti-epileptic drugs. The migraine data are conflicting. One study of chronic daily headache failed on its primary endpoint, while another in migraine has been reported to be positive against placebo. Our data suggest this medicine would not be effective, and this is in line with the author's (PJG) clinical experience. If unpublished data exists, its public availability would help better understand this question.

In summary, our data demonstrate effects of two traditional Chinese medicine treatments of migraine: gastrodin and ligustrazine. The agents performed well against propranolol and better than levetiracetam, so that we see a possible role for these agents at least in migraine prevention. The model of dural nociceptive trigeminovascular activation is likely to activate a pathway that predicts migraine effects not limited to acute or preventive strategies, and recent data with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists demonstrates anti-migraine compounds can have both effects. Western medicine has much to learn from traditional Chinese approaches and exploring mechanisms of treatments from that tradition, and dissecting out the role of the components of traditional Chinese therapies may yield insights to progress in the development of new treatments for migraine.

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^07654eb0]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

TMD patients should be evaluated for the presence of comorbid migraine.
In patients with myofascial TMD, the presence of comorbid migraine is associated with greater efficacy of propranolol in reducing TMD pain.
The efficacy of propranolol in reducing TMD pain is not mediated by decreased headache impact, but by propranolol's effect on heart rate.

Starting preventive treatment — clinician directives specify that clinicians should inform patients and caregivers that in clinical trials of preventive treatments for pediatric migraine, many children and adolescents who received placebo improved and the majority of preventive medications were not superior to placebo (Level B). Acknowledging the limitations of currently available evidence, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the use of short-term treatment trials (a minimum of 2 months) for those who could benefit from preventive treatment (Level B). Clinicians should discuss the evidence for amitriptyline combined with CBT for migraine prevention, inform patients of the potential side effects of amitriptyline including risk of suicide, and work with families to identify providers who can offer this type of treatment12 (Level B). Clinicians should discuss the evidence for topiramate for migraine prevention in children and adolescents and its side effects in this population (Level B), and clinicians should discuss the evidence for propranolol for migraine prevention in children and adolescents (Level B).

### The cycle of migraine: patients' quality of life during and between migraine attacks [^ddfd989d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite advances in therapy, the prevalence of migraine has remained constant over the past 17 years. The current diagnostic procedure for migraine does not take into account the entire cycle of migraine, which includes both the pain of the acute attack and the worry between attacks.

Objectives

This review discusses the effects of migraine on health-related quality of life. The focus is on the impact of migraine between attacks and more successful clinical management of the complete cycle of migraine in both the neurology and primary care settings.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE (January 1997-January 2007) was conducted to determine the impact of migraine on quality of life and the need for and use of migraine preventive treatment. The search terms were migraine prevention, migraine prophylaxis, bead-ache and quality of life, migraine disability, and head-ache disability. The inclusion of specific studies was based on subjective, comparative evaluation and standard levels of evidence. Older publications were included to provide a historical perspective.

Results

Worry in expectation of the next migraine attack can have negative effects on the family and social lives and work productivity of patients with migraine. The benefits of preventive pharmacotherapy for migraine may be measured over time in terms of changes in the frequency of acute attacks, impact of acute treatment on headache recurrence within the next 24 hours, and reduction in overall functional impairment. Optimizing the acute treatment outcome and reducing the frequency of episodes may help alleviate the cycle of migraine. The clinical assessment of migraine should include multiple dimensions. Several questionnaires, such as the Migraine Disability Assessment and the 6-item Headache Impact Test, have been developed to help clinicians assess the dimensions of migraine. These questionnaires should be used in conjunction with open communication techniques that elicit any underlying worry associated with migraines. Preventive therapies that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include the neurostabilizers divalproex sodium and topiramate, and the beta-blockers timolol and propranolol. Despite not being approved for this indication, the antidepressant amitriptyline has shown levels of evidence of efficacy in preventing migraine in controlled trials similar to those for the approved medications.

Conclusion

The assessment of whether patients with migraine may benefit from preventive therapy should include the use of open communication techniques to uncover possible impairment between attacks.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — Recommendation 3: ACP suggests clinicians use monotherapy with the antiseizure medication topiramate to prevent episodic migraine headache in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings who do not tolerate or inadequately respond to a first trial or trials of a beta-adrenergic blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), the antiseizure medication valproate, the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, or the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline.

### A comparative study of candesartan versus propranolol for migraine prophylaxis: a randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, double cross-over study [^62bf120d]. Cephalalgia (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to see whether the effect of candesartan for migraine prevention, shown in one previous study, could be confirmed in a new study, and if so, whether the effect was comparable to that of propranolol (non-inferiority analysis), and whether adverse events were different.

Methods

In a randomised, triple-blind, double cross-over study, 72 adult patients with episodic or chronic migraine went through three 12-week treatment periods on either candesartan 16 mg, propranolol slow-release 160 mg, or placebo. The main outcome measures were days with migraine headache per four weeks (primary outcome), days with headache, hours with headache, proportion of responders (> 50% reduction of migraine days from baseline), and adverse events.

Results

In the modified intention-to treat-analysis, candesartan and propranolol were both superior to placebo: 2.95 (95% confidence interval: 2.35–3.55%) and 2.91 (2.36–3.45%), versus 3.53 (2.98–4.08%) for migraine days per month (p = 0.02 for both comparisons, Wilcoxon's paired signed rank test, blinded statistical analysis). Candesartan was non-inferior to propranolol (and vice versa). The proportion of responders was significantly higher on candesartan (43%) and propranolol (40%) than on placebo (23%) (p = 0.025 and < 0.050, respectively). There were more adverse events on candesartan (n = 133%) and propranolol (n = 143%) than on placebo (n = 90%), and the adverse event profiles of the active substances differed somewhat.

Conclusion

It is confirmed that candesartan 16 mg is effective for migraine prevention, with an effect size similar to propranolol 160 mg, and with somewhat different adverse events.

### New players in the preventive treatment of migraine [^9ed8f0fd]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The main goals of migraine preventive treatment include: reducing headache frequency, severity and intensity; restoring function; and preventing progression to chronic migraine. There is evidence that valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol and flunarizine are effective for episodic migraine prevention and should be offered to appropriate migraineurs to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity (level A medications). Frovatriptan (primarily indicated and usually used for acute care of migraine) is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine (level A), while lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention and should not be used (level A). Although commonly used in clinical practice, amitriptyline does not carry adequate evidence for migraine prevention (only class II studies). For prevention of chronic migraine (with and without medication overuse) only one treatment is approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that is onabotulinumtoxinA. Topiramate studies do show efficacy but there is no approval for this condition. Additionally, a variety of behavioral medicine treatments, such as biofeedback training and cognitive restructuring, are available for these patients.

### Randomised clinical trial comparing melatonin 3 mg, amitriptyline 25 mg and placebo for migraine prevention [^ef808468]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a chronic debilitating neurological condition affecting 12–20% of the population worldwide. Preventive treatments are available, decreasing the number and severity of headache attacks, and improving health outcomes and quality of life; half of the patients show 50% reduction in attack frequency. Although migraine prophylaxis guidelines from North American, South American and European societies are available, only 3–5% of patients receive adequate preventive therapy.

Public surveys report that migraineurs are among the most dissatisfied patients. About half of the patients with migraine stop seeking care for their headaches, partly because of their side effect profile. Most guidelines recommend topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence. Newer effective and tolerable options for migraine prophylaxis are necessary to reduce this gap and improve patients' quality of life.

Melatonin use in migraine prevention is supported by several biological effects. Melatonin levels are decreased in patients with migraine; it has been studied for migraine prophylaxis with conflicting results. We aimed to study the effect of melatonin in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with an active comparator.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: a position statement of the international headache society [^47f8b729]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparators

The developers of new health technologies typically conduct randomized trials to demonstrate efficacy using placebo as a control. For HTAs in migraine, it is recommended that new technologies be compared with an established treatment in the specific patient population of interest. If head-to-head trials comparing relevant interventions are not available at the time of assessment, HTAs should employ indirect or mixed-treatment comparisons (e.g. network meta-analyses) to estimate relative effectiveness, provided that the trials being analysed have comparable treatment periods, endpoints, assessments, and populations. Whenever required, statistical adjustments for potential confounders of treatment effects should be included. The HTA process should be fully inclusive of relevant stakeholders, particularly patients and/or patient groups (including public hearings by the HTA authorities)

Acute treatment

Appropriate comparators for technologies intended for the acute treatment of migraine include the oral tablet formulations of sumatriptan 50 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, rizatriptan 10 mg, or eletriptan 40 mg and 80 mg. For new technologies intended for patients who do not respond to triptans, do not tolerate them, or have cardiovascular contraindications that preclude their use, appropriate comparators include a different class of medications (e.g. NSAIDs), usual care, or placebo. With usual care as the comparator, real-world data on headache patterns and treatments are required, and patients who have a history of failure with currently available treatments should be analysed. The main challenge with using placebo as a control is that results may lack external validity; placebo is not given as a treatment for migraine in clinical practice.

Preventive treatment

Comparators that may be used for efficacy trials technologies intended for the preventive treatment of migraine include propranolol 80 mg to 160 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg, flunarizine 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, amitriptyline 25 mg to 50 mg, and mAbs against CGRP or the CGRP receptor (e.g. monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg). For populations that include patients with chronic migraine, appropriate comparators include onabotulinumtoxinA 155 IU to 195 IU; topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg; monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg; and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg.

### Drugs for preventing migraine headaches in children [^427261d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It has been estimated that about ten per cent of children between six and 20 years of age suffer from migraine. It is estimated that children with migraine lose one and a half weeks more schooling per year than their peers. Prophylactic drugs can be prescribed when children suffer from frequent or disabling headaches.

Objectives

We aimed to describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological agents taken on a regular basis to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks and/or reduce the intensity of such attacks in children with migraine.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched from 1966 through 2002. Additional strategies for identifying trials included searching the reference lists of review articles and included studies and searching books related to headache.

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of self- or parent-administered drug treatments in children (under 18 years of age) who had received a diagnosis of migraine were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators extracted, assessed, and coded separately all data for each study, using a form that was designed specifically for the review. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Headache frequency standardised over 28 days was used as the primary outcome measure. Headache intensity, headache duration, amount of symptomatic treatment used, and headache indices were used as secondary outcome measures. Data were extracted from both parallel-group and crossover trials. Continuous and dichotomous data were used to calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs), respectively. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) and numbers-needed-to-harm (NNHs) were also calculated.

Main Results

Thirty-eight studies were selected. Eighteen were excluded. Eleven preventive drugs were compared with placebo in a total of 15 studies. Drug-drug comparisons were made in just six studies. For only four drugs (L-5-hydroxytryptophan [L-5HTP], flunarizine, clonidine, and propranolol) were two or more studies selected. For only six drugs (trazodone, L-5HTP, propranolol, flunarizine, papaverine, and nimodipine) were data reported for effect on frequency. For no individual drug were comparable data reported in more than one study, thus meta-analysis was not possible. Two placebo-controlled studies showed a beneficial effect on the primary outcome measure, headache frequency. They were for the drugs propranolol and flunarizine. The propranolol study reported a dichotomous outcome (proportion of children responding), and it was possible to calculate a number-needed-to-treat to produce a two-thirds reduction in headache frequency (NNT = 1.5, 95%CI 1.15 to 2.1). The flunarizine study produced a SMD of 1.51 (95% confidence interval, -2.21 to -0.82), which was statistically significant in favour of flunarizine (p < 0.001). Nimodipine, timolol, papaverine, pizotifen, trazodone, L-5HTP, clonidine, metoclopramide, and domperidone showed no efficacy in reduction of frequency of attacks. The available studies on cyproheptadine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, metoprolol, and piracetam were excluded for various reasons.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Only one study each for propranolol and flunarizine were identified showing efficacy of these drugs as prophylactics of paediatric migraine. Nimodipine, timolol, papaverine, pizotifen, trazodone, L-5HTP, clonidine, metoclopramide, and domperidone showed no efficacy in reduction of frequency of attacks. Available studies on other commonly used drugs failed to meet our inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence available for the use of drug prophylaxis in paediatric migraine was poor. Studies were generally small, with no planning of sample size, so that for many drugs, despite the negative findings of this review, we do not have conclusive evidence of 'no effect'. There is a clear and urgent need for methodologically sound RCTs for the use of pings of this review, we do not have conclusive evidence of 'no effect'. There is a clear and urgent need for methodologically sound RCTs for the use of prophylactic drugs in paediatric migraine, starting with propranolol. These studies need to be adequately powered to investigate meaningful reductions in pain and suffering from a patient's perspective.

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^9b7cad7a]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparison with previously published studies and potential biological mechanisms of propranolol efficacy

Migraine prevalence of 52% in our cohort with myofascial TMD was comparable with prevalence of 56% and 55% reported in other studies. In SOPPRANO, migraine comorbidity was associated with greater severity and disability of TMD pain, similar to what was previously reported. While there is no precedent for our finding of greater efficacy of propranolol in reducing TMD pain among migraineurs compared to non-migraineurs, greater TMD severity in migraineurs could be a consequence of a central sensitivity syndrome characterized by augmented mechanisms of central sensitization in patients with multiple painful comorbidities. Since propranolol can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and block chronic sensitization of descending pain pathways to the trigeminocervical complex, its greater efficacy among TMD patients with comorbid migraine could be due to propranolol's targeting of abnormal central pain processing.

Interestingly, propranolol's efficacy for TMD pain was independent of its effect on headache impact. As only one third of the study migraineurs met criteria for chronic migraine, perhaps the correlation between relief of TMD pain and headache would have been stronger in the group consisting entirely of patients with chronic migraine. However, our study does not provide statistical power for this analysis. Instead, in our study, propranolol's efficacy was likely mediated by a reduction in heart rate. Propranolol decreases heart rate while increasing HRV and these effects on the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system may explain the mechanism of pain reduction. In a recent RCT investigating the effect of propranolol on HRV and experimental pain, propranolol increased HRV but did not affect pressure pain sensitivity or other mechanistic pain biomarkers. However, the study was conducted in healthy males, and the lack of antinociceptive effect on pain biomarkers may be due to the absence of abnormal pain processing in healthy volunteers and the use of a low single dose of the drug. HRV, which is inversely related to heart rate, was not measured in our study. A recent study concluded that correlation between a change in HRV and altered morbidity can be attributed to the concurrent change in heart rate. The mediating effect of heart rate observed in our study suggests that propranolol relieves TMD pain by restoring autonomic dysfunction which, in turn, dampens pain amplification.

### Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis [^caf137fe]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

About 14% of adults in the UK have migraines. Drugs used in migraine prophylaxis include beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol), 5HT antagonists (e.g. pizotifen), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), antiepileptics (e.g. sodium valproate) and NSAIDs. The antiepileptic topiramate (Topamax-Janssen-Cilag) is licensed for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in patients aged over 16 years. Here we discuss the place of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^c9fe327d]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The aim of our study was to explore the role of lamotrigine for the prevention of episodic migraine with aura. For this purpose, we decided to compare lamotrigine to topiramate, an antiepileptic drug established to be highly effective for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. Pooled data from three large multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated a clinically relevant response of monthly migraine frequency in patients treated with topiramate compared with placebo and led to topiramate approval as first-line drug for migraine prophylaxis. Further studies confirmed a similar efficacy of topiramate compared with other first-line prophylactic drugs such as propranolol and valproate. Real-world experience with topiramate proved its efficacy in reducing migraine frequency, improving patient quality of life and social functioning as well as reducing healthcare resources allocation to headache, making topiramate one of the most used migraine preventive drug in clinical practice nowadays. Moreover, due to its mechanism of action, topiramate is also believed to affect migraine aura initiation. In an experimental model of CSD, topiramate showed to inhibit the propagation of induced CSD in a dose-dependent manner. However, its clinical efficacy in preventing migraine aura is not clear. In an open longitudinal, pilot study involving patients affected by migraine with aura, topiramate failed to reduce aura frequency and duration at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, a posthoc analysis of the PROMPT trial, a well-designed study consisting of an open label phase in which patients were treated with topiramate for 26 weeks, followed by a double-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive placebo or continue to receive topiramate, showed a significant reduction in migraine aura frequency at the end of the open label phase which was maintained throughout the double-blind phase. However, no significant change in number of auras between topiramate and placebo were found at the end of the follow-up period.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^81518077]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, more specifically with respect to migraine prophylaxis, anticonvulsants, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering monotherapy with topiramate for the prevention of episodic migraine in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings not tolerating or inadequately responding to a first trial or trials of a β-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline and a further trial with a CGRP antagonist (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP monoclonal antibody (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab).

### Preventive pharmacologic treatments for episodic migraine in adults [^b0a148ac]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Systematic review of preventive pharmacologic treatments for community-dwelling adults with episodic migraine.

Data Sources

Electronic databases through May 20, 2012.

Eligibility Criteria

English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive drugs compared to placebo or active treatments examining rates of ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency or improvement in quality of life.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

We assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence and conducted random effects meta-analyses of absolute risk differences and Bayesian network meta-analysis.

Results

Of 5,244 retrieved references, 215 publications of RCTs provided mostly low-strength evidence because of the risk of bias and imprecision. RCTs examined 59 drugs from 14 drug classes. All approved drugs, including topiramate (9 RCTs), divalproex (3 RCTs), timolol (3 RCTs), and propranolol (4 RCTs); off-label beta blockers metoprolol (4 RCTs), atenolol (1 RCT), nadolol (1 RCT), and acebutolol (1 RCT); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril (1 RCT) and lisinopril (1 RCT); and angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan (1 RCT), outperformed placebo in reducing monthly migraine frequency by ≥ 50% in 200–400 patients per 1,000 treated. Adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation (68 RCTs) were greater with topiramate, off-label antiepileptics, and antidepressants than with placebo. Limited direct evidence as well as frequentist and exploratory network Bayesian meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences in benefits between approved drugs. Off-label angiotensin-inhibiting drugs and beta-blockers were most effective and tolerable for episodic migraine prevention.

Limitations

We did not quantify reporting bias or contact principal investigators regarding unpublished trials.

Conclusions

Approved drugs prevented episodic migraine frequency by ≥ 50% with no statistically significant difference between them. Exploratory network meta-analysis suggested that off-label angiotensin-inhibiting drugs and beta-blockers had favorable benefit-to-harm ratios. Evidence is lacking for long-term effects of drug treatments (i.e., trials of more than 3 months duration), especially for quality of life.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^6a767900]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Acute treatment

One hundred and twelve (48%) of the 232 randomised participants were using a triptan for acute treatment before the run-in of optimised acute treatment. However, study neurologists judged previous acute treatment to be suboptimal for all 232 participants.

Triptan use (doses per migraine) did not differ across the four treatment groups, either during the run-in period or at any point in the trial (P > 0.05). All 232 subsequently randomised participants had been treated with a triptan during the run-in of optimised acute treatment, using a mean of 1.2 (SD 0.9) doses per migraine. In month 5, 157/168 (93%) participants both had a migraine and treated it with a triptan, using a mean of 1.8 (SD 1.1) doses per migraine; in month 10, 124/133 (93%) participants both had a migraine and treated it with a triptan, using a mean of 1.8 (1.1) doses per migraine; finally, in month 16, 89/96 (93%) participants both had a migraine and treated it with a triptan, using a mean of 1.9 (1.1) doses per migraine.

Preventive treatment

At month 5, after dose adjustment, 72/90 (80%) participants in the active drug groups were taking long acting propranolol hydrochloride (7 at 60 mg, 18 at 120 mg, 47 at 180 mg) and 18 were taking nadolol (10 at 40 mg, 8 at 80 mg). At month 10, 61/76 (80%) participants were taking long acting propranolol hydrochloride (6 at 60 mg, 16 at 120 mg, 39 at 120 mg, 1 at 180 mg) and 15 were taking nadolol (7 at 40 mg, 6 at 80 mg, 2 at 120 mg). At month 16, 52/60 (87%) participants were taking long acting propranolol hydrochloride (5 at 60 mg, 14 at 120 mg, 33 at 120 mg) and eight were taking nadolol (5 at 40 mg, 2 at 80 mg, 1 at 120 mg).

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^a54f1bf5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in migraine report efficacy signals for candesartan and telmisartan. In a parallel-design RCT, patients (n = 60) with migraine with or without aura who experienced 2–6 migraine days per month had a statistically lower mean number of headache days with candesartan versus placebo (13.6 versus 18.5 days; p = 0.001), and the mean reduction in monthly migraine days was lower among those receiving candesartan compared with placebo (12.6 versus 9.0 days; p < 0.001); adverse events were similar in the two treatment periods. In a crossover RCT of adults (n = 72) with episodic (n = 71) or chronic migraine (n = 1) randomized to candesartan (16 mg), slow-release propranolol (160 mg), or placebo across three 12-week periods, a statistically significant reduction of migraine days was found in both the candesartan (0.58) and propranolol (0.62) groups, compared with placebo. Diener et al. reported telmisartan improved migraine days versus placebo (1.65 versus 1.15; p = 0.03) over a 12-week treatment period, and the rate of AEs was similar between groups.

### Combined therapy for migraine prevention? Clinical experience with a β-blocker plus sodium valproate in 52 resistant migraine patients [^0a258bfa]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

The aim was to explore whether combining a beta-blocker and sodium valproate could lead to an advantage in efficacy in patients with migraine previously resistant to the two medications in monotherapy. Fifty-two patients (43 women) with a history of episodic migraine with or without aura, and previously unresponsive to beta-blockers and sodium valproate in monotherapy, were treated with a combination of propranolol or nadolol and sodium valproate in an open-label fashion. Eight patients (15%) discontinued due to adverse events. Fifteen (29%) did not respond. The remaining 29 cases (56%) showed response (> 50% reduction in migraine days). The response was excellent in nine (17%). From this open trial, combination therapy with a beta-blocker and sodium valproate appears to be a good migraine preventative in some previously resistant migraine cases. Controlled trials are now necessary to determine the true advantage in efficacy of this combination in difficult to treat migraineurs.

### Safety of rimegepant in patients using preventive migraine medications: a subgroup analysis of a long-term, open-label study conducted in the United States [^5700670c]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Preventive medications have included propranolol, timolol, divalproex sodium, topiramate, beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and botulinum toxin. These medications, however, can be associated with significant adverse events and/or increased rates of treatment discontinuation. A key role for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been established in the pathophysiology of migraine. As a result, several migraine therapies have been recently developed that target CGRP or its receptor. These therapies have demonstrated improved safety profiles over older migraine treatments.

Rimegepant is an oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist indicated in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and other regions for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura and for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. Currently, rimegepant is the only migraine medication approved for both acute and preventive treatment. The efficacy and safety of a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg for the acute treatment of migraine has been established in three previous randomized placebo-controlled trials in the United States. In these three US-based studies, approximately 15% (n = 547) of treated participants (rimegepant or placebo; n = 3507) used concomitant preventive medications. The repeated, long-term use of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine has also been assessed in an open-label safety study (NCT03266588). However, the long-term safety of rimegepant in patients taking concomitant preventive migraine medication has not been assessed. The purpose of this subgroup analysis was to assess long-term safety of rimegepant in adults receiving concomitant preventive migraine medication during study NCT03266588.

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^31a881f2]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This RCT of patients with chronic myofascial TMD demonstrated that efficacy of propranolol in reducing TMD pain was enhanced in the presence of comorbid migraine. Hence, propranolol appears to be the drug of choice for management of painful TMD in migraineurs. Interestingly, the causal mediation analysis suggested that the reduction in TMD pain was mediated more by reduction in heart rate rather than by reduction in headache impact.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^bd18ac83]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — Classification of migraine preventive therapies (available in the United States) lists Level A medications with established efficacy (≥ 2 Class I trials), including antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, topiramate), β-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol, timolol), and triptans for menstrually related migraine (MRM) (frovatriptanb; footnote b indicates use for short-term prophylaxis of MRM). Level B medications are probably effective (1 Class I or 2 Class II studies) with examples including amitriptyline and venlafaxine, β-blockers atenolola and nadolola, and triptans naratriptanb and zolmitriptanb. Level C medications are possibly effective (1 Class II study) such as lisinopril and candesartan.

### Episodic migraines in children: limited evidence on preventive pharmacological treatments [^e0e1a64e]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The authors conducted a systematic literature review of preventive pharmacological treatments for episodic childhood migraines searching several databases through May 20, 2012. Episodic migraine prevention was examined in 24 publications of randomized controlled trials that enrolled 1578 children in 16 nonrandomized studies. Single randomized controlled trials provided low-strength evidence that propranolol would result in complete cessation of migraine attacks in 713 per 1000 children treated (95% confidence interval, 452–974); trazodone and nimodipine decreased migraine days, while topiramate, divalproex, and clonidine were no more effective than placebo in preventing migraines. Migraine prevention with multidisciplinary drug management was not sustained at 6 months. Divalproex resulted in treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, and topiramate increased the risk of paresthesia, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss. Long-term preventive benefits and improvement in disability and quality of life are unknown. No studies examined quality of life or provided evidence for individualized treatment decisions.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^23faa4a3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, more specifically with respect to migraine prophylaxis, CGRP inhibitors, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP antibody (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab) for the prevention of episodic migraine in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings not tolerating or inadequately responding to a trial or trials of a β-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline.

### Propranolol treatment prevents chronic central sensitization induced by repeated dural stimulation [^53762292]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Migraine is currently conceptualized as a chronic disease with episodic manifestations. In some patients, migraine attack frequency increases, leading to chronic migraine. Daily preventive therapy is initiated to decrease attack frequency. Propranolol, a first-line medication for migraine prophylaxis, reduces attack frequency in nearly 50% of patients receiving it. However, the mechanisms of its antimigraine action are unclear. We examined the effect of daily propranolol treatment (10 mg·kg per os, 8 days) in a rat model of recurrent activation of dural nociceptors (repeated infusion of an inflammatory soup (IS) on the dura through a cannula every 2–3 days). Propranolol does not abort IS-induced acute cephalic mechanical allodynia but blocks the development of a chronic cutaneous hypersensitivity upon repeated IS injections. Furthermore, propranolol prevents (1) the elevated touch-evoked Fos expression within the trigeminocervical complex, (2) enhanced both spontaneous activity, and evoked responses of second-order trigeminovascular neurons, (3) elevated touch-evoked rostral ventromedial medulla and locus coeruleus Fos expression and (4) diffuse noxious inhibitory controls impairment, induced by repeated IS injections. Our results suggest that propranolol exerts its prophylactic action, at least in part, by blocking the chronic sensitization of descending controls of pain, arising from the rostral ventromedial medulla and locus coeruleus, and in turn preventing the maintenance of a state of facilitated trigeminovascular transmission within the trigeminocervical complex. Assessing changes in these brain areas has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms for migraine transformation and to reveal novel biological and molecular targets for specific migraine-preventive therapies.

Importance

Migraine is one of the most common neurologic disorders in children and adolescents. However, a quantitative comparison of multiple preventive pharmacologic treatments in the pediatric population is lacking.

Objective

To examine whether prophylactic pharmacologic treatments are more effective than placebo and whether there are differences between drugs regarding efficacy, safety, and acceptability.

Data Sources

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies in MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, and PsycINFO published through July 2, 2018.

Randomized clinical trials of prophylactic pharmacologic treatments in children and adolescents diagnosed as having episodic migraine were included. Abstract, title, and full-text screening were conducted independently by 4 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis network meta-analysis guidelines. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes, calculated as standardized mean differences for primary outcomes and risk ratios for discontinuation rates, were assessed in a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were efficacy (ie, migraine frequency, number of migraine days, number of headache days, headache frequency, or headache index), safety (ie, treatment discontinuation owing to adverse events), and acceptability (ie, treatment discontinuation for any reason).

Results

Twenty-three studies (2217 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Prophylactic pharmacologic treatments included antiepileptics, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, antihypertensive agents, and food supplements. In the short term (< 5 months), propranolol (standard mean difference, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.03–1.17) and topiramate (standard mean difference, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.03–1.15) were significantly more effective than placebo. However, the 95% prediction intervals for these medications contained the null effect. No significant long-term effects for migraine prophylaxis relative to placebo were found for any intervention.

Conclusions and Relevance

Prophylactic pharmacologic treatments have little evidence supporting efficacy in pediatric migraine. Future research could (1) identify factors associated with individual responses to pharmacologic prophylaxis, (2) analyze fluctuations of migraine attack frequency over time and determine the most clinically relevant length of probable prophylactic treatment, and (3) identify nonpharmacologic targets for migraine prophylaxis.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^a03a66ac]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to examine the separate and combined effects of preventive drug treatment and behavioural migraine management, as well as the first trial to determine if these treatments improve the outcomes obtained with an "optimised" acute treatment regimen. Only the combination of β blocker treatment and behavioural migraine management improved outcomes with optimised acute treatment. This combined treatment yielded larger improvements in number of migraines, number of days with migraine, and quality of life at both short term (month 10) and longer term (month 16) assessments than did the other three treatments. Preventive (β blocker) treatment combined with brief behavioural migraine management thus may be a promising method of improving outcomes in the management of frequent impairing episodic migraine.

In contrast to results obtained with combined treatment, neither β blocker alone nor behavioural migraine management alone improved on the outcomes of optimised acute treatment. However, neither β blocker alone nor behavioural migraine management alone were ineffective. The approximately 50% reductions in migraine episodes and in migraine days seen with β blocker and with behavioural migraine management in this trial compare favourably with the average reductions in migraines seen in previous trials of β blocker and of behavioural therapy. However, optimised acute treatment alone yielded improvements in migraines and quality of life of the same magnitude. As a result, we were unable to show that the addition of either β blocker alone or behavioural migraine management alone improved on the substantial improvements achieved with optimised acute treatment.

Migraine preventive pharmacotherapy — We suggest propranolol for the prevention of migraine. We suggest valproate for the prevention of episodic migraine. We suggest memantine for the prevention of episodic migraine. We suggest atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine. We suggest onabotulinumtoxinA injection for the prevention of chronic migraine. We suggest against abobotulinumtoxinA or onabotulinumtoxinA injection for the prevention of episodic migraine. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against rimegepant for the prevention of episodic migraine. We suggest against the use of gabapentin for the prevention of episodic migraine. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against levetiracetam for the prevention of episodic migraine.

### The effect of propranolol on glyceryltrinitrate-induced headache and arterial response [^d89676fd]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Prophylactic drug trials in migraine are long-lasting and expensive and require long-term toxicology information. A human migraine model would therefore be helpful in testing new drugs. Immediate headache and delayed migraine after glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) has been well characterized. We have recently shown that sodium valproate has prophylactic effect in the GTN model. Here we report our experience with propranolol in this model. Nineteen subjects with migraine without aura and 16 sex- and aged-matched healthy subjects were included in a two-centre randomized double-blind cross-over study. Fourteen migraine subjects and 14 healthy subjects completed the study and results from comparison of the 28 subjects are reported. Randomly propranolol 160 mg or placebo were each given daily for 14 days to both migraine and healthy subjects. A 20-min intravenous infusion of GTN 0.25 microg/kg per min was administered on a study day at the end of both pretreatment periods. Headache was registered for 12 h after GTN infusions. Its intensity was scored on a numerical verbal rating scale from 0 to 10. Fulfilment of International Headache Society (HIS) criteria was recorded for 24 h. Radial and superficial temporal artery diameters and blood velocity of both middle cerebral arteries were measured. All migraine subjects developed headache after GTN. No reduction of overall peak headache was found after propranolol (median 5, range 0–7) compared with placebo (median 5, range 0–10) (P = 0.441). Eight of the 14 completing migraine subject developed IHS 1.1 migraine after GTN, two subjects on both days, three subjects only after placebo, and three subjects only after propranolol. No reduction of GTN-induced migraine was found after propranolol compared with placebo (5 vs. 5, P = 1.000). All healthy subjects developed headache after GTN. No reduction of overall peak headache was found after propranolol (median 2, range 1–5) compared with placebo (median 1, range 1–7) (P = 0.315). Two subjects fulfilled IHS criteria 1.1 for migraine without aura after propranolol but not after placebo. The fulfilment was short lasting and did not require rescue medication. Headache after GTN was more pronounced in migraine subjects than in healthy subjects both with (P = 0.003) and without pretreatment with propranolol (P = 0.017). We found that 2 weeks of propranolol constricted the radial artery in healthy subjects but not in migraine subjects. GTN-induced vasodilatation abolished this difference. Mean maximum blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was higher in healthy subjects than in migraine patients (P = 0.003–0.033) and unaffected by propranolol. We observed no effect of propranolol on GTN-induced headache and migraine. This could indicate that GTN induces migraine at a deeper level of the pathophysiological cascade of migraine than the prophylactic effect of propranolol. Propranolol does not constrict cerebral arteries, which therefore cannot be part of its mechanism of action in migraine.

β blocker and placebo

In this double blind protocol, we attempted to maximise the efficacy and tolerability of β blocker treatment by using a flexible target dose, by treating participants who were unable to tolerate propranolol hydrochloride with nadolol, and by including a proven intervention to maximise adherence. Treatment was started with one capsule (60 mg long acting propranolol hydrochloride or matched placebo) and increased to three capsules (180 mg or matched placebo) at week 12 as tolerated. Participants who did not tolerate at least two capsules (120 mg) of long acting propranolol hydrochloride or matched placebo, and in the judgment of the treating neurologist (FJO, GEC) were unimproved, were switched with blindness maintained to the second drug — nadolol for participants who had been receiving propranolol hydrochloride or matched nadolol placebo for participants who had been receiving propranolol placebo. Participants initially received a single 40 mg capsule of nadolol or matched placebo. The dose was increased at the next visit to two capsules (80 mg) as tolerated. At week 12, the dose was stabilised at the highest tolerated level. In the evaluation phase, we permitted an increase to four capsules of long acting propranolol hydrochloride (240 mg) or matched placebo or three capsules of nadolol (120 mg) or matched placebo. We used instructional handouts and the three monthly phone contacts to identify and rectify problems with adherence (this constituted the adherence intervention).

### Treatment recommendations for migraine [^d64255bb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be acute or preventive. Acute treatment attempts to stop the progression of an attack or relieve pain and functional impairment once an attack has begun, whereas preventive therapy is given to reduce attack frequency and severity. Additional benefits of preventive therapy include improving responsiveness to acute attack treatment, and reducing disability. Treatment protocols should also include education and reassurance, avoidance of triggers, nonpharmacological treatments, and physical and/or complementary medicine when appropriate. The treatment plan should be reassessed at regular intervals. Acute attack medication can be specific or nonspecific, and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Backup and rescue medication should be available in case the initial treatment fails. The route of drug administration depends on attack severity, how rapidly the attack escalates, the patient's preference, the presence or absence of severe nausea or vomiting, and the need for rapid relief. Preventive migraine treatments include beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Preventive treatments are selected on the basis of the drugs' side-effect profiles and the patient's coexistent and comorbid conditions.

### Practice guideline update summary: pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^9e37e7d8]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention — abstract findings indicate updated evidence-based recommendations and key efficacy signals. Fifteen Class II–III studies on migraine prevention in children and adolescents met inclusion criteria. There is insufficient evidence to determine if children and adolescents receiving divalproex, onabotulinumtoxinA, amitriptyline, nimodipine, or flunarizine are more or less likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving propranolol are possibly more likely than those receiving placebo to have at least 50% reduction in headache frequency, and children and adolescents receiving topiramate and cinnarizine are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a decrease in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving amitriptyline plus cognitive behavioral therapy are more likely than those receiving amitriptyline plus headache education to have a reduction in headache frequency. The majority of randomized controlled trials studying the efficacy of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo, recommendations include counseling on lifestyle and behavioral factors that influence headache frequency and assessment and management of comorbid disorders associated with headache persistence, and clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients and caregivers regarding the use of preventive treatments for migraine, including discussion of the limitations in the evidence to support pharmacologic treatments.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^8052c14f]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine if the addition of preventive drug treatment (β blocker), brief behavioural migraine management, or their combination improves the outcome of optimised acute treatment in the management of frequent migraine.

Design Randomised placebo controlled trial over 16 months from July 2001 to November 2005.

Setting Two outpatient sites in Ohio, USA.

Participants 232 adults (mean age 38 years; 79% female) with diagnosis of migraine with or without aura according to International Headache Society classification of headache disorders criteria, who recorded at least three migraines with disability per 30 days (mean 5.5 migraines/30 days), during an optimised run-in of acute treatment.

Interventions Addition of one of four preventive treatments to optimised acute treatment: β blocker (n = 53), matched placebo (n = 55), behavioural migraine management plus placebo (n = 55), or behavioural migraine management plus β blocker (n = 69).

Main outcome measure The primary outcome was change in migraines/30 days; secondary outcomes included change in migraine days/30 days and change in migraine specific quality of life scores.

Results Mixed model analysis showed statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences in outcomes among the four added treatments for both the primary outcome (migraines/30 days) and the two secondary outcomes (change in migraine days/30 days and change in migraine specific quality of life scores). The addition of combined β blocker and behavioural migraine management (−3.3 migraines/30 days, 95% confidence interval −3.2 to −3.5), but not the addition of β blocker alone (−2.1 migraines/30 days, −1.9 to −2.2) or behavioural migraine management alone (−2.2 migraines migraines/30 days, −2.0 to −2.4), improved outcomes compared with optimised acute treatment alone (−2.1 migraines/30 days, −1.9 to −2.2). For a clinically significant (≥ 50% reduction) in migraines/30 days, the number needed to treat for optimised acute treatment plus combined β blocker and behavioural migraine management was 3.1 compared with optimised acute treatment alone, 2.6 compared with optimised acute treatment plus β blocker, and 3.1 compared with optimised acute treatment plus behavioural migraine management. Results were consistent for the two secondary outcomes, and at both month 10 (the primary endpoint) and month 16.

Conclusion The addition of combined β blocker plus behavioural migraine management, but not the addition of β blocker alone or behavioural migraine management alone, improved outcomes of optimised acute treatment. Combined β blocker treatment and behavioural migraine management may improve outcomes in the treatment of frequent migraine.

### Anticonvulsant drugs for migraine prophylaxis [^79a46b2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Anticonvulsant drugs seem to be useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by a variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system that are probably relevant to the pathophysiology of migraine.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of anticonvulsants for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with migraine.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (from 1966 on) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Date of most recent search: April 2003. Additional information was gained from hand-searching specialist headache journals; correspondence with pharmaceutical companies, authors of reports, and experts in the field; and a wide variety of review articles and book chapters.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of self-administered drug treatments taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks and/or to reduce the intensity of those attacks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were selected and data extracted by two independent reviewers. For migraine frequency data, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for individual studies and pooled across studies. For dichotomous data on significant reduction in migraine frequency, odds ratios (ORs) and numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were similarly calculated. Adverse events were analyzed by calculating numbers-needed-to-harm (NNHs) for studies using similar agents.

Main Results

Fifteen papers were included in the review. Of these, 14 reported trials comparing anticonvulsants with placebo, as follows: four trials of divalproex sodium, three trials of topiramate, two trials of sodium valproate, two trials of gabapentin, and one trial each of carbamazepine, clonazepam, and lamotrigine. One paper reported a trial of sodium valproate versus an active comparator, flunarizine, and one trial of divalproex sodium versus placebo included a comparison against propranolol, also an active comparator. Data from 2024 patients were considered. Analysis of data from eight trials (n = 841) demonstrates that anticonvulsants, considered as a class, reduce migraine frequency by about 1.4 attacks per 28 days as compared to placebo (SMD -0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.93 to -0.26). Data from 10 trials (n = 1341) show that anticonvulsants, considered as a class, also more than double the number of patients for whom migraine frequency is reduced by 50% or more, relative to placebo (OR 3.90; 95% CI 2.61 to 5.82; NNT 3.8; 95% CI 3.2 to 4.6). For seven trials of sodium valproate and divalproex sodium, NNHs for five clinically important adverse events ranged from 6.6 to 16.3. For the three trials of topiramate, NNHs for eight adverse events (100-mg dose) ranged from 2.4 to 32.9.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Anticonvulsants appear to be both effective in reducing migraine frequency and reasonably well tolerated. There is noticeable variation among individual agents, but there are insufficient data to know whether this is due to chance or variation in true efficacy. Neither clonazepam nor lamotrigine was superior to placebo (one trial each). Relatively few robust trials are available for agents other than sodium valproate/divalproex sodium. Two recently published and large trials of topiramate demonstrated reasonable efficacy, and one further trial of this agent is anticipated in the near future.

Possible role for the Cefaly device

Acute treatment of episodic migraine

There is no well-controlled evidence for using the Cefaly device in the acute treatment of episodic migraine. A single pilot study of 10 patients using the device for acute migraine treatment showed no effect on 57% of treated attacks and was associated with pain freedom in only 13% of attacks.

Preventative treatment of episodic migraine

Evidence for the use of the Cefaly device in preventing episodic migraine comes from one small, manufacturer-sponsored sham-controlled trial, the PREvention of MIgraine using the STS Cefaly (the PREMICE study) and company postmarketing survey data. The sham-controlled study involved only 67 subjects with episodic migraine, who after a one month run-in period of normal treatment used the Cefaly or sham device for 3 months and reported a significant reduction in migraine days by 29.7% from 6.94 to 4.88 days (p = 0.023) in the active group compared to a non-significant change of 4.9% from 6.54 to 6.22 days (p = 0.608) in the sham group. For comparison, topiramate 100 mg daily decreased migraine days by 44% in a pooled analysis of controlled studies. The therapeutic gain for the 50% responder rate of supraorbital nerve stimulation was 26.1% compared with 23.5% for topiramate but the therapeutic gain in migraine day reduction is much higher in pooled studies of topiramate at 24.5% compared with the PREMICE trial at 12%. The responder rate shown in the PREMICE study was within the range quoted for other migraine preventatives such as propranolol and antiepileptic medications. The postmarketing survey of 2313 subjects using the device to prevent episodic migraine reported 53% of users were 'satisfied' with the treatment, as determined by the number continuing treatment after a 40-day trial period. In the PREMICE trial, 70.6% declared themselves satisfied after 3 months of treatment. In contrast, using stopping of treatment as a measure of patient satisfaction, one American health insurance survey of migraine preventatives found that 26.6% of patients on antidepressants, 29.8% on antiepileptic medications and 32.4% on beta-blockers were satisfied and remained on treatment after 6 months.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^54f1eab0]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine if the addition of preventive drug treatment (β blocker), brief behavioural migraine management, or their combination improves the outcome of optimised acute treatment in the management of frequent migraine.

Design

Randomised placebo controlled trial over 16 months from July 2001 to November 2005.

Setting

Two outpatient sites in Ohio, USA.

Participants

232 adults (mean age 38 years; 79% female) with diagnosis of migraine with or without aura according to International Headache Society classification of headache disorders criteria, who recorded at least three migraines with disability per 30 days (mean 5.5 migraines/30 days), during an optimised run-in of acute treatment.

Interventions

Addition of one of four preventive treatments to optimised acute treatment: β blocker (n = 53), matched placebo (n = 55), behavioural migraine management plus placebo (n = 55), or behavioural migraine management plus β blocker (n = 69).

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome was change in migraines/30 days; secondary outcomes included change in migraine days/30 days and change in migraine specific quality of life scores.

Results

Mixed model analysis showed statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences in outcomes among the four added treatments for both the primary outcome (migraines/30 days) and the two secondary outcomes (change in migraine days/30 days and change in migraine specific quality of life scores). The addition of combined β blocker and behavioural migraine management (-3.3 migraines/30 days, 95% confidence interval -3.2 to -3.5), but not the addition of β blocker alone (-2.1 migraines/30 days, -1.9 to -2.2) or behavioural migraine management alone (-2.2 migraines migraines/30 days, -2.0 to -2.4), improved outcomes compared with optimised acute treatment alone (-2.1 migraines/30 days, -1.9 to -2.2). For a clinically significant (≥ 50% reduction) in migraines/30 days, the number needed to treat for optimised acute treatment plus combined β blocker and behavioural migraine management was 3.1 compared with optimised acute treatment alone, 2.6 compared with optimised acute treatment plus β blocker, and 3.1 compared with optimised acute treatment plus behavioural migraine management. Results were consistent for the two secondary outcomes, and at both month 10 (the primary endpoint) and month 16.

Conclusion

The addition of combined β blocker plus behavioural migraine management, but not the addition of β blocker alone or behavioural migraine management alone, improved outcomes of optimised acute treatment. Combined β blocker treatment and behavioural migraine management may improve outcomes in the treatment of frequent migraine.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cb80d0a5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this clinical guideline for clinicians caring for adults with episodic migraine headache (defined as 1 to 14 headache days per month) in outpatient settings.

Methods

ACP based these recommendations on systematic reviews of the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments to prevent episodic migraine, patients' values and preferences, and economic evidence. ACP evaluated the comparative effectiveness of the following interventions: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril), angiotensin II-receptor blockers (candesartan and telmisartan), antiseizure medications (valproate and topiramate), β-blockers (metoprolol and propranolol), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist-gepants (atogepant or rimegepant), CGRP monoclonal antibodies (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine and venlafaxine), and a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline). ACP used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to analyze the effects of pharmacologic treatment on the following outcomes: migraine frequency and duration, number of days medication was taken for acute treatment of migraine, frequency of migraine-related emergency department visits, migraine-related disability, quality of life and physical functioning, and discontinuations due to adverse events. In addition, adverse events were captured through U.S. Food and Drug Administration medication labels and eligible studies.

Recommendations

In this guideline, ACP makes recommendations for clinicians to initiate monotherapy for episodic migraine prevention in nonpregnant adults in the outpatient setting as well as alternative approaches if initial treatments are not tolerated or result in an inadequate response. All 3 ACP recommendations have conditional strength and low-certainty evidence. Clinical considerations provide additional context for physicians and other clinicians.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal) [^5f119175]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Migraine

In a 34-week, placebo-controlled, 4-period, dose-finding crossover study with a double-blind randomized treatment sequence, 62 patients with migraine received propranolol 20 to 80 mg 3 or 4 times daily. The headache unit index, a composite of the number of days with headache and the associated severity of the headache, was significantly reduced for patients receiving propranolol as compared to those on placebo.

Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis

In an uncontrolled series of 13 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 or 3 symptoms and hypertrophic subaortic stenosis diagnosed at cardiac catheterization, oral propranolol 40 to 80 mg t.i.d. was administered and patients were followed for up to 17 months. Propranolol was associated with improved NYHA class for most patients.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^003d734b]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Adverse effects

Of the 208 participants who completed the first dose adjustment session, at least one side effect was reported during the dose adjustment phase by 54/110 (49%) participants receiving β blocker and 40/98 (41%) receiving placebo (P = 0.23). After dose adjustment at month 5, side effects were reported by only 18/90 (20%) participants taking β blocker and 9/86 (10%) taking placebo (P = 0.08). The one side effect reported by 5% or more of participants was fatigue, reported by 9/90 (10%) participants taking β blocker and 5/86 (6%) taking placebo (P = 0.31). For the 214 participants who provided post-baseline data (fig 1), attrition attributed to the side effects of β blocker treatment was 7/110 (6%) participants assigned to β blocker compared with 5/93 (5%) assigned to placebo (P = 0.77) at month 5. Over the full 16 months of the trial, attrition attributed to side effects of β blocker treatment was 13/101 (13%) participants assigned to β blocker compared with 7/93 (8%) assigned to placebo (P = 0.25).

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^73b6e19d]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Neurology/American Headache Society recommendations — pharmacologic prevention of episodic migraine in adults: Level A, the following medications are established as effective and should be offered for migraine prevention, including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, and topiramate; β-Blockers metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol; and triptans frovatriptan for short-term MAMs prevention. Level B, the following medications are probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention, including antidepressants amitriptyline and venlafaxine; β-Blockers atenolol and nadolol; and triptans naratriptan and zolmitriptan for short-term MAMs prevention. Level C, the following medications are possibly effective and may be considered for migraine prevention, including ACE inhibitors lisinopril, angiotensin receptor blockers candesartan, α-Agonists clonidine and guanfacine, AEDs carbamazepine, and β-Blockers nebivolol and pindolol. Level U states that evidence is conflicting or inadequate to support or refute the use of AEDs gabapentin, antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, tricyclics protriptyline, antithrombotics acenocoumarol, Coumadin, and picotamide, β-Blockers bisoprolol, calcium-channel blockers nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, and verapamil, as well as acetazolamide and cyclandelate. Level A negative states that the following medication is established as ineffective and should not be offered for migraine prevention: lamotrigine.

### Weight change associated with the use of migraine-preventive medications [^f9f7c139]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Medications administered long term, such as those used for migraine prophylaxis, are often associated with weight change as a side effect. Such effects may compromise general health status, exacerbate coexisting medical conditions, and affect medication adherence. Weight gain should be of particular concern in patients with migraine, as there is evidence that overweight and obese patients with migraine are at risk for an increased frequency and severity of migraine attacks.

Objective

This article reviews weight-change data from recent clinical studies of migraine-preventive medications in children, adolescents, and adults with migraine.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted for English-language articles published between January 1970 and November 2007. Among the search terms were migraine prevention, migraine prophylaxis, migraine treatment, antidepressant drug, beta-adrenergic-receptor blockers, antiepileptic drug, anticonvulsant drug, weight gain, and weight loss. Studies that reported weight-change data (gain, loss, or neutral) were included. When available, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were selected for review. Open-label, retrospective or prospective trials may also have been included.

Results

Most of the migraine-preventive medications classified by the United States Headache Consortium as group 1 based on the high level of evidence for their efficacy — for instance, amitriptyline, propranolol, and divalproex sodium-have been associated with varying degrees of weight gain. The exceptions are timolol, which is weight neutral, and topiramate, which is associated with weight loss. Among the drugs that have been associated with weight gain, a higher incidence of weight gain was observed with amitriptyline and divalproex sodium than with propranolol.

Conclusion

Weight-change effects require careful consideration when selecting migraine-preventive medications, and weight should be monitored carefully over the course of any migraine treatment plan.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^c8ab091d]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The current NICE guideline suggests first trying either topiramate or a beta blocker. If both are ineffective or contraindicated, then consider acupuncture, gabapentin, botulinum toxin or riboflavin. Since the publication of this guideline, there is new evidence that gabapentin is not effective, so we no longer use this. The NICE guideline also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support using amitriptyline and pizotifen, due to lack of robust clinical trials in this area. In reality, the choice of preventative depends in part on NICE guidelines, but is also influenced by patient comorbidities; thus, we also consider other agents as outlined in table 3.

Table 3
Migraine preventatives: an overview

It is important to note that topiramate, flunarizine and beta blockers can exacerbate depression. Weight gain can be a concern with beta blockers, pizotifen, flunarizine, valproate and antidepressants. Beta blockers cannot be used in people with asthma (candesartan is a useful alternative with equivalent efficacy to propranolol). The tricyclic antidepressants, particularly amitriptyline, can be sedating though this can make it the drug of choice in people with sleeping difficulty. Topiramate can reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive pill. Also, many agents are potentially teratogenic and this should be mentioned to women of childbearing age.

The general rules of thumb are to start treatment at a low dose, gradually increasing to an initial target dose. If there is no effect and no significant side effects, the dose can be further increased for some drugs. We continue the medication for at least 3 months to evaluate efficacy. If effective (about a 50% improvement) the drug may be continued for 6 months, although there is some evidence of fewer rebound headaches if continued for 12 months.

There is very limited evidence to support the use of SNRIs in migraine.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^5b1cb44e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians clinical guideline — interventions and outcomes evaluated include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril), angiotensin II-receptor blockers (candesartan and telmisartan), antiseizure medications (valproate and topiramate), β-blockers (metoprolol and propranolol), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist gepants (atogepant or rimegepant), CGRP monoclonal antibodies (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine and venlafaxine), and a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline), with outcomes including migraine frequency and duration, number of days medication was taken for acute treatment of migraine, frequency of migraine-related emergency department visits, migraine-related disability, quality of life and physical functioning, discontinuations due to adverse events, and adverse events captured through U.S. Food and Drug Administration medication labels and eligible studies.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^fcf0450e]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

Mixed model analysis yielded significant effects for both time (P < 0.001) and the treatment by time interaction (at least P < 0.05) for each of the three outcome measures, indicating statistically significant differences in outcomes with the four treatments over time. At the primary end point of month 10, figures 2and 3and table 2show that each of the four treatments yielded clinically meaningful improvements in number of migraines and days with migraine. However, only the addition of combined β blocker and behavioural migraine management improved on the outcomes obtained with optimised acute treatment alone. Differences among the three remaining treatments were neither clinically meaningful in magnitude nor statistically significant. The longer term pattern of results at month 16 was identical.

*Differ significantly from other three treatments with Bonferroni adjustment (P < 0.0083).

The proportion of participants classified as clinically improved (≥ 50% reduction in migraines) at the primary end point (month 10) differed similarly across groups (P < 0.001). Optimised acute treatment plus β blocker and behavioural migraine management, with 53/69 (77%) participants clinically improved, differed from the remaining three treatments (P ≤ 0.001), whereas differences among the other three treatments were neither clinically meaningful nor statistically significant: 22/55 (40%) optimised acute treatment alone participants, 18/53 (34%) optimised acute treatment plus β blocker participants, and 19/55 (36%) optimised acute treatment plus behavioural migraine management participants were classified as clinically improved. For optimised acute treatment plus β blocker and behavioural migraine management, the number needed to treat was 3.1 compared with optimised acute treatment alone, 2.6 compared with optimised acute treatment plus β blocker, and 3.1 compared with optimised acute treatment plus behavioural migraine management.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^bedd1867]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

When the omnibus treatment by time interaction was statistically significant (P < 0.05, two tailed), we did six pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0083) at month 10, the primary end point, and, to evaluate longer term treatment effects, at month 16. The first three comparisons considered the primary study question by comparing each of the three additive treatments with optimised acute treatment plus placebo. Three additional comparisons compared the three added treatments with one another. At the primary end point at month 10, we also compared the proportion of participants who showed clinically significant improvements, defined as at least a 50% improvement in migraines per 30 days relative to the run-in of optimised acute treatment, across the four treatment groups by using χ², with missing values imputed as described above. If this omnibus χ² was significant (P < 0.05, two tailed), we used χ² tests with Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0083) to test the above six comparisons.

Two sensitivity analyses repeated the above mixed model analyses with only participants (n = 214) who provided at least one post-randomisation data point and with only participants (n = 182) who completed the treatment/dose adjustment phase and were assessed at month 5. The post-tests power to detect a between group difference in improvement of 1 (SD 1.5) migraine per 30 days, an adjusted α of 0.0083, and our initially planned number of participants of 240 was 0.83.

### Practice guideline update summary: pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^0c90064b]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for migraine prevention using pharmacologic treatment with or without cognitive behavioral therapy in the pediatric population.

Methods

The authors systematically reviewed literature from January 2003 to August 2017 and developed practice recommendations using the American Academy of Neurology 2011 process, as amended.

Results

Fifteen Class I-III studies on migraine prevention in children and adolescents met inclusion criteria. There is insufficient evidence to determine if children and adolescents receiving divalproex, onabotulinumtoxinA, amitriptyline, nimodipine, or flunarizine are more or less likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving propranolol are possibly more likely than those receiving placebo to have an at least 50% reduction in headache frequency. Children and adolescents receiving topiramate and cinnarizine are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a decrease in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving amitriptyline plus cognitive behavioral therapy are more likely than those receiving amitriptyline plus headache education to have a reduction in headache frequency.

Recommendations

The majority of randomized controlled trials studying the efficacy of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. Recommendations for the prevention of migraine in children include counseling on lifestyle and behavioral factors that influence headache frequency and assessment and management of comorbid disorders associated with headache persistence. Clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients and caregivers regarding the use of preventive treatments for migraine, including discussion of the limitations in the evidence to support pharmacologic treatments.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^b4732ffe]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Current standard of care

As for acute medications, preventive treatments can be classified as first-line, second-line and third-line options (Table 4). However, choice of medication and the order of use depend on local practice guidelines and local availability, costs and reimbursement policies.

First-line medications are beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol or propranolol), topiramateand candesartan. If these fail, second-line medications include flunarizine, amitriptylineand sodium valproate, although valproate is strictly contraindicated in women of childbearing potential, which greatly limits its utility in migraine –. Third-line medications are the four CGRP monoclonal antibodies erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab and eptinezumab. These antibodies have been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in the past few years. In Europe, regulatory restrictions limit their use to patients in whom other preventive drugs have failed or are contraindicated.

Non-pharmacological therapies

A range of non-pharmacological preventive therapies can be used either as adjuncts to acute and preventive medications or instead of them if medication use is contraindicated. Some evidence supports the use of non-invasive neuromodulatory devices, biobehavioural therapyand acupuncture, although a study of acupuncture indicated that it is not superior to sham acupuncture. Contrary to popular belief, little to no evidence exists for physical therapy, spinal manipulation and dietary approaches. We make no recommendations about other therapeutic options, such as melatonin, magnesium and riboflavin, as limited evidence for their efficacy is available and their use in clinical practice is limited.

Recommendations

Consider preventive treatment in patients who are adversely affected by migraine on ≥ 2 days per month despite optimized acute treatment.
Use beta blockers (atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol or propranolol), topiramate or candesartan as first-line medications.
Use flunarizine, amitriptyline or (in men) sodium valproate as second-line medications.
Consider CGRP monoclonal antibodies as third-line medications.
Consider neuromodulatory devices, biobehavioural therapy and acupuncture as adjuncts to acute and preventive medication or as stand-alone preventive treatment when medication is contraindicated.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^137bd153]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The first multicentre, double-blind RCT in VM treatment was published in 2019, comparing controlled-release metoprolol 95 mg daily with placebo over 6 months. Recruitment was slower than expected, with 130 patients eventually randomized (the planned sample size was 266), meaning the planned primary per protocol end point analysis could not be completed. Mean monthly vertigo frequency decreased from 4.2 to 2.8 attacks per month between months 4 and 6 in the metoprolol group and from 4.5 to 3.1 attacks per month in the placebo group (P = 0.696). Mean monthly migraine headache days over months 4–6 were also similar between the two groups (2.4 in metoprolol group versus 2.5 in placebo group, P = 0.904). An averaged DHI remained unchanged in both groups. No superiority of metoprolol over placebo was found for any of the outcome measures. Despite participant numbers being fewer than anticipated, the confidence interval for the incidence rate ratio was narrow, indicating that a large treatment effect was not likely.

Beta-blockers were generally well-tolerated, although in two studies approximately 12% of patients discontinued medication, compared with 7% for placebo in one of these studies. One of the multiple-treatment-arm studies that used a very low daily dose of propranolol (10 mg) observed a high dropout of patients from other treatment arms, but the four patients in the propranolol group were adherent. Two studies on beta-blockers did not report on side effects.

Authors' comments

Propranolol was seen to improve headache and vertigo severity in before-and-after studies. Beta-blockers are generally well tolerated by patients with good adherence rates and for this reason are commonly used in VM prophylaxis. However, in the most robust study of VM treatment metoprolol did not reduce vertigo frequency or dizziness handicap compared to placebo.

### Practice guideline update summary: pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^4310b20b]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric migraine preventive pharmacotherapy — evidence from randomized trials shows a high placebo response and limited superiority of medications; pediatric migraine trial results demonstrated a high response to placebo, with 30%–61% of children who received placebo having had a 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency, and the majority of randomized controlled trials that studied the efficacy of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. Children and adolescents with migraine receiving topiramate are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a decrease in headache days and migraine attacks; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether children with migraine who are receiving topiramate are more or less likely than those receiving placebo to have at least a 50% reduction in migraine frequency or headache days, and this is also the case for reduction in migraine-related disability. Children who receive propranolol are possibly more likely than those who receive placebo to have more than a 50% reduction in headache frequency. Patients receiving amitriptyline combined with CBT as compared with those treated with amitriptyline who receive headache education are more likely to experience a decreased headache frequency and have more than a 50% reduction in headache frequency and are probably more likely to have decreased migraine-associated disability, yet there is insufficient evidence to judge the independent effectiveness of amitriptyline on migraine prevention in children and adolescents and there is a Food and Drug Administration black box warning regarding risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with amitriptyline use. Evidence is insufficient to evaluate flunarizine, nimodipine, valproate, and onabotulinumtoxinA for pediatric migraine prevention, whereas cinnarizine is probably more effective than placebo but is not available in the United States or Canada; it is possible that CBT alone is effective and individual barriers to access may exist.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^c309cadc]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

The possibility that the combination of preventive drug treatment and behavioural migraine management can improve on the outcomes achieved with either treatment modality alone is of particular interest but has yet to be formally evaluated. Additional information about the comparative benefits of preventive treatment and behavioural migraine management when added to contemporary acute treatment is also needed.

The 5-HT 1B/D agonists or "triptans" have markedly improved the effectiveness of the acute treatment of migraine. However, the very effectiveness of contemporary acute treatment creates uncertainty about the benefits of preventive treatment beyond "optimised" acute treatment alone. Contemporary acute treatment effectively controls even frequent migraines in some people. Administered early in the migraine episode, acute treatment can terminate a migraine, preventing some of the associated psychosocial and biological consequences of a full blown migraine episode (Bernstein R, personal communication, 2008). On the other hand, the additional benefits of a preventive treatment may be smaller when acute treatment is optimised as recommended in clinical practice than when acute treatment is uncontrolled or suboptimal, which is the situation in the typical trial of preventive treatment. Information about the benefits of preventive treatment when acute treatment is optimised as recommended in clinical practice is lacking in trials of preventive drugs.

The Treatment of Severe Migraine trial aimed to determine if the addition of preventive drug treatment, behavioural migraine management, or the combination of the two improves the outcomes of optimised acute treatment. Participants with frequent migraines associated with disability received optimised acute treatment, and if their migraines remained uncontrolled they were randomised to one of four added treatments: preventive (β blocker) treatment, placebo, behavioural migraine management plus placebo, or behavioural migraine management plus preventive treatment. We obtained electronic headache diary recordings for the full 16 months of the trial, including a 12 month evaluation phase, and we assessed migraine related impairments in quality of life at multiple points over the 16 months of the trial.

### Erenumab versus topiramate for the prevention of migraine-a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 4 trial [^7cb6134e]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients

Adults (18–65 years) with a history of migraine with or without aura for at least 12 months prior to screening who had never received treatment with topiramate or a monoclonal antibody targeting the CGRP pathway were enrolled. Migraine was defined according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). In the initial protocol, only patients with episodic migraine (4–14 monthly migraine days (MMDs) over the last 3 months prior to screening) were eligible. Patients also had to meet these criteria during a 4-week baseline phase, during which they had to record headache information daily in an electronic diary (eDiary). Study participation required ≥ 80% eDiary compliance during the baseline phase. In order to implement the recommendation of the health technology assessment (HTA) body to include a full migraine population in the trial, a protocol amendment permitted patients with chronic migraine to be enrolled. At this time, 43.8% of the total study population had been randomised, all of them patients with episodic migraine.

Patients were eligible if they had not received prior prophylactic migraine treatment (naïve) or, due to lack of efficacy or tolerability, had failed or had not been suitable for up to three previous prophylactic treatments from the following: Metoprolol/propranolol, amitriptyline, and flunarizine. Patients were excluded if they were older than 50 years at migraine onset, had a history of cluster headache or hemiplegic migraine, or were unable to differentiate migraine from other headaches. Patients were also excluded if they had previously received valproate or, in the event of chronic migraine, onabotulinumtoxin A, in line with recommendations of the German HTA bodies. The use of any medication for migraine prophylaxis within five half-lives, or a device or a procedure within 1 month prior to the start of the baseline phase and during the study, was prohibited. A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the appendix (pp. 3–5).

Patients were recruited under the supervision of study investigators at each site.

The study was conducted according to good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines. All patients were informed about study conduct, expected benefits, and potential risks, including possible adverse events (AEs) of both study drugs, and provided written consent to participate in the trial.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^6240930a]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blockers — Noncardioselective propranolol immediate release: 80–160 mg/day (divided bid) and sustained release: 80–160 mg daily; cardioselective atenolol 25–100 mg daily (adjust dose in CKD), metoprolol tartrate immediate release: 50–300 mg/day (daily or divided bid), and metoprolol succinate (XL) sustained release: 25–200 mg/day. Discontinue with slow taper over one week; avoid combination with non-DHP CCB due to increased risk of bradycardia or heart attack; as doses increase, cardioselectivity decreases; beta-blockers should be used cautiously in asthma; compelling indications include: HFrEF (evidence available for reduction in morbidity and mortality with bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate in HFrEF); recent MI; angina; rate control in atrial fibrillation/flutter; data available for select beta-blockers for migraine prevention.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^b0d1622c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the clinical trials used either three times a day or four times a day dosing, clinical, pharmacologic, and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that twice daily dosing with propranolol should be adequate in the treatment of postinfarction patients.

Migraine

In a 34-week, placebo-controlled, 4-period, dose-finding crossover study with a double-blind randomized treatment sequence, 62 patients with migraine received propranolol 20 mg to 80 mg 3 or 4 times daily. The headache unit index, a composite of the number of days with headache and the associated severity of the headache, was significantly reduced for patients receiving propranolol as compared to those on placebo.

Essential Tremor

In a 2 week, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study of 9 patients with essential or familial tremor, propranolol, at a dose titrated as needed from 40 mg to 80 mg three times a day reduced tremor severity compared to placebo.

Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis

In an uncontrolled series of 13 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 or 3 symptoms and hypertrophic subaortic stenosis diagnosed at cardiac catheterization, oral propranolol 40 mg to 80 mg three times a day was administered and patients were followed for up to 17 months. Propranolol was associated with improved NYHA class for most patients.

Pheochromocytoma

In an uncontrolled series of 3 patients with norepinephrine-secreting pheochromocytoma who were pretreated with an alpha adrenergic blocker (prazosin), perioperative use of propranolol at doses of 40 mg to 80 mg three times a day resulted in symptomatic blood pressure control.

### Preventive medications in pediatric migraine: a network meta-analysis [^d037c5f2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study offers several notable advantages over the previous NMA. First, we included a larger number of studies, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalizability of our findings. Additionally, our methodological approach differed substantially; while the previous NMAcombined all categorical variables into one variable and all continuous variables into another before measuring effect size, we conducted separate analyses for each key feature of migraine. This approach provides a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of the treatments studied.

Furthermore, we employed meta-regression analysis to assess the association of baseline characteristics with treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that differences in baseline characteristics did not significantly influence the final results, further strengthening the validity and reliability of our conclusions. The previous NMAanalyzed flunarizine, pregabalin, propranolol, and topiramate. The most notable difference in findings between our study and the previous NMAlies in the assessment of propranolol. While both our study and the previous studyreported no effect of propranolol in preventing pediatric migraine, the earlier analysis indicated that propranolol was comparatively more effective than our study suggests.

Evidence-based research on pediatric migraine faces a major challenge, which is high placebo effect. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of propranolol, it was found that propranolol was effective in pediatric migraine prevention, but its effect was not significant compared with placebo. The authors stated that this finding could be because of high placebo effect among pediatric patients. This high effect was also previously reported. For instance, in a meta-analysis published in 2013, placebo was shown to effectively reduce migraine frequency among children. The previous NMAalso stated that the lack of significant results could be due to the placebo effect in children, which indicates robustness of our results and also shows that all findings are somehow underestimated.

### Efficacy and tolerability in migraine prophylaxis of flunarizine in reduced doses: a comparison with propranolol 160 mg daily [^29672d93]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

This was a phase-IV double-blind equivalence trial designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of flunarizine (10 mg o.d. = FLU 10 mg and 5 mg o.d. = FLU 5 mg) in the prophylaxis of migraine, in comparison with slow-release propranolol (160 mg o.d.). A total of 808 subjects were treated in a treatment period of 16 weeks. 142 subjects discontinued the trial prematurely, mainly because of adverse events (n = 58). The mean attack frequency in the double-blind period was 2.0 for the FLU 5 mg group, 1.9 for the FLU 10 mg group, and 1.9 for the propranolol group. The mean attack frequency in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 1.8 for FLU 5 mg, 1.6 for FLU 10 mg, and 1.7 for propranolol. Both flunarizine groups were at least as effective as propranolol (P < 0.001 in one-sided test). The percentage of responders (defined as subjects for whom attack frequency decreased by at least 50% compared to run-in) in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 46% (118/259) for FLU 5 mg, 53% (141/264) for FLU 10 mg, and 48% (125/258) for propranolol. Statistical analysis showed that FLU 10 mg is at least as effective as propranolol (P < 0.001) and showed a trend for noninferiority of FLU5 and propranolol (P = 0.053). No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were found for any of the secondary parameters. Overall, 190 subjects reported one or more adverse events during the run-in phase: 54 (20.5%) in the FLU 5 mg group, 76 (27.7%) in the FLU 10 mg group and 60 (22.3%) in the propranolol group. The results of this equivalence trial show that 10 mg flunarizine daily with a drug-free weekend is at least as effective as 160 mg propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine for all evaluated parameters (one-sided equivalence tests) after 16 weeks of treatment. In addition, 5 mg flunarizine proves to be at least as effective as 160 mg propranolol when looking at the mean attack frequency for both the whole double-blind period and the last 28 days of treatment. However, in the analysis of responders, 160 mg propranolol seems to be slightly better than 5 mg flunarizine. In addition, no significant differences between the three treatments were found with regard to safety: all three treatments were generally well-tolerated and safe.
