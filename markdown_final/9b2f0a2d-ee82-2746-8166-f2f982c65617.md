## Question

Treatment of mood disorders in 11yr child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating mood disorders in an 11-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical question and scope, including what counts as a mood disorder and how age 11 fits developmentally. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and identify the highest-quality sources. Next, I will extract and appraise the evidence for psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and combined treatments in this exact age group. After that, I need to integrate safety considerations, including suicidality and monitoring. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, stepwise treatment algorithm with shared decision-making and follow-up plans, while noting uncertainties and where adult data are extrapolated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and scope. Mood disorders in children include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar spectrum disorders, with MDD and PDD being the most common in this age band; at 11 years, the child is prepubertal or early pubertal, and the evidence base for children under 12 is thinner than for adolescents, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralizing from older youth data [^ef4bfc98] [^fa858603] [^a6be9589].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and identify the best sources. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to prioritize guidelines and meta-analyses over single trials. The AACAP 2023 guideline, APA 2019 guideline, and the 2020 Lancet Psychiatry network meta-analysis are the most authoritative sources, with NICE and WHO providing complementary stepped-care frameworks; I will also consider FDA labeling for medications in this age range [^a6be9589] [^e0106a2f] [^cb9fc811] [^b5a3909c] [^c6491182] [^83d79ab2].

> I will now examine psychotherapy evidence for 11-year-olds. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence by age. The APA panel found insufficient evidence to recommend specific psychotherapies for children, whereas AACAP notes that CBT and IPT have some rigorous support across pediatric samples that include children down to about age 7–8, albeit with fewer trials in pure child samples; a meta-analysis of child-only studies shows a modest CBT effect size around 0.41, suggesting benefit but with smaller, less consistent effects than in adolescents [^d9cc1be1] [^d64e30ea] [^2e43b338]. I should double-check that most pediatric psychotherapy trials are adolescent-weighted; yes, the majority of RCTs include adolescents, limiting certainty for children under 12, so family-involved CBT or structured psychosocial interventions are reasonable, but evidence is conditional at best [^a6be9589] [^418725d2].

> Now, pharmacotherapy in 11-year-olds. I need to check FDA approvals and pediatric data. Fluoxetine is FDA-approved for MDD in children aged 8 years and older, making it the only SSRI with pediatric MDD approval below age 12; escitalopram is approved only for ages 12 and up, so it is not labeled for an 11-year-old with MDD, though off-label use may be considered in select cases with specialist input [^83d79ab2] [^7de7156a]. Let me verify efficacy signals in children; randomized data in 7–11 year olds show fluoxetine can reduce depressive symptoms and achieve response, with effect sizes around 0.3–0.5 in some analyses, acknowledging high placebo response and smaller samples than adolescents [^2e43b338] [^d4872fce]. Hold on, I should confirm suicidality risk; pooled analyses show a small absolute increase in suicidal ideation with SSRIs in youth, with an NNH around 112, mandating close monitoring, especially early in treatment and after dose changes [^8abbe2a6].

> Combined treatment is often favored in adolescents; what about in 11-year-olds? The TADS demonstrated superiority of fluoxetine plus CBT over monotherapy in adolescents, but that trial did not enroll children under 12, so I should be cautious about direct extrapolation to an 11-year-old; still, AACAP supports considering combination therapy for moderate-to-severe presentations, and given the limited monotherapy effect sizes in younger children, combination treatment is a reasonable consideration when impairment is significant or response to psychotherapy is inadequate [^f566bbac] [^d64e30ea]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the network meta-analysis proved superiority of combination over CBT alone in children; let me verify the age breakdown. The Lancet analysis aggregated children and adolescents and found fluoxetine plus CBT outperformed CBT alone, but it did not isolate a child-only effect, so I should not overstate pediatric-specific superiority even though the directionality is encouraging [^cb9fc811].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring requirements. SSRIs carry a boxed warning for suicidality through age 24, with the highest risk in the first weeks and after dose changes; therefore, weekly contact for the first month, then every 2–4 weeks for 3 months, with explicit safety planning and caregiver education, is prudent, and measurement-based care with standardized scales such as the MFQ or PHQ-9 modified for youth helps track symptoms and suicidality [^8abbe2a6] [^bcefbba9]. Let me reconsider growth effects; SSRIs can suppress appetite and weight gain, so serial weights and heights should be monitored in children, and any emergent agitation, insomnia, or suicidal ideation warrants prompt reassessment of the regimen [^7de7156a].

> Next, I should review differential diagnosis and bipolar risk. Prepubertal-onset depression confers a 10–20% risk of bipolar spectrum disorder, so I need to screen for family history, episodic irritability, decreased need for sleep, and grandiosity; if bipolar features emerge, antidepressants may worsen mania, and mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics may be indicated, ideally with pediatric psychiatric consultation [^fa858603] [^c8bc720c]. Hold on, I should verify that routine screening for mania is not a substitute for careful diagnostic interviewing; correct, structured assessment and collateral information remain essential to avoid misclassification and inappropriate antidepressant monotherapy in bipolar-spectrum presentations [^7cec05c4].

> I will now translate this into a practical, stepwise approach. For mild, nonchronic depression with minimal functional impairment, start with psychoeducation, family support, and active monitoring for 2–4 weeks, then escalate to CBT or a structured psychosocial intervention if no improvement; avoid starting medication in mild cases given unfavorable risk–benefit in children [^b5a3909c] [^b95f4def]. For moderate severity or persistent symptoms, initiate CBT with family involvement and consider adding fluoxetine if there is inadequate response after about 6–8 weeks or if impairment is substantial; if CBT is unavailable, fluoxetine monotherapy may be used with close monitoring, recognizing the weaker evidence base in pure child samples [^d64e30ea] [^2e43b338]. For severe depression with marked impairment or suicidality, combination treatment with fluoxetine and CBT is reasonable, with expedited psychiatric consultation and safety planning, including means restriction and crisis protocols [^f566bbac] [^63bee354].

> But wait, what if first-line treatments fail or are not tolerated? I should confirm the approach to treatment resistance. Reassess diagnosis, comorbidity, and adherence; if there has been an adequate fluoxetine trial, switching to sertraline or citalopram is reasonable, though pediatric MDD data are less robust and escitalopram is not FDA-approved under age 12; augmentation strategies such as adding CBT if not already done, or considering lithium, atypical antipsychotics, or lamotrigine in specialist hands, may be considered, acknowledging limited pediatric evidence and the need for careful risk–benefit discussion [^cae21968] [^b5a3909c]. I should double-check that any off-label use is documented with rationale and consent, especially in children under 12 [^fa5d612b].

> Shared decision-making and consent are critical here. I need to ensure the parent or guardian understands diagnosis, treatment options, expected benefits and risks, alternatives, and the right to decline, and I should obtain assent from the 11-year-old in developmentally appropriate language; documenting this process and providing written materials improves comprehension and alignment with treatment goals [^526daeaa] [^fa5d612b]. Let me verify that consent should explicitly cover suicidality monitoring and emergency plans; yes, guidelines emphasize discussing safety monitoring and crisis contingencies up front [^fa5d612b].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence and duration. Acute treatment should be reassessed at 6–8 weeks for response, with continuation for at least 6–12 months after remission to reduce relapse risk, and gradual tapering if medication is discontinued; throughout, track symptoms, functioning, and side effects using standardized measures and adjust the plan based on trajectory and family preferences [^464b6df8] [^1bb3c5cd]. Hold on, I should verify that early improvement within 2–4 weeks predicts later response; modeling and clinical experience support early signal detection to avoid prolonged ineffective therapy, which is particularly relevant in children where evidence is thinner and families may lose momentum if benefits are slow [^83d79ab2].

For an 11-year-old with a mood disorder, **CBT is first-line** [^d64e30ea] because it is effective [^cb9fc811] and has a favorable safety profile. Fluoxetine is the **only FDA-approved SSRI** for children aged 8 and older [^83d79ab2]; consider it for moderate-to-severe depression or when CBT is unavailable or ineffective, with close monitoring for suicidality and side effects [^8abbe2a6]. Combination therapy (CBT plus fluoxetine) may be used for severe or treatment-resistant cases [^f566bbac]. Family involvement and school-based supports improve outcomes, and treatment should be individualized with regular monitoring of symptoms, functioning, and adverse effects [^7d927aac] [^1bb3c5cd].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis is essential; in children, irritability may replace depressed mood, and symptoms must cause significant impairment [^754d9d84]. Common comorbidities include anxiety, ADHD, and disruptive behaviors, which should be assessed and managed concurrently [^992c9d80] [^c9de95b7].

---

## Evidence-based treatment options

### Psychotherapy

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: First-line for pediatric depression; effective in reducing symptoms and improving functioning [^d64e30ea] [^cb9fc811].
- **Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)**: Effective in adolescents; evidence is limited in younger children but may be considered [^b90ee2e5].
- **Family involvement**: Enhances engagement, adherence, and outcomes; family therapy or parent training is often beneficial [^992c9d80].

---

### Pharmacotherapy

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Fluoxetine is FDA-approved for children aged 8 and older [^83d79ab2]; escitalopram is approved for adolescents aged 12 and older [^7de7156a].
- **Fluoxetine**: First-line SSRI for pediatric depression; effective and generally well tolerated [^cb9fc811] [^d4872fce].
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for suicidality, behavioral activation, and side effects is essential, especially during initiation and dose changes [^8abbe2a6] [^e34ff3b0].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy with **CBT plus fluoxetine** may be considered for severe depression or when monotherapy is insufficient, with evidence strongest in adolescents but extrapolated cautiously to younger children [^f566bbac] [^cb9fc811].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Severity** | **First-line treatment** | **Second-line treatment** | **Additional considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | CBT or supportive psychotherapy | Watchful waiting | Family involvement; school-based supports |
| Moderate | CBT | Fluoxetine if CBT unavailable or ineffective | Family therapy; school accommodations |
| Severe | CBT + fluoxetine | Hospitalization if high risk | Intensive family involvement; multidisciplinary care |

---

## Safety considerations

- **Suicidality**: SSRIs carry a boxed warning; monitor closely for suicidal ideation, especially early in treatment or with dose changes [^8abbe2a6].
- **Side effects**: Common SSRI side effects include gastrointestinal upset, sleep disturbances, and behavioral activation; monitor growth and appetite [^7de7156a].
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of symptoms, functioning, and adverse effects is essential [^1bb3c5cd].

---

## Role of family and school

Family involvement improves adherence and outcomes; **parent training and family therapy** are often beneficial [^992c9d80]. School-based supports — such as accommodations, counseling, and coordination with teachers — enhance functioning and recovery [^992c9d80].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Pediatric depression is recurrent; **relapse rates are 20–60% within 1–2 years** and up to 70% by 5 years [^fa858603]. Continuation and maintenance treatment reduce relapse risk, and ongoing monitoring and support are essential [^d64e30ea].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **CBT is first-line** for pediatric depression, with family involvement and school-based supports [^d64e30ea].
- **Fluoxetine is the only FDA-approved SSRI** for children aged 8 and older; consider for moderate-to-severe depression or when CBT is unavailable or ineffective [^83d79ab2].
- **Combination therapy** may be used for severe or treatment-resistant cases [^f566bbac].
- **Regular monitoring** of symptoms, functioning, and adverse effects is essential [^1bb3c5cd].

Treatment should be **individualized**, with shared decision-making with the child and family, and coordinated care across settings to optimize outcomes [^fa5d612b].

### Screening and treatment for major depressive disorder in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d3eaca1f]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Description

This is an update of the 2002 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on screening for child and adolescent major depressive disorder.

Methods

The US Preventive Services Task Force weighed the benefits and harms of screening and treatment for major depressive disorder in children and adolescents, incorporating new evidence addressing gaps in the 2002 recommendation statement. Evidence examined included the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of primary care-feasible screening tests, and the benefits and risks of treating depression by using psychotherapy and/or medications in patients aged 7 to 18 years.

Recommendations

Screen adolescents (12–18 years of age) for major depressive disorder when systems are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal), and follow-up (B recommendation). Evidence is insufficient to warrant a recommendation to screen children (7–11 years of age) for major depressive disorder (I statement).

Treatment of depression — AHRQ/RTI-UNC CETP Systematic Review summarizes that the objective was to examine the benefits and harms of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for child and adolescent depressive disorders, with key questions addressing nonpharmacological, pharmacological, combination, collaborative care, and comparative treatments and an accompanying subpopulation question. Eligibility required studies including children and adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of MDD, PDD (or dysthymia), or DD NOS who were receiving any nonpharmacological or pharmacological interventions, alone or combined, for at least 6 weeks and reporting specified end-of-treatment benefits and harms outcomes; the study time frame was any publication date, settings were outpatient care in countries with a very high Human Development Index, language was English, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and observational studies were included as specified for benefits and harms. Overall, 60 studies were included (reported in 94 articles); 0% addressed key question 4 and 49% addressed key question 5; 72% of the studies were conducted in the United States; and populations included children (age range from 5 to 12 years), adolescents (age range from 11 to 18 years), and studies including both groups (age range from 7 to 18 years), with definitions referring to adolescents as persons aged 11 or 12 years and older and children as persons aged 10 or 11 years and younger (generally down to age 7 or 8 years).

APA guideline — child population initial treatment states that for initial treatment of child patients with depressive disorders there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding any of the listed psychotherapies/interventions, with the strength labeled "Insufficient evidence for a recommendation." It also states there was insufficient evidence to either recommend or not recommend pharmacotherapy for child patients with depressive disorders, and the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^33364cef]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Background — depressive disorder definitions across ages — Major depression is the second leading cause of disability as of 2013, and major depressive disorder is characterized by depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks and is accompanied by at least three (or a total of at least five) symptoms present most days. Persistent depressive disorder (DSM-5) is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at least 2 years with at least two additional symptoms; in children and adolescents the duration is at least 1 year, and there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months. For presentations that do not meet full criteria, DSM-5 Other Specified Depressive Disorder includes recurrent episodes of depressed mood with at least four other symptoms for 2–13 days (recurrent brief depression) and a depressive episode for 4–13 days (short-duration depressive episode).

### Suicide and suicide attempts in adolescents [^e34ff3b0]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Advice for pediatricians — Ask questions about mood disorders, use of drugs and alcohol, suicidal thoughts, bullying, sexual orientation, and other risk factors associated with suicide in routine history taking throughout adolescence, and consider using a depression screening instrument, such as the PHQ-9 or PHQ-2, at health maintenance visits from 11 to 21 years of age and as needed at acute care visits. Educate yourself and your patients about the benefits and risks of antidepressant medications; patients with depression should be carefully monitored, with appropriately frequent appointments and education of the family regarding warning signs for when to call you, especially after the initiation of antidepressant medication treatment and with dose changes; and recent studies suggest that, for appropriate youth, the benefits of antidepressant medications outweigh the risks. Recognize the medical and psychiatric needs of the suicidal adolescent and work closely with families and health care professionals involved in the management and follow-up of youth who are at risk or have attempted suicide; develop working relationships with emergency departments and colleagues in child and adolescent psychiatry, clinical psychology, and other mental health professions to optimally evaluate and manage the care of adolescents who are at risk for suicide; and because mental and physical health services are often provided through different systems of care, extra effort is necessary to ensure good communication, continuity, and follow-up through the medical home. Because resources for adolescents and physicians vary by community, become familiar with local, state, and national resources that are concerned with treatment of psychopathology and suicide prevention in youth, including local hospitals with psychiatric units, mental health agencies, family and children's services, crisis hotlines, and crisis intervention centers, and compile the names and contact information of local mental health resources and providers and make that information available to patients/families when needed. Because there is great variation among general pediatricians in training and comfort with assessing and treating patients with mental health problems, as well as in access to appropriate mental health resources, consider additional training and ongoing education in diagnosing and managing adolescent mood disorders, especially if practicing in an underserved area.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^754d9d84]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Scope of the problem — diagnostic features of major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder are defined: Major depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood (or irritability in children) and/or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks and is accompanied by at least three (or a total of at least five) of listed symptoms present most days. Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at least 2 years along with at least two specified symptoms; in children and adolescents, the duration is at least one year, and the mood can be irritable. The text further specifies that there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months and that symptoms are not better explained by another disorder, cause significant impairment in functioning or distress, and are not due to a different medical condition or a substance.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^7195794b]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — diagnostic categories, impairment, and course: With the introduction of DSM-5, Mood Disorders are now referred to as Depressive Disorders and include Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder — Single and Recurrent Episodes, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder; over 60% of depressed teens reported severe impairment in functioning related to school/work, family, chores, and social roles, behavior changes must occur for at least 2 weeks to be considered impaired, episode duration is longer in children than adolescents (median of 16 weeks versus 8 weeks, respectively), and clinicians are encouraged to intervene as opposed to watchful waiting.

### Depression in the child and adolescent [^84bb93d6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Depression is a common disorder of childhood and adolescence for which effective interventions exist. Primary care physicians should be familiar with its essential features to ensure that their patients do not suffer needlessly from this potentially devastating, even fatal disorder. Clinical signs and symptoms of depression typically are not difficult to elicit, but patients and families may fail to volunteer them unless asked. A growing body of evidence exists to guide clinicians in their choice of treatment interventions. Treatment response to studied interventions is high, although recurrence is common. Consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist is advisable in complicated cases or severe presentations, especially when patients are suicidal or threatening to harm others.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^526daeaa]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for treatment implementation — importance of informed consent emphasizes that the panel "encourages all clinicians to provide informed consent to patients," and that "psychologists should obtain an informed consent from the patient prior to implementing psychological services." Informed consent requires clinicians to "inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic relationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient to ask questions and receive answers," and the Code of Ethics notes it "should include information about any known diagnosis; why particular interventions are recommended and what is involved in these interventions; and benefits, harms, and burdens of possible interventions including those for choosing to receive no treatment," thereby allowing patients "to make an informed decision of whether to initiate or continue treatment," and satisfying "the General Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence." For minors, "the provider should convey the same information to the parent/guardian who must provide consent for treatment" and also to "adolescents who must assent to treatment," and "for children, it also would be helpful to convey some of the information… in an age-appropriate manner."

### Treatment guidelines for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder [^c8bc720c]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians who treat children and adolescents with bipolar disorder desperately need current treatment guidelines. These guidelines were developed by expert consensus and a review of the extant literature about the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bipolar disorders. The four sections of these guidelines include diagnosis, comorbidity, acute treatment, and maintenance treatment. These guidelines are not intended to serve as an absolute standard of medical or psychological care but rather to serve as clinically useful guidelines for evaluation and treatment that can be used in the care of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. These guidelines are subject to change as our evidence base increases and practice patterns evolve.

### Anxiety and depression in children | Children's mental health… [^992c9d80]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Depression and anxiety often co-occur.
- Although fears and worries are typical in children, persistent or extreme forms of fear and sadness could be due to anxiety or depression.
- If you are concerned about anxiety or depression in your child, the first step is to talk with a health care provider such as your child's primary care provider, or a mental health specialist, about getting an evaluation. Depression Occasionally being sad or feeling hopeless is a part of every child's life. However, some children feel sad or are uninterested in things that they used to enjoy, or feel helpless or hopeless in situations they are able to change. When children feel persistent sadness and hopelessness, they may be diagnosed with depression. Like anxiety, depression is not one disorder but a category of conditions. Major depressive disorder is the most common.

Examples of behaviors often seen in children with depression include:

- Feeling sad, hopeless, or irritable a lot of the time
- Not wanting to do or enjoy doing fun things
- Changes in eating patterns — eating a lot more or a lot less than usual
- Changes in sleep patterns — sleeping a lot more or a lot less than normal
- Changes in energy — being tired and sluggish or tense and restless a lot of the time
- Having a hard time paying attention
- Feeling worthless, useless, or guilty
- Showing self-injury and self-destructive behavior. Treatment for anxiety and depression The first step to treatment is to talk with a health care provider such as your child's primary care provider, or a mental health specialist, about getting an evaluation.
- Consultation with a health care provider can help determine if medication should be part of the treatment. A mental health professional can develop a therapy plan that works best for the child and family.
- Behavior therapy includes child therapy, family therapy, or a combination of both. The school can also be included in the treatment plan. For very young children, involving parents in treatment is key.
- Behavior therapy for anxiety may involve helping children cope with and manage anxiety symptoms while gradually exposing them to their fears to help them learn that bad things do not occur.
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy is one form of therapy that is used to treat anxiety or depression, particularly in older children. It helps the child change negative thoughts into more positive, effective ways of thinking and coping, leading to more effective behavior.

### Improving the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder [^3ee0c7d4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Awareness of the prevalence and impact of bipolar disorder in pediatric patients has grown in recent years. Youths with this disorder are at risk for poor long-term outcomes, but with careful screening, clinicians may be able to detect early signs or subthreshold symptoms and provide a timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Although several pharmacologic options are available for patients aged 10 years and up, they differ in their safety and tolerability profiles. Clinicians should select the agent that best balances benefit and risk-at the lowest efficacious dose-and provide careful monitoring for adverse events throughout treatment.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^c06e55ed]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — recommendation framework and key definitions across children and adolescents, the general adult population, and older adults are described as follows: No treatment is defined as "No active treatment was provided (i.e., waitlist)." Efficacy is "The impact of an intervention compared to an inactive control," and comparative effectiveness "compares at least two different active treatments to each other to assess for the benefits of one (or combination) versus the other (or combination)." Recommendations pertaining to efficacy "do not imply that these treatments are superior to other active treatments." Decision-making criteria were that the panel "recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions or for which there was evidence of equivalency or superiority to other treatments," "conditionally recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions" when either "Other active treatments… were superior," there was "Insufficient evidence that the treatment was equivalent to other effective treatments," or there were "Greater harms/burdens than with other treatments," and the panel "did not recommend treatments or recommended against treatments if there was insufficient evidence of efficacy or if the harms were considered to outweigh any benefits." The ultimate decision "should be based on shared decision-making with the patient" and, for youth, "the parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care."

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1a2700f9]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment guideline — scope exclusions and evidence base state that the reviews did not explicitly search for or include screening for depression (including assessment of associated or comorbid conditions, monitoring response, or follow-up), prevention of depression, dose/timing/duration, costs, model or locus of care, the long-term benefits of treatment for maintenance of recovery and prevention of relapse, mechanisms of change, efficacy of treatments for disorders other than depression, or bipolar disorder. The panel had originally proposed to include somatic treatments but the search criteria did not adequately capture the literature and the panel was unable to make recommendations; instead, the panel utilized systematic reviews/meta-analyses current within the past 5 years that met IOM (2011b) development and AMSTAR quality standards, and although some reviews crossed the 5-year mark by finalization, decision-making occurred during the 5-year window. Additionally, while the panel initially decided not to look at efficacy of medication treatments alone, it later examined efficacy of medication treatment alone for children/adolescents due to potential safety concerns about medications in this population.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients, pharmacotherapy, APA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend other medications in adolescent patients. Ensure shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable.

The authors review the currently available evidence-based treatments of child and adolescent major depressive disorder. Medication monotherapy, namely with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is supported by large clinical trials in adolescents. For mild to moderate depression, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy are reasonable options as monotherapies. There is also evidence that the combination of medication and CBT is superior to medication alone for accelerating the pace of treatment response and remission, despite some negative studies. Response, remission, and recurrence rates after acute treatment and during long-term follow-ups are also presented and discussed.

Process and method — guideline scope, outcomes, and evidence sources — The guideline covers a broad range of the population (children through older adults) and includes psychotherapeutic interventions, noting that earlier guidelines have either been completed 5 or more years prior, provided limited guidance on psychotherapies, or focused on a specific population; it is intended for a broad international audience. APA's Advisory Steering Committee issued a call for nominations and the panel used the Patient, Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Timing, and Settings (PICOTS) framework to guide initial question formulation. In selecting outcomes critical for recommendations, the panel decided that response to treatment and serious associated harms/adverse events were critical, and that the following additional outcomes were important: remission (no longer having symptoms), quality of life, functional capacity, patient satisfaction, relapse, recurrence, and suicidality; evidence development involved RTI-UNC Evidence-Based Practice Center scientists and use of existing systematic reviews.

### Mood and suicidality outcomes 3–11 years following pediatric anxiety disorder treatment [^ea34d260]. Depression and Anxiety (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Youth anxiety interventions have potential to reduce risk for depression and suicidality.

Methods

This naturalistic follow-up of the multi-site, comparative treatment trial, inking and behavior, and depressive symptoms 3–11 years (mean 6.25 years) following 12-week evidence-based youth anxiety treatment. Participants (N = 319; 10–26 years, mean 17 years) completed semiannual questionnaires and annual diagnostic interviews for 4 years.

Results

One-fifth (20.4%) of the sample met DSM-IV criteria for a mood disorder, 32.1% endorsed suicidal ideation, and 8.2% reported suicidal behavior. Latent class growth analysis yielded two linear trajectories of depressive symptoms, and 85% of the sample demonstrated a persistent low-symptom course over seven assessments. Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) 12-week treatment outcome (positive response, remission) and treatment condition (cognitive behavior therapy [CBT], medication, CBT+medication, pill placebo) were not associated with subsequent mood disorder or suicidal thinking. CAMS remission predicted absence of suicidal behavior, and treatment response and remission predicted low depressive symptom trajectory. Greater baseline self-reported depressive symptoms predicted all long-term mood outcomes, and more negative life events predicted subsequent mood disorder, depressive symptom trajectory, and suicidal ideation.

Conclusions

Effective early treatment of youth anxiety, including CBT, medication, or CBT+medication, reduces risk for subsequent chronic depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior. Attention to (sub)clinical depressive symptoms and management of negative life events may reduce odds of developing a mood disorder, chronic depressive symptoms, and suicidality. Findings contribute to evidence that early intervention for a primary disorder can serve as secondary prevention.

### Toward prevention of bipolar disorder in at-risk children: potential strategies ahead of the data [^dff02e56]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

A final rationale for considering treatment interventions ahead of adequate systematic supporting evidence is that treatments could be studied first in pilot studies, case series, and naturalistic outcome studies, and followed by more systematic open randomized studies, and then gold-standard randomized placebo controlled clinical trials (RCTs). If approaches do not look promising in initial open studies, expensive RCTs might be avoided. In high risk children who are already prodromal, treatment choices would also vary depending on the degree of symptom severity and impairment, which might warrant intervention with more risky agents, such as atypical antipsychotic or mood stabilizers. In contrast, mild anxiety might merit cognitive-behavioral therapy, lifestyle optimization, and supplements generally regarded as safe, prior to introducing major psychopharmacology.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^7c3c26aa]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Safety assessment — children and adolescents with depressive disorders: Safety risks, including but not limited to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, self-harm, risk-taking behaviors, and impulsivity, are assessed both at evaluation and during treatment and have been associated with depression and with antidepressant treatment, and depressive disorders suggest exploration of exposure to childhood adversities. In the case of abuse or neglect, reporting to the state child welfare authority is required, and information may need to be gathered from multiple sources using culturally and developmentally sensitive techniques. Assessment culminates in 2 basic questions — Is the patient at current risk? and Are the patient and family able to adhere to recommendations regarding supervision, safeguarding, and follow-up care? — and answers guide the appropriate level and intensity of care. Psychiatric hospitalization is likely indicated when the youth actively voices intent to harm, and in the context of altered mental status (including hopelessness, agitation, psychosis), multiple previous suicide attempts, previous unsuccessful treatment, and/or caregiver incapacity.

Anxiety and depressive disorders

What do I do if a young person has depression and has not responded to two SSRIs and CBT?

National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines currently recommend CBT as a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe depression, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line antidepressant and, if that is not effective, sertraline or citalopram. There is limited evidence for other treatments beyond this, other than interpersonal psychotherapy, which is often not available.

The first thing to do when a patient is treatment-resistant is to revisit the formulation and diagnosis. Is this really depression, or does the pattern of symptoms since you started seeing the patient suggest a personality disorder as a more appropriate diagnosis? Are there any social factors that have not been addressed?

Then review whether the patient has indeed had all the treatments to which they appear to be 'resistant'. Did they stop fluoxetine after a few days of mild side effects and would they be prepared to try again? Did they have a good number of sessions of evidence-based psychological therapy from a fully trained and supervised therapist? If they stopped after a few sessions, was this due to a problem in the therapy or the therapist and would they consider trying a different therapist?

If the patient truly does have depression, and you have tried all the evidence-based treatments, there is no evidence to guide you. It would be reasonable to try two SSRIs up to the maximum tolerated dose, within BNF limits: although there is no evidence in favour of or against this, there is some evidence for a dose increase in adult depression; and there is plenty of safety data from paediatric OCD studies which use high doses of SSRIs. If the patient is nearly 18, it may be reasonable to try antidepressants shown to work in studies of 18–64 years old but not in studies of 12–17 years old, such as mirtazapine (adrenergic alpha-2 auto receptors and heteroceptors antagonist and 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors blocker) or venlafaxine (serotonin and norepinephrine inhibitor); caution should be used with the latter due to possible increased risk of suicidal ideation, and for that reason it is especially important to seek peer advice. It may be worth trying an augmenting agent that has evidence in adults such as lamotrigine, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, or-thyroxine.

### Examination of disruptive behavior outcomes and moderation in a randomized psychotherapy trial for mood disorders [^c9de95b7]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Multifamily psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP) is an efficacious treatment for children with mood disorders. Given the comorbidity between disruptive behaviors and mood disorders, this study examined associations between disruptive behaviors and impairment, impact of MF-PEP on disruptive behaviors, and whether disruptive behaviors affected treatment response of mood symptoms.

Method

Secondary analyses examined a randomized controlled trial of MF-PEP versus waitlist control (N = 165 children 8–11 years old with mood disorders and their parents). Comorbid behavioral diagnoses occurred in 97% of children. All participants continued treatment as usual.

Results

Greater degree of disruptive behaviors was associated with worse mood symptoms and impairment. Between-group analyses examining outcome of disruptive behaviors were nonsignificant. Within-group analyses and between-group effect sizes suggested that MF-PEP was associated with decreases in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (d = 0.39), oppositional defiant disorder (d = 0.30), and overall disruptive behavior symptoms (d = 0.30), but not conduct disorder symptoms. Baseline severity of disruptive behaviors did not affect treatment response of mood symptoms to MF-PEP.

Conclusions

MF-PEP is an effective intervention for children with mood disorders and provides some benefit for disruptive behaviors. Given that disruptive behavior severity does not affect children's ability to experience improved mood symptoms, MF-PEP may be an important early intervention for children with comorbid mood and disruptive behavior disorders. Subsequent intervention targeting behavioral symptoms after improvement in mood may be beneficial. Studies examining treatment sequencing for children with comorbid mood and disruptive behavior disorders are needed.

Adolescent major depressive disorder — additional pharmacotherapy guidance for initial treatment notes that information is lacking regarding other medication options for adolescents; thus, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care. This is a Conditional recommendation for use, and the stated rationale is that the recommendation is due to safety concerns such as increased suicide risk for adolescents when using other medications.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^6153164b]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP clinical practice guideline for children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD) aims to enhance quality of care by summarizing empirically based guidance on psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatment and expert-based guidance on assessment and implementation in clinical practice. Meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/RTI-UNC review are included, and guidance on assessment and implementation is informed by expert opinion and consensus sources including the DSM-5-TR. Psychotherapy (specifically, cognitive–behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have some rigorous empirical support as treatment options, and comprehensive, evidence-based assessment may enhance evidence-based treatment outcomes. The guideline notes significant limitations in rigorous empirical support and a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent–trained behavioral health specialists, and highlights research priorities including delivery mechanisms, comparative effectiveness and sequencing of treatments, mediators and moderators, approaches for nonresponders and disorder relapse/ recurrence, long-term effects and degree of suicide risk with SSRI use, and discovery of novel pharmacologic or interventional treatments. Epidemiology cited includes that nearly 30% of youth worldwide are reported to have a depressive disorder and that estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of MDD among U.S. adolescents was reported to be 11% and 7.5%.

### Depression and bipolar support alliance consensus statement on the unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders in children and adolescents [^f9a48d3a]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To focus attention on the critical unmet needs of children and adolescents with mood disorders and to make recommendations for future research and allocation of healthcare resources.

Method

The 36-member Consensus Development Panel consisted of experts in child/adolescent or adult psychiatry and psychology, pediatrics, and mental health advocacy. Reviews of the literature concerning youth mood disorders were performed on the subjects of risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and services delivery, and opinions and experiences of mental health advocates were obtained.

Results

The Consensus Development Panel listened to presentations and participated in discussions. Independent workgroups of clinicians, scientists, and mental health advocates considered the evidence and prepared preliminary statements. Workgroup leaders presented drafts for discussion by the Consensus Development Panel. The final document was reviewed by the entire group and edited to incorporate input from all participants.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests high rates of unmet needs for children and adolescents with depression or bipolar disorder. Training is largely limited to child mental health specialists; general psychiatrists, pediatricians, and other primary care physicians receive little or no training. As a result, treatment patterns may reflect adult treatment plans that are not validated for youths. Effective treatments have been identified and some preliminary prevention models have been developed, but they are not yet widely applied. Patients experience limited exposure to clinicians adequately trained to address their problems and little information to guide care decisions, particularly concerning bipolar disorder. National efforts are required to restructure healthcare delivery and provider training and to immediately develop more advanced research on pathophysiology, prevention, and services delivery effectiveness.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline — children and adolescents: The guideline focuses on ages 5–18 years old and recommends providing good psychoeducation and stepped care; for mild depression and persistent depressive disorder it recommends watchful waiting for up to 4 weeks, nondirective supportive therapy, group cognitive-behavioral therapy, or guided self-help, and recommends against using antidepressant medication as an initial treatment for mild depression in children and adolescents. For moderate to severe depression, it recommends brief psychological therapy (individual CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, family therapy, or psychodynamic psychotherapy) with or without fluoxetine; for recurrent, unresponsive, or psychotic depression it recommends intensive psychological therapy or an alternative therapy than what was already tried (individual CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, or shorter term family therapy, lasting at least three months) or systems family therapy or 30 weekly sessions of individual child psychotherapy, with treatment done with or without fluoxetine. If the child is unresponsive to fluoxetine, then sertraline or citalopram may be used; the guideline recommends against using paroxetine, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants, or St. John's Wort, and for psychotic depression recommends that consideration be given to augmenting treatment with an antipsychotic.

### Individualizing treatment selection for pediatric and adult patients with bipolar depression [^062143e3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 60% of patients with bipolar disorder who present with depression are misdiagnosed as having recurrent unipolar depression, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and potential worsening of symptoms. Bipolar depression in youth has a negative effect on numerous domains of life. Early treatment is crucial, yet diagnosis is difficult. The standard of treatment often requires life-long psychopharmacologic management, and treatments have various adverse effects that should be considered when the clinician tailors the regimen for each patient. By facilitating effective communication with patients, referring to diagnostic criteria, and using assessment tools before diagnosis and as treatment continues, clinicians can identify indicators of the disorder, recommend individualized treatment, and help patients work toward greater success in relationships, at home, and at school or work.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^d64e30ea]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions — treatment considerations for pediatric major and persistent depressive disorders: Psychotherapy (specifically CBT and interpersonal therapy) and psychopharmacology (specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medication [except paroxetine]) have some rigorous (RCT/meta-analysis) empirical support as well as strong expert consensus as treatment options. Because of the compelling contribution of psychological and social–environmental factors to the onset of depression, consideration of supportive interventions as a first-line treatment for mild presentations of depression in children and adolescents is warranted. Empirically validated psychotherapies and SSRI medications, alone or in combination, can be considered for moderate-to-severe presentations, with continuation of treatment for a sufficient period of time to reduce the risk of relapse or recurrence.

Major depressive disorder (children and adolescents) — evaluation principles: Clinically significant depression must be distinguished from everyday sadness and irritability, which can be normative in specific developmental stages. In DSM-5-TR, mental disorders are defined as a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in underlying psychological, biological, or developmental processes. By DSM convention, a mental disorder is diagnosed if all diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met. Most diagnostic criteria sets require specific frequency and duration of symptoms and clinically significant distress and functional impairment, and alternative medical, substance, and psychiatric explanations must have been considered before the diagnosis is applied.

### When do you prescribe antidepressants to depressed children? [^d4872fce]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents is a public health problem that requires evidence-based management. Our objective is to review available studies, with a PubMed search, and briefly summarize safety and efficacy results of (mostly SSRI) antidepressants in children and adolescents with MDD. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents both in reduction of symptoms, and in remission/response rates. However, response rates are lower than for non-OCD anxiety. Sertraline also had positive results in one study that pooled results from two studies. The number needed to treat (NNT) for MDD is 10, and the number needed to harm (NNH) for suicidality is 112. Methodological limitations in the studies include, mainly, high placebo response rates, associated with multiple study sites, younger patients, and lower MDD severity. Treatment should be maintained close to 1 year after remission, to prevent relapse. FDA-approved fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric MDD. Sertraline also has some data supporting its efficacy and safety, but is not FDA-approved. The possible modest increase in suicidal ideation in some patients should be known by clinicians, but the risk/benefit ratio is 1 to 11.2 times favorable to using SSRIs in moderate to severe MDD.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^f566bbac]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Child and adolescent depression — American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guidance recommends case management, support, and psychoeducation for brief or uncomplicated depression; recommends either interpersonal psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for moderate depression; and states that for severe depression antidepressant medication is also recommended alone until the child can begin psychotherapy or in combination with psychotherapy from the start, with combination therapy recommended for children that do not respond to monotherapy. The American Psychological Association notes caution with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and suggests combination of treatment may be warranted with more severe clinical presentations, yet its guideline does not address combination treatment of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication for children/adolescents. In the Treatment of Adolescent Depression trial, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was compared as a stand-alone intervention to fluoxetine, to the combination of CBT and medication, and to placebo across 13 sites and over 400 adolescents, and the study concluded that combination treatment of fluoxetine and CBT resulted in significantly better outcomes than CBT or fluoxetine alone. Despite these data, the panel did not find these studies to yet warrant recommendations regarding combined treatment for children and adolescents and desires more comparative effectiveness and combined treatment research.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^4a28167f]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — clinical recommendations are separated due to developmental and methodological considerations in the included reviews; the panel retained recommendation statements for adolescents only and noted that evidence was insufficient to make specific recommendations for type of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for children. Evidence for children was less robust for CBT and IPT. Generalizability is limited because very few studies included a wide range of racially diverse youth, with samples focusing primarily on socioeconomically diverse White youth and lower socioeconomic status youth of color, and therefore the recommendations are limited in applicability to a diverse community of mental health consumers.

### Pediatric bipolar disorder: combination pharmacotherapy, adverse effects, and treatment of high-risk youth [^e63f6675]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Treating bipolar disorder in pediatric patients is challenging because data from rigorous trials of pharmacotherapy in this population are still not plentiful enough. Furthermore, the treatment of children and adolescents is complicated by the frequent need to combine pharmacotherapies to address all bipolar symptoms as well as this population's elevated risk for experiencing side effects. Additionally, young patients with depressive episodes who are at high risk for developing bipolar disorder need careful treatment to prevent or delay the emergence of mania. Despite these challenges, clinicians should evaluate the existing pediatric literature, extrapolate evidence obtained from adult patients, and draw from clinical experience to guide treatment decisions for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.

Random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were conducted.

Study Selection

Included were studies reporting on the frequency of (1) mood disorders in antipsychotic-treated youth (≤ 19 years) and (2) antipsychotic use in youth with mood disorders.

Two independent investigators abstracted data on study, patient, and treatment characteristics.

Results

Forty-one studies were meta-analyzed (N = 518,919, mean ± SD age = 12.8 ± 1.8 years, males = 65.7%). Altogether, 24.2% of antipsychotic-treated youth had a mood disorder diagnosis (studies = 34, depression spectrum disorder = 10.9%, bipolar spectrum disorder = 13.6%). In longitudinal studies, the overall proportion increased significantly from 17.3% in 2000 (range, 1996–2009) to 24.5% in 2006 (range, 2004–2011) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26–1.79; P < .0001). This increase was driven entirely by bipolar spectrum diagnoses (2001 = 11.1%, 2006 = 16.3%, P < .0001), rather than depression spectrum diagnoses (2001 = 9.1%, 2007 = 9.2%, P = 0.77). Among youth with mood disorders (8 studies), 24.0% received antipsychotics (depression spectrum disorder = 4.6%; bipolar spectrum disorder = 44.0%).

Conclusions

The proportion of youth with mood disorder diagnoses increased significantly among antipsychotic-treated youth, driven entirely by an increase in youth with bipolar spectrum disorders. Progress in understanding the reasons for these trends and for an evaluation of the appropriateness of the observed antipsychotic prescribing requires more detailed information than is available in traditional pharmacoepidemiologic databases.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^fa8e2ddd]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — APA versus NICE alignment and differences: While the NICE guideline recommends various psychotherapies depending on stepped care placement, the APA guideline recommends CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy and notes insufficient evidence to recommend particular treatments over others. The NICE guideline focuses its medication recommendation for moderate or severe depression on fluoxetine, and the APA guideline likewise recommends fluoxetine as a first line medication; if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the APA panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.

### Update on pediatric bipolar disorder [^99ee25fc]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents with a bipolar disorder experience mood dysregulation that is often chronic with little interepisodic recovery. Although bipolar disorder in youth is recognized by more and more clinicians, much is still not known regarding how best to accurately diagnose and effectively treat it. As a result, children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are often symptomatic for long periods of time before receiving appropriate treatment. In this review of the pediatric bipolar disorder literature, the phenomenology, longitudinal course, and risk factors associated with the illness' development are discussed. Also, recent research pertaining to neuroimaging and pharmacologic and psychological treatments are considered. Because pediatric bipolar disorder is such a pernicious condition, it is recommended that clinicians complete a careful assessment of mood symptoms and comorbid conditions when this illness is suspected so that they can provide treatments with the best chance of benefit in a timely manner.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^fa858603]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD) — prevalence, course, and risk factors are described. The prevalence of dysthymia (PDD) was reported to be 1.8% (lifetime) and 1.3% (past year), and nearly 30% of youth with MDD reported some form of suicidality in the past year, with more than 10% reporting a suicide attempt. Only 34% of adolescents with MDD were reported to receive disorder-specific treatment, and only 35% received treatment from the mental health sector. In prepubertal samples, the 3-month rate of any depressive disorder was estimated to be 0.5% to 1.9%, and in preschoolers using developmentally modified DSM criteria prevalence was reported to be less than 2.0%. From 2005 to 2014, the past year prevalence of MDD increased from 8.7% to 11.3% in adolescents. The median duration of MDD episodes is 1 to 2 months in community samples and 8 months in clinical samples, with approximately 10% of cases becoming chronic; PDD duration approximates 3 to 4 years. Recurrence is common, with adolescent recurrence rates estimated at 20% to 60% in 1 to 2 years and 70% after 5 years. The risk for bipolar disorder in prepubertal-onset depression is estimated at around 10% to 20%. Genetic vulnerability is substantial, with 40%-60% heritability, higher in adolescents than in children. Childhood adversities were associated with 57.1% of childhood-onset (up to age 13 years) mood disorders versus 20.5% to 30.5% of later-onset mood disorders.

Treatment planning and informed consent — children and adolescents with depressive disorders: Treatment planning derives from the diagnoses and clinical formulation, and high-quality treatment plans are safe, timely, effective, efficient, feasible, equitable, and child and family centered. A range of potentially effective treatments and other interventions should be explained in accordance with the cognitive and linguistic level of the parents/guardians and patient, prioritized according to the acuity, severity, distress, and impairment associated with each diagnosed disorder, and the clinician should provide sufficient information to enable the patient and parent/guardian to make an informed decision about treatment options. Level of care decisions are informed by diagnosis, the current severity of symptoms, comorbid medical or psychiatric disorders, the child's risk to self or others, prior illness course and complications, potential supports, and the treatment alliance. Many stakeholders agree on at least 4 basic elements of the informed consent process — capacity of the decision maker, disclosure by the clinician, confirmation of understanding, and free authorization of the plan — and these 4 elements translate into 5 components for discussion (the diagnosis; an explanation of the proposed treatment; the attendant risks and benefits of the proposed treatment; alternative treatments and their risks and benefits; and the risks and benefits of declining treatment). Strategies to improve comprehension can include providing written educational materials, multimedia presentations, decision-making worksheets, standardized consent forms, asking for a "repeat back," and engaging in extended back-and-forth discussions until understanding is achieved, with documentation providing evidence that the patient and parent/guardian were adequately prepared to provide assent and consent for treatment.

Are they really 'treatment resistant'?

Pharmacologically treatment-resistant depression is defined, in adults, by at least two prior treatment failures with adequate dose and duration. Similarly, pharmacologically treatment-resistant anxiety has been recently defined in adults as at least two separate failed full trials of pharmacological monotherapy with first-line agents approved for those disorders by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency or other equivalent regulatory agencies, and recommended by guidelines. Treatment-resistant depression and anxiety in children and young people are difficult to treat, with little research evidence to guide the practitioner. However, we need to review the history of treatment before concluding there is treatment resistance. Notably, significant numbers of people stop antidepressants when they have minor side effects which may have worn off if they had persevered. The amount of time needed to wait until side effects go away is very variable, but we would advise patients to persevere for a month if side effects are tolerable, before stopping.

It may be worth going back to re-try the antidepressant with psychoeducation and encouragement to persevere. A slower dose titration may also reduce the impact of side effects. It is also appropriate to increase the dose to BNF dose limits if tolerated. It is important to discuss with the patient and their families the risks and benefits of this strategy, and how this is outside the license for adolescents, but is an acceptable treatment for adults, and often used in adolescents.

A particularly concerning side effect of SSRIs is increased suicidal thoughts. These have only been demonstrated to be significantly higher than placebo in randomised controlled trials of depression, not of anxiety, and indeed the UK 2003 MHRA and USA 2004 FDA Black Box warnings only applied to adolescent depression, not anxiety disorders. However, negative results in anxiety may reflect a lower baseline risk and fewer total participants in trials. Hence, prescribers need to watch carefully for suicidality. Due to the severe potential consequences of suicidal thoughts, many prescribers and families would choose not to continue SSRIs if they emerged.

2.2. Participants

Youth were recruited primarily from two specialty outpatient programs at UCLA Semel Institute – the Child and Adolescent Mood Disorders Program and the Center for the Assessment and Prevention of Prodromal States. Participants had to meet for a lifetime DSM-5 unipolar or bipolar mood disorder, including major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar mood disorder or unspecified depressive or bipolar disorder based on semi-structured interview using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents and/or current criteria for the psychosis-risk syndrome based on the Structured Interview for Prodromal States. Participants had to be aged 13 years, 0 months to 17 years, 11 months, fluent in English, able to attend and appropriately participate in all treatment sessions, and have at least one parent willing to join the treatment. All participants were also required to have access to a smartphone.

We excluded participants who were too acutely ill to participate in treatment in an outpatient setting and/or who would be disruptive to the other group participants. Specfically, participants with significant behavioral issues (e.g. aggression, oppositionality), active suicidality, substance abuse, or acute psychotic symptoms that would interfere with the treatment or require more intensive treatment were excluded from this study and referred elsewhere.

### Pediatric bipolar disorder: emerging diagnostic and treatment approaches [^a1cea122]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents who have bipolar disorder often are encountered in clinical settings and frequently require treatment with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. New screening and diagnostic tools are available to aid in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. Additional data supporting the use of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics in this population also are emerging. Combinations of existing psychotropics remain the most effective treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder at this point. This article reviews the phenomenology and clinical characteristics of pediatric bipolar disorder and current approaches to pharmacotherapy. It is becoming apparent that bipolar disorder is often a chronic disorder in children and adolescents, much like diabetes, and is best managed with a combination of medications and psychosocial therapy.

### Pharmacotherapy of child and adolescent depression [^8e505e22]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric depression is a prevalent and recurrent condition that persists into adulthood and carries significant impairment, morbidity, and risk of mortality. Although there has been a surge of pediatric antidepressant studies in recent years, depression remains largely understudied, unrecognized, and untreated in children and adolescents. Few antidepressant trials have yielded positive results in pediatric depression. Regulatory agencies recently issued warnings against the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and newer antidepressants in depressed children and adolescents because of a possible link between their use and the appearance or worsening of suicidal ideation or attempts. The authors review data on efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of pediatric depression to provide treating clinicians with a basis on which to guide their treatment recommendations.

How the APA clinical practice guideline compares to other clinical practice guidelines for treatment of depression — this section notes that various other organizations' guidelines are now considered to be outdated and highlights guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute, the Veteran's Affairs/Department of Defense, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The American Psychiatric Association's last guideline on depression focused on major depressive disorder in adults and is now listed as outdated; its main recommendations include overall psychiatric management. For patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder, antidepressant medication or psychotherapy were recommended as initial treatments; for moderate to severe major depressive disorder, a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy was recommended; and for severe major depressive disorder that was not responding to medication or psychotherapy or with associated catatonic or psychotic features, electroconvulsive therapy was recommended. The recommendations also included monitoring during the continuation phase of treatment, a maintenance phase of treatment, tapering of medication during the discontinuation phase, and consideration of psychiatric factors, psychosocial and demographic factors, and other co-occurring medical conditions. Like the American Psychiatric Association's guideline, the present American Psychological Association's guideline also includes recommendations for psychotherapy and for antidepressant medication; however, it more commonly recommends combinations of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication versus antidepressant medication alone and does not detail recommendations for the various stages of treatment.

### Depression in children and adolescents: evaluation and treatment… [^fc5d6d82]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment INITIAL MANAGEMENT The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend that primary care physicians counsel families and patients about depression and develop a treatment plan that includes setting specific goals involving functioning at home, at school, and with peers. ONGOING MANAGEMENT Treatment options for children and adolescents with depression include psychotherapy and anti-depressants. Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of talk therapy that focuses on changing behaviors by correcting faulty or potentially harmful thought patterns and generally includes five to 20 sessions. Whereas CBT focuses on cognition and behaviors, interpersonal psychotherapy concentrates on improving interpersonal relationships and typically includes around 12 to 16 sessions. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are the only two medications approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration to treat major depressive disorder in children and adolescents.

Fluoxetine is approved for patients eight years and older, and escitalopram is approved for patients 12 years and older. There are concerns of increased suicidality with the use of fluoxetine and escitalopram in this population. PHARMACOTHERAPY ALONE Three systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials including children and adolescents with major depressive disorder support the use of fluoxetine as the first-line antidepressant medication. 54 One trial of youth with major depression who declined antidepressants found that compared with self-selected treatment as usual, 12 weeks of CBT was associated with shorter time to treatment response and remission and improved depression scores through week 52 but not in weeks 53 to 104. 55 In children and adolescents with subclinical depression, one systematic review found moderate-quality evidence that CBT is associated with a small effect on depressive symptoms vs. waitlist or no treatment.
56.

COMBINED THERAPY Evidence from a good-quality randomized trial suggests that adolescents are most likely to achieve remission with 12 weeks of combined therapy with fluoxetine and CBT compared with either therapy alone or placebo. 58 Children and adolescents with moderate or severe depression or persistent mild depression should be treated with fluoxetine or escitalopram in conjunction with CBT or other talk therapy. 47, 57–59 If combination therapy is not used, monotherapy with an antidepressant or psychotherapy is recommended, although the likelihood of benefit is lower. 46, 52–56.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination for acute treatment of children and adolescents with depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^cb9fc811]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Background

Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents. Antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination are often used in routine clinical practice; however, available evidence on the comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions is inconclusive. Therefore, we sought to compare and rank all available treatment interventions for the acute treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ProQuest, CINAHL, LiLACS, international trial registries, and the websites of regulatory agencies for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials from database inception until Jan 1, 2019. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 16 antidepressants, seven psychotherapies, and five combinations of antidepressant and psychotherapy that are used for the acute treatment of children and adolescents (≤ 18 years old and of both sexes) with depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. Trials recruiting participants with treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, treatment duration of less than 4 weeks, or an overall sample size of fewer than ten patients were excluded. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy of outcome measures, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using validated methods. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and acceptability (treatment discontinuation due to any cause). We estimated summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with credible intervals (CrIs) using network meta-analysis with random effects. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020841.

Findings

From 20366 publications, we included 71 trials (9510 participants). Depressive disorders in most studies were moderate to severe. In terms of efficacy, fluoxetine plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was more effective than CBT alone (-0·78, 95% CrI -1·55 to -0·01) and psychodynamic therapy (-1·14, -2·20 to -0·08), but not more effective than fluoxetine alone (-0·22, -0·86 to 0·42). No pharmacotherapy alone was more effective than psychotherapy alone. Only fluoxetine plus CBT and fluoxetine were significantly more effective than pill placebo or psychological controls (SMDs ranged from -1·73 to -0·51); and only interpersonal therapy was more effective than all psychological controls (-1·37 to -0·66). Nortriptyline (SMDs ranged from 1·04 to 2·22) and waiting list (SMDs ranged from 0·67 to 2·08) were less effective than most active interventions. In terms of acceptability, nefazodone and fluoxetine were associated with fewer dropouts than sertraline, imipramine, and desipramine (ORs ranged from 0·17 to 0·50); imipramine was associated with more dropouts than pill placebo, desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine plus CBT, and vilazodone (2·51 to 5·06). Most of the results were rated as "low" to "very low" in terms of confidence of evidence according to Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis.

Interpretation

Despite the scarcity of high-quality evidence, fluoxetine (alone or in combination with CBT) seems to be the best choice for the acute treatment of moderate-to-severe depressive disorder in children and adolescents. However, the effects of these interventions might vary between individuals, so patients, carers, and clinicians should carefully balance the risk-benefit profile of efficacy, acceptability, and suicide risk of all active interventions in young patients with depression on a case-by-case basis.

### Somatic treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents [^ceb4d8e5]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The currently available data from randomized, controlled trials and a considerable amount of open clinical data suggest that adolescent-onset bipolar disorder probably responds to the same agents as adult-onset bipolar disorder. Research examining psychopharmacologic treatment approaches in the early-onset bipolar disorder is limited, however. Methodologic problems include small sample sizes, lack of comparison groups, retrospective designs, and lack of standardized measures. In addition, sometimes no clear differentiation is made between mania and bipolar disorder, the latter term being used broadly in the literature. Often the studies show that symptoms improve because of treatment, but the functioning of the patients does not improve significantly. More research is clearly needed in all aspects of this disorder but especially in examining the efficacy of various types of treatment, its longitudinal course, and diagnostic issues. The indications for, and the overall duration of, long-term maintenance therapy need further study. Many adolescents and children with bipolar disorder do not respond to any of the first-line pharmacologic treatments; therefore, studies with novel agents should be extended to patients in this age range. Furthermore, physicians will probably continue to use combination therapies when confronted by either lack of efficacy or delayed onset of efficacy with a single agent. Thus, such resultant drug-drug interactions also should also be systematically studied [97].

### Pediatric depression: an evidence-based update on treatment interventions [^2e43b338]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Depression in Children

Depression in children younger than 12 years of age is less prevalent than among adolescents; however, it can be reliably diagnosed in children as young as 3 years of age. There is significantly less evidence on the treatment of depression in children than their adolescent counterparts. A meta-analysis identified seven studies of psychotherapeutic interventions for children under the age of 13 years with depression, and found an effect size of 0.41, significantly different from zero (p = 0.03); many of these interventions involved CBT. A recent trial comparing psychoeducation alone with a parenting intervention found that both treatments reduced severity of depression in 3–7-year-olds, but that the parenting intervention demonstrated additional benefit for executive functioning and emotion-recognition skills. As noted previously, the only SSRI approved for use in depressed children under the age of 12 years is fluoxetine. Fluoxetine has demonstrated benefit for children with depression, and was even found to be more effective for children under the age of 12 years than adolescents in one study. The AAFP/US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines do caution PCPs that SSRIs, and fluoxetine, in particular, have "demonstrated harms" in the "risk of suicidality" in children, and that there is insufficient evidence to recommend psychotherapy, combination fluoxetine plus psychotherapy, or routine screening for depression in children. Clearly, more evidence is required before routine screening for depression and specific interventions can be recommended in younger children with depression; PCPs may wish to refer younger children with depression to mental health specialty care upon diagnosis.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — pediatric depression FDA approvals, dosing, and response timing — include that medications from the SSRI class marketed in the United States are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone, and currently only 2 SSRIs are FDA approved for depression in youth: fluoxetine for youth aged 8 years and older and escitalopram for youth aged 12 years and older; most SSRIs have long half-lives permitting single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine youth may require twice-daily dosing to avoid withdrawal side effects; modeling suggests early improvement with two-thirds of benefits by week 2 and maximal benefit by week 4, and this pharmacodynamic profile suggests that 2-month clinical SSRI trials may unnecessarily prolong an ineffective treatment if response or remission is not observed within the first 4 to 6 weeks.

### Special populations: treatment-resistant depression in children and adolescents [^0225026c]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a substantial public health challenge impacting at least 3 million adolescents annually in the United States. Depressive symptoms do not improve in approximately 30% of adolescents who receive evidence-based treatments. Treatment-resistant depression in adolescents is broadly defined as a depressive disorder that does not respond to a 2-month course of an antidepressant medication at a dose equivalent of 40 mg of fluoxetine daily or 8 to 16 sessions of a cognitive behavioral or interpersonal therapy. This article reviews historical work, recent literature on classification, current evidence-based approaches, and emerging interventional research.

APA adolescent depression — initial treatment recommendations state that for initial treatment of adolescent patients with depressive disorders, the panel recommends that clinicians offer cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for adolescents (IPT-A), with the strength listed as "Recommendation for use" and justification that, based on the literature reviewed that met the AMSTAR requirements, these were the only psychotherapy interventions with evidence of efficacy. The panel recommends fluoxetine as a first-line medication compared to other medications for adolescent patients with major depressive disorder, specifically when considering medication options, and there was insufficient evidence to recommend either treatment (psychotherapy or fluoxetine) over the other for major depressive disorder.

Clinical practice guideline — study characteristics across included studies indicate that studies had both mostly female and mostly White participants. Participants in 77% of studies were confirmed as having major depressive disorder (MDD), and participants in 23% of studies were confirmed as mixed, including various combinations of MDD, Dysthymia/PDD, or Not Otherwise Specified/Unspecified DD. Of the studies, 45% addressed nonpharmacological interventions, 40% addressed pharmacological interventions, and 15% addressed both.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of citalopram for the treatment of major depression in children and adolescents [^39df0d91]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Open-label trials with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram suggest that this agent is effective and safe for the treatment of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. The current study investigated the efficacy and safety of citalopram compared with placebo in the treatment of pediatric patients with major depression.

Method

An 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the safety and efficacy of citalopram with placebo in the treatment of children (ages 7–11) and adolescents (ages 12–17) with major depressive disorder. Diagnosis was established with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. Patients (N = 174) were treated initially with placebo or 20 mg/day of citalopram, with an option to increase the dose to 40 mg/day at week 4 if clinically indicated. The primary outcome measure was score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised; the response criterion was defined as a score of ≤ 28.

Results

The overall mean citalopram dose was approximately 24 mg/day. Mean Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised scores decreased significantly more from baseline in the citalopram treatment group than in the placebo treatment group, beginning at week 1 and continuing at every observation point to the end of the study (effect size = 2.9). The difference in response rate at week 8 between placebo (24%) and citalopram (36%) also was statistically significant. Citalopram treatment was well tolerated. Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were comparable in the placebo and citalopram groups (5.9% versus 5.6%, respectively). Rhinitis, nausea, and abdominal pain were the only adverse events to occur with a frequency exceeding 10% in either treatment group.

Conclusions

In this population of children and adolescents, treatment with citalopram reduced depressive symptoms to a significantly greater extent than placebo treatment and was well tolerated.

Child and adolescent populations — evidence scope for IPT-A and CBT: Most of the studies on IPT-A did not include information on long-term outcomes of treated participants, and for many of the studies of CBT reviewed by the panel, the CBT condition was compared with a waitlist condition rather than other active treatments, so the effect sizes of the outcomes in the CBT arm might be overstated given evidence that waitlist control conditions show greater effect sizes in favor of the active treatment than no treatment or usual treatment comparisons. Despite these concerns, IPT-A and CBT still present the best evidence that the field has to date on positive outcomes for the treatment of depression in youth.

Focused symptom rating scales for depression — Focused depression rating scales can support a depression diagnosis, characterize the nature and breadth of symptoms, and quantify pretreatment severity as a baseline for tracking response to treatment over time ("measurement-based treatment"). Freely available instruments with acceptable psychometric properties include the Patient Health Questionnaire — 9 (PHQ-9) modified for adolescents, the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) parent and child versions, and the Preschool Feelings Checklist. The APA also offers field-tested parent- and self-rated Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures for depression that explore depression endorsed on the Level 1 measure ("mild" or greater on any depression item) and self-rated Disorder-Specific Severity Measures for clinically diagnosed depression.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder

have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of escitalopram for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of escitalopram was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open-label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged (7 to 11 years) who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 7 years of age.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram.
