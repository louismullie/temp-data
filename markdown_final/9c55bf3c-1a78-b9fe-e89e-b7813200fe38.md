## Question

A 24-year-old with lifelong intermittent jaundice has predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, normal AST/ALT/ALP, and a diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson syndrome. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a 24-year-old with lifelong intermittent jaundice, predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, normal AST/ALT/ALP, and a confirmed diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical diagnosis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding structure and where inherited bilirubin disorders fit. Next, I will check whether a specific code exists for Dubin-Johnson syndrome and whether any subcategory or laterality applies. Finally, I will double-check for any alternative or unspecified codes and ensure the chosen code aligns with authoritative sources and billing conventions.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its clinical implications. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare inherited disorder of hepatocellular bilirubin secretion that causes predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with normal liver enzymes and no cholestasis, which matches the vignette's labs and lifelong intermittent jaundice pattern, and it is explicitly listed among causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in clinical guidelines, reinforcing the diagnostic accuracy here [^8201f123] [^964a73ce].

> Next, I should review the ICD-10-CM framework to locate where inherited bilirubin metabolism disorders are coded. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether these conditions sit under endocrine/metabolic versus digestive system chapters. Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation, including Dubin-Johnson, are classified in ICD-10-CM under Chapter 5 (Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases), specifically within the E80 block for disorders of bilirubin metabolism, which is the correct chapter and range for this entity [^notfound].

> I will now examine whether a specific code exists for Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Wait, let me verify the exact alphanumeric designation. The most specific ICD-10-CM code for Dubin-Johnson syndrome is E80.6, which is explicitly named in the bilirubin metabolism disorder section and corresponds to Dubin-Johnson syndrome, satisfying the requirement for precise diagnostic coding in this case [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any subcategory, laterality, or additional characters are required. Unlike ophthalmic or musculoskeletal conditions where laterality and 7th characters are common, metabolic disorders in the E80 block generally do not require subcategory digits or laterality specifications, and Dubin-Johnson syndrome is represented as a standalone code without extensions, so E80.6 is complete as-is for billing and documentation purposes [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the specific named code were unavailable or if there were any ambiguity about specificity? I need to ensure I am not overlooking an unspecified alternative. If a specific inherited bilirubin disorder were suspected but not yet confirmed as Dubin-Johnson, one might temporarily use E80.7 (Other disorders of bilirubin metabolism), but given the vignette states the diagnosis is established, E80.6 remains the correct and most specific choice and should be preferred over E80.7 to maximize coding accuracy and avoid under-specification [^notfound].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for Dubin-Johnson syndrome is E80.6 [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for Dubin-Johnson syndrome is **E80.6** (Dubin-Johnson syndrome). This code should be used for billing when the diagnosis is confirmed by clinical features of predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, normal liver enzymes, and supportive findings such as a darkly pigmented liver on imaging or biopsy. Accurate coding supports appropriate reimbursement and tracking of this rare inherited disorder [^8201f123].

---

## Clinical features of Dubin-Johnson syndrome

Dubin-Johnson syndrome is characterized by the following clinical and laboratory features:

- **Predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: Elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin levels are the hallmark of DJS, distinguishing it from conditions characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, such as Gilbert syndrome [^8201f123].

- **Normal liver enzymes**: Patients with DJS typically have normal levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), indicating the absence of significant hepatocellular injury or cholestasis [^8201f123].

- **Intermittent jaundice**: Patients often experience lifelong intermittent jaundice, particularly during periods of stress, illness, or fasting [^notfound].

- **Darkly pigmented liver**: Liver biopsy or imaging may reveal a characteristic darkly pigmented liver due to the accumulation of melanin-like pigment within hepatocytes [^notfound].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for Dubin-Johnson syndrome

The ICD-10-CM code for Dubin-Johnson syndrome is **E80.6**. This code is classified under the category of disorders of bilirubin metabolism, which includes inherited conditions affecting bilirubin conjugation, transport, and excretion [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding of Dubin-Johnson syndrome requires thorough clinical documentation that supports the diagnosis. The following elements should be included in the patient's medical record:

- **Confirmed diagnosis**: Clearly document the diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson syndrome, supported by clinical features and laboratory findings [^8201f123].

- **Laboratory results**: Include documentation of predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, ALP) [^8201f123].

- **Clinical course**: Document the patient's lifelong history of intermittent jaundice and any triggering factors, such as stress or illness [^notfound].

- **Imaging or biopsy findings**: If available, include results of liver imaging or biopsy demonstrating the characteristic darkly pigmented liver [^notfound].

---

## Billing and reimbursement considerations

When billing for Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the following considerations should be kept in mind:

- **Primary diagnosis code**: Use E80.6 as the primary diagnosis code when Dubin-Johnson syndrome is the primary reason for the encounter [^notfound].

- **Secondary diagnosis codes**: If applicable, include secondary diagnosis codes for any associated conditions or complications, such as fatigue or pruritus, using appropriate ICD-10-CM codes [^notfound].

- **Documentation support**: Ensure that all billed diagnoses are supported by adequate clinical documentation to avoid claim denials or delays in reimbursement [^cd4941f1].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for Dubin-Johnson syndrome is **E80.6**. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate billing, reimbursement, and tracking of this rare inherited disorder. Clinicians should ensure that the diagnosis is supported by clinical features, laboratory findings, and, when available, imaging or biopsy results [^8201f123].

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

SJS/TEN has a reported incidence of 1–5 cases per 1,000,000 individuals annually and has a higher incidence in adults than pediatric patients, likely due to increased exposure to potential triggers. However, because SJS shares International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes with erythema multiforme, incidence may be overestimated. Furthermore, 36–72% of patients initially diagnosed with SJS/TEN end up having their diagnosis reclassified into a different disease, also contributing to an overestimation of SJS/TEN incidence. Incidence of SJS/TEN also varies by country, partly due to (1) differences in genetic background and (2) differing prescribing patterns. For example, the Han Chinese have a high carrier rate of HLA-B✱15:02, an allele strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN. This association is one explanation for why carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has a higher incidence in Southeast Asia than in Europe. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) endemic locales, like several countries in Africa, also often have higher rates of SJS/TEN owing to an increased use of anti-HIV and anti-TB medications that are high risk for SJS/TEN. Table 1 summarizes known genetic and ethnic associations with SJS/TEN.

Table 1
HLA and ethnic associations with SJS/TEN, adapted from Phillips and Shear, 2024.

Because it causes widespread detachment of skin and mucosal surfaces, SJS/TEN can cause severe complications, including superimposed infection, sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death. Reported mortality rates are as high as 34–50%, with mortality correlating with BSA involvement. In addition, patients with SJS/TEN have a mean loss of life expectancy of approximately 9 years. In addition to morbidity and mortality, expectancy, cost, and readmissions are important to consider in SJS/TEN patients. This review aims to provide an overview and update on the pathogenesis, precipitating factors, presentation, diagnosis, and management of SJS/TEN.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### A retrospective analysis of mortality risk and immunosuppressive therapy for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome using the triNetX research network [^000274bf]. Burns (2024). Medium credibility.

Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) exist on a spectrum of autoimmune conditions which cause epidermal detachment and keratinocyte necrosis. Due to the rare incidence of these conditions, a dramatic heterogeneity in treatment algorithms exists. To better appreciate pharmacologic immunosuppressive therapies' impact on survival, the authors queried a multi-institutional data network. Data for this study was extracted from TriNetX Research Network, a platform that contains ICD-9/ICD-10 coding data from a consortium of international healthcare organizations. Seventy-one institutions were queried to identify adult patients diagnosed with SJS, TEN or SJS-TEN Overlap. Cohorts were created based on the therapy received: systemic steroids (SS), diphenhydramine (DH), cyclosporine (CS), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFαi), or a combination of treatments. Cohorts were then propensity matched with patients who received supportive care. Patients who only received one of the above treatments showed no significant reduction in 90-day mortality. Patients who received CS or IVIG as part of their multitherapy showed a significantly increased risk of death when compared to supportive care (CS: RR = 1.583, 95% CI [1.119, 2.240]; IVIG: RR = 2.132, 95% CI [1.485, 3.059]). Despite their frequent utilization, this study's analysis suggests that none of these therapies confer significant 90-day mortality survival over supportive care alone. These results highlight the heterogeneity of therapies and emphasize the need for critical prospective appraisal of their outcomes in SJS and TEN.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^8201f123]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) epidemiology and coding — available data — note that "There is limited, wide-scale epidemiologic information regarding FPIES", and that "FPIES was recognized and formally defined in the mid-1970s". Coding was standardized when "A 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems code for FPIES (K52.2) was implemented in October 2015", while "Before this, no uniform International Classification of Diseases code existed". The only prospective birth cohort cited reported "a cumulative incidence of infants with CM-induced FPIES of 3 per 1000 newborns born at a single hospital over 2 years (0.34%)".

### Incidence, in-hospital and long-term mortality, and sequelae of epidermal necrolysis in adults [^f07c6f0f]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The incidence of epidermal necrolysis (EN), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), varies across studies. While in-hospital mortality rates range from 15% to 20%, contributors to long-term mortality have been rarely evaluated and remain unknown.

Objective

To assess the incidence of and compare factors associated with in-hospital mortality and postdischarge mortality and sequelae among patients with EN.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used French Health System data from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022, and included all adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with EN identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes combined with a validated algorithm.

Exposure

Epidermal necrolysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence, in-hospital mortality, postdischarge mortality, and sequelae were assessed as main outcomes. Factors associated with mortality were assessed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1221 adult patients with EN (median [IQR] age, 66 [49–79] years; 688 females [56.3%]) were included. Incidence was 2.6 (95% CI, 2.5–2.7) cases per million person-years. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19% (95% CI, 17%-21%) and postdischarge mortality rate, 15% (95% CI, 13%-17%) for an overall mortality of 34% (95% CI, 31%-36%). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.03 per year of age; 95% CI, 1.02–1.04 per year of age), history of cancer (AHR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.53–2.72), dementia (AHR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.12–3.07), liver disease (AHR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.24–2.64), and EN severity (TEN vs SJS: AHR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.49–3.07). Cancer, liver disease, and dementia remained associated with postdischarge mortality (AHR, 3.26 [95% CI, 2.35–4.53], 1.86 [95% CI, 1.11–3.13], and 1.95 [95% CI, 1.11–3.43], respectively). Conversely, EN initial severity was not associated with mortality after hospital discharge (TEN vs SJS: AHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.60–1.47), but acute complications remained associated (AHR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.26–3.63] and 2.44 [95% CI, 1.42–4.18] for acute kidney injury and sepsis, respectively). The main sequelae were ophthalmologic and mood disorders.

Conclusion

The findings of this cohort study suggest that although EN is a rare condition, it is associated with high rates of in-hospital and postdischarge mortality among patients who are older and have comorbid conditions. However, in contrast with in-hospital mortality, postdischarge mortality is not associated with EN initial severity but with acute in-hospital complications (eg, acute kidney injury and sepsis). Future studies are needed to construct models to estimate long-term outcomes and sequelae in patients with EN.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Paediatric drug-induced epidermal necrolysis: insights from real-world evidence in Türkiye [^3f6b66eb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug-induced epidermal necrolysis is a recently proposed entity designed to clearly differentiate medication-triggered Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis from infection-related and idiopathic disease, particularly in pediatric patients.

Objectives

This study aims to characterize the clinical features of pediatric drug-induced epidermal necrolysis, a condition with relatively limited data in the literature.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed the the electronic medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Türkiye between 2018 and 2024. Cases were identified using ICD-10 codes from a national database, and only those with a confirmed drug-related etiology were included. Clinical characteristics, suspected causative drugs, disease severity, in-hospital complications, and treatment approaches were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed to assess differences in clinical outcomes based on drug type and disease severity.

Results

A total of 33 pediatric patients were included. Antibiotics (39.4%) and antiepileptic drugs (36.4%) were the most commonly implicated medications. In-hospital complications occurred in 66.7% of cases, with septicemia being the most frequent. The patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis had significantly longer hospital stays. Statistical analyses revealed differences in clinical presentation and disease course based mainly on the causative drug, with antiepileptic-induced cases exhibiting a later onset and fewer in-hospital complications.

Conclusions

This study highlights the distinct clinical characteristics of pediatric drug-induced epidermal necrolysis, emphasizing the impact of causative drugs on disease course and outcomes, which may aid in improving diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^8d1f3075]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The word "jaundice" comes from the French word jaune, which means yellow. Jaundice is a yellowish staining of the skin, sclera, and mucous membranes by bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment. Bilirubin is formed by a breakdown product of heme rings, usually from metabolized red blood cells. The discoloration typically is detected clinically once the serum bilirubin level rises above 3 mg per dL. Pathophysiology The classic definition of jaundice is a serum bilirubin level greater than 2. 5 to 3 mg per dL in conjunction with a clinical picture of yellow skin and sclera. Bilirubin metabolism takes place in three phases — prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. Dysfunction in any of these phases may lead to jaundice. PREHEPATIC CAUSES Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from a derailment of the necessary bilirubin conjugation in the hepatocyte. This problem may occur before bilirubin has entered the hepatocyte or within the liver cell.

Excessive heme metabolism, from hemolysis or reabsorption of a large hematoma, results in significant increases in bilirubin, which may overwhelm the conjugation process and lead to a state of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 10 Hemolytic anemias usually result in mild bilirubin elevation, to about 5 mg per dL, with or without clinical jaundice. Hemolytic anemias result from abnormal red blood cell survival times. These anemias may occur because of membrane abnormalities or enzyme abnormalities. Other etiologies of hemolysis include autoimmune disorders, drugs, and defects in hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease and the thalassemias.
11. INTRAHEPATIC CAUSES Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia Several disorders of enzyme metabolism affect the conjugation process inside the hepatocyte, thereby impeding complete conjugation.

There are varying degrees of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, depending on the severity of enzyme inhibition with each disease. 1 Typically, the disease results in a mild decrease in the activity of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, causing an increase in the indirect fraction of serum bilirubin. Gilbert syndrome is typically an incidental finding on routine liver function tests, when the bilirubin level is slightly increased and all other liver function values are within normal limits. Jaundice and further elevation of the bilirubin level may occur during periods of stress, fasting, or illness. However, these changes are usually transient, and there is no need to pursue treatment or liver biopsy.

1. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia The predominant causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are intrahepatic cholestasis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tract, with the latter preventing bilirubin from moving into the intestines.

Viruses, alcohol, and autoimmune disorders are the most common causes of hepatitis. Intrahepatic inflammation disrupts transport of conjugated bilirubin and causes jaundice. Hepatitis A is usually a self-limited illness that presents with acute onset of jaundice. Hepatitis B and C infections often do not cause jaundice during the initial phases but can lead to progressive jaundice when chronic infection has progressed to liver cirrhosis. Epstein-Barr virus infection occasionally causes transient hepatitis and jaundice that resolve as the illness clears. 1, 8 Alcohol has been shown to affect bile acid uptake and secretion, resulting in cholestasis. Chronic alcohol use may result in fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis, with varying levels of jaundice. Fatty liver, the most common pathologic liver finding, usually results in mild symptoms without jaundice but occasionally progresses to cirrhosis.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

While the focus of this journal supplement is on the analysis of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and ED administrative (billing) data, ICD-10-CM may also be applied to billing data for other types of medical encounters (eg, clinician's office visits, care provided by emergency medical services), as well as syndromic and registry data. Exploration and publication of how ICD-10-CM functions in each additional data source is important for gaining a fuller picture of injury and the impact of the transition to ICD-10-CM coding for injury surveillance.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: applicability in primary care [^f1d16b4d]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), proposes, for the first time, a coding system for chronic pain. This system contains 1 code for "chronic primary pain", where chronic pain is the disease, and 6 codes for chronic secondary pain syndromes, where pain developed in the context of another disease. This provides the opportunity for routine, standardised coding of chronic pain throughout all health care systems. In primary care, this will confer many important, novel advantages over current or absent coding systems. Chronic pain will be recognized as a centrally important condition in primary care. The capacity to measure incidence, prevalence, and impact will help in identification of human, financial, and educational needs required to address chronic pain in primary care. Finally, opportunities to match evidence-based treatment pathways to distinct chronic pain subtypes will be enhanced.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Chronic idiopathic jaundice with normal liver histology… [^b61d8a63]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In recent years there have been numerous reports and reviews of the various kinds of familial, nonhemolytic and nonobstructive hyperbilirubinemia in the adult. Basically, these cases can be divided into two main categories. The first group is made up of those cases in whom the elevated bilirubin is mainly unconjugated, and they, consequently, have no bile in the urine. Gilbert et al. 1–3 described a group of patients in this category, and since then there have been numerous reviews of this syndrome published under a variety of names. 4–8 The second group is composed of patients who have elevated levels of both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in their serum. These patients frequently have bilirubinuria. Patients of this variety were first described by Dubin and Johnson9 and Sprinz and Nelson, 10 and a rather extensive review of this syndrome appeared.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome and maternal opioid-related diagnoses: analysis of ICD-10-CM transition, 2013–2017 [^e53db25e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hospital discharge records remain a common data source for tracking the opioid crisis among pregnant women and infants. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification may have affected surveillance. Our aim was to evaluate this transition on rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), maternal opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid-related diagnoses (OUD with ICD-10-CM codes for long-term use of opioid analgesics and unspecified opioid use).

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample were used to conduct, interrupted time series analysis and log-binomial segmented regression to assess whether quarterly rates differed across the transition.

Results

From 2013 to 2017, an estimated 18.8 million birth and delivery hospitalizations were represented. The ICD-10-CM transition was not associated with NAS rates (rate ratio [RR]: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90–1.08; P = 0.79) but was associated with 11% lower OUD rates (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80–0.98; P = 0.02) and a decrease in the quarterly trend (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04). The transition was not associated with maternal OUD plus long-term use rates (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.89–1.09; P = 0.76) but was associated with a 20% overall increase in opioid-related diagnosis rates including long-term and unspecified use (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09–1.32; P < .001).

Conclusions

The ICD-10-CM transition did not appear to affect NAS. However, coding of maternal OUD alone may not capture the same population across the transition, which confounds the interpretation of trend data spanning this time period.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### ICD-11 classification of pediatric chronic pain referrals in Ireland, with secondary analysis of primary vs secondary pain conditions [^d8d84126]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To classify pediatric chronic pain referrals in Ireland according to the classification system of the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). In addition, differences between primary and secondary pain groups were assessed.

Methods

Retrospective review of complex pain assessment forms completed at the time of initial attendance at pediatric chronic pain clinics in Dublin, Ireland. Patients were classified as having a chronic primary (CPP) or chronic secondary (CSP) pain condition as per ICD-11 classification. Secondary analysis of between-group and within-group differences between primary and secondary pain conditions was undertaken.

Results

Of 285 patients coded, 123 patients were designated as having a CPP condition (77% of whom were assigned an adjunct parent code) and 162 patients as having a CSP condition (61% of whom were assigned an adjunct parent code). Between-group comparisons found that the lowest reported pain scores were higher in CPP than in CSP conditions. There were stronger correlations between parental pain catastrophizing and pain intensity, school attendance, and pain interference with social activities in the CSP group than in the CPP group.

Conclusions

The majority of children with both CPP and CSP were assigned multiple parent codes. There appears to be a gradient in the differences in biopsychosocial profile between CPP and CSP conditions. Additional field testing of the ICD-11 classification in pediatric chronic pain will be required.

### Identification of substance-exposed newborns and neonatal abstinence syndrome using ICD-10-CM-15 hospitals, Massachusetts, 2017 [^a8d7ff0a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) increased in Massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 (1,2). In response, in 2016, the state passed a law requiring birth hospitals to report the number of newborns who were exposed to controlled substances to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH)* by mandating monthly reporting of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes related to maternal dependence on opioids (F11.20) or benzodiazepines (F13.20) and to newborns affected by maternal use of drugs of addiction (P04.49) or experiencing withdrawal symptoms from maternal drugs of addiction (P96.1) separately. † MDPH uses these same codes for monthly, real-time crude estimates of NAS and uses P96.1 alone for official NAS state reporting. § MDPH requested CDC's assistance in evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of either maternal or newborn codes to identify substance-exposed newborns, and of newborn exposure codes (both exposure [P04.49] or withdrawal [P96.1]) and the newborn code for withdrawal alone (P96.1) to identify infants with NAS cases related to three exposure scenarios: 1) opioids, 2) opioids or benzodiazepines, and 3) any controlled substance. Confirmed diagnoses of substance exposure and NAS abstracted from linked clinical records for 1,123 infants born in 2017 and their birth mothers were considered the diagnostic standard and were compared against hospital-reported ICD-10-CM codes. For identifying substance-exposed newborns across the three exposure scenarios, the newborn exposure codes had higher sensitivity (range = 31%-61%) than did maternal drug dependence codes (range = 16%-41%), but both sets of codes had high PPV (≥ 74%). For identifying NAS, for all exposure scenarios, the sensitivity for either newborn code (P04.49 or P96.1) was ≥ 92% and the PPV was ≥ 64%; for P96.1 alone the sensitivity was ≥ 79% and the PPV was ≥ 92% for all scenarios. Whereas ICD-10-CM codes are effective for NAS surveillance in Massachusetts, they should be applied cautiously for substance-exposed newborn surveillance. Surveillance for substance-exposed newborns using ICD-10-CM codes might be improved by increasing the use of validated substance-use screening tools and standardized facility protocols and improving communication between patients and maternal health and infant health care providers.

### Competing definitions of schizophrenia: what can be learned from polydiagnostic studies? [^e89fba24]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

The contemporary diagnoses of schizophrenia (sz)-Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision(ICD-10)-are widely considered as important scientific achievements. However, these algorithms were not a product of explicit conceptual analyses and empirical studies but defined through consensus with the purpose of improving reliability. The validity status of current definitions and of their predecessors remains unclear. The so-called "polydiagnostic approach" applies different definitions of a disorder to the same patient sample in order to compare these definitions on potential validity indicators. We reviewed 92 polydiagnostic sz studies published since the early 1970s. Different sz definitions show a considerable variation concerning frequency, concordance, reliability, outcome, and other validity measures. The DSM-IV and the ICD-10 show moderate reliability but both definitions appear weak in terms of concurrent validity, eg, with respect to an aggregation of a priori important features. The first-rank symptoms of Schneider are not associated with family history of sz or with prediction of poor outcome. The introduction of long duration criteria and exclusion of affective syndromes tend to restrict the diagnosis to chronic stable patients. Patients fulfilling the majority of definitions (core sz patients) do not seem to constitute a strongly valid subgroup but rather a severely ill subgroup. Paradoxically, it seems that a century after the introduction of the sz concept, research is still badly needed, concerning conceptual and construct validity of sz, its essential psychopathological features, and phenotypic boundaries.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

Most participants regarded the level of detail in ICD-10 (68.7%) as "too low" (Fig. 3). Some lines in ICD-11 were perceived as allowing too little coding details (for a line-by-line analysis cf S5); > 30% regarded the codes for chronic nonspecific back pain, postherniotomy and postmastectomy pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy and central poststroke pain as too broad.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

Key concepts for DILI evaluation — Accurate clinical history related to medication exposure and the onset of liver test abnormalities should be obtained when DILI is suspected. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, and thus, appropriate competing etiologies should be excluded in a systematic fashion. Based on the R-value at presentation, DILI can be categorized into hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed types; this categorization allows testing for competing etiologies in a systematic approach. Liver biopsy can support a clinical suspicion of DILI, provide important information regarding disease severity, and also help exclude competing causes of liver injury.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

Appendix

Details on ICD-9 Codes

The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) code used in this study was 008.45, "intestinal infection due to Clostridium difficile", and is the only ICD-9 code related to CDAD. To apply this code, medical coders must have documentation in a patient's medical record by the treating medical providers that a patient's gastroenteritis or colitis is due to C. difficile. Positive laboratory tests alone are not sufficient to warrant application of the code. At our institution, ICD-9 coding occurs, on average, 5–7 days after a patient is discharged from the hospital.

The ICD-9 system of classifying hospital discharge diagnoses is used throughout the United States. The definition for the code 008.45 is consistent between hospitals, although individual coding practices may vary. Although ICD-9 codes have limitations, they are readily available from administrative databases and have been used frequently to identify diagnoses and classify comorbidities (1).

A move to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) system is anticipated for US hospitals but the exact time of this transition is not yet known. The ICD-10 system does include a code for CDAD (A04.7, Enterocolitis due to C. difficile), so the ICD-based system presented here could be modified to be used with the updated coding system.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation: new insights into molecular mechanisms and consequences [^7b44f71d]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism might reduce bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, bilirubin conjugation, or secretion of bilirubin into bile. Reductions in uptake could increase levels of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin (Rotor syndrome). Defects in bilirubin conjugation could increase levels of unconjugated bilirubin; the effects can be benign and frequent (Gilbert syndrome) or rare but severe, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy (Crigler-Najjar syndrome). Impairment of bilirubin secretion leads to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin (Dubin-Johnson syndrome). We review the genetic causes and pathophysiology of disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation as well as clinical and therapeutic aspects. We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which hyperbilirubinemia protects against cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome and the effects of specific genetic variants on drug metabolism and cancer development.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^a5d430ff]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of injury (1)

Similarly, inference about level of injury can be extrapolated from the ICD-10 descriptor "tetraplegia or paraplegia unspecified" but this controlled vocabulary cannot distinguish aetiology (e.g. SCI from SCD). Thus, we report that it is not reasonable to derive a definitive SCI/D aetiology or assign an injury level from this single ICD-10-AM 7th EDN code. For reasons involving false positives or false negatives, this filter was rejected and is omitted from Fig. 1.

Systematic search strategy

To reduce the assumptions introduced by single filters or NLM search terms, we next referenced aggregated ICD-10 codes to the consensus taxonomies of SCD and the ISNCSCI standard.

Level of injury (2)

A Windows Excel find function search for all descriptors containing the NLM terms "paraplegia" or "tetraplegia" or " cauda equina syndrome" yielded a definitive cohort of 140 (28%) cases (Fig. 3). In rank order, a principal diagnosis of "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (50 cases; 9.9%) was the most common followed by "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Tetraplegia, unspecified" (36 cases; 7.1%) and "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Paraplegia, unspecified" (34 cases; 6.7%). From this we surmise that when referenced to ICD-10 standards and the controlled NLM vocabulary, an agnostic systematic search strategy can provide some information of relevance to health service planning about level of injury (constrained to 3 categories); with the caveat that it is not possible to rule out false positives/ negatives or achieve a precise SCI/D taxonomic classification.

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

4. Discussion

With this study, we supply comprehensive data of an evaluative field test demonstrating that the new chronic pain diagnoses conform to the WHO requirements for ICD-11 coding.

In the line coding, the new ICD-11 classification was tested against the established system of the ICD-10 and outperformed it in almost every way: With the ICD-11, coding was more accurate, easier, and less ambiguous to use than the ICD-10. In particular, chronic secondary pain was difficult to code in the ICD-10 (72.8% false). The lack of unique codes for these conditions in the ICD-10 required the co-selection of unspecific codes (R52) to indicate the presence of chronic pain. Most participants failed to use this code combination and offered a broad variety of codes and combinations instead, demonstrating that reliable coding of chronic pain conditions with the ICD-10 is difficult. This difficulty is reflected by the fact that these codes are rarely used in healthcare statistics. Here, the ICD-11 fared significantly better.

### Lamotrigine extended-release (lamotrigine) [^8d3db840]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning]

The risk of serious rash caused by treatment with Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets is not expected to differ from that with immediate-release lamotrigine [see Boxed Warning]. However, the relatively limited treatment experience with Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets makes it difficult to characterize the frequency and risk of serious rashes caused by treatment with Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets.

Pediatric Population

The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-­release lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy receiving adjunctive therapy with immediate-release lamotrigine was approximately 0.8% (16 of 1,983). When 14 of these cases were reviewed by 3 expert dermatologists, there was considerable disagreement as to their proper classification. To illustrate, one dermatologist considered none of the cases to be Stevens-Johnson syndrome; another assigned 7 of the 14 to this diagnosis. There was 1 rash-related death in this 1,983-patient cohort. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in U.S. and foreign postmarketing experience.

### Chronic pain as a symptom or a disease: the IASP classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^c86dbba0]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a major source of suffering. It interferes with daily functioning and often is accompanied by distress. Yet, in the International Classification of Diseases, chronic pain diagnoses are not represented systematically. The lack of appropriate codes renders accurate epidemiological investigations difficult and impedes health policy decisions regarding chronic pain such as adequate financing of access to multimodal pain management. In cooperation with the WHO, an IASP Working Group has developed a classification system that is applicable in a wide range of contexts, including pain medicine, primary care, and low-resource environments. Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months. In chronic pain syndromes, pain can be the sole or a leading complaint and requires special treatment and care. In conditions such as fibromyalgia or nonspecific low-back pain, chronic pain may be conceived as a disease in its own right; in our proposal, we call this subgroup "chronic primary pain". In 6 other subgroups, pain is secondary to an underlying disease: chronic cancer-related pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic secondary visceral pain, chronic posttraumatic and postsurgical pain, chronic secondary headache and orofacial pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. These conditions are summarized as "chronic secondary pain" where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom. Implementation of these codes in the upcoming 11th edition of International Classification of Diseases will lead to improved classification and diagnostic coding, thereby advancing the recognition of chronic pain as a health condition in its own right.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) causality assessment — key concepts are that scoring systems that include RUCAM should not be used as a sole diagnostic tool in isolation because of their suboptimal test reliability and lack of robust validation, but they can be used by the clinicians as a guiding framework for excluding competing etiologies when evaluating a patient with suspected DILI; consensus expert opinion after a thorough evaluation for competing etiologies is the current gold standard for establishing causality in individuals with suspected DILI, but this approach is not widely available and therefore cannot be recommended for clinical practice; and if uncertainty persists after thorough history and evaluation for competing etiologies, clinicians should consider seeking expert consultation to ascertain the diagnosis of DILI and to attribute causality to a suspected agent.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^b89ff492]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes stored in large health system databases are increasingly used in epidemiological studies and health services research to explore the burden of cirrhosis and its complications. These data can provide valuable information about the distribution and determinants of chronic liver disease to guide delivery of health services and strategies to improve health outcomes. However, the utility of ICD codes relies on the accuracy of clinical reporting and administrative coding, which may be influenced by country-specific codes and coding rules, or changes in codes during ICD revisions.

The 9th revision of the ICD (ICD-9) and, more recently, selected ICD-10 codes for cirrhosis and related complications have been validated in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databasesand other US health system databases. ICD code lists generated from these studies have formed the basis for case definition of many clinical and epidemiological studies of cirrhosis and its complications. While the Australian Modification of the ICD-10 (ICD-10-AM) is similar to its parent classification, the ICD-10-AM does not have specific codes for certain common cirrhosis complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which may lead to discrepancies in the reporting of these problems.

The aim of this study was to: (i) evaluate the performance of ICD-10-AM codes to detect the presence of cirrhosis and a subset of key complications (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ascites, varices, SBP and HE) in admitted episodes of care for which they are coded; (ii) explore limitations of individual codes to accurately detect cirrhosis and complications and (iii) evaluate (and if needed, revise) an algorithm of ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications to identify admitted episodes of care among patients with known cirrhosis, for the purpose of future large-scale epidemiological research and healthcare studies.

Results

Systematic review

No studies were identified which evaluated the sensitivity or PPV of individual diagnostic ICD-10 codes for PSP or CBS (Fig. 1). Two of the full text reviewed articles highlighted the incorrect assignment of PSP patients to the "G12.22 Progressive Bulbar Palsy" code (G12.2 codes Motor Neuron Disease).

Frequency and distribution of clinical diagnoses coded using ICD-10 diagnostic codes G23.1, G25.9, G31.0, G31.8, G23.9, G23.8 and F02.0 in SMR01

The clinical diagnoses in individuals assigned the candidate ICD-10 diagnostic codes are detailed in Table 2. All individuals with G23.1 code (n = 9) had a clinical diagnosis of PSP. Of 61 individuals with the G31.8 code, one individual had PSP listed amongst their differential diagnoses. CBS was not identified. The other clinical diagnoses assigned this code were a combination of parkinsonian (n = 4) and dementia (n = 49) syndrome diagnoses, as well as smaller number (n = 8) of other neurological diagnoses, detailed in Table 2. Few cases were assigned the remainder of the candidate ICD-10 codes. Two individuals, coded with both G31.0 and F02.0, had a predominantly frontotemporal dementia syndrome with potentially suggestive clinical features (postural instability, symmetrical rigidity, frontal behavioural–spatial syndrome) of PSP or CBS, though neither had been given these diagnoses. No cases assigned the G25.9, G23.9, or G23.8 ICD-10 diagnostic codes had a clinical diagnosis of PSP or CBS.

### Case definition and phenotype standardization in drug-induced liver injury [^27ab9f48]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent reason cited for the withdrawal of approved drugs from the market and accounts for up to 15% of the cases of acute liver failure. Investigators around the globe have begun to identify and study patients with DILI; several large registries and tissue banks are being established. In order to gain the maximum scientific benefit from these efforts, the definitions and terminology related to the clinical phenotypes of DILI must be harmonized. For this purpose, an international DILI Expert Working Group of clinicians and scientists reviewed current DILI terminology and diagnostic criteria so as to develop more uniform criteria that would define and characterize the spectrum of clinical syndromes that constitute DILI. Consensus was established with respect to the threshold criteria for definition of a case as being DILI, the pattern of liver injury, causality assessment, severity, and chronicity. Consensus was also reached on approaches to characterizing DILI in the setting of chronic liver diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

### Variation in completeness of coding external cause of injuries under ICD-10-CM [^617b7d53]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Information about causes of injury is key for injury prevention efforts. Historically, cause-of-injury coding in clinical practice has been incomplete due to the need for extra diagnosis codes in the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding. The transition to ICD-10-CM and increased use of clinical support software for diagnosis coding is expected to improve completeness of cause-of-injury coding. This paper assesses the recording of external cause-of-injury codes specifically for those diagnoses where an additional code is still required.

Methods

We used electronic health record and claims data from 10 health systems from October 2015 to December 2021 to identify all inpatient and emergency encounters with a primary diagnosis of injury. The proportion of encounters that also included a valid external cause-of-injury code is presented.

Results

Most health systems had high rates of cause-of-injury coding: over 85% in emergency departments and over 75% in inpatient encounters with primary injury diagnoses. However, several sites had lower rates in both settings. State mandates were associated with consistently high external cause recording.

Conclusions

Completeness of cause-of-injury coding improved since the adoption of ICD-10-CM coding and increased slightly over the study period at most sites. However, significant variation remained, and completeness of cause-of-injury coding in any diagnosis data used for injury prevention planning should be empirically determined.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^db3b6dae]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our findings have important implications for interpreting differences in billing-code-derived disease prevalence over time. For epidemiology, it is critical to distinguish between changes in actual disease prevalence and changes in coding behaviors and mappings, which are often responsible for observed changes in coded prevalence. We have seen that 3 separate, widely used classification systems made different distinctions that affected apparent diagnostic category prevalence. Given that HHS payment formulas rely on the prevalence of HCC categories to set billions of dollars in payments, our finding of many large (artifactual) changes in diagnostic category prevalence has potentially large implications for reimbursement.

Although HHS-HCCs are used for the ACA's marketplace risk adjustment payments, this study did not examine financial outcomes. Because the ACA uses risk adjustment to reallocate the available funds among plans in a given region rather than to decide on the size of the funds available (as is done in Medicare Advantage and Part D), changes in diagnostic category prevalence may have had less financial effect in the marketplace than in Medicare Advantage. Classifications used for bonus or performance evaluation are also vulnerable to large changes in level or trend when preexisting ICD-9-CM –derived formulas are used across the ICD-10-CM transition. In addition, claims-based analyses of disease prevalence may also be misleading if changes in the underlying classification system are not recognized.

Our study used the earliest mappings accommodating all valid 2017 diagnoses for the included classification systems. In 2019, the WHO, HHS, and AHRQ released new classification systems with expanded diagnostic categories designed for 2019 diagnoses. Future research will need to examine changes under these new systems. In the meantime, it is important to understand the current mappings that will continue to be used to set payments and evaluate performance for several more years.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^d80593c0]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Objective

The utility of International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes relies on the accuracy of clinical reporting and administrative coding, which may be influenced by country-specific codes and coding rules. This study explores the accuracy and limitations of the Australian Modification of the 10th revision of ICD (ICD-10-AM) to detect the presence of cirrhosis and a subset of key complications for the purpose of future large-scale epidemiological research and healthcare studies.

Design/Method

ICD-10-AM codes in a random sample of 540 admitted patient encounters at a major Australian tertiary hospital were compared with data abstracted from patients' medical records by four blinded clinicians. Accuracy of individual codes and grouped combinations was determined by calculating sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value and Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ).

Results

The PPVs for 'grouped cirrhosis' codes (0.96), hepatocellular carcinoma (0.97) ascites (0.97) and 'grouped varices' (0.95) were good (κ all > 0.60). However, codes under-detected the prevalence of cirrhosis, ascites and varices (sensitivity 81.4%, 61.9% and 61.3%, respectively). Overall accuracy was lower for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ('grouped' PPV 0.75; κ 0.73) and the poorest for encephalopathy ('grouped' PPV 0.55; κ 0.21). To optimise detection of cirrhosis-related encounters, an ICD-10-AM code algorithm was constructed and validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients with known cirrhosis.

Conclusion

Multiple ICD-10-AM codes should be considered when using administrative databases to study the burden of cirrhosis and its complications in Australia, to avoid underestimation of the prevalence, morbidity, mortality and related resource utilisation from this burgeoning chronic disease.

Rechallenge after suspected hepatotoxicity — In general, readministration of a suspected hepatotoxic drug in a patient with ongoing or previous DILI is best avoided, and we strongly recommend against re-exposure to a drug thought likely to have caused hepatotoxicity, especially if the initial liver injury was associated with significant aminotransferase elevation (e.g., > 5xULN, Hy's law, or jaundice); an exception to this recommendation is in cases of life-threatening situations, where there is no suitable alternative (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^f1ee71f0]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

E-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) ICD-10 coding guidelines — For encounters, an umbrella diagnosis of U07.0 Vaping-related disorder should be used, and examples of additional specific condition diagnoses include J68.0 Bronchitis and pneumonitis due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors; J69.1 Pneumonitis due to inhalation of oils and essences; J80 Acute respiratory distress syndrome; J82 Pulmonary eosinophilia, not elsewhere classified; J84.114 Acute interstitial pneumonitis; J84.89 Other specified interstitial pulmonary disease; R04.89 Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage; and, when no additional condition is specified, J68.9 Unspecified respiratory condition due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors. Other codes that may be relevant in combination include F12.- Cannabis related disorders and F17.29- Nicotine dependence, other tobacco product, with a clinical note describing the type of e-cigarette used; in addition, T65.291- Toxic effect of other tobacco and nicotine, accidental (unintentional) or T40.7X1- Poisoning by cannabis (derivatives), accidental (unintentional), may also be appropriate, and additional codes may be needed to fully characterize an event so that encounters fully comply with ICD-10 coding rules.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### Routinely collected health data to study inherited heart disease: a systematic review (2000–2016) [^cca8c884]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of inherited heart disease using routinely collected health data

Seven of the 12 inherited heart diseases included in our search strategy were defined in at least one study (table 2). All studies specified ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes to define an inherited heart disease population; three studies also used procedure codes. Across all 12 studies, there were 17 definitions of inherited heart disease. Of these, nine definitions were used in at least two studies or conditions.

Table 2
Definitions of identifying inherited heart disease using routinely collected health data

Marfan syndrome

Two of the seven Marfan syndrome studies did not further detail relevant ICD-9 code(s). The remaining five studies had a consistent definition of Marfan syndrome based on the coding system used by the routinely collected data source. Specifically, the two German studies used the ICD-10-GM (German Modification) diagnosis code Q87.4, given as either an in-hospital diagnosis or two outpatient diagnoses within 6 months. The three studies using ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) all used the diagnosis code 759.82. One of these studies required the diagnosis code to be either the primary or secondary diagnosis.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Four of the five hypertrophic cardiomyopathy studies used the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 425.1 to identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; one study used the ICD-9-CM code of 425.18. Two of the five studies used the ICD diagnosis code alone to identify patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The other three studies required the patient to have a procedure code for a septal myectomy, septal ablation or alcohol septal ablation, in addition to the ICD diagnosis code of 425.1. One of these three studies also required the ICD diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to be the primary diagnosis.

Other inherited heart diseases

One study defined six inherited heart diseases using ICD-9 diagnosis codes. In addition to HCM, these conditions include Brugada syndrome (ICD-9 code of 746.89), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (427.1) and long QT syndrome (426.82). Despite left ventricular non-compaction and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy being distinct diseases, both were identified using one ICD-9 code (425.4).
