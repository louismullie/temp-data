## Question

can bipap be used for sleep apnea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether and when BiPAP can be used for sleep apnea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical entities and first-line therapies. Then, I should verify evidence and guidelines for BiPAP in OSA. Next, I will examine BiPAP's role in CSA and heart failure contexts. After that, I need to check special populations and safety concerns. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and double-check for any contradictions or nuances I might have missed [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS] [^111qG3vy].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and default modalities. OSA is a disorder of upper-airway collapse with preserved drive, where CPAP or APAP is the standard first-line therapy because a single continuous (or auto-adjusting) pressure splints the airway; CSA is a disorder of reduced or absent central respiratory drive, where CPAP is often tried first and ASV is typically preferred if CPAP fails, with BiPAP reserved for select scenarios, not as routine first-line for either OSA or CSA [^113Hxugf] [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS] [^111qG3vy].

> Now, focusing on OSA, I should verify whether BiPAP improves adherence or outcomes compared with CPAP/APAP in unselected adults. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions: contemporary AASM guidance recommends CPAP or APAP as routine therapy and does not endorse BiPAP over CPAP/APAP for standard OSA management, indicating BiPAP should not be used routinely in uncomplicated OSA [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS]. I initially thought BiPAP was the only device that improved compliance "28% vs 49%", but hold on, I should double-check that claim; the Cochrane review did not find a significant adherence advantage for BiPAP, and overall evidence does not show consistent superiority of BiPAP over CPAP for adherence in unselected OSA cohorts [^112wjFe3]. That said, in patients with pressure intolerance or exhalation discomfort, some studies show small, non-significant trends favoring BiPAP, suggesting a possible niche benefit, though not definitive [^116vcifY] [^114akdr4].

> Let me consider what to do when CPAP is poorly tolerated. I need to ensure basic adherence supports are optimized first: education, behavioral support, mask/interface optimization, heated humidification, and early follow-up, as recommended by AASM and VA/DoD guidelines and supported by Cochrane analyses of adherence interventions [^112uhZM3] [^113emarE] [^11589euo] [^11342PPu] [^116YkDgW]. Next, I should review modality adjustments: APAP is often favored over fixed CPAP to facilitate usage, and if exhalation intolerance persists at higher pressures, a trial of BiPAP may be reasonable, but expectations should be modest because robust superiority data are lacking in general OSA populations [^113x7oZY] [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS]. If PAP remains unacceptable, consider guideline-supported non-PAP alternatives such as mandibular advancement devices or positional therapy in appropriate phenotypes and severities, recognizing CPAP generally has greater physiologic efficacy but alternatives can achieve comparable clinical gains via better usage [^114mYWBp] [^116j8d9u] [^113PaXWG].

> Next, I should review BiPAP in CSA, where the physiology and guideline hierarchy differ. I will now examine the practice parameters: AASM recommends CPAP initially for CSA, and if ineffective, ASV is generally preferred; BiPAP in spontaneous-timed mode is a conditional option typically after inadequate response to CPAP, ASV, and even oxygen in heart-failure–related CSA, meaning BiPAP is not first- or second-line for most CSA phenotypes [^111qG3vy] [^114L3Nt4]. ERS guidance similarly emphasizes CPAP first and prioritizes ASV for treatment-persistent CSA, reflecting better comparative control of central events; BiPAP may be considered in select contexts but is not the routine choice for CSA [^116uuHm3] [^113qDyMv].

> But wait, what about heart failure, where safety nuances matter for servo-ventilation. I need to check the LVEF threshold carefully: ASV is contraindicated in stable HFrEF with LVEF ≤ 45% due to increased cardiovascular mortality in SERVE-HF; in those with LVEF > 45% or mild HF-CSA, ASV can be considered, whereas prolonged CPAP should not be continued if it fails to suppress CSA, and BiPAP is not promoted as a clearly safer substitute but may be considered case-by-case when other options fail or are contraindicated [^115MFKf5] [^114L3Nt4] [^117TZw56] [^115bXti9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this does not mean BiPAP is categorically preferred in HFrEF; rather, it underscores that the evidence base is stronger for CPAP or oxygen trials and that device selection must be individualized along with HF optimization and careful monitoring [^114L3Nt4] [^117TZw56].

> I should also confirm opioid-induced CSA and treatment-emergent CSA positions. For opioid-associated CSA, ERS suggests considering ASV or BiPAP given the depressed drive and need for stabilizing ventilation, acknowledging limited head-to-head data and the pathophysiologic rationale for pressure support with a backup rate in selected cases; for treatment-emergent or treatment-persistent CSA on CPAP, definitions are standardized, and if clinically significant events persist, ASV is generally preferred over continuing CPAP alone, with BiPAP as a possible alternative when ASV is not available or not tolerated [^115e4oEU] [^113qDyMv] [^116uuHm3].

> Now, safety and perioperative considerations deserve attention. Let me check bariatric surgery data: case reports link postoperative BiPAP to massive bowel distension and anastomotic leaks after RYGB, prompting caution and close monitoring; countervailing observational series suggest PAP can sometimes be omitted postoperatively without excess harm in carefully managed settings, yet EASO recommends continuing CPAP or BiPAP immediately after surgery and for 3–6 months with specialist review to retitrate pressures and reassess need, underscoring individualized risk assessment and vigilant follow-up [^116Xid5a] [^115bFZGM] [^115epns3].

> Let me think about hypoventilation phenotypes such as OHS or COPD overlap, where ventilation, not just splinting, is needed. Although the provided documents do not include a definitive RCT in OHS, clinical logic and practice patterns favor BiPAP when hypercapnia or ventilatory failure is present, because IPAP–EPAP differentials can augment tidal ventilation; observational data in veterans show BiPAP prescriptions cluster with higher BMI, COPD, CHF, higher AHI, and more sleepiness, suggesting clinicians already channel BiPAP toward these complex phenotypes, while acknowledging the need for stronger comparative trials in this space [^111yktVN] [^117KY1ZU].

> I should now synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach and verify each step. For uncomplicated adult OSA, start with CPAP or APAP alongside structured education, mask optimization, and early troubleshooting; if pressure intolerance or high-pressure needs limit adherence, consider a trial of BiPAP, explaining that benefits on comfort and usage are possible but not assured; for persistent PAP intolerance, consider mandibular advancement or positional therapy in suitable phenotypes and severities and re-emphasize cardiovascular risk control and symptom targets rather than AHI alone in shared decision-making [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS] [^11589euo] [^11342PPu] [^114mYWBp]. For CSA, optimize underlying conditions, trial CPAP, and if central events persist and LVEF > 45% or CSA is not HF-related, ASV is typically preferred; reserve BiPAP-ST for rescue when CPAP and ASV are ineffective or contraindicated, documenting goals, safety, and close follow-up [^111qG3vy] [^114L3Nt4] [^116uuHm3].

> Hold on, I should verify a few guardrails. Oxygen should not be used as a standalone therapy for OSA when other recommended therapies are intolerable, which helps prevent misapplication of supplemental oxygen without airway stabilization; similarly, evidence for EPAP valves and several adjunctive therapies in OSA is insufficient to support routine use, so they should not displace guideline-backed PAP and oral appliance pathways outside of research or select circumstances [^1166bAEx] [^113DLPrN]. In heart failure with LVEF ≤ 45%, avoid ASV; if sleep apnea remains clinically significant, consider CPAP with close reassessment and refrain from persisting if CSA is not suppressed, individualizing any consideration of BiPAP-ST with multidisciplinary input and careful monitoring [^115MFKf5] [^117TZw56].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also reconcile the adherence narrative to avoid overstatement. Earlier I noted a claim that BiPAP uniquely improved adherence percentages, but on double-checking, the higher-quality systematic reviews show no consistent, clinically meaningful adherence advantage of BiPAP over CPAP in unselected OSA, whereas targeted subgroups with pressure intolerance may experience modest improvements; moreover, robust adherence gains often come from educational and behavioral supports rather than device mode alone, which should remain the foundation of any PAP optimization plan [^112wjFe3] [^114akdr4] [^11342PPu].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure clarity: BiPAP is generally not first-line for uncomplicated OSA, where CPAP/APAP is preferred; BiPAP is reasonable when exhalation discomfort or high-pressure intolerance persists despite best practices, and it is often the modality of choice for hypoventilation phenotypes needing ventilatory support. In CSA, CPAP is tried first and ASV is usually preferred if central events persist, with BiPAP-ST reserved as a conditional, rescue option after CPAP and ASV, and with special caution in heart failure where ASV is contraindicated at LVEF ≤ 45% and device choices must be individualized and closely monitored. Perioperative bariatric contexts warrant caution with BiPAP, with EASO advising continuation of PAP under supervision for several months and reassessment thereafter [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS] [^111qG3vy] [^114L3Nt4] [^115MFKf5] [^115epns3] [^116Xid5a].

Yes, BiPAP can be used for sleep apnea, but it is **not first-line** for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^116REiLS]. CPAP or APAP is **preferred** for routine OSA care [^113V56sM]. BiPAP is appropriate when CPAP is **intolerable** due to high pressures, in OSA with **hypoventilation** (e.g. obesity hypoventilation, COPD overlap) [^117KY1ZU], or for **complex or mixed sleep apnea with central events** [^111qG3vy]. BiPAP may improve comfort and adherence in selected patients [^116vcifY], but it requires careful titration and monitoring [^113HZ1Kr] to avoid complications such as aerophagia, mask leaks, or central apneas.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [^116REiLS] and the American College of Physicians (ACP) provide clear guidance on **BiPAP use in sleep apnea**:

- **First-line therapy**: CPAP or APAP is recommended as the initial [^116REiLS] treatment for OSA [^113V56sM].

- **BiPAP indications**: BiPAP is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP due to high pressure requirements, discomfort, or exhalation difficulties.

- **Complex sleep apnea**: BiPAP is indicated for patients with complex sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS), characterized by the emergence of central apneas during CPAP therapy.

- **Hypoventilation syndromes**: BiPAP is recommended for patients with OSA complicated by hypoventilation syndromes, such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome [^117KY1ZU].

---

## Clinical scenarios where BiPAP is preferred

BiPAP is **particularly beneficial** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for BiPAP** |
|-|-|
| CPAP intolerance | - High pressure requirements <br/> - Discomfort <br/> - Exhalation difficulties |
| Complex sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS) | Emergence of central apneas during CPAP therapy |
| Hypoventilation syndromes | - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) <br/> - COPD overlap syndrome [^117KY1ZU] |
| Central sleep apnea (CSA) | - Idiopathic CSA [^116mpZSg] <br/> - CSA related to congestive heart failure (CHF) [^111qG3vy] |

## Effectiveness of BiPAP compared to CPAP

BiPAP is effective for managing sleep apnea, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate CPAP or who have specific clinical conditions. However, **CPAP remains the gold standard** [^113Hxugf] for most patients with OSA due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and widespread availability. **Patient comfort and adherence** may improve [^116vcifY] with BiPAP compared with CPAP, especially in patients with high pressure requirements or exhalation difficulties. **Clinical outcomes** include reductions in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) [^116REiLS], improved oxygen saturation, and decreased daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA and CSA [^111qG3vy].

---

## Potential risks and complications

While BiPAP is generally safe, potential risks and complications include:

- **Mask discomfort and leaks**: Improper mask fit can cause discomfort and air leaks, reducing therapy effectiveness [^113HZ1Kr].

- **Aerophagia**: Swallowing air can cause bloating and discomfort [^115KZ7e1].

- **Central apneas**: In some cases, BiPAP may induce central apneas, particularly in patients with underlying central sleep apnea [^113qDyMv].

- **Pressure-related complications**: High pressures may cause nasal congestion, dryness, or sinus discomfort [^115PNqZp].

---

## Patient adherence and comfort

Patient **adherence and comfort** are critical to the success of BiPAP therapy. BiPAP may improve adherence compared with CPAP in patients who experience discomfort or difficulty exhaling against continuous pressure. However, adherence remains a challenge, and patient education [^112uhZM3], mask fitting, and regular follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes [^11342PPu].

---

## Conclusion

BiPAP is an effective therapy for sleep apnea, especially for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP or who have conditions such as complex sleep apnea syndrome or hypoventilation syndromes. While **CPAP remains the first-line therapy** [^116REiLS] for most patients with OSA, BiPAP is a valuable alternative for selected patients. Careful patient selection, titration, and monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize potential risks [^116ezaSE].

### Titration studies overestimate continuous positive airway pressure requirements in uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea [^115zQYYB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Attended manual continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration is the standard practice for determining optimal positive airway pressures for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment. However, an unattended single night auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) titration is an alternative. The goal of this study was to determine whether therapeutic CPAP pressures determined during manual titrations are higher than APAP-generated surrogate pressures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 165 adults with uncomplicated OSA who had full/split-night manual CPAP titrations prior to commencing treatment with APAP. Demographic and clinical data, including 30-day APAP compliance data, were obtained. We compared the recommended CPAP pressure from manual titrations with the 90th/95th percentile pressure generated from APAP usage over 30 days.

- **Results**: The recommended CPAP pressures during the manual titrations were higher than the 90th/95th percentile pressures generated from APAP (11.4 ± 3.4 vs 10.3 ± 2.4 cmH2O; p = 0.000). Almost half the group (41.9%) had their manually derived titration pressure at least 1.5 cm above the 90th/95th percentile pressure. In multivariate analyses, body mass index was the only variable that predicted higher manual titration pressures. Notably, the average residual apnea-hypopnea index on 30-day APAP data was less than the average residual apnea-hypopnea index observed at the recommended pressure during the manual titration (5.0 ± 4.3 vs 7.2 ± 8.5; p = 0.006).

- **Conclusions**: Manual CPAP titrations may overestimate pres

### The value of auto-adjustable CPAP devices in pressure titration and treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^1119vfuS]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

In moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard therapy. In the last decade, new technologies such as auto-adjustable CPAP (APAP) have been promoted as having an added advantage over CPAP due to their ability to adapt the pressure level to the patient's needs at all times. This could logically result in the delivery of lower pressures, which was hypothesized to improve patient acceptance and compliance for therapy.

Several clinical trials have been performed with APAP in different modalities, either as a titration tool in attended or unattended conditions or as a treatment device for chronic use. Comparison of these trials is challenging since APAP technology is evolving rapidly and devices differ not only in how sleep-disordered breathing is detected but also in how the operational algorithm responds accordingly. Although the question remains whether proof has yet been delivered of the superiority of this technology over CPAP, there is a tendency to accept it as common standard practice in OSAS titration and treatment. This review will bring available evidence on this subject into perspective.

### A potential complication of bi-level positive airway pressure after gastric bypass surgery [^116Xid5a]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) is a common treatment modality for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), particularly within the morbidly obese population. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of adverse effects of BIPAP on patients undergoing weight loss surgical procedures.

- **Methods**: We report two patients who were treated with BIPAP in the postoperative period following open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). Their clinical courses and outcomes are presented.

- **Results**: The patients developed massive bowel distention following treatment with BIPAP and subsequently experienced anastomotic leaks.

- **Conclusion**: BIPAP following RYGBP may not be a completely benign treatment modality. Caution and careful monitoring are advised during the use of BIPAP after gastric bypass surgery.

### Postoperative CPAP and BiPAP use can be safely omitted after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^115bFZGM]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in the morbidly obese population. The need for routine preoperative testing for OSA has been debated in bariatric surgery publications. Most investigators have advocated the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in the postoperative setting; however, others have reported pouch perforations or other gastrointestinal complications as a result of their use. From a review of our experience, we present an algorithm for the safe postoperative treatment of patients with OSA without the use of CPAP or BiPAP.

- **Methods**: From January 2003 to December 2007, 1095 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses were performed at our institution. Preoperative testing for OSA was not routinely performed. A prospective database was maintained. The data included patient demographics, co-morbidities (including OSA and CPAP/BiPAP use), perioperative events, complications, and follow-up information. Patients with known OSA were not given CPAP/BiPAP after surgery. They were observed in a monitored setting during their inpatient stay, ensuring continuous oxygen saturation of > 92%. All patients used patient-controlled analgesia, were trained in the use of incentive spirometry, and ambulated within a few hours of surgery. The outcomes were compared between the OSA patients using preoperative CPAP/BiPAP versus those with OSA without preoperative CPAP/BiPAP and patients with no history of OSA.

- **Results**: A total of 811 patients were included in the study group with no known history of OSA. Of the…

### Novel and emerging nonpositive airway pressure therapies for sleep apnea [^1178PL8J]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

CPAP therapy has remained the standard of care for the treatment of sleep apnea for nearly four decades. Its overall effectiveness, however, has been limited by incomplete adherence despite many efforts to improve comfort. Conventional alternative therapies include oral appliances and upper airway surgeries. Recently, several innovative alternatives to CPAP have been developed. These novel approaches include means to increase arousal thresholds, electrical nerve stimulation, oral vacuum devices, and nasal expiratory resistive devices. We will review the physiologic mechanisms and the evidence for these novel treatments.

### Obstructive sleep apnea therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction-time for a rethink [^116LYmfm]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent and underdiagnosed medical condition, which is associated with various cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The mainstay of therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); however, CPAP is known to be poorly accepted and tolerated by patients. In randomized controlled trials evaluating CPAP for cardiovascular outcomes, the average usage was less than 3.5 hours, which is below the 4 hours per night recommended to achieve a clinical benefit. This low adherence may have resulted in poor effectiveness and failure to show cardiovascular risk reduction.

The mandibular advancement device (MAD) is an intraoral device designed to advance the mandible during sleep. It functions primarily through the alteration of the jaw and/or tongue position, resulting in improved upper airway patency and reduced upper airway collapsibility. The MAD is an approved alternative therapy that has been consistently shown to be the preferred option by patients who are affected by OSA. Although the MAD is less efficacious than CPAP in abolishing apnea and hypopnea events in some patients, its greater usage results in comparable improvements in quality-of-life and cardiovascular measures, including blood pressure reduction.

This review summarizes the impact of OSA on cardiovascular health, the limitations of CPAP, and the potential of OSA treatment using MADs in cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Positive pressure therapy: A perspective on evidence-based outcomes and methods of application [^115gPMx9]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

The sleep medicine community has increasingly recognized the necessity that clinical care be based on high-quality levels of evidence. Although research supports a favorable influence of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on risk for significant adverse outcomes in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH), well-designed trials are still required to elucidate the effect of PAP on health, quality of life, and economic risks in patients with milder OSAH.

Similarly, although there is strong evidence supporting various PAP titration strategies and PAP modalities in patients with severe OSAH without significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities, there is insufficient high-level evidence assessing and comparing the clinical efficacy and health care cost implications of various titration paradigms and various PAP modalities in individuals with milder OSAH and those with comorbid conditions. For ethical and other reasons, it may not be possible to apply a randomized controlled design to address all questions. However, whichever design is employed, it must be rigorously developed with attention to all potential confounders with adequate power to provide compelling, high-quality evidence.

### Definition, discrimination, diagnosis and treatment of central breathing disturbances during sleep [^113qDyMv]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for central sleep apnea, particularly concerning patients with treatment-emergent CSA, the ERS 2017 guidelines recommend defining treatment-persistent CSA as CSA that newly develops under treatment with CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure and persists under continuous use. The combination of obstructive sleep apnea with any phenotype of central disturbances should be defined as coexisting obstructive sleep apnea and CSA.

### Association of extubation failure rates with high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, and bilevel positive airway pressure vs conventional oxygen therapy in infants and young children: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113SZ8T2]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Statistical analysis: HFNC, CPAP, and BiPAP were the experimental nodes (interventions in a network plot), and COT was considered the reference node in the network meta-analysis. We performed the analysis using a Bayesian analytic framework. A Bayesian approach has been preferred for network meta-analyses since it is better able to handle studies with very few events and produce probability and ranking outputs that are intuitive to end users. A Bayesian random-effects model for network meta-analysis was adopted because it assumes and accounts for unexplained heterogeneity across studies.

- **Different interventions were ranked** using the rank probabilities generated by the Bayesian approach. We also used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to describe the relative ranking of interventions. SUCRA is expressed as a fraction and provides the relative probability of an intervention being the best among all options. SUCRA of 1 for an intervention indicates that the intervention is certain to be the best among all the interventions tested, while a SUCRA of 0 indicates that the intervention is certain to be the worst among the treatments tested. It is recommended that the ranks be interpreted in the context of the certainty of evidence and the absolute risk reduction of the pairwise comparisons.

- **Using the Bayesian framework, we performed a meta-regression analysis** to explore the association of age with the effectiveness of NRS on reducing EF (reintubation) and TF. In our model, we assumed a common study-level covariate effect versus the baseline.

### European respiratory society guideline on non-CPAP therapies for obstructive sleep apnoea [^114mYWBp]. European Respiratory Review (2021). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to positional therapy, ERS 2021 guidelines recommend offering either positional therapy using vibratory devices or CPAP in adult patients with mild or moderate position-dependent OSA. This is defined by a supine apnea-hypopnea index at least twice as high as the nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index and no relevant nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index (< 15 events/hour).

### Comparison of three auto-adjusting positive pressure devices in patients with sleep apnoea [^113RYagN]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Auto-adjustable continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) devices are an emerging treatment alternative to fixed-pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. These devices have been engineered to automatically adjust the pressure to the optimal level on a continuous basis. However, not all APAP technologies use the same algorithm.

Three different APAP devices (Autoset Spirit, Breas PV 10i, and RemStar Auto) were compared in a randomised crossover trial in patients who were already established on fixed-pressure CPAP therapy. The outcome measures included compliance, quality of life, and side-effects. Twenty-seven middle-aged patients (25 male) previously diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (median [interquartile range] apnoea/hypopnoea index 48 [29–76]), established on CPAP therapy for more than three years, were randomised to each APAP device for four weeks. Mean pressure and patient compliance were significantly lower on the Breas PV 10i than on the other APAP devices.

- **Quality of life and side effects**: The devices were similar in terms of quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and upper airway side-effects.
- **Patient evaluation**: Patients evaluated the devices significantly differently in terms of features, sleep quality, and pressure comfort, with the Breas PV 10i being the least popular.

Auto-adjustable positive airway pressure devices differ in pressure delivery and patient compliance among obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^113Ta2sb]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for the accompanying clinical practice guideline on the treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of positive airway pressure therapies (PAP), non-PAP therapies, and pharmacological treatments to no treatment to improve patient-important outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical meaningfulness of using various interventions to treat CSA in adults. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations.

- **Results**: The literature search resulted in 6,701 articles, out of which 103 articles provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### Cpap and bi-level PAP therapy: New and established roles [^117KY1ZU]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea has evolved into increasingly sophisticated modes of therapy for various forms of sleep-disordered breathing. The principles of splinting the airway and delivering assisted ventilation underpin the basics of this therapy. However, the introduction of newer technologies and miniaturization are revolutionizing the former conventions of the field. This review aims to enhance our understanding of various forms of PAP therapy by:

- **Rationale for modalities**: Providing the rationale for such modalities.
- **Device technology**: Gaining a basic working knowledge of device technology.
- **Clinical research evidence**: Critically assessing the clinical research evidence while identifying barriers to implementation.

Dissemination of this information is vital to prevent knowledge gaps in healthcare providers and systems.

### Interventions to improve compliance with continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea [^112wjFe3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). High credibility.

Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) is currently considered to be the cornerstone of therapy for sleep apnoea (OSA). However, compliance with this treatment is frequently poor, which may lead to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness, and poor waking cognitive function. Mechanical and psychological/educational interventions have been proposed to try to increase the hours of use of CPAP therapy.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of interventions designed to increase compliance with CPAP.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Sleep Apnoea Specialised Register (January 2004).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions to improve compliance with CPAP usage were considered for inclusion in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed articles for inclusion in the review and extracted data. Attempts were made to obtain additional unpublished data from the trialists.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria with 1,007 participants. Each of the mechanical interventions was compared with fixed CPAP alone. Auto-CPAP (13 studies): A small, significant difference was observed in compliance, but this effect disappeared when we took account of the variation between the studies. There may be a subgroup of patients who respond better than others. Most participants preferred auto-CPAP to fixed CPAP where this was measured. Bi-level PAP (3 studies): No significant differences were observed in compliance. One small study found no difference in preference.

### Effect of CPAP on blood pressure in patients with minimally symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea: A meta-analysis using individual patient data from four randomised controlled trials [^1111VtP8]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

In the meta-analysis, there was no evidence that the treatment effect of CPAP on blood pressure was dependent on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as defined by the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) or apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is in contrast to the report by Haentjens et al. The mean AHI in the two Barbé studies was higher than the mean ODI in the other studies. This discrepancy is due to the Spanish studies using a higher inclusion threshold on AHI and the fact that AHI values are generally higher than the equivalent ODI, especially when using > 4% dips in oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2).

A possible limitation of the meta-analysis is that not all studies used the same follow-up length or the same treatment for the control arm. The two largest studies used standard care, and patients were followed up at a 6-month visit. By contrast, the two smaller studies used sham CPAP and followed patients for a shorter period of time. However, since these two studies consisted of about 7% of the total number of patients, they are unlikely to greatly influence the overall results of the meta-analysis.

Despite the studies in this meta-analysis examining patients with apparently normal levels of daytime sleepiness and only minimal symptoms, there was an average reduction in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of about one point in patients using CPAP relative to control, with considerable variability across baseline ESS. This improvement was greater in those with an initially higher ESS, as expected. There was also a dependence on initial OSA severity, with more severe patients benefiting less from treatment. In clinical practice, this indicates that it is not possible to conclude… (Text ends abruptly.)

### Cardiovascular effects after five nights without continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea: a randomized controlled trial [^114Cm5Nx]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effectively prevents sleep apnea and reduces blood pressure, many patients do not use CPAP every night. This trial investigates cardiovascular effects after sleeping five nights without CPAP.

- **Methods**: We randomized 100 patients (67 men and 33 women with a mean age of 64 ± 9 years) using CPAP treatment for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea to either withdraw treatment for five nights (n = 50) or to continue with CPAP (n = 50). The primary outcomes were arterial stiffness and 24 h blood pressure.

- **Results**: The 24 h SBP increased by a mean of 2.8 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2–5.4 mmHg] (P = 0.035) and DBP increased by a mean of 1.7 mmHg (95% CI 0.1–3.3 mmHg) (P = 0.032) in the group without CPAP compared to the CPAP group. There was a significant effect on blood pressure in women but not in men. In women, SBP increased by 5.1 mmHg (95% CI 1.0–9.5 mmHg) (P = 0.017) and DBP by 2.9 mmHg (95% CI 0.4–5.6 mmHg) (P = 0.029). Arterial stiffness remained unaffected. Secondary outcomes that worsened in patients without CPAP included apnea–hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, hemoglobin levels, and daytime sleepiness.

Blood pressure is affected after five nights of CPAP interruption, along with a rapid return of sleep apneas, nocturnal hypoxic events, daytime sleepiness, and increased hemoglobin levels, but arterial stiffness was not affected. Blood pressure was affected in women only, suggesting a sex-related CPAP effect on blood pressure.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116ezaSE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines in the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

- **Methods**: The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statements**: The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure: (1) Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing. (2) Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation.

### Updated adaptive servo-ventilation recommendations for the 2012 AASM guideline: "The treatment of central sleep apnea syndromes in adults: practice parameters with an evidence-based literature review and meta-analyses" [^114L3Nt4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for central sleep apnea, and more specifically with respect to adaptive servo-ventilation, the AASM 2016 guidelines recommend considering offering adaptive servo-ventilation targeted to normalize the apnea-hypopnea index.

### Clinical foundation for efficient treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^111FLFUa]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Only a few decades ago, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was an unknown and untreated entity. Now, there is a rush to place literally millions of Americans on continuous positive airway pressure devices. Community practice standards are evolving yearly, driven by economic incentives from industry, government, and physicians, rather than actual medical evidence supporting treatment and efficacy.

Medicare has lowered the diagnostic threshold for diagnosis and reimbursement. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revision 2 (2005), has permitted the diagnosis of OSA exclusively through a laboratory test, even if the patient does not present clinical symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, the industry is positioned to market computer-assisted continuous positive airway pressure machines to the public without requiring a physician's prescription.

Due to this paradigm shift away from physician-directed diagnosis and treatment, this article critically evaluates the current medical evidence regarding the clinical foundation for treating OSA.

### Updated adaptive servo-ventilation recommendations for the 2012 AASM guideline: "The treatment of central sleep apnea syndromes in adults: Practice parameters with an evidence-based literature review and meta-analyses" [^115MFKf5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

An update of the 2012 systematic review and meta-analyses was performed, and a modified-GRADE approach was used to update the recommendations for the use of adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) for the treatment of central sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS) related to congestive heart failure (CHF). Meta-analyses demonstrated an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and normalization of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in all patients. Analyses also indicated an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with an LVEF of ≤ 45% and moderate or severe CSA-predominant sleep-disordered breathing.

These data support a Standard level recommendation against the use of ASV to treat CHF-associated CSAS in patients with an LVEF of ≤ 45% and moderate or severe CSAS. There is an Option level recommendation for the use of ASV in the treatment of CHF-associated CSAS in patients with an LVEF > 45% or mild CHF-related CSAS. The application of these recommendations is limited to the target patient populations; the ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician.

### Educational, supportive and behavioural interventions to improve usage of continuous positive airway pressure machines in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea [^115JukuX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Although effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not universally accepted by users. Educational, supportive, and behavioural interventions may help people with OSA recognize the need for regular and continued use of CPAP.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of strategies that are educational, supportive, or behavioural in encouraging people who have been prescribed CPAP to use their machines.

- **Search methods**: Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials up to 17 January 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized parallel controlled trials that assessed an intervention designed to inform participants about CPAP or OSA, to support them in using CPAP, or to modify their behavior to increase their use of CPAP machines. Studies of any duration were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed studies to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Data were extracted independently and were entered into Review Manager software for analysis.

- **Main results**: Thirty studies (2047 participants) were included. We categorized studies by intervention type: supportive interventions during follow-up, educational interventions, and behavioural therapy. Across all three intervention classes, most studies incorporated elements of more than one intervention. For the purposes of this systematic review, we categorized them by the prevailing type of intervention, which we expected would have the greatest impact.

### Diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^113Hxugf]. CMAJ (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obstructive sleep apnea:

- **Definition**: OSA is a condition characterized by recurring episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to cyclic reduction or cessation in airflow.

- **Pathophysiology**: OSA is caused by periods of dynamic airway collapse during sleep. Factors that increase the risk of collapse include obesity, male sex, postmenopausal state, enlarged tonsils/adenoids, maxillary insufficiency, retrognathia, polycystic ovarian disease, androgen supplementation, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15) in adults (30–70 years of age) is estimated at 13% in men and 6% in women.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations of OSA include reduced sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Long-term complications include arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiovascular events, stroke, impaired cognitive function, depression, and even premature death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Regular CPAP use is associated with an improvement in sleep apnea symptoms and health-related QoL. Randomized studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of CPAP for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Biphasic positive airway pressure or continuous positive airway pressure: A randomized trial [^111M4wEY]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

There is currently no clear evidence that nasal-biphasic positive airway pressure (n-BiPAP) confers any advantage over nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP). Our hypothesis was that preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation and under 2 weeks old when extubated onto n-BiPAP will have a lower risk of extubation failure than infants extubated onto n-CPAP at equivalent mean airway pressure.

- **Methods**: We conducted an unblinded multicenter randomized trial comparing n-CPAP with n-BiPAP in infants born before 30 weeks' gestation and under 2 weeks old. The primary outcome variable was the rate of extubation failure within 48 hours after the first attempt at extubation. Block randomization stratified by center and gestation (under 28 weeks or 28 weeks and older) was performed.

- **Results**: A total of 540 infants (270 in each group) were eligible to be included in the statistical analysis; 57 (21%) of the n-BiPAP group and 55 (20%) of the n-CPAP group failed extubation at 48 hours postextubation (adjusted odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.65–1.56; p = 0.97). Subgroup analysis of infants born before and after 28 weeks' gestation showed no significant differences between the two groups. There were no significant differences between arms in death; oxygen requirement at 28 days; oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' corrected gestation; intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, or pneumothorax.

- **Conclusions**: This trial shows that there is no added benefit to using n-BiPAP over n-CPAP at equivalent mean airway pressure in preventing extubation failures in infants.

### The efficacy of split-night sleep studies [^114UbR1M]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the most commonly used medical modality to reverse the apneas, hypopneas, and inspiratory flow-limited breaths, which result in oxyhemoglobin desaturation, altered sleep architecture, and daytime sleepiness representing the cardinal features of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSA/H). Identifying optimal strategies to develop the initial positive airway prescription is of paramount importance to clinicians who evaluate patients with suspected OSA/H.

With the growing appreciation of the clinical and physiologic importance of sleep-disordered breathing, there have been increasing demands on clinical resources to diagnose and treat these patients. The time, hardware, and personnel-intensive nature of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) are significant, especially considering the traditional paradigm that utilizes a full night PSG for diagnostic evaluation and, when indicated, another full night for PAP titration. Efforts to identify time and resource-conserving alternatives to this paradigm have focused on in-laboratory split-night studies, in which the diagnosis of OSA/H can be made, and a positive pressure prescription defined during a single overnight PSG.

Case-control studies indicate that, when certain guidelines are applied, split-night PSGs result in prescription efficacy and patient adherence comparable to the traditional two-night strategy. However, prospective, randomized trials designed with adequate power are required to further define the impact of a split-night strategy on clinical outcomes.

### Use of continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnea in the treatment of hypertension [^117EjAUW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension, both of which are highly prevalent and treatable conditions that often coexist and contribute to an increased cardiovascular risk. There is ongoing debate regarding the ability of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to improve blood pressure in hypertensive patients with OSA. This review highlights findings from recent studies that have investigated the impact of CPAP on blood pressure in patients with this condition.

Recent findings indicate that comparing the results of various studies is complicated by significant methodological differences. In patients with hypertension and OSA, treatment with CPAP tends to improve blood pressure to a lesser extent than antihypertensive medications. However, patients with more severe OSA and greater adherence to CPAP therapy are likely to gain the most benefit.

In summary, CPAP should be used in combination with antihypertensive medications in hypertensive patients with OSA. CPAP offers additional benefits, such as restoring nocturnal dipping and improving arterial stiffness, which could potentially reduce cardiovascular morbidity in these high-risk patients.

### Adaptive servo-ventilation for the treatment of central sleep apnea in congestive heart failure: What have we learned [^114y1jjA]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Positive airway pressure devices for the noninvasive treatment of sleep-disordered breathing are being marketed that have substantially expanded capabilities. Most recently, adaptive servo-ventilation devices have become available that can measure patient ventilation continuously. These devices use that information to adjust expiratory positive airway pressure and pressure support levels, abolishing central and obstructive apneas and hypopneas, including central sleep-disordered breathing of the Hunter-Cheyne-Stokes variety. Patients with congestive heart failure are particularly prone to developing central sleep apnea and/or Hunter-Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Studies have shown that suppression of these abnormal breathing patterns may improve cardiac function and, ultimately, mortality.

Over the last approximately 18 months, increasing numbers of studies have appeared demonstrating improvement in cardiac function and other important outcomes after both the acute application of adaptive servo-ventilation as well as 3 to 6 months of use in patients with congestive heart failure and central sleep apnea/Hunter-Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Several of these studies are randomized controlled trials and include assessments of cardiac event-free survival, showing an advantage to treating with adaptive servo-ventilation.

As an adjunct to optimal pharmacological management, adaptive servo-ventilation shows considerable promise as a means to improve outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure complicated by central sleep apnea/Hunter-Cheyne-Stokes breathing.

### Interventions to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure [^1169EDMc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite widespread agreement that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, it is estimated that 50% of patients recommended for therapy are non-compliant one year later. Interventions to improve compliance in such patients have not been extensively studied. This study evaluated a two-phase intervention program aimed at improving compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with CPAP.

204 patients with previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and who were non-compliant with CPAP were enrolled. **Methods**: Phase 1 evaluated standard interventions to improve therapy compliance, including mask optimization, heated humidification, topical nasal therapy, and sleep apnea education. Persistently non-compliant patients proceeded to Phase 2, where compliance was compared in a double-blind, randomized fashion between standard CPAP and flexible bilevel positive airway pressure.

49 (24%) of the 204 previously non-compliant patients became compliant (average nightly use ≥ 4 hours) after standard interventions. Subsequently, 104 of the 155 persistently non-compliant patients agreed to continue and were randomized to either CPAP or flexible bilevel positive airway pressure re-titration and treatment for an additional ninety days. At follow-up, 15 (28%) of the 53 randomized to CPAP and 25 (49%) of the 51 randomized to flexible bilevel positive airway pressure (p = 0.03) achieved compliance.

A two-phase intervention program, first employing standard interventions and followed by advanced treatment options, demonstrated a significant improvement in compliance among initially non-compliant sleep apnea patients.

### Optimal continuous positive airway pressure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea [^1136Jcp8]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA/H) is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. The consequences of OSA/H include excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced perceived health quality, and an increased risk of driving accidents. There is evidence that treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective in eliminating these consequences. In addition, OSA/H may also be associated with hypertension and an increased risk of vascular disease. Although there is no clear evidence in this regard, CPAP may be effective in alleviating these consequences as well. Nasal CPAP is considered the treatment of choice for clinically significant OSA/H. The optimal CPAP prescription is that which is most effective in eliminating the adverse consequences of OSA/H.

Patients should be initially treated with standard CPAP. For those in whom standard CPAP is unsuccessful or intolerable, bi-level or self-adjusting modes may be attempted. The nasal CPAP pressure level can be titrated to eliminate apnea, hypopnea, snoring, respiratory arousal, and inspiratory flow limitation as a means of predicting successful long-term therapy. The reliability of these physiological parameters in predicting the optimal long-term CPAP pressure is eroded by the tendency of CPAP pressure-level requirements to decrease with chronic CPAP use and by other factors that may increase the CPAP pressure requirement.

The split-night polysomnogram and unattended auto-CPAP titration have been proposed as efficient means of determining the optimal CPAP pressure.

### Expiratory positive airway pressure for sleep apnea after stroke: A randomized, crossover trial [^116iV4bu]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common following a stroke and predicts poor outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treats OSA but is generally poorly tolerated by stroke patients. This study assesses whether nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), an alternative to CPAP, may be an effective option after an acute stroke.

- **Methods**: A randomized, controlled, two-period crossover study was conducted. Each acute ischemic stroke patient received one night of EPAP and one night without EPAP, with OSA monitored using a validated device, the Watch-PAT 200. Linear repeated-measures analyses were conducted. Sample size calculations indicated that 18 subjects would be required to detect a 10-point or larger average reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the primary outcome) with the use of EPAP, with power ≥ 80% and α = 0.05.

- **Results**: Among the 19 subjects who completed the protocol, nasal EPAP treatment was associated with a nonsignificant absolute difference in AHI of -5.73 events/h in the primary analysis (p = 0.183, 95% confidence interval -14.4, 2.97) and a nonsignificant absolute difference in AHI of -5.43 events/h in the subgroup of patients who used nasal EPAP for ≥ 3 hours (p = 0.314, 95% confidence interval -16.6, 5.76).

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that EPAP is not an effective alternative to CPAP in acute stroke patients with OSA. Further work is needed to identify other, more effective alternatives.

Clinical trial registration was recorded as ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT01703663.

### The art and science of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in obstructive sleep apnea [^115PNqZp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, no ideal therapy has emerged at the time of writing. Based on recent randomized trials, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice. Although CPAP can prevent pharyngeal collapse in virtually all patients who choose to wear it, poor patient adherence with treatment limits its effectiveness. Convincing data exist that treatment with CPAP can alleviate the neurocognitive sequelae of OSA, but data on cardiovascular complications are more limited. Several recent reports support a lowering of nocturnal and daytime blood pressure with CPAP, but data on the prevention of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events are currently lacking.

- **Patient adherence**: Can be improved with optimization of mask comfort, heated humidification, and intensive support and education.

For those who remain poorly compliant, alternative therapies such as autotitrating devices and oral positive airway pressure can be considered. Further research into the basic mechanisms underlying OSA will be required for new therapeutic targets to develop.

Regarding perioperative care for obstructive sleep apnea, specifically concerning perioperative CPAP, EASO 2017 guidelines recommend continuing CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure therapy immediately after surgery in patients with OSA, and for 3–6 months post-surgery. Patients should then be reviewed by a respiratory physician to determine whether the CPAP/bilevel positive airway pressure therapy pressures need to be adjusted and if a new sleep-respiratory assessment should be undertaken.

### Multidisciplinary alternatives to CPAP program for CPAP-intolerant patients [^116Mqg9S]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) intolerance remains a persistent problem for many obstructive sleep apnea patients. Clinicians and researchers continue to search for other effective treatment modalities given the well-documented sequelae associated with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. A multidisciplinary "Alternatives to CPAP program" (ALT) can facilitate systematic evaluation of non-CPAP therapies appropriate for an individual patient. We review successful strategies and barriers encountered during implementation of an ALT at our institution. Creation of similar programs in private practice and academic settings can help medical, dental, and surgical sleep medicine specialists coordinate evaluation and treatment of CPAP-intolerant patients.

### Pressure modification for improving usage of continuous positive airway pressure machines in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea [^114akdr4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) is considered to be the cornerstone of therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, compliance with this treatment is frequently poor, which may lead to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness, and poor waking cognitive function. Mechanical interventions that involve changing the way that positive pressure is delivered, and the addition of humidification, might improve compliance.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of pressure level modifications and additional humidification in increasing CPAP machine usage.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (September 2008).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions to improve compliance with CPAP usage. Control groups received fixed pressure CPAP.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed articles for inclusion in the review and extracted data. We made attempts to obtain additional unpublished data from the trialists.

- **Main results**: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (1874 participants). Auto-CPAP (30 studies, 1136 participants): a statistically significant difference in machine usage of 0.21 hours/night (0.08 to 0.35) was observed in favour of auto-CPAP from cross-over studies. This difference is of questionable clinical significance. Pooled effect estimates from parallel group trials detected a similarly sized difference for average nightly machine usage, but this was not statistically significant. Evidence from parallel group studies did not identify any statistically significant differences.

### A predictive model for optimal continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of pure moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in China [^113kwtM7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing characterized by the cessation or significant reduction of oronasal airflow during sleep, which is accompanied by daytime drowsiness and fatigue. Nearly one billion adults aged 30 to 69 worldwide are reported to have OSA, with the highest number of affected individuals in China, followed by the United States, Brazil, and India. OSA is associated with multiple-system damage due to intermittent hypoxia.

Previous studies have demonstrated that automatic continuous positive airway pressure (auto-CPAP) therapy is beneficial in treating OSA patients. However, auto-CPAP titration followed by fixed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with the assistance of a web platform is not commonly used in China. This is due to economic factors, medical insurance policies, and the nascent stage of telemedicine services, which lack relevant national policies and regulations. Currently, the main "gold standard" for diagnosing and treating OSA in China involves an initial laboratory diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a second PSG to manually titrate the appropriate CPAP value if moderate to severe OSA is detected in the baseline PSG. This procedure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, the titration duration may be insufficient to attain the appropriate pressure due to the patient's difficulty in sleeping in an unfamiliar environment.

### Cerebrovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea [^1159mWKU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

The major treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a therapy that holds the airway open by using pressures delivered by a mask. Variations that use positive pressure are currently being used, but all maintain positive pressure during inhalation. Although the use of CPAP seems to be beneficial in some studies, more randomized, prospective studies are needed to fully clarify the effectiveness of CPAP. Unfortunately, 30% of all patients with OSA do not tolerate CPAP or do not comply because of the discomfort of the CPAP mask, which is strapped over the nose or over both the nose and mouth by a headband. In asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, lack of compliance is even greater. This lack of compliance is compounded by the estimate that 93% of women and 82% of men with moderate to severe sleep apnea syndrome have not been clinically diagnosed. Other therapies, such as mandibular devices, weight reduction, and surgery, have limited effectiveness in milder forms of OSA but generally are not effective in more severe OSA. Pharmacological therapies have been disappointing, even though several dozen drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of OSA.

### A trial of positive airway pressure for the treatment of sleep apnea in pregnancy [^112AFezg]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). High credibility.

The pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy remains poorly understood, and studies examining the effect of treatment with positive airway pressure on pregnancy have been limited.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to perform a randomized controlled trial of positive airway pressure treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy.

- **Study design**: Participants with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² underwent polysomnography at 14 to 20 weeks' gestation (visit 1), and those with obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 but < 50) were enrolled. In phase 1, participants were randomized to autotitrating positive airway pressure versus sham positive airway pressure. In phase 2, the sham arm was replaced with a sleep hygiene control. Participants returned at 28 to 31 weeks' gestation (visit 2). The mean arterial blood pressure, uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index, endoglin, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 levels, and placental growth factor levels were measured, along with fasting glucose and insulin to calculate insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance). The primary outcome was a composite of the uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio, and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. For secondary analyses, each outcome variable was analyzed independently. Adherence to treatment was examined.

- **Results**: A total of 241 participants completed visit 1, and 89 (37%) had an apnea-hypopnea index between 5 and 50. Of those, 51 participants were

### Understanding sleep apnea physiology: A potential path to improving positive airway pressure effectiveness [^112r7QzU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Future work will ultimately need to clarify the impact of trait identification and personalized management on patient-centered outcomes. As we innovate, we must also bear in mind the costs of complexity. The polysomnograms currently necessary for comprehensive trait identification are costly and often inaccessible, particularly for groups with existing barriers to adherence such as historically disadvantaged populations and those who live in rural areas. Developing automated approaches to measure traits with home testing would be an important step to mitigating this obstacle.

Even then, additional unanticipated burdens to the health system from added complexity in decision-making and care pathways are likely. Ultimately, to reduce the burden of untreated OSA, it will be incumbent on us to integrate personalized strategies in a way that promotes equitable access to high-quality OSA care.

### Clinical guidelines for the manual titration of positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^113HZ1Kr]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). High credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are used to treat patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). After a patient is diagnosed with OSA, the standard practice involves performing attended polysomnography (PSG), during which positive airway pressure is adjusted throughout the recording period to determine the optimal pressure for maintaining upper airway patency. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) represent the two forms of PAP that are manually titrated during PSG to determine the single fixed pressure of CPAP or the fixed inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP and EPAP, respectively) of BPAP for subsequent nightly usage.

A PAP Titration Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reviewed the available literature. Based on this review, the Task Force developed these recommendations for conducting CPAP and BPAP titrations. Major recommendations are as follows:

- **Recommendation 1**: All potential PAP titration candidates should receive adequate PAP education, hands-on demonstration, careful mask fitting, and acclimatization prior to titration.

- **Recommendation 2**: CPAP (IPAP and/or EPAP for patients on BPAP) should be increased until the following obstructive respiratory events are eliminated, or the recommended maximum CPAP (IPAP for patients on BPAP) is reached: apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs), and snoring.

- **Recommendation 3**: The recommended minimum starting CPAP should be 4 cm H2O for pediatric and adult patients.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^1117R2Tc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The SAVIOR-C (Study of the Effects of Adaptive Servo-Ventilation Therapy on Cardiac Function and Remodeling in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure) trial failed to show an improvement in ejection fraction or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level after 24 weeks of ASV therapy in patients with heart failure and CSA but did reveal improvements in quality of life and clinical status.

The SERVE-HF (Treatment of Sleep-Disordered Breathing with Predominant Central Sleep Apnea by Adaptive Servo Ventilation in Patients with Heart Failure) trial was designed to test the effect of ASV on mortality in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% and predominantly central sleep apnea. Despite effectively reducing the AHI, ASV failed to confer a survival benefit and was actually associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality (29.9% versus 24%). Postulated mechanisms for this finding include reductions in cardiac output related to the higher levels of PAP delivered in ASV mode, as well as the hypothesis that CSA is actually a compensatory mechanism in patients with severe heart failure that has beneficial properties attenuated by ASV treatment. Additionally, the proprietary algorithm used in SERVE-HF has been shown to induce episodes of significant hyperventilation in some patients, which some suspect may have been related to the increase in mortality.

The question of whether SERVE-HF's findings represent a class effect of ASV versus that of one specific algorithm may be answered by the ongoing ADVENT-HF (Effect of Adaptive Servo Ventilation on Survival and Hospital Admissions in Patients with Heart Failure) trial.

### Correlates of a prescription for bilevel positive airway pressure for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea among veterans [^111yktVN]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The acceptance of portable home-based polysomnography, combined with auto-titrating CPAP, has eliminated the need for laboratory polysomnography. Since bilevel airway pressure (BPAP) is calibrated in the sleep lab, patients diagnosed using portable home-based polysomnography may not have the opportunity to receive BPAP. It is unknown whether the patients who would have ordinarily received a BPAP would benefit from it. We determine correlates of receiving BPAP and of being switched from BPAP to CPAP and examine whether patients with these correlates have better adherence to BPAP versus CPAP.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study (correlates at baseline) of 2,513 VA patients was conducted. These patients underwent a sleep study between January 2003 and October 2006 and were receiving continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP [N = 2,251] or BPAP [N = 262]) by the end of 2007. PAP adherence up to 30 months was assessed.

- **Results**: Significant correlates of BPAP use were older age (p < 0.001), higher BMI and CHF (p < 0.01), COPD (p < 0.001), higher blood CO₂ (p < 0.05), higher AHI and OSA severity (p < 0.001), lower nadir SpO₂ (p < 0.001), and greater sleepiness (ESS) (p < 0.01). Patients on BPAP were more adherent to PAP therapy (p < 0.01), but the association largely disappeared following adjustment for BPAP correlates. Preliminary evidence indicated that these correlates predict long-term adherence to PAP therapy regardless of mode.

- **Conclusions**: We identified baseline factors that can help clinicians decide whether to prescribe an auto-BPAP as first-line therapy and predict good long-term PAP adherence.

### Cardiovascular benefit of continuous positive airway pressure according to high-risk obstructive sleep apnoea: a multi-trial analysis [^11168phM]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Randomized trials of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in patients with cardiovascular disease have not detected a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). This study tested whether the cardiovascular benefit of CPAP occurs preferentially in high-risk OSA, characterized by greater OSA-related heart rate acceleration or hypoxaemia.

- **Methods**: In a post hoc analysis of pooled randomized intervention with CPAP in coronary artery disease and OSA, impact of CPAP on patients with acute coronary syndrome and nonsleepy OSA, and sleep apnoea cardiovascular endpoints study randomized trials, outcomes were stratified by high-risk OSA status. High-risk status was defined by a heart rate response following OSA respiratory events greater than 9.4 beats per minute (third tertile) or an oxygen desaturation area under baseline (hypoxic burden) greater than 87.1% min/h (third tertile). Cox mixed models quantified the CPAP treatment effect on MACCE, including cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke, within high-risk OSA and the difference versus low-risk status (primary test). Secondary analyses examined participants without excessive sleepiness (Epworth score less than 11 points) or without increased blood pressure (systolic/diastolic less than 140/90 mmHg).

- **Results**: In 3549 participants, 16.6% reached the MACCE endpoint with CPAP (n = 1778) and 16.3% reached it with usual care (n = 1771). The CPAP treatment effect was greater in participants…

### The impact of changing people with sleep apnea using CPAP less than 4 h per night to a Bi-level device [^116vcifY]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pressure intolerance is a reason for poor acceptance and subsequent compliance in some patients starting treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In unselected populations initiating CPAP, different types of pressure-generating devices have not been found to improve compliance. We hypothesized that using Bi-level PAP for patients who reported pressure-related discomfort as a cause for poor compliance with CPAP might increase their hours of treatment use.

Patients using CPAP for less than 4 hours per night with symptoms suggesting pressure intolerance were randomized to receive either a Bi-level PAP device or a new CPAP for 4 weeks. Following a washout period of 2 weeks, they were crossed over to the other device for 4 weeks. Twenty-eight volunteers completed the protocol. Compared to the baseline (mean 1.49 hours per night), improvement in compliance was noticed when changed to a new CPAP (2.23 hours, p = 0.006) or Bi-level PAP (2.73 hours, p < 0.001).

The trend suggesting superior compliance with a Bi-level PAP device compared to a new CPAP was not significant (p = 0.059), and there were no differences in subjective or objective measures of sleepiness. The results of this study suggest that routine intervention with Bi-level PAP in this group of sub-optimally compliant individuals was not very effective in improving PAP usage. However, there is a subgroup of patients who complain of difficulty with exhalation, where favorable trends towards improved compliance were observed on Bi-level PAP.

### Educational, supportive and behavioural interventions to improve usage of continuous positive airway pressure machines in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea [^11342PPu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Although highly effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not universally accepted by users. Educational, supportive, and behavioural interventions may help people with OSA initiate and maintain regular and continued use of CPAP.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of educational, supportive, behavioural, or mixed (combination of two or more intervention types) strategies that aim to encourage adults who have been prescribed CPAP to use their devices.

- **Search methods**: Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, up to April 29, 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed intervention(s) designed to inform participants about CPAP/OSA, to support them in using CPAP, or to modify their behaviour to increase the use of CPAP devices.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed studies to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Data were extracted independently and were entered into RevMan for analysis. 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed using the updated 'Risk of bias 2' tool for the primary outcome, CPAP usage. Study-level 'Risk of bias' assessments were conducted using the original 'Risk of bias' tool. GRADE assessment was performed using GRADEpro.

- **Main results**: Forty-one studies, comprising 9,005 participants, are included in this review; 16 of these studies are newly identified with updated searches. Baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores were assessed.
