## Question

Linezolid for herpetic encephalitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether linezolid is an appropriate therapy for herpetic encephalitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologic agent and standard-of-care therapy for herpetic encephalitis. Then, I should verify linezolid's mechanism, spectrum, and any evidence in viral CNS disease. Next, I will review guideline recommendations and dosing for acyclovir. After that, I need to assess the safety profile of linezolid in the encephalitis context. Finally, I will synthesize the risk–benefit and provide a clear recommendation with contingencies for diagnostic confirmation and de-escalation [^114e3wVR] [^113Xb5ib].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity: herpetic encephalitis is a viral parenchymal brain infection most commonly due to HSV-1, with HSV-2 and VZV as additional causes; the cornerstone of therapy is intravenous acyclovir, and delays in acyclovir worsen outcomes, so I should anchor on that before considering any alternative agents [^114e3wVR] [^1174vYFu] [^113Xb5ib].

> Now, I need to check what linezolid actually does. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial that binds the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis; it has no antiviral activity and is approved for resistant gram-positive bacterial infections, not for viral diseases, and FDA patient counseling explicitly states antibacterials like linezolid do not treat viral infections; wait, even though linezolid can penetrate CSF in bacterial CNS infections, that pharmacokinetic property does not translate into efficacy against viruses lacking the drug's target [^112NTkat] [^1179HQd4] [^111R8ZwV] [^115sc1jA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review whether any evidence supports linezolid in viral CNS disease. I will now examine the literature: there are no clinical data showing efficacy of linezolid for HSV or VZV encephalitis, and preclinical work shows linezolid can suppress T cell effector function via mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition, which could theoretically impair viral clearance in acute viral encephalitis, arguing against its use here [^116xDQfM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could the CNS role of linezolid in other infections be misleading me? Reports of linezolid use in CNS infections relate to bacterial etiologies such as MRSA, VRE meningitis, or mycobacterial disease like tuberculous meningitis; that is mechanistically and clinically distinct from herpetic encephalitis, so I should not extrapolate those findings to HSV/VZV encephalitis [^115sc1jA] [^1137Gq3d] [^112Lu6A6] [^112Pvr9X].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to verify the recommended therapy for herpetic encephalitis. IDSA and ABN/BIA guidelines recommend prompt empiric IV acyclovir for suspected HSV encephalitis, typically 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14–21 days, with strong emphasis on not delaying initiation; early acyclovir reduces mortality markedly, and recent cohort data reinforce the impact of time-to-acyclovir on outcome in HSV encephalitis [^114e3wVR] [^113Co6bp] [^112ymbLB] [^111LPKgi] [^113vkJit].

> I should double-check that no guideline even mentions linezolid for viral encephalitis. Scanning IDSA and ABN/BIA documents confirms acyclovir (or related anti-herpes antivirals for other herpesviruses) is the standard, and linezolid has no role in treating HSV or VZV encephalitis; failure to start acyclovir promptly independently predicts poor outcomes, so substituting a non-antiviral like linezolid would be inappropriate and harmful [^114e3wVR] [^11587RyZ] [^114ii1sj] [^111TK9zU].

> Let me consider the safety signal, because even if linezolid had no benefit, potential harm matters in encephalitis. Linezolid carries risks of myelosuppression and mitochondrial toxicity manifesting as peripheral and optic neuropathy, and it is a reversible MAO inhibitor with serotonin toxicity potential; in cohorts with prolonged use, neurologic and ophthalmologic toxicities are common, which could worsen neurologic morbidity or confound encephalitis assessment, so the harm–benefit balance is unfavorable in viral encephalitis with no antiviral upside [^1147H6bC] [^114i6PQ7] [^116AaEny] [^113uWxwK] [^111prt5j].

> But wait, what if the patient actually has a bacterial coinfection or health care–associated ventriculitis rather than HSV/VZV encephalitis? I should confirm the diagnosis with HSV/VZV PCR on CSF and MRI findings; start acyclovir empirically while testing, and if two appropriately timed HSV PCRs are negative with non-characteristic MRI and clinical picture, then de-escalation of acyclovir is reasonable, but none of these diagnostic algorithms create an indication for linezolid in herpetic encephalitis itself [^111pws75] [^113Xb5ib] [^112XDskW].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the recommendation is explicit. Linezolid has no antiviral mechanism, no supporting evidence in HSV/VZV encephalitis, is not recommended by guidelines, and carries neurologic and hematologic toxicities that add risk without benefit; therefore, do not use linezolid for herpetic encephalitis, and instead initiate guideline-concordant IV acyclovir promptly at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14–21 days while pursuing diagnostic confirmation and reassessment per protocol [^1179HQd4] [^114e3wVR] [^113Co6bp] [^112ymbLB].

---

Linezolid is not effective for herpetic encephalitis because it has **no antiviral activity** against HSV-1 or HSV-2 [^111R8ZwV]. The standard of care is **IV acyclovir** [^114e3wVR] (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14–21 days) [^113Co6bp]. Linezolid is only for bacterial coinfections and is not recommended as primary or adjunctive therapy for herpetic encephalitis [^1179HQd4].

---

## Mechanism of action and antiviral activity

Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that **inhibits bacterial protein synthesis** by binding the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing formation of the 70S initiation complex [^117XVbXo]. This mechanism is specific to bacteria and does not affect viral replication, including HSV-1 and HSV-2 [^1179HQd4]. No evidence supports **antiviral activity** of linezolid against HSV or any other virus [^111R8ZwV]. Its clinical utility is limited to bacterial infections, particularly Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA and VRE [^117XVbXo] [^111nZ79M].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for linezolid in herpetic encephalitis [^116jc3mq]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Association of British Neurologists/British Infection Association (ABN/BIA) recommend intravenous acyclovir as the standard treatment for HSV encephalitis [^114e3wVR] [^112ymbLB]. Acyclovir, a nucleoside analog that **inhibits viral DNA polymerase**, reduces viral replication and improves clinical outcomes in HSV encephalitis [^113Xb5ib] [^113vkJit]. Delayed initiation is associated with significantly worse outcomes [^111TK9zU], underscoring the importance of early antiviral therapy [^111LPKgi].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and CNS penetration

Linezolid has good CNS penetration, achieving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations about 70% of plasma levels. However, this pharmacokinetic property **does not translate into antiviral efficacy**, as linezolid lacks activity against HSV [^111R8ZwV]. In contrast, acyclovir achieves therapeutic CNS concentrations and has **proven efficacy** in treating HSV encephalitis [^113Xb5ib].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

Linezolid is associated with **significant adverse effects**, particularly with prolonged use [^1147H6bC]. These include:

- **Myelosuppression**: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia, particularly with treatment durations exceeding two weeks.

- **Peripheral and optic neuropathy**: Risk increases with prolonged use, potentially leading to irreversible vision loss [^1147H6bC] [^112GdWq7] [^111prt5j].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk when combined with serotonergic agents due to MAO inhibition [^111R8ZwV].

- **Lactic acidosis**: Rare but serious adverse effect [^1147H6bC] [^114i6PQ7].

Given these risks, linezolid **should only be used when clearly indicated** for bacterial infections and not as an antiviral agent [^1147H6bC].

---

## Clinical scenarios for linezolid use in encephalitis

Linezolid may be considered in encephalitis cases complicated by **bacterial coinfections**, particularly Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA or VRE [^113hnh97] [^1137Gq3d]. In such cases, linezolid treats the bacterial infection, not the viral encephalitis itself [^111R8ZwV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Linezolid is **not effective for herpetic encephalitis** because it lacks antiviral activity against HSV. The standard treatment remains intravenous acyclovir, which has proven efficacy and is supported by clinical guidelines. Linezolid should be reserved for bacterial coinfection and not used as primary or adjunctive therapy for herpetic encephalitis.

### Ribosome-targeting antibiotics impair T cell effector function and ameliorate autoimmunity by blocking mitochondrial protein synthesis [^116xDQfM]. Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

Linezolid inhibits the onset of a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease: To determine if Th cell responses in vivo were altered by RAbos treatment, we employed the murine model of T cell-mediated autoimmunity experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunized mice developed classical clinical signs of EAE, presenting with infiltrating Th cells in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as decreased motility. Administration of a human-equivalent dose of linezolid limited the development and severity of EAE symptoms (Figures 1A and 1B). This correlated with a lower frequency and numbers of MOG-specific IL-17- and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing Th cells in the CNS of linezolid-treated mice (Figure 1C); the frequency of FoxP3+ Th cells was not affected. Antibiotics can disturb the intestinal microbiome, which in turn can influence the outcome of an immune response. To rule out that any effects mediated by linezolid were due to its antibacterial activity, vancomycin, which holds a similar spectrum of bacterial activity as linezolid, was used as control. Of note, while vancomycin inhibits cell wall synthesis in bacterial cells, linezolid inhibits prokaryotic ribosomes. Vancomycin-treated mice developed severe EAE symptoms comparable to those of the untreated group, suggesting that linezolid's immunosuppression was due to its effect on host, and not bacterial, cells.

### Linezolid [^112NTkat]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Linezolid is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled crossover thorough QT study, 40 healthy subjects were administered a single linezolid 600 mg dose via a 1-hour IV infusion, a single linezolid 1200 mg dose via a 1-hour IV infusion, placebo, and a single oral dose of positive control. At both the 600 mg and 1200 mg linezolid doses, no significant effect on QTc interval was detected at peak plasma concentration or at any other time.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The mean pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults after single and multiple oral and intravenous doses are summarized in Table 8. Plasma concentrations of linezolid at steady-state after oral doses of 600 mg given every 12 hours are shown in Figure 1.

	- Figure 1. Plasma Concentrations of Linezolid in Adults at Steady-State Following Oral Dosing Every 12 Hours (Mean ± Standard Deviation, n = 16)

	**Absorption**: Linezolid is extensively absorbed after oral dosing. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing, and the absolute bioavailability is approximately 100%. Therefore, linezolid may be given orally or intravenously without dose adjustment. Linezolid may be administered without regard to the timing of meals. The time to reach the maximum concentration is delayed from 1.5 hours to 2.2 hours, and Cmax is decreased by about 17% when high-fat food is given with linezolid. However, the total exposure measured as AUC0–∞ is similar under both conditions.

### Linezolid-associated neurologic adverse events in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, France [^116AaEny]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Linezolid is one of the most effective drugs for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), but adverse effects remain problematic. We evaluated 57 MDR TB patients who had received more than one dose of linezolid during 2011–2016. Overall, patients received 600 mg/day of linezolid for a median of 13 months. In 33 (58%) patients, neurologic or ophthalmologic signs developed, and 18 (32%) had confirmed peripheral neuropathy, which was irreversible for 78% at 12 months after the end of TB treatment despite linezolid withdrawal. Among the 19 patients who underwent ophthalmologic evaluation, 14 had optic neuropathy that fully reversed for 2. A total of 16 (33%) of 49 patients had a linezolid trough concentration greater than 2 mg/L, and among these, 14 (88%) experienced adverse effects. No significant association was found between trough concentration and neurologic toxicity. These findings suggest the need to closely monitor patients for neurologic signs and discuss the optimal duration of linezolid treatment.

### Linezolid-associated toxic optic neuropathy [^112GdWq7]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The oxazolidinone antimicrobial linezolid is effective against gram-positive bacteria. Although the maximal recommended therapy is 28 days, treatment durations greater than this are common. Linezolid may cause reversible optic neuropathy and irreversible peripheral neuropathy after months of treatment. Three cases of linezolid-induced optic and peripheral neuropathy are described, and previously reported cases of linezolid-induced optic neuropathy are reviewed. The mechanism of neural toxicity may be impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis.

### Encephalitis in US children [^112C3YTF]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is an uncommon but severe disease characterized by neurologic dysfunction with central nervous system inflammation. Children with encephalitis should receive supportive care and empiric therapies for common and treatable causes while prioritizing diagnostic evaluation for common, treatable, and high-risk conditions. Even with an extensive diagnostic workup, an infectious cause is identified in less than half of cases, suggesting a role for postinfectious or noninfectious processes.

---

### Linezolid [^111R8ZwV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including linezolid, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections, such as the common cold. When linezolid is prescribed for a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although feeling better early in the course of therapy is common, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance, rendering linezolid or other antibacterial drugs ineffective in the future.

Patients should be advised that:

- **Linezolid dosage**: It may be taken with or without food.
- **Hypertension history**: They should inform their physician if they have a history of hypertension.
- **Tyramine content**: Large quantities of foods or beverages high in tyramine should be avoided while taking linezolid tablets 600 mg. Foods high in tyramine include those that have undergone protein changes through aging, fermentation, pickling, or smoking to enhance flavor, such as aged cheeses, fermented or air-dried meats, sauerkraut, soy sauce, tap beers, and red wines. The tyramine content of any protein-rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated.
- **Other medications**: They should inform their physician if they are taking medications containing pseudoephedrine HCl or phenylpropanolamine HCl, such as cold remedies and decongestants. They should also inform their physician if they are taking serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or other antidepressants.

### Trimipramine maleate [^116nXFWP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Who should not take trimipramine maleate capsules?

Do not take trimipramine maleate capsules if you are taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are unsure whether you are taking an MAOI, including the antibiotic linezolid. Do not take an MAOI within 2 weeks of stopping trimipramine maleate capsules unless directed by your physician. Similarly, do not start trimipramine maleate capsules if you have stopped taking an MAOI in the last 2 weeks unless directed by your physician.

- **What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines**: Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first consulting a healthcare provider. Abruptly stopping an antidepressant can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is essential to discuss all the risks of treating depression and the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment options with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.

Antidepressant medicines can have side effects. Discuss these with your healthcare provider regarding the specific medication prescribed for you or your family member. Additionally, antidepressant medications can interact with other medications. Be aware of all the medicines you or your family member are taking. Maintain a list of all medications to share with your healthcare provider, and do not start new medicines without first consulting with your healthcare provider. Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children.

### Characteristics, management and outcome of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus encephalitis: a multicentre prospective cohort study [^111LPKgi]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Low credibility.

To characterize differences between herpes simplex virus encephalitis and varicella-zoster virus encephalitis (HSVE and VZVE) and other aetiologies of infectious encephalitis (IE), and to investigate the impact of time-to-aciclovir (ACV) start, ACV dose, and duration on outcome, we compared 132 HSVE, 65 VZVE, and 297 other IE enrolled in a prospective cohort (ENCEIF). We estimated associations between time-to-ACV start, dose, or duration and outcome through adjusted odds ratio (aOR) using logistic regression analysis.

Prevalence of immunodepression differed among aetiologies: 15/65 (23%) for VZVE, 13/132 (10%) for HSVE, and 30/297 (10%) for other IE (p < 0.05). The presence of seizure at admission was also different: 27/132 (20%) for HSVE, 4/65 (6%) for VZVE, and 43/297 (14%) for other IE (p < 0.05). Poor outcome at hospital discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale ≤ 3) varied among the three groups: 40/127 (31%) for HSVE, 12/65 (18%) for VZVE, and 38/290 (13%) for other IE (p < 0.05). Time-to-ACV start was associated with outcome in HSVE (aOR 3.61 [1.25–10.40]), but not in VZVE (aOR 0.84 [0.18–3.85]). Increased ACV dose was not associated with outcome among HSVE (aOR 1.25 [0.44–3.64]) nor VZVE (aOR 1.16 [0.24–5.73]).

HSVE and VZVE are distinct in clinical presentation, outcome, and prognostic factors. The impact of early ACV initiation was more apparent for HSVE than for VZVE; however, this could be because of VZVE's smaller sample size and lower outcome rate, leading to low statistical power or because of potential distinct IE pathophysiology.

### Linezolid [^112AaY89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adult patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy trial. The study involved comparing study medications initially administered intravenously, followed by oral medications, for a total of 10 to 21 days of treatment. One group of patients received linezolid injection 600 mg every 12 hours, followed by linezolid tablets 600 mg every 12 hours. The other group received oxacillin 2 g every 6 hours intravenously, followed by dicloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours orally. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam if clinically indicated.

There were 400 linezolid-treated and 419 oxacillin-treated patients enrolled in the study. Two hundred forty-five (61%) linezolid-treated patients and 242 (58%) oxacillin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates for clinically evaluable patients were 90% for the linezolid group and 85% for the oxacillin group. A modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis of 316 linezolid-treated patients and 313 oxacillin-treated patients included subjects who met all criteria for study entry. The cure rates in the MITT analysis were 86% in linezolid-treated patients and 82% in oxacillin-treated patients. The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 15.

A separate study provided additional experience with the use of linezolid in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This was a randomized, open-label trial in hospitalized patients.

### Linezolid [^111pGzpP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotics

- **Aztreonam**: The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or aztreonam are not altered when administered together.

- **Gentamicin**: The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or gentamicin are not altered when administered together.

Antioxidants

The potential for drug-drug interactions with linezolid and the antioxidants Vitamin C and Vitamin E was studied in healthy volunteers. Subjects were administered a 600 mg oral dose of linezolid on Day 1, and another 600 mg dose on Day 8. On Days 2–9, subjects were given either Vitamin C (1000 mg/day) or Vitamin E (800 IU/day). The AUC0–∞ of linezolid increased by 2.3% when co-administered with Vitamin C and by 10.9% with Vitamin E. No linezolid dose adjustment is recommended during co-administration with Vitamin C or Vitamin E.

Strong CYP 3A4 inducers

- **Rifampin**: The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid was evaluated in a study of 16 healthy adult males. Volunteers were administered oral linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 5 doses with and without rifampin 600 mg once daily for 8 days. Co-administration of rifampin with linezolid resulted in a 21% decrease in linezolid Cmax [90% CI, 15%–27%] and a 32% decrease in linezolid AUC0–12 [90% CI, 27%–37%]. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood and may be related to the induction of hepatic enzymes. Other strong inducers of hepatic enzymes (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) could cause a similar or smaller decrease in linezolid exposure.

### Clinical failures of linezolid and implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory [^112qKDah]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment for Patient 2 was switched from empiric vancomycin to linezolid for VRE bacteremia, despite linezolid not being part of her initial susceptibility data. Unfortunately, the sensitivities to linezolid were only available after the patient passed away. Had linezolid been included in the initial susceptibility data, alternative therapies might have been pursued, considering the isolate was resistant to linezolid. It is arguable that her death could have been prevented.

Multidrug-resistant organisms, particularly VRE, continue to contribute significantly to illness and death. A published case series involving linezolid use in 15 patients with VRE infections reported high mortality at long-term follow-up. Two primary explanations may account for this high mortality rate. First, the identified patients were severely ill, with multiple coexisting conditions or illnesses. Second, alternative options were considered before initiating linezolid, which may have inadvertently increased morbidity and mortality due to delays in administering linezolid therapy. This argument is supported by studies showing a significantly higher rate of hospital deaths for patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy compared to those who received appropriate initial therapy.

### Clinical experience with linezolid for the treatment of central nervous system infections [^115sc1jA]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, exhibits bacteriostatic activity against virtually all Gram-positive bacteria and even covers atypical organisms like mycobacteria and Nocardia. However, little is known about its effectiveness for central nervous system (CNS) infections. We report on our positive experience with linezolid for the treatment of CNS infections in 10 patients, among whom three cases were caused by mycobacteria. While six of our patients clinically improved during linezolid therapy, even after the failure of various antibiotics, it was unsuccessful in one case. Side effects were limited to mild gastrointestinal problems in one patient after long-term treatment, which, however, led to the cessation of therapy. Linezolid appears to be a safe alternative to vancomycin for therapy-resistant CNS infections because of its good cerebrospinal fluid penetration and few side effects.

### Zyvox [^111amHGs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of the parent drug, linezolid, are not altered in patients with any degree of renal impairment; however, the two primary metabolites of linezolid accumulate in patients with renal impairment, with the amount of accumulation increasing with the severity of renal dysfunction (see Table 10). The pharmacokinetics of linezolid and its two metabolites have also been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. In the ESRD study, 14 patients were dosed with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for 14.5 days. Because similar plasma concentrations of linezolid are achieved regardless of renal function, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. However, given the absence of information on the clinical significance of accumulation of the primary metabolites, use of linezolid in patients with renal impairment should be weighed against the potential risks of accumulation of these metabolites. Both linezolid and the two metabolites are eliminated by hemodialysis. No information is available on the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid. Approximately 30% of a dose was eliminated in a 3-hour hemodialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered; therefore, linezolid should be given after hemodialysis.

The pharmacokinetics of linezolid are not altered in patients (n = 7) with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B). Based on the available information, no dose adjustment is recommended.

### Global landscape of encephalitis: Key priorities to reduce future disease burden [^113vkJit]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Specific treatments are available for some important causes of encephalitis, including doxycycline for scrub typhus, immunotherapy for autoimmune encephalitis, and acyclovir for HSV and VZV. We focus here on the global availability of intravenous (IV) acyclovir. Empirical treatment with IV acyclovir is recommended for patients with suspected encephalitis in most high-income countries (HICs), until the diagnosis is either confirmed or excluded. In settings where there are outbreaks from other causes, especially arboviruses, acyclovir is often reserved for those in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of HSV. Prompt treatment with IV acyclovir has been shown to reduce the case fatality of HSV encephalitis from 70% to 10%–20%. Oral acyclovir is not suitable as it does not result in adequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration, though oral valaciclovir may be an alternative which requires further investigation. The WHO List of Essential Medicines includes acyclovir for both adults and children but does not specifically refer to encephalitis or specify the route of administration.

IV acyclovir is widely available in HICs across Europe, North America, and Australia; however, there is some evidence of suboptimal administration that is not in accordance with guidelines. Studies in the United Kingdom showed that only 53% of patients with suspected encephalitis received IV acyclovir, less than one-third were prescribed within 6 hours of admission, and the duration of treatment for some was too short. Acyclovir availability appears variable in Asia, with Japan, India, and Pakistan.

### Zyvox [^111MSzPe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Antibacterial drugs**:
	- **Aztreonam**: The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or aztreonam are not altered when administered together.
	- **Gentamicin**: The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or gentamicin are not altered when administered together.

- **Antioxidants**:
	- The potential for drug-drug interactions with linezolid and the antioxidants Vitamin C and Vitamin E was studied in healthy volunteers. Subjects were administered a 600 mg oral dose of linezolid on Day 1, and another 600 mg dose on Day 8. On Days 2–9, subjects were given either Vitamin C (1,000 mg/day) or Vitamin E (800 IU/day). The AUC0–∞of linezolid increased 2.3% when co-administered with Vitamin C and 10.9% when co-administered with Vitamin E. No linezolid dose adjustment is recommended during co-administration with Vitamin C or Vitamin E.

- **Strong CYP 3A4 inducers**:
	- **Rifampin**: The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid was evaluated in a study of 16 healthy adult males. Volunteers were administered oral linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 5 doses with and without rifampin 600 mg once daily for 8 days. Co-administration of rifampin with linezolid resulted in a 21% decrease in linezolid Cmax [90% CI, 15% – 27%] and a 32% decrease in linezolid AUC0–12 [90% CI, 27% – 37%]. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood and may be related to the induction of hepatic enzymes. Other strong inducers of hepatic enzymes (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) could cause a similar or smaller decrease in linezolid exposure.

### Clinical failures of linezolid and implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory [^1142Qinb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Linezolid is the first in a new class of antimicrobials, the oxazolidinones. This antimicrobial is approved to treat gram-positive infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Newer antibiotics have provided clinicians with greater treatment options; however, ongoing experience shows limitations in their use. We report two patients with infections caused by linezolid-resistant and possible linezolid-nonsusceptible bacteria and provide commentary on the increasing bacterial resistance to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin, as well as the appropriate use of these and future antibiotics.

### Linezolid versus glycopeptide or beta-lactam for treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115aM38i]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2008). High credibility.

Linezolid has been approved for the treatment of patients with infections caused by gram-positive cocci that are resistant to traditionally used antibiotics, including glycopeptides. This oxazolidinone antibiotic has been reported to have excellent pharmacokinetics and effectiveness. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether linezolid is superior to glycopeptides or beta-lactams for the treatment of gram-positive infections. Twelve RCTs, involving 6093 patients, were included.

Overall, with respect to treatment success, linezolid was more effective than glycopeptides or beta-lactams (odds ratio [OR] 1.41 [95% CI 1.11–1.81]). Mortality was similar between the groups (OR 0.97 [0.79–1.19]). Linezolid was more effective than comparators in patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (OR 1.67 [1.31–2.12]) and bacteremia (OR 2.07 [1.13–3.78]). However, there was no difference in treatment success for patients with pneumonia (OR 1.03 [0.75–1.42]).

Treatment with linezolid was not associated with more adverse effects in general (OR 1.40 [0.95–2.06]); however, thrombocytopenia was recorded more commonly in patients receiving linezolid (OR 11.72 [3.66–37.57]). Although linezolid is more effective than its comparators for the empirical treatment of selected patients, several points, such as the use of less potent antistaphylococcal beta-lactams, the same all-cause mortality, and the higher probability of thrombocytopenia, should be taken into account. These considerations may limit the use of linezolid to specific patient populations or infections that are difficult to treat.

### Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections caused by herpesviruses [^111pws75]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Herpesviruses may be associated with various types of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) must be considered one of the most severe diseases. As effective antiviral drugs are available, rapid and reliable diagnosis has become important.

- **Objectives**: To describe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serological methods for the detection of herpesvirus-induced CNS infections using the example of HSE.

- **Study design**: 620 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 2,400 serum samples from 2,700 selected hospitalized patients with clinical suspicion of encephalitis were tested for herpes simplex virus (HSV) as well as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA and HSV-specific antibodies, respectively.

- **Results**: HSV-1 DNA could be detected in eight and HSV-2 in three patients with focal encephalitis. Additionally, HSV-2 DNA was found in two newborns with encephalitis, and two adults suffered from transverse lumbar myelitis. One VZV DNA-positive patient had developed herpes zoster accompanied by meningoencephalitis, and in the other, an encephalitis without cutaneous rash was diagnosed. Intrathecal antibody synthesis could be measured when CSF was cleared from viral DNA.

- **Conclusions**: The detection of viral DNA by PCR technique has become the "gold standard" method for laboratory diagnosis of herpesvirus infections of the CNS. Serodiagnosis may be useful to confirm the diagnosis retrospectively.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^115ugoME]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Linezolid, a member of the oxazolidinones class, is available in both IV and oral formulations. It offers an option for an early switch to oral therapy. Dose reduction is not necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Linezolid has demonstrated effectiveness against many resistant gram-positive organisms, including MRSA, VRE, and macrolide-resistant streptococci. In a study of patients with ABSSSIs due to MRSA, those treated with linezolid had significantly higher clinical and microbiological success rates at the end of treatment compared to those treated with vancomycin. Although linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia and anemia are typically mild, reversible, and duration dependent, there is a noted interaction between linezolid and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Tedizolid, a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor, can be administered once daily, either orally or IV at equivalent doses. In two randomized trials, treatment with tedizolid for six days was shown to be noninferior to linezolid for ten days. Additionally, differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs) between tedizolid and linezolid have been observed, possibly due to the effects of these agents on intestinal flora. Studies show that the impact of tedizolid on normal intestinal flora is limited and reversible, whereas linezolid causes marked changes in gut flora composition. Furthermore, the less frequent dosing with tedizolid (once daily vs. twice daily with linezolid) may somewhat reduce the overall risk of developing gastrointestinal AEs.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin have been evaluated in several recent trials, which…

### State of the art: Acute encephalitis [^113Xb5ib]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Encephalitis is a devastating neurologic disease often complicated by prolonged neurologic deficits. Best practices for the management of adult patients include universal testing for a core group of etiologies, including herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, varicella zoster virus (VZV), enteroviruses, West Nile virus, and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) antibody encephalitis. Empiric acyclovir therapy should be started at presentation and, in selected cases, continued until a second HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction test is negative. The acyclovir dose can be increased for VZV encephalitis. Supportive care is necessary for other viral etiologies.

Patients in whom no cause for encephalitis is identified represent a particular challenge. Management includes repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging, imaging for occult malignancy, and empiric immunomodulatory treatment for autoimmune conditions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or brain biopsy should be considered. The rapid pace of discovery regarding autoimmune encephalitis and the development of advanced molecular tests such as NGS have improved diagnosis and outcomes. Research priorities include the development of novel therapeutics.

### The role of antiviral therapy in immunocompromised patients with herpes simplex virus meningitis [^115PZ7XX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important causes of acute neurologic illness. Although the role of acyclovir in treating HSV encephalitis is clear, the role of antiviral therapy in HSV meningitis remains controversial.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the charts of all patients with cerebrospinal fluid specimens positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by polymerase chain reaction between July 2000 and November 2012. Patients' charts were reviewed for demographic data, clinical presentation, treatment, and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Forty-two patient episodes were clinically classified as meningitis. In 6 episodes (14.3%), patients with meningitis received no antivirals, whereas the remaining episodes were treated with an oral antiviral (n = 11 [26.2%]), combination intravenous and oral therapy (n = 22 [52.4%]), or intravenous acyclovir alone (n = 3 [7.1%]). Six patients had recurrent episodes of meningitis, and all recovered without any neurologic sequelae. Neurologic outcomes were significantly improved with antiviral therapy in immunocompromised patients with herpes meningitis (P < .05), but not in the 27 patient episodes among immunocompetent patients (P = 1.0), as no neurologic sequelae were noted in this group.

- **Conclusions**: Most patients with HSV meningitis rapidly improve, but immunocompromised hosts have more neurologic sequelae and may benefit from antiviral therapy. Our data suggest symptomatic treatment alone for immunocompetent patients with HSV meningitis, avoiding the cost and side effects of prolonged antiviral use.

### Early onset probable linezolid-induced encephalopathy [^114u3iHA]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Linezolid is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of gram-positive pathogens. While neurological complications with linezolid are rare, long-term exposure can be associated with neurotoxic effects. Patients with pre-existing neurologic sequelae or risk factors, such as alcohol abuse, diabetes, or the concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic agents and/or antiretroviral therapy, may be more susceptible to the development of linezolid-induced neurotoxicity. We describe a 41-year-old male who developed early onset encephalopathy following a day and a half of linezolid therapy. Our patient had at least one significant risk factor (alcoholism), making linezolid-induced encephalopathy probable based on the Naranjo probability scale. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for early onset linezolid-induced neurotoxicity, particularly in patients with concomitant risk factors.

Peripheral and optic neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In Trial 1, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 81% of patients. Most of these adverse reactions (64%) occurred after 8 weeks of treatment and resulted in dosing interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid. Severe, moderate, and mild peripheral neuropathy occurred in 22%, 32%, and 26% of patients, respectively. No adverse reaction related to peripheral neuropathy led to a discontinuation of the entire study regimen.

In Trial 2, 17 (38%) patients reported an adverse reaction of peripheral neuropathy in the 1,200 mg 26-week treatment group; one of these reactions led to treatment discontinuation. In the 600 mg 26-week treatment group, 10 (22%) patients reported peripheral neuropathy, and none required linezolid treatment interruption or treatment discontinuation.

Optic neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Two patients (2%) in Trial 1 developed optic neuropathy after 16 weeks of treatment. Both cases were serious, confirmed on retinal examination as optic neuropathy/neuritis, and resulted in discontinuation of linezolid; both adverse reactions resolved.

Overall, patients administered a linezolid dose of 600 mg twice daily had a similar safety profile to those administered a dose of 1,200 mg once daily.

In Trial 2 overall, 4 (2%) patients reported an adverse reaction of optic neuropathy. All 4 patients were in the 1,200 mg linezolid 26-week treatment group (9%). The maximum severity was grade 1 (mild) for 1 patient and grade 2 (moderate) for 2 patients.

### Zyvox [^113iY7W5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of linezolid have been evaluated in pediatric patients from birth to 17 years of age. In general, weight-based clearance of linezolid gradually decreases with increasing age of pediatric patients. However, in preterm neonates (gestational age < 34 weeks) who are less than 7 days old, linezolid clearance is often lower than in full-term neonates of the same age. Consequently, preterm neonates under 7 days of age may require an alternative linezolid dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In limited clinical experience, 5 out of 6 (83%) pediatric patients with infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4 mcg/mL treated with Zyvox achieved clinical cures. However, pediatric patients exhibit wider variability in linezolid clearance and systemic exposure (AUC) compared with adults. For pediatric patients with a sub-optimal clinical response, particularly those with pathogens having an MIC of 4 mcg/mL, factors such as lower systemic exposure, site and severity of infection, and the underlying medical condition should be considered when assessing clinical response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Geriatric use**: Of the 2,046 patients treated with Zyvox in Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trials, 589 (29%) were 65 years or older and 253 (12%) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified substantial differences.

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^112Lu6A6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is universally fatal without treatment. Even among patients who receive recommended therapy, 25%–50% will die, and those who survive often experience neurological disability. Despite these poor outcomes, there is a paucity of data on how to optimize antituberculosis therapy for TBM, particularly for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The highest proportion of deaths occurs within the first month after treatment initiation, suggesting a critical early window where enhanced treatment could significantly impact clinical outcomes.

In the absence of compelling data to guide treatment, the same standard drug regimens and dosing used for pulmonary tuberculosis are empirically applied to TBM, except for a longer continuation phase to complete 9–12 months of therapy. This approach assumes equivalent efficacy of tuberculosis drugs at all sites of infection, disregarding the unique challenges of treating infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Effective drugs for TBM must penetrate the blood-brain barrier and remain in the CNS to achieve bactericidal concentrations for an adequate duration. At the standard dosing recommended in guidelines, rifampin, a key drug in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seldom reaches minimal inhibitory concentrations for M. tuberculosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), potentially jeopardizing treatment efficacy in TBM.

Several recently completed or ongoing clinical trials are investigating the effect of high-dose rifampin on mortality rates.

### Don't rash it! The clinical significance of positive Varicella zoster virus PCR in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurological symptoms [^114t9rtQ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is among the leading pathogens causing meningitis and encephalitis. While VZV-PCR-positive CSF is considered a gold standard for diagnosis, it is not uncommon to detect VZV-DNA in the CSF of patients with other acute or chronic illnesses. Our goal was to determine the clinical relevance of VZV-PCR-positive CSF when investigating patients with neurological symptoms.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort from the largest hospital in Israel, we collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients with VZV-PCR-positive CSF, analyzing the significance of various parameters.

- **Results**: During a 5-year study, 125 patient-unique VZV-PCR-positive CSFs were recorded, in which only 9 alternative diagnoses were noted. The most common symptoms were headache (N = 104, 83%) and rash (N = 96, 76%). PCR cycle threshold (Ct), a surrogate of viral burden, did not significantly vary across the clinical manifestations; however, patients with rash and Ct < 35 were prone to develop stroke in the following year (N = 6, 7%). Empiric nucleoside-analogue treatment was not associated with a better outcome compared to treatment administered upon a positive PCR result.

- **Discussion**: Our findings suggest that in patients with neurological symptoms, detection of VZV-DNA in CSF renders VZV the probable culprit. Nevertheless, a systematic evaluation of treatment and follow-up algorithms for patients with suspected or proved VZV meningitis and encephalitis is needed. The benefits of prompt treatment should be weighed against the potential complications of nucleoside analogues.

### Viral encephalitis [^117L4W34]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Acute viral encephalitis may be caused by a wide range of viruses; however, the most important is herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) due to its severity, especially if untreated, and its good response to specific treatment with acyclovir. The outcome of any CNS viral infection depends on both the immune status of the host and the virulence of the infecting virus.

In evaluating a patient with suspected viral encephalitis, there are three essential steps: identifying a true parenchymal virus infection of the brain rather than a non-infective encephalopathy; distinguishing an infectious viral encephalitis from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM); and, when possible, determining the specific virus involved. In practice, the precise viral cause of encephalitis may never be established.

Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been a significant advance in diagnosing HSE, as this test has very high sensitivity and specificity, especially with appropriate sample timing. It is essential to commence early treatment with intravenous acyclovir in patients suspected of having HSE because of the remarkable safety and efficacy of this drug and the dangers of delaying potentially effective treatment for life-threatening disease.

This review outlines the general management approach for patients suspected of having viral encephalitis.

### Linezolid [^1147H6bC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Myelosuppression**: Myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, has been reported in patients receiving linezolid. In cases where the outcome is known, discontinuing linezolid has led to a rise in the affected hematologic parameters toward pretreatment levels. Complete blood counts should be monitored weekly in patients who are on linezolid, especially those receiving it for more than two weeks, those with pre-existing myelosuppression, those taking concomitant bone marrow-suppressing drugs, or those with chronic infections who have received prior or concurrent antibiotic therapy. Discontinuation of linezolid therapy should be considered for patients who develop or have worsening myelosuppression.

- **Peripheral and optic neuropathy**: Peripheral and optic neuropathies have been reported in patients treated with linezolid, primarily in those treated beyond the maximum recommended duration of 28 days. In cases where optic neuropathy progressed to loss of vision, the treatment duration extended beyond the recommended limit. Visual blurring has been noted in some patients treated for less than 28 days. Cases of peripheral and optic neuropathy have also been reported in children. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as changes in visual acuity, color vision changes, blurred vision, or visual field defects, a prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended. Visual function should be monitored in all patients taking linezolid.

### Therapeutic effect of linezolid in children with health care-associated meningitis or ventriculitis [^111pBG9t]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of linezolid treatment in six children with health care-associated meningitis or ventriculitis (HCAMV) caused by gram-positive cocci. All children were diagnosed and treated at the Ehime University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2017. Of these, five were treated with linezolid as an empirical therapy. Initially, vancomycin was used in these five patients, but it was changed to linezolid due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture positivity (n = 3) and a high minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin (n = 2).

- **Pathogens**: The most common HCAMV pathogens were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3).
- **Treatment observations**: In three patients, vancomycin concentration was low in CSF but reached the target concentration in serum, while linezolid concentration was high in both CSF and serum. HCAMV treatment using antimicrobial agents with poor CSF penetration may increase the likelihood of therapy failure.
- **Conclusion**: Linezolid is more susceptible as the first-line treatment for HCAMV compared with vancomycin.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^114Br52K]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is generally diagnosed based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can differentiate common aetiologies. Epidemiological factors can guide further investigations. Most clinical management guidelines (CMGs) recommended urgent blood and CSF sampling, unless lumbar puncture (LP) is contraindicated due to signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also recommended when possible, or alternatively computed tomography (CT), since MRI can be useful to detect early changes, for excluding alternative causes, and is more sensitive and specific compared to CT. It was highlighted that although some specific changes on MRI have been associated with certain aetiological agents (e.g. HSV and arboviruses), it does not always assist in differentiation and findings might initially be normal. Electroencephalography (EEG) to aid diagnostics was mainly recommended for patients displaying certain symptoms, such as altered behavior or non-convulsive seizures, to exclude non-infectious causes.

### Linezolid [^115k7XUg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: The pharmacokinetics of the parent drug, linezolid, are not altered in patients with any degree of renal impairment. However, the two primary metabolites of linezolid accumulate in these patients, with the accumulation increasing with the severity of renal dysfunction. The pharmacokinetics of linezolid and its two metabolites have also been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. In the ESRD study, 14 patients were dosed with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for 14.5 days. Because similar plasma concentrations of linezolid are achieved regardless of renal function, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. However, given the absence of information on the clinical significance of the accumulation of the primary metabolites, the use of linezolid in patients with renal impairment should be weighed against the potential risks of metabolite accumulation. Both linezolid and the two metabolites are eliminated by hemodialysis. No information is available on the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid. Approximately 30% of a dose was eliminated in a 3-hour hemodialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered; therefore, linezolid should be given after hemodialysis.

- **Hepatic impairment**: The pharmacokinetics of linezolid are not altered in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B). Based on the available information, no dose adjustment is recommended for these patients.

### Linezolid-associated neurologic adverse events in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, France [^114BHMcH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Linezolid is one of the most effective drugs for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), but adverse effects remain problematic. We evaluated 57 MDR TB patients who had received > 1 dose of linezolid during 2011–2016. Overall, patients received 600 mg/day of linezolid for a median of 13 months. In 33 (58%) patients, neurologic or ophthalmologic signs developed, and 18 (32%) had confirmed peripheral neuropathy, which was irreversible for 78% at 12 months after the end of TB treatment, despite linezolid withdrawal.

Among the 19 patients who underwent ophthalmologic evaluation, 14 had optic neuropathy that fully reversed for 2 patients. A total of 16 (33%) of 49 patients had a linezolid trough concentration > 2 mg/L, and among these, 14 (88%) experienced adverse effects. No significant association was found between trough concentration and neurologic toxicity. These findings suggest the need to closely monitor patients for neurologic signs and discuss the optimal duration of linezolid treatment.

Regarding medical management for encephalitis, more specifically with respect to specific therapy, the ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the discontinuation of acyclovir in immunocompetent patients in the following situations:

- **Alternative diagnosis**: An alternative diagnosis has been made.

- **Negative HSV PCR and MRI not characteristic**: HSV PCR in the CSF is negative on two occasions 24–48 hours apart, and the MRI is not characteristic for HSV encephalitis.

- **Negative HSV PCR once > 72 hours after symptom onset**: HSV PCR in the CSF is negative once more than 72 hours after the onset of neurological symptoms, with unaltered consciousness, a normal MRI (obtained more than 72 hours after symptom onset), and a CSF white cell count of less than 5×10⁶/L.

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^112Pvr9X]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The 24-week overall survival rate was higher for participants who received linezolid than for those who did not. At 12 weeks, 14 participants (35%) had died, with 5 deaths (25%) in the linezolid group and 9 (45%) in the no-linezolid group (odds ratio [OR] for linezolid group, 0.41 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10–1.52; P = 0.19]; adjusted OR, 0.28 [0.06–1.23; P = 0.10]). At 24 weeks, 1 additional participant in the linezolid group had died, for a total of 15 deaths (37.5%) (OR for linezolid group, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.14–1.90; P = 0.33]; adjusted OR, 0.43 [0.10–1.71; P = 0.24]). No significant difference in overall survival was observed across treatment arms or by linezolid or rifampin treatment group. Most deaths occurred in the first 6 weeks after initiation of antituberculosis therapy in participants with moderate to severe disease. In a post hoc analysis restricted to participants with moderate to severe disease, overall survival was again observed to be higher for participants who received linezolid than for those who did not.

### Ponvory [^112BehZA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Cases of herpes viral infection have been reported in the development program of Ponvory; herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with other S1P receptor modulators. In study 1, the rate of herpetic infections was 4.8% for both Ponvory-treated patients and those receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox) or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating Ponvory. See vaccinations for additional guidance.

Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and disseminated cryptococcal infections have been reported with other S1P receptor modulators. Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or signs of CM. Patients with symptoms or signs consistent with a cryptococcal infection should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Ponvory treatment should be suspended until a cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.

### Continuous infusion of linezolid for critically ill patients: Toward a new standard of care [^1157LojE]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

**Rethinking the role of MIC in dosing decisions**: MIC variability complicates dose optimization, as values fluctuate with pathogen traits, resistance, and testing methods. Although an MIC of 2 mg/L is often used empirically, it does not always reflect in vivo drug activity or patient-specific factors, limiting its reliability. A broader approach integrating infection severity, drug exposure, and PK/PD profiles is essential.

### Hematologic effects of linezolid in young children [^115N6XL5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Linezolid is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive infections, including hospital and community-acquired pneumonia, as well as complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections. In adults, linezolid treatment for more than two weeks has been associated with reversible hematopoietic suppression, primarily thrombocytopenia.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the occurrence of hematologic effects in children with Gram-positive infections in an open-label study of linezolid versus vancomycin.

- **Methods**: Detailed analyses of hematologic data, including reported hematologic adverse events, complete blood counts, reticulocyte index (RI), and iron studies (serum iron and transferrin saturation), were conducted in both groups at baseline, as well as during and after treatment using an intent-to-treat analysis.

- **Results**: Three hundred sixteen patients (median age, 1.65 years) were randomized 2:1 to linezolid (n = 215) or vancomycin (n = 101) for treatment. Total treatment durations were similar in the vancomycin group (12.2 ± 6.4 days; median, 11.0 days) and the linezolid group (11.3 ± 5.0 days; median, 11.0 days) (P = 0.20). No significant differences were noted in drug-related hematologic events, such as thrombocytopenia (linezolid, 1.9% vs. vancomycin, 0%; P = 0.170), anemia (linezolid, 1.4% vs. vancomycin, 1.0%; P = 0.771) or neutropenia (linezolid, 0% vs. vancomycin, 0%). Hemoglobin values also were similar between treatment groups when assessed by shifts from baseline to the lowest recorded value.

### Outcome of and prognostic factors for herpes simplex encephalitis in adult patients: Results of a multicenter study [^111TK9zU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Management of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) has been considerably improved by the availability of acyclovir therapy and rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assays. However, prognostic factors for this rare affliction are often misestimated. We conducted a large retrospective multicenter study that included 93 adult patients who were diagnosed with HSE by PCR from 1991 through 1998 and were treated with intravenous acyclovir.

Among the 85 patients assessed at 6 months, 30 (35%) had a poor outcome, leading to death in 13 patients (15%) and severe disability in 17 (20%). The outcome was favorable for 55 patients (65%).

- **Prognostic factors**: A multivariate analysis identified two factors that were independently associated with a poor outcome:
	- Simplified Acute Physiology Score II ≥ 27 at admission
	- Delay of more than 2 days between hospital admission and initiation of acyclovir therapy

- **Improvement recommendations**: Early administration of antiviral therapy is the only parameter that can be modified to improve the prognosis of patients with HSE.

### Imlygic [^114hovR5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Herpetic infections, including but not limited to cold sores and herpetic keratitis, and serious cases of disseminated herpetic infections, have been reported in patients treated with IMLYGIC. This includes fatal disseminated herpetic infections in the immunocompromised patient population [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1) and Postmarketing Experience (6.2)]. Immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk of life-threatening disseminated herpetic infection [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Patients who develop suspicious herpes-like lesions should follow standard hygienic practices to prevent viral transmission. Patients or close contacts with suspected herpetic infections should contact their healthcare provider to evaluate the lesions. Suspected herpetic lesions should be reported to Amgen at 1–855-IMLYGIC (1–855–465–9442); patients or close contacts have the option of follow-up testing for further characterization of the infection.

IMLYGIC is sensitive to acyclovir, and acyclovir or other antiviral agents may interfere with the effectiveness of IMLYGIC. Therefore, consider the risks and benefits of IMLYGIC treatment before administering antiviral agents to manage herpetic infection.

- **Injection site complications**: Necrosis or ulceration of tumor tissue may occur during IMLYGIC treatment. Cellulitis and systemic bacterial infection have been reported in clinical studies. Careful wound care and infection precautions are recommended, particularly if tissue necrosis results in open wounds.

### Linezolid-associated neurologic adverse events in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, France [^113uWxwK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

After linezolid withdrawal, a second ophthalmologic examination for 9 patients indicated that 2 had fully recovered, 3 had improved visual acuity with residual impaired vision, and 4 showed no improvement. Five patients did not undergo a second examination, possibly because they had clinical improvement and did not report optical signs/symptoms.

The median delay between linezolid initiation and occurrence of neurologic adverse effects was 8.3 (IQR 4–11) months and ophthalmologic adverse effects was 9.3 (IQR 1.6–15.1) months. Overall, 27 (47%) of the 57 patients had neurologic side effects confirmed by EMG/NCV or specific ophthalmologic examination, 13 (23%) had peripheral neuropathy only, 9 (16%) had ophthalmologic neuropathy only, and 5 (9%) had both. Linezolid treatment duration was 15.1 (IQR 7.2–19.1) months for patients with confirmed neurologic adverse effects and 12.3 (IQR 5.5–21.1) months for those without (p = 0.9148).

### Encephalitis [^112iHeMu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is a serious and potentially treatable infection of the central nervous system. A pathogen is identified in less than 50% of cases. The differential diagnosis includes acute infection, immune-mediated causes, and other central nervous system processes. Emergent investigations include blood work, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuroimaging. Empiric acyclovir and antibiotics should be started immediately to maximize the child's chance of neurologic recovery.

### Linezolid [^117XVbXo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dextromethorphan, a serotonergic agent, was investigated for potential drug-drug interactions with linezolid in healthy volunteers. Subjects received dextromethorphan (two 20-mg doses given 4 hours apart) with or without linezolid. No serotonin syndrome effects, such as confusion, delirium, restlessness, tremors, blushing, diaphoresis, or hyperpyrexia, were observed in normal subjects receiving both linezolid and dextromethorphan.

- **Mechanism of action**: Linezolid is a synthetic antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class, used to treat infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. It also has activity against certain Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. Linezolid binds to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, preventing the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex essential for bacterial reproduction. Time-kill studies have shown linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci, and bactericidal against the majority of streptococci isolates.

- **Mechanisms of resistance**: In vitro studies indicate that point mutations in the 23S rRNA are associated with linezolid resistance. Reports have emerged of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus developing resistance to linezolid during clinical use. The resistance in these organisms is linked to a point mutation.

### Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis successfully managed with linezolid: case report and review of the literature [^1137Gq3d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enterococci cause serious illness in immunocompromised and severely ill hospitalized patients. Resistance to vancomycin has increased in frequency over the past few years. Limited therapeutic options are available for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections, and the optimum therapy has not been established. We report a case of nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in the setting of hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis that was successfully treated with linezolid. Additionally, we review the previously reported cases of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium meningitis.

### Herpes simplex virus encephalitis update [^115SL3E5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of review: HSV is the most frequently identified cause of infectious encephalitis in Western countries. This article is an update on the topic based on a review of recent studies from 2017 to 2018.

- **Recent findings**: Acyclovir remains the first-line treatment, with no new drugs currently available for clinical use. The major considerations for HSV encephalitis are as follows:

	1. Clinical evaluation remains the most critical factor, even though CSF HSV PCR has good sensitivity; in a small portion of patients, the initial testing might be negative. MRI of the brain is the first-line imaging test, and mesial temporal lobe involvement, along with other typical findings, is important for diagnosis.

	2. Future studies and clinical management should emphasize sequela, short-term, and long-term outcomes, not just case fatality rates. Autoimmune encephalitis can be triggered by HSV and should be considered in patients who are not responding to treatment.

	3. Future studies should focus on better management of sequela and improved treatment regimens, including those targeting the immune response.

In summary, autoimmune encephalitis is a clearly identified complication of HSV encephalitis. Inflammatory mechanisms are linked to the clinical presentation, as well as severity and poor outcomes. Initial corticosteroid therapy must be evaluated to prevent complications.

### Treatment of meningitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis with linezolid [^113hnh97]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) can cause nosocomial meningitis in the presence of prosthetic devices. Vancomycin is the treatment of choice, but its penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is poor, especially in cases without severe meningeal inflammation. We successfully used linezolid to treat a case of posttraumatic MRSE meningitis with a low-level inflammatory response. Therapeutic effectiveness was documented microbiologically and by the simultaneous measurement of linezolid levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.

### Linezolid [^1179HQd4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Linezolid is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. It is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Pneumonia**: Nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases with bacteremia, or Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Skin and skin structure infections**: Complicated skin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections without concomitant osteomyelitis, caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid has not been studied in the treatment of decubitus ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections**: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Tysabri [^115dN4g4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Herpes infections**: Tysabri increases the risk of developing encephalitis and meningitis caused by herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses. Serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal cases have been reported in the postmarketing setting in multiple sclerosis patients receiving Tysabri. Laboratory confirmation in those cases was based on positive PCR for viral DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. The duration of treatment with Tysabri prior to onset ranged from a few months to several years. It is important to monitor patients receiving Tysabri for signs and symptoms of meningitis and encephalitis. If herpes encephalitis or meningitis occurs, Tysabri should be discontinued, and appropriate treatment for herpes encephalitis/meningitis should be administered.

- **Acute retinal necrosis**: Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a fulminant viral infection of the retina caused by the family of herpes viruses (e.g. varicella zoster, herpes simplex virus). A higher risk of ARN has been observed in patients being administered Tysabri. Patients presenting with eye symptoms, including decreased visual acuity, redness, or eye pain, should be referred for retinal screening for ARN. Some ARN cases occurred in patients with central nervous system (CNS) herpes infections (e.g. herpes meningitis or encephalitis). Serious cases of ARN led to blindness of one or both eyes in some patients. Following a clinical diagnosis of ARN, consider discontinuation of Tysabri. The treatments reported in ARN cases included antiviral therapy and, in some cases, surgery.

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^114ih7Jh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

The distribution of functional outcomes, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 12 and 24 weeks, favored the linezolid group (see Figure 5). In a proportional odds model, the odds of a lower mRS score (e.g. mRS of 0 vs. ≥ 1 or 0 or 1 vs. ≥ 2) in participants who received linezolid, signifying less disability, was about twice that for participants who did not receive linezolid (OR at 12 weeks, 2.22 [95% CI, 0.69–7.14; P = 0.18]; OR at 24 weeks, 2.00 [0.64–6.25; P = 0.24]). Participants who received linezolid had a 3.69-fold higher adjusted odds of a favorable outcome at 24 weeks (mRS, 0–2) than those who did not receive linezolid (95% CI, 0.82–20.69; P = 0.10).

Figure 5: Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at weeks 12 and 24.

- **Proportional odds analysis**: Comparing mRS scores at 12 and 24 weeks for participants in the linezolid (LZD) versus no LZD groups. For participants who received LZD, the odds of a lower mRS score at 12 and 24 weeks, signifying less disability, was about twice that for those in the no LZD group.

- **Post hoc analysis**: Adjusted for baseline disease grade, participants who received LZD were 3.69-fold more likely than those in the no LZD group to have a favorable outcome at week 24, defined as an mRS score of 0–2. Parenthetical ranges after odds ratios (ORs) represent 95% confidence intervals.

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^1173y6tQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who experienced serious adverse events during the 24-week observational period; the proportion who completed linezolid treatment; time to death; and death and disability, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), at 12 and 24 weeks. All deaths and nonfatal serious adverse events were reviewed by the study team and by the DSMB, which provided input on classification of severity, expectedness, and causality of events.

A structured questionnaire combined with the Rankin Focused Assessment was used to assign an mRS score, which ranged from 0 to 5 (0 indicates no symptoms; 1, no significant disability; 2, slight disability; 3, moderate disability; 4, moderately severe disability; and 5, severe disability). Participants who died were assigned a score of 6. In a post hoc analysis, the mRS was dichotomized with a score of 0–2 defined as a favorable outcome.

Power calculations for the trial were based on the quantification of pharmacokinetic parameters (to be published separately) for a planned sample size of 60 participants. However, with trial start-up and recruitment hampered by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we ultimately stopped recruitment before reaching this target due to cessation of funding.

In the statistical analysis, we compared the proportions of participants who experienced any treatment-emergent grade ≥ 3 adverse event and individual grade ≥ 3 adverse events, using χ² or Fisher exact tests. We then compared grade ≥ 3 adverse event–free survival over 4 weeks and overall survival over 24 weeks.
