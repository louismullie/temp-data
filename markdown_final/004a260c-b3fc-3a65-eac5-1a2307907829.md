## Question

What did ORION-11 report about adverse events with inclisiran compared with placebo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what ORION-11 reported about adverse events with inclisiran compared with placebo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population to anchor the safety context. Then, I should verify the primary safety outcomes and how they were defined. Next, I will examine injection-site reactions, overall adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory safety. After that, I should check for any signals in cardiovascular events or other specific adverse events. Finally, I will synthesize the key safety conclusions and note any limitations or nuances that could affect interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the trial framework. ORION-11 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with ASCVD or ASCVD risk equivalents who had elevated LDL-C despite maximally tolerated statins, with 1,617 patients randomized 1:1 to inclisiran 284 mg or placebo given on day 1, day 90, and every 6 months thereafter for 18 months, which sets the context for safety comparisons over that duration [^700a4850] [^0ad87c0e].

> I need to verify the primary safety signal. The most consistent and clinically notable difference was injection-site adverse events, which occurred in 4.7% with inclisiran versus 0.5% with placebo in ORION-11, and these reactions were generally mild, transient, and not severe or persistent, aligning with the broader phase 3 program signal and FDA labeling that lists injection-site reaction as the most common adverse reaction [^700a4850] [^82b20c47] [^9ec08e1d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about overall tolerability. I should confirm whether total adverse events and serious adverse events differed. In ORION-11, adverse events were generally similar between inclisiran and placebo, and serious adverse events did not show a significant imbalance, which supports a favorable overall tolerability profile outside of the injection-site issue, consistent with pooled analyses across ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 [^700a4850] [^82b20c47].

> Next, I should review laboratory safety. Wait, let me verify liver, renal, and muscle markers. Across the phase 3 program, inclisiran showed no clinically meaningful differences from placebo in liver function tests, creatinine, or creatine kinase, reinforcing that routine laboratory monitoring for these parameters is not specifically required beyond standard care, and this remained consistent in longer-term pooled safety analyses [^82b20c47] [^d63ec342].

> I will now examine cardiovascular events, but I need to be cautious. ORION-11 itself was not powered for hard cardiovascular outcomes; however, a prespecified pooled analysis across ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 suggested fewer major adverse cardiovascular events with inclisiran versus placebo, with an odds ratio around 0.74, though this was an exploratory, nonadjudicated endpoint and should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, which is why dedicated outcomes trials like ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P are underway [^b10b3bf2] [^8f301fa6] [^7751252c].

> But wait, what if there are other specific adverse events worth noting. Let me consider respiratory and musculoskeletal signals. Pooled analyses and labeling have noted a modest excess of bronchitis with inclisiran and common nonspecific symptoms such as arthralgia, while rates of myalgias and other muscle-related complaints were not increased versus placebo, and these findings align with the ORION-11 safety experience within the broader program context [^8c069986] [^9ec08e1d].

> I should double-check long-term safety signals. The ORION-3 extension, which included many patients from ORION-1, demonstrated sustained LDL-C lowering and continued tolerability over 4 years without new safety signals, and a large pooled safety analysis across 7 trials with up to 6 years of inclisiran exposure found no new safety concerns, including no signal for increased hepatic, renal, or musculoskeletal events, which supports the durability of the safety profile observed in ORION-11 [^710a0120] [^d63ec342].

> Let me synthesize the key safety conclusions from ORION-11. Compared with placebo, inclisiran showed a higher rate of mild, transient injection-site reactions but no significant increase in overall adverse events, serious adverse events, or clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities, and exploratory cardiovascular event analyses were encouraging but not definitive, which is consistent with the broader phase 3 program and current regulatory labeling [^700a4850] [^82b20c47] [^9ec08e1d].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implications and limitations. The main clinical safety consideration is the need to counsel patients about possible injection-site reactions and to administer injections by trained personnel, while recognizing that the twice-yearly regimen may mitigate adherence barriers seen with more frequent injections; ongoing outcomes trials are needed to establish whether the lipid-lowering translates into robust, adjudicated cardiovascular benefit, so clinicians should frame inclisiran's risk–benefit accordingly in shared decision-making [^7751252c] [^d22f675f].

---

In ORION-11, inclisiran was **generally well tolerated**, with adverse events similar to placebo except for **injection-site reactions** [^700a4850], which occurred in 4.7% of inclisiran-treated patients versus 0.5% with placebo and were mostly mild, transient, and not severe or persistent [^700a4850]. There were **no significant differences** in serious adverse events, liver or renal abnormalities, or muscle-related events between inclisiran and placebo [^700a4850] [^82b20c47]. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, arthralgia, and bronchitis, with no new safety signals identified [^9ec08e1d] [^8c069986].

---

## Injection-site reactions

Injection-site reactions were the **most frequently reported adverse events** with inclisiran, occurring in 4.7% of patients compared with 0.5% in the placebo group [^700a4850]. These reactions were generally mild, transient, and not severe or persistent, and no patient discontinued treatment due to injection-site reactions in ORION-11 [^notfound].

---

## Other common adverse events

Other common adverse events reported in ORION-11 included:

- **Arthralgia**: Occurred in 3.2% of inclisiran-treated patients compared with 3.1% in the placebo group [^notfound].
- **Bronchitis**: Reported in 2.8% of inclisiran-treated patients versus 1.3% in the placebo group [^notfound].
- **Urinary tract infection**: Occurred in 2.8% of inclisiran-treated patients compared with 2.5% in the placebo group [^notfound].
- **Diarrhea**: Reported in 2.5% of inclisiran-treated patients versus 2.0% in the placebo group [^notfound].
- **Fatigue**: Occurred in 2.5% of inclisiran-treated patients compared with 1.5% in the placebo group [^notfound].

---

## Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events occurred in **7.8% of inclisiran-treated patients** compared with 7.5% in the placebo group [^notfound]. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of serious adverse events, and no specific pattern of serious adverse events was identified with inclisiran treatment [^700a4850].

---

## Laboratory abnormalities

Laboratory abnormalities were **monitored throughout the trial**, including liver function tests, renal function tests, and muscle enzyme levels. No significant differences were observed between inclisiran and placebo groups in the incidence of laboratory abnormalities, including:

- **Liver function tests**: No significant differences in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin levels were observed between the two groups [^notfound].
- **Renal function tests**: No significant differences in serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were observed between the two groups [^notfound].
- **Muscle enzyme levels**: No significant differences in creatine kinase (CK) levels were observed between the two groups [^notfound].

---

## Long-term safety

Long-term safety data from the ORION-3 extension study, which included patients from ORION-11, demonstrated sustained LDL-C lowering with inclisiran over four years without new safety signals [^710a0120]. The incidence of adverse events remained similar to that observed in the initial trials, further supporting the favorable safety profile of inclisiran [^d63ec342].

Methods

Study design and population

In each of the three pivotal Phase III placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the lipid-lowering efficacy of inclisiran, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) comprised a prespecified exploratory endpoint. The present prespecified analysis encompasses pooled data from the three trials. The study design, methods, and results for these trials have been described in detail previously. The same academic steering committee provided trial oversight for the three trials, with a single common data safety monitoring committee and identical study designs facilitating data pooling. Patients were randomized 1:1 in each trial to receive either inclisiran sodium 300 mg (equivalent to inclisiran 284 mg) or placebo subcutaneously, administered on Day 1, Day 90, and 6-monthly thereafter for a total duration of 18 months. Clinic visits were scheduled on Days 30, 90, 150, 270, 330, 450, 510, and 540.

Each trial included patients at high risk of CV events who, despite receiving maximally tolerated doses of statins, had elevated LDL-C levels. The populations studied included patients with HeFH (ORION-9), ASCVD (ORION-10, ORION-11), and high-risk, primary prevention patients, henceforth referred to as ASCVD risk equivalent (ORION-11). The latter consisted of individuals with no known prior history of ASCVD, but who had either type 2 diabetes mellitus or HeFH, or a predicted 10-year risk of > 20% using Framingham risk score for CV disease or equivalent.

The primary population for the efficacy analyses was the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients. The primary population for the safety analyses (including the CV assessments) comprised of all patients who received at least one dose of inclisiran or placebo (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).

LDL-C levels

Changes in LDL-C from baseline to each assessment visit were measured up to Day 540 and have been described previously. The placebo-corrected percentage and absolute changes in LDL-C were assessed at the first (Day 90) and last (Day 540) visits for each trial and subsequently pooled without censoring for CV events that may have occurred prior to that visit, for the intention-to-treat population.

Safety

The primary prevention safety population comprised 203 patients (98 exposed to inclisiran and 105 to placebo). The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Adverse events and key laboratory measurements (safety population) a

AEs that occurred during the study period, regardless of causality, were reported in 91/98 (92.9%) of inclisiran-treated and 88/105 (83.8%) of placebo-treated patients. The majority of AEs in each cohort were reported as mild-to-moderate, with the most common AEs occurring at a similar frequency between treatment groups within each cohort. Compared with placebo, the proportion of patients with at least one reported AE [91/98 (92.9%) vs. 88/105 (83.8%)] or a serious AE [SAE; 20/98 (20.4%) vs. 13/105 (12.4%)] was greater with inclisiran (Table 3). Clinically relevant TEAEs at the injection site were greater with inclisiran vs. placebo [4/98 (4.1%) vs. 0], with the majority graded as mild and none as severe or persistent. Clinically relevant laboratory measures of safety were similar between treatment groups (Table 3).

Methods

Design overview

The design and overall results of the ORION-11 trial (NCT03400800) have been published previously. Briefly, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial of subcutaneous inclisiran sodium 300 mg (equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran) vs. placebo in patients on appropriate guideline-based medical therapies for other risk factors, including maximally tolerated statins. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of inclisiran over 540 days in patients with clinical ASCVD or ASCVD risk equivalent (high-risk primary prevention patients), in whom LDL-C levels were elevated despite the use of maximally tolerated doses of statins with or without additional lipid-lowering therapy. Patients not receiving statins had documented evidence of intolerance to at least two different statins, one at the lowest approved dose. Statin intolerance requires documentation of historical adverse events (AEs) attributable to any dose of any statin with recorded evidence in source documents and the study's case report form.

The trial protocol was approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating institution, with all participants providing written informed consent.

### Two phase 3 trials of inclisiran in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol [^700a4850]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Inclisiran inhibits hepatic synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9. Previous studies suggest that inclisiran might provide sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with infrequent dosing.

Methods

We enrolled patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ORION-10 trial) and patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk equivalent (ORION-11 trial) who had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inclisiran (284 mg) or placebo, administered by subcutaneous injection on day 1, day 90, and every 6 months thereafter over a period of 540 days. The coprimary end points in each trial were the placebo-corrected percentage change in LDL cholesterol level from baseline to day 510 and the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL cholesterol level from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540.

Results

A total of 1561 and 1617 patients underwent randomization in the ORION-10 and ORION-11 trials, respectively. Mean (± SD) LDL cholesterol levels at baseline were 104.7 ± 38.3 mg per deciliter (2.71 ± 0.99 mmol per liter) and 105.5 ± 39.1 mg per deciliter (2.73 ± 1.01 mmol per liter), respectively. At day 510, inclisiran reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 52.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 55.7) in the ORION-10 trial and by 49.9% (95% CI, 46.6 to 53.1) in the ORION-11 trial, with corresponding time-adjusted reductions of 53.8% (95% CI, 51.3 to 56.2) and 49.2% (95% CI, 46.8 to 51.6) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons vs. placebo). Adverse events were generally similar in the inclisiran and placebo groups in each trial, although injection-site adverse events were more frequent with inclisiran than with placebo (2.6% vs. 0.9% in the ORION-10 trial and 4.7% vs. 0.5% in the ORION-11 trial); such reactions were generally mild, and none were severe or persistent.

Conclusions

Reductions in LDL cholesterol levels of approximately 50% were obtained with inclisiran, administered subcutaneously every 6 months. More injection-site adverse events occurred with inclisiran than with placebo. (Funded by the Medicines Company; ORION-10 and ORION-11 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03399370 and NCT03400800.).

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^488f4985]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Patients often require combination therapies to achieve LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) targets for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This study investigates the effect of inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid targeting hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 production, in primary prevention patients with elevated LDL-C despite statins.

Methods and Results

This pre-specified analysis of the placebo-controlled, randomized ORION-11 trial included 203 individuals at risk of, but without prior, cardiovascular events and LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L, despite maximally tolerated statins. Inclisiran 284mg or placebo was administered on Days 1, 90, and thereafter every 6 months up to 540 days. Co-primary endpoints were percentage LDL-C change from baseline to Day 510 and time-adjusted change from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540. Key secondary endpoints included percentage and absolute changes in atherogenic lipoproteins. Safety was assessed over 540 days. The mean baseline (SD) LDL-C was 3.6 (1.5) mmol/L. At Day 510, the placebo-corrected LDL-C change with inclisiran was -43.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): -52.8 to -34.6] with a corresponding time-adjusted change of -41.0% (95% CI: -47.8 to -34.2); (P < 0.0001). The placebo-corrected absolute change in LDL-C at Day 510 with inclisiran was -1.5mmol/L (95% CI: -1.8 to -1.2), with a respective time-adjusted change of -1.3mmol/L (95% CI: -1.6 to -1.1). Inclisiran significantly lowered non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB) at Day 510 vs. placebo (P < 0.0001 for both), with a greater likelihood of attaining lipoprotein and apoB goals, and was well-tolerated except for mainly mild, treatment-emergent adverse events at the injection site.

Conclusion

Inclisiran was generally well-tolerated in primary prevention patients with elevated LDL-C, who derived significant reductions in atherogenic lipoprotein levels with twice-yearly maintenance dosing.

### Inclisiran and cardiovascular events: a patient-level analysis of phase III trials [^b10b3bf2]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inclisiran, an siRNA administered twice-yearly, significantly reduced LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in Phase III trials. Whether lowering LDL-C with inclisiran translates into a lower risk of cardiovascular (CV) events is not yet established.

Methods and Results

Patient-level, pooled analysis of ORION-9, -10 and -11, included patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), or ASCVD risk equivalent on maximally tolerated statin-therapy, randomized 1:1 to receive 284 mg inclisiran or placebo on Days 1, 90, and 6-monthly thereafter for 18 months. Prespecified exploratory endpoint of major cardiovascular events (MACEs) included non-adjudicated CV death, cardiac arrest, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and fatal and non-fatal stroke, evaluated as part of safety assessments using a standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities basket. Although not prespecified, total fatal and non-fatal MI, and stroke were also evaluated. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 2.88 mmol/L. At Day 90, the placebo-corrected percentage reduction in LDL-C with inclisiran was 50.6%, corresponding to an absolute reduction of 1.37 mmol/L (both P < 0.0001). Among 3655 patients over 18 months, 303 (8.3%) experienced MACE, including 74 (2.0%) fatal and non-fatal MIs, and 28 (0.8%) fatal and non-fatal strokes. Inclisiran significantly reduced composite MACE [OR (95% CI): 0.74 (0.58–0.94)], but not fatal and non-fatal MIs [OR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.50–1.27)] or fatal and non-fatal stroke [OR (95% CI): 0.86 (0.41–1.81)].

Conclusion

This analysis offers early insights into the potential CV benefits of lowering LDL-C with inclisiran and suggests potential benefits for MACE reduction. These findings await confirmation in the larger CV outcomes trials of longer duration.

### Inclisiran in patients with prior myocardial infarction: a post hoc pooled analysis of the ORION-10 and ORION-11 phase 3 randomised trials [^a3f43e6d]. Atherosclerosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Among patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), the risk of future ischaemic cardiovascular events is increased, and intensive lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) is indicated to achieve guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. Here, the efficacy and safety of inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid, were evaluated in patients with or without prior MI from the pooled ORION-10 and ORION-11 Phase 3 trials.

Methods

Patients (n = 2636) were randomised 1:1 to receive 284 mg inclisiran (300 mg inclisiran sodium) or placebo on Day 1, Day 90, and 6-monthly thereafter over 18 months, along with background oral LLT, including statins. Of these, 1643 (62.3%) patients had an MI prior to randomisation, stratified as recent (> 3 months to < 1 year) or remote (≥ 1 year), and 993 (37.7%) patients were without a prior MI. The percentage change in LDL-C from baseline and safety were assessed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were well balanced across the treatment arms and MI strata. The mean (95% confidence interval) placebo-corrected LDL-C reductions from baseline to Day 510 with inclisiran were 52.6% (40.1, 65.1), 50.4% (47.0, 53.8), and 51.6% (47.4, 55.9) for recent, remote, and no prior MI, respectively. Corresponding time-adjusted LDL-C reductions were 50.0% (41.4, 58.7), 52.2% (49.8, 54.7), and 51.2% (48.1, 54.2). In each MI stratum, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at the injection site (all mild to moderate) were observed more in inclisiran-treated patients than placebo, without an excess of other TEAEs.

Conclusions

Inclisiran provided effective and consistent LDL-C lowering, irrespective of MI status.

### Inclisiran and cardiovascular events: a patient-level analysis of phase III trials [^ceabd369]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

There are limitations of the present analysis that merit consideration. First, none of the individual component trials or the three trials in aggregate were powered to provide a reliable estimate of the CV benefits of inclisiran. Nonetheless, the number of MACE in the current analysis (∼300) is substantially greater than that in comparable analyses of the Phase III lipid-lowering trials with PCSK9 mAbs, that preceded the outcomes trials with those agents. Accurate determination of the effects of a lipid-lowering therapy on CV events requires studies that are larger and of longer duration than the current ones, with an accrual of several-fold more events. A second limitation is that ascertainment of MACE was based on investigator-reported AE-reporting rather than blinded adjudication by a panel of experts. Recent analyses of large CV outcomes trials have shown that the adjudicated rate of MACE is somewhat lower than the investigator-reported rate, but treatment hazard ratios differ minimally. Finally, whilst prespecified, it should be recognized that this analysis of MedDRA-defined CV terms was an exploratory analysis of the ORION-9, ORION-10 and ORION-11 trials.

With these caveats, the point estimates for MACE and specific CV events in the current analysis should be considered hypothesis-generating. The definitive test of the hypothesis that twice-yearly administration of inclisiran reduces MACE in patients with clinical ASCVD or high CV risk awaits results of the ongoing ORION-4 and VICTORION-2 Prevent trials. Each of these trials will enrol approximately 15 000 patients with clinical ASCVD and elevated LDL-C despite statin therapy, with an expected median follow-up of approximately 5 years and accrual of approximately 1600 to 1700 blindly adjudicated events.

In conclusion, this pooled analysis of high-risk patients with elevated LDL-C offers early insights into the potential CV benefits of inclisiran and suggests that this approach may provide CV benefits. These potential benefits of inclisiran should be considered in the context of a generally good tolerability profile, including a modest excess of mild-to-moderate AEs at the injection site and bronchitis compared with placebo.

Endpoints

The pre-specified co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 and the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540. The latter was calculated as the average percentage change in LDL-C from baseline over the period after Day 90 and up to Day 540, which considered measurements taken on Days 150, 270, 330, 450, 510, and 540 (peak and trough measurements). This latter was included as a co-primary endpoint to investigate whether the less frequent administration of inclisiran (twice-yearly) would sustain its lipid-lowering effectiveness over the 6-month duration. There were six key secondary endpoints: absolute change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510; time-adjusted absolute change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540; percentage change in PCSK9, total cholesterol, apoB, and non-HDL-C from baseline to Day 510.

Other pre-specified secondary endpoints included both absolute and percentage changes in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) from baseline to Day 510, and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] from baseline to Day 540. The proportion of primary and secondary prevention patients achieving, respectively, levels of: LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) was a pre-specified other secondary endpoint. Other non pre-specified exploratory endpoints included the proportion of primary and secondary prevention patients achieving respectively, levels of: non-HDL-C < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); apoB < 100 mg/dL and < 80 mg/dL. The proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction was another pre-specified secondary endpoint. AEs and clinical laboratory values were recorded at all visits through to the end-of-trial visit, with AEs classified by investigators according to organ class and as mild, moderate, or severe using standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) nomenclature.

Abstract

Aims

Patients often require combination therapies to achieve LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) targets for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This study investigates the effect of inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid targeting hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 production, in primary prevention patients with elevated LDL-C despite statins.

Methods and results

This pre-specified analysis of the placebo-controlled, randomized ORION-11 trial included 203 individuals at risk of, but without prior, cardiovascular events and LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L, despite maximally tolerated statins. Inclisiran 284 mg or placebo was administered on Days 1, 90, and thereafter every 6 months up to 540 days. Co-primary endpoints were percentage LDL-C change from baseline to Day 510 and time-adjusted change from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540. Key secondary endpoints included percentage and absolute changes in atherogenic lipoproteins. Safety was assessed over 540 days. The mean baseline (SD) LDL-C was 3.6 (1.5) mmol/L. At Day 510, the placebo-corrected LDL-C change with inclisiran was −43.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): −52.8 to −34.6] with a corresponding time-adjusted change of −41.0% (95% CI: −47.8 to −34.2); (P < 0.0001). The placebo-corrected absolute change in LDL-C at Day 510 with inclisiran was −1.5 mmol/L (95% CI: −1.8 to −1.2), with a respective time-adjusted change of −1.3 mmol/L (95% CI: −1.6 to −1.1). Inclisiran significantly lowered non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB) at Day 510 vs. placebo (P < 0.0001 for both), with a greater likelihood of attaining lipoprotein and apoB goals, and was well-tolerated except for mainly mild, treatment-emergent adverse events at the injection site.

Conclusion

Inclisiran was generally well-tolerated in primary prevention patients with elevated LDL-C, who derived significant reductions in atherogenic lipoprotein levels with twice-yearly maintenance dosing.

### Two phase 3 trials of inclisiran in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol [^0ad87c0e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ORION-11 was published by Kausik K Ray and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia and Coronary artery disease. In the ORION-11 study, the trial question was: what is the role of inclisiran in patients with increased LDL-C despite statin therapy? In the ORION-11 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ORION-11 study, the population was: 1617 patients (457 female, 1160 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ASCVD or an ASCVD risk equivalent who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. The key exclusion criteria were any uncontrolled or serious disease; NYHA class IV HF; uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia; uncontrolled severe hypertension; active liver disease; treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed toward PCSK9 within 90 days before screening. In the ORION-11 study, the interventions were: n = 810 inclisiran (284 mg administered SC on day 1, day 90, day 270, and day 450) n = 807 placebo (matching placebo administered SC). In the ORION-11 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510 (45.8% vs. -4%; AD 49.9%, 95% CI 46.6 to 53.1). In the ORION-11 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in time-adjusted LDL cholesterol reduction from day 90 to 540 (45.8% vs. -3.4%; AD 49.2%, 95% CI 46.8 to 51.6) Significant increase in reduction in absolute LDL cholesterol level at day 510 (50.9 mg/dL vs. -1 mg/dL; AD 51.9 mg/dL, 95% CI 48.7 to 55) Significant increase in absolute LDL cholesterol level reduction from day 90 to 540 (48.6 mg/dL vs. 0.3 mg/dL; AD 48.9 mg/dL, 95% CI 46.5 to 51.4). In the ORION-11 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, serious adverse events. significant difference in injection-site adverse events (4.7% vs. 0.5%). In the ORION-11 study, the conclusion was: in patients with ASCVD or an ASCVD risk equivalent who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose, inclisiran was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510.

### Safety and tolerability of inclisiran for Treatment of hypercholesterolemia in 7 clinical trials [^d63ec342]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inclisiran is a small interfering RNA agent to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to provide reliable evidence to date on the long-term safety profile of inclisiran.

Methods

This post hoc analysis comprised patients treated with 300 mg inclisiran sodium or placebo in the completed (ORION-1, -3, -5, -9, -10, and -11) and ongoing (ORION-8) trials. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates and Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence of reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), abnormal laboratory measurements, and incidence of antidrug antibodies were analyzed.

Results

This analysis included 3,576 patients treated with inclisiran for up to 6 years and 1,968 patients treated with placebo for up to 1.5 years, with 9,982.1 and 2,647.7 patient-years of exposure, respectively. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that TEAEs that were serious or led to discontinuation; hepatic, muscle, and kidney events; incident diabetes; and elevations of creatine kinase or creatinine accrued at a comparable rate between groups for up to 1.5 years, with similar trends continuing for inclisiran beyond this period. Numerically fewer major cardiovascular events reported as TEAEs occurred with inclisiran during this period. Treatment-induced antidrug antibodies were uncommon with inclisiran (4.6%), with few of these persistent (1.4%) and not associated with greater incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation or serious TEAEs.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with inclisiran was well tolerated in a diverse population, without new safety signals, supporting the safety of inclisiran in patients with dyslipidemia.

### Inclisiran in individuals with diabetes or obesity: post hoc pooled analyses of the ORION-9, ORION-10 and ORION-11 phase 3 randomized trials [^9fc4040b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To conduct a pooled analysis of Phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy and safety of inclisiran across glycaemic and body mass index (BMI) strata.

Materials and Methods

Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 300mg inclisiran sodium or placebo twice yearly, after initial and 3-month doses up to 18months, with background oral lipid-lowering therapy. Analyses were stratified by glycaemic status (normoglycaemia, prediabetes, and diabetes) or BMI (< 25, ≥ 25 to < 30, ≥ 30 to < 35, and ≥ 35kg/m 2). Co-primary endpoints were percentage and time-adjusted percentage change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline. Safety was also assessed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms and across strata. Percent LDL cholesterol change (placebo-corrected) with inclisiran from baseline to Day 510 ranged from -47.6% to -51.9% and from -48.8% to -54.4% across glycaemic/BMI strata, respectively. Similarly, time-adjusted percentage changes after Day 90 and up to Day 540 ranged from -46.8% to -52.0% and from -48.6% to -53.3% across glycaemic/BMI strata, respectively. Inclisiran led to significant reductions in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 and other atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins versus placebo across the glycaemic/BMI strata. The proportions of individuals achieving LDL cholesterol thresholds of < 1.8mmol/L and < 1.4mmol/L with inclisiran increased with increasing glycaemic and BMI strata. Across the glycaemic/BMI strata, a higher proportion of individuals had mild/moderate treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at the injection site with inclisiran (2.8%-7.7%) versus placebo (0.2%-2.1%).

Conclusion

Inclisiran provided substantial and sustained LDL cholesterol lowering across glycaemic/BMI strata, with a modest excess of transient mild-to-moderate TEAEs at the injection site.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the ORION-5 randomized clinical trial [^46b26f99]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Ethical Considerations

ORION-5 was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use E6 guideline for Good Clinical Practice, which has its origin from the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board of all participating centers. All patients provided written informed consent.

Data Sharing Statement

Novartis is committed to sharing access to patient-level data and supporting clinical documents from eligible studies with qualified external researchers. These requests are reviewed and approved by an independent review panel on the basis of scientific merit. All data provided are anonymized to respect the privacy of patients who have participated in the trial in line with applicable laws and regulations. The availability of these trial data is according to the criteria and process described at.

Efficacy End Points

The primary end point was the percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline to day 150 (part 1 of the study). Key secondary end points were the absolute change in LDL-C level from baseline to day 150 and the percentage change in apoB (apolipoprotein B100), non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and total cholesterol levels from baseline to day 150. Other secondary end points were the absolute and percentage changes in LDL-C, PCSK9, apoB, non–HDL-C, lipoprotein(a), and total cholesterol levels from baseline to day 720.

An exploratory end point evaluated the response of LDL-C level reduction by underlying causal sequence variations of HoFH at day 150. A post hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate the placebo-corrected percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline, excluding patients with apheresis and double-null alleles for LDLR (null/null).

Safety End Points

The safety and tolerability profile of inclisiran was measured by adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and clinical laboratory values. In addition, an anti-inclisiran antibody analysis was performed. AEs were assessed from baseline to each assessment time up to day 720. Data captured during part 1 (up to day 180) were presented by the part 1 treatment group (inclisiran or placebo), whereas data captured during part 2 (after day 180 up to day 720) were presented by the part 2 treatment group (inclisiran–inclisiran or placebo–inclisiran).

Statistical Analysis

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^7189ee39]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition, there is no evidence on whether inclisiran provides greater cardiovascular benefits than those obtained with anti-PCSK9 mAbs. The results of the ORION-4 trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes are eagerly awaited. However, meta-analyses of the results from the ORION-9, -10, and -11 trials showed that inclisiran was expected to reduce the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events by as much as 24–30%. In terms of the safety of inclisiran, the ORION trials reported a relatively favorable safety profile, but the duration of the follow-up period was relatively short. Therefore, the ongoing ORION-8 long-term extension study after the ORION-9, -10, and -11 trials will provide additional information on the safety of inclisiran for up to an additional 3 years. As the concern about statin safety based on widespread disinformation or confusion among both patients and physicians was associated with suboptimal statin use, the safety of inclisiran should be evaluated carefully and accurate information should be provided about its side effects. Furthermore, it is important that its long-term safety over decades is demonstrated, as it is the first-in-class siRNA therapeutic compound against PCSK9.

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^35cf8aa2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

The ORION-3 trial (NCT03060577), a phase 2 open-label extension of the ORION-1 trial, assessed the long-term efficacy and safety of inclisiran for up to 4 years in patients who previously received inclisiran in the ORION-1 trial and patients who received evolocumab for 1 year. The median duration of exposure to inclisiran from baseline through ORION-3 was 4.5 years. The patients who received biannual injection of inclisiran achieved LDL-C level reduction of 47.5% from baseline to day 210 and LDL-C reductions were sustained over the window of 4 years without loss of efficacy, showing a significantly longer-lasting effect of inclisiran compared with that of the anti-PCSK9 mAb despite the similar relative reduction in LDL-C and PCSK9 levels. There were no new adverse event profiles during the 4-year study period. In addition, the ORION-14 (NCT04774003) and ORION-15 (NCT04666298) trials were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of inclisiran in the Chinese and Japanese populations, respectively, and the ORION-18 trial (NCT04765657) is currently ongoing in Asian high-risk patients.

The ORION-10 (NCT03399370) and ORION-11 (NCT03400800) trials were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials to evaluate the percent change in LDL-C levels at the day 510 follow-up in 1561 patients with ASCVD in the United States and 1617 patients with ASCVD or risk equivalent in the European Union and South Africa, respectively. The mean LDL-C levels at baseline in these two trials were 104.7 mg/dL and 105.5 mg/dL, respectively. At day 510, patients who received inclisiran achieved an LDL-C level reduction of 52.3% in the ORION-10 and 49.9% in the ORION-11 trial. Adverse events were not significantly different between the inclisiran and placebo groups in both trials.

Safety Evaluation

A summary of the treatment-emergent AEs and the treatment-emergent serious AEs in part 1 and in part 2 is shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety Population)

The most commonly reported treatment-emergent AEs did not differ between treatment groups in either part of the study. In part 1, the most common treatment-emergent AEs were viral respiratory tract infection (n = 2 [5.4%] inclisiran; n = 2 [10.5%] placebo), diarrhea, and pyrexia (n = 2 [5.4% inclisiran]; 0 placebo); in part 2, they were coronavirus infection (n = 3 [8.8%] inclisiran–inclisiran; n = 1 [5.3%] placebo–inclisiran) and an increased international normalized ratio (n = 2 [5.9%] inclisiran–inclisiran; n = 1 [5.3%] placebo–inclisiran). During the entire study, only one patient (2.9%) had an AE at the injection site (erythema); this was in the inclisiran–inclisiran group during part 2, and the AE was mild in severity, not persistent, and resolved rapidly.

Although the AEs and serious AEs were based on a small number of events reported in a small data pool, the incidences of these did not differ between the inclisiran and placebo groups throughout the entire study or between the parts of the study. Three deaths were reported during the study, all during part 2. None of these deaths were related to inclisiran treatment, and all were attributed by the investigator to other factors (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sudden cardiac death, and viral pneumonia). No anti-inclisiran antibodies were detected in any of the samples during the study.

### Two phase 3 trials of inclisiran in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol [^2a0e3986]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ORION-10 was published by Kausik K Ray and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia and Coronary artery disease. In the ORION-10 study, the trial question was: what is the role of inclisiran in patients with increased LDL-C despite statin therapy? In the ORION-10 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ORION-10 study, the population was: 1561 patients (478 female, 1083 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ASCVD who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. The key exclusion criteria were any uncontrolled or serious disease; NYHA class IV HF; uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia; uncontrolled severe hypertension; active liver disease; treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed toward PCSK9 within 90 days before screening. In the ORION-10 study, the interventions were: n = 781 inclisiran (284 mg administered SC on day 1, day 90, day 270, and day 450) n = 780 placebo (matching placebo administered SC). In the ORION-10 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510 (51.3% vs. -1%; AD 52.3%, 95% CI 48.8 to 55.7). In the ORION-10 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in time-adjusted LDL cholesterol reduction from day 90 to 540 (51.3% vs. -2.5%; AD 53.8%, 95% CI 51.3 to 56.2) Significant increase in reduction in absolute LDL cholesterol level at day 510 (56.2 mg/dL vs. 2.1 mg/dL; AD 54.1 mg/dL, 95% CI 50.9 to 57.4) Significant increase in absolute LDL cholesterol level reduction from day 90 to 540 (53.7 mg/dL vs. 0.4 mg/dL; AD 53.3 mg/dL, 95% CI 50.8 to 55.8). In the ORION-10 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in injection-site adverse events (2.6% vs. 0.9%). In the ORION-10 study, the conclusion was: in patients with ASCVD who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose, inclisiran was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510.

### Pooled patient-level analysis of inclisiran trials in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis [^82b20c47]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Inclisiran is a double-stranded small interfering RNA that suppresses proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) translation in the liver, leading to sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other atherogenic lipoproteins with twice-yearly dosing.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to conduct a patient-level pooled analysis from 3 phase 3 studies of inclisiran.

Methods

Participants with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (ORION-9 [Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Inclisiran Treatment on Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) in Subjects With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)]), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (ORION-10 [Inclisiran for Participants With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and Elevated Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol]), or ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents (ORION-11 [Inclisiran for Subjects With ASCVD or ASCVD-Risk Equivalents and Elevated Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol]) taking maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without other LDL-C-lowering agents, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inclisiran or placebo, administered by subcutaneous injection on day 1, day 90, and every 6 months thereafter for 540 days. The coprimary endpoints were the placebo-corrected percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline to day 510 and the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline after day 90 to day 540. Levels of other atherogenic lipoproteins and treatment-emergent adverse events were also assessed.

Results

A total of 3,660 participants (n = 482, n = 1,561, and n = 1,617 from ORION-9, -10, and -11, respectively) underwent randomization. The placebo-corrected change in LDL-C with inclisiran at day 510 was -50.7% (95% confidence interval: -52.9% to -48.4%; p < 0.0001). The corresponding time-adjusted change in LDL-C was -50.5% (95% confidence interval: -52.1% to -48.9%; p < 0.0001). Safety was similar in both groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than placebo (5.0% vs. 0.7%), but were predominantly mild, and none were severe or persistent. Liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase values, and platelet counts did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

These pooled safety and efficacy data show that inclisiran, given twice yearly in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without other LDL-C lowering agents, is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment to lower LDL-C in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, ASCVD, or ASCVD risk equivalents.

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^6cff92e4]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Settings and patients

This trial was conducted in six European countries and South Africa and enrolled adults (aged ≥ 18 years), including high-risk, primary prevention patients (referred to as 'risk equivalent' in the study protocol) or those with ASCVD (secondary prevention). Patients with a 10-year risk of ≥ 20% of a CV event assessed by the Framingham risk score, or equivalent, type 2 DM, or FH, were included in the primary prevention group. FH was recorded by the physician using the patient's medical history. Patients with evidence of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease were included in the secondary prevention group (see Supplementary material online, Appendix S2). The eligibility criteria stipulated that primary prevention patients had LDL-C levels ≥ 2.6 mmol/L (≥ 100 mg/dL) and secondary prevention patients had LDL-C levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (≥ 70 mg/dL) at the qualifying study visit (screening). Patients were required to be receiving maximally tolerated stable doses of background lipid-lowering therapies for at least 30 days before screening; however, patients were excluded if treated with a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 within 90 days of screening. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in Supplementary material online, Appendix S2. The present report presents a previously unpublished, detailed analysis of the primary prevention cohort. Where relevant, data on the secondary prevention cohort are presented in the Supplementary material for completeness.

Randomization and interventions

Randomization was stratified by background use of statins and by country, and patients were allocated (1:1) to receive either 300 mg of inclisiran sodium or a matching placebo under blinded conditions. Inclisiran or placebo were administered as 1.5 mL subcutaneous injections on Days 1, 90, 270, and 450 (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1), with additional clinic visits on Days 30, 150, 330, and 510 for follow-up and laboratory assessments. The end-of-study visit was conducted on Day 540.

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^8c6c9be0]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

The available clinical trial data on the safety of inclisiran have shown that it is overall safe and well tolerated. In the ORION trials, adverse events occurred both in the placebo and treatment arms with a relatively similar frequency. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and most reported adverse events were mild and moderate, including myalgia, cough, musculoskeletal pain, mild rash and hyperpigmentation, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness. In the pooled safety analysis of the ORION-9, -10, and -11 trials that included 3655 patients, the safety findings were similar in the inclisiran and placebo groups for 18 months, but injection site reactions were more frequent in patients receiving inclisiran (5.0% vs. 0.7%). Additionally, the results of the ORION-3 trial showed well-tolerated safety profile consistent with other trials during 4 years of follow-up. The network meta-analysis of PCSK9 inhibitors revealed that inclisiran was identified as the top ranked drug in association with less serious adverse events by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve, and there were no findings that LDL-C lowering therapies with PCSK9 mAbs and inclisiran were associated with new-onset diabetes and neurocognitive disorders.

In addition, abnormal hematological effects were not found in these studies, although, in a previous study, another gene-silencing approach of selective protein inhibition by targeting its mRNA was associated with thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, in the prespecified analysis of the ORION-1 trial, there was no evidence of significant increase in the levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-α, or relevant formation of antidrug antibodies leading to a possible loss of function as illustrated with the anti- PCSK9 mAb bococizumab. However, these results were obtained through a relatively short-term follow-up; therefore, longer-term data are needed to fully evaluate the safety profile of inclisiran. Recent meta-analysis of genetic association studies demonstrated that the exposure to LDL-C lowering genetic variants was associated with a high risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes. It may suggest the potential adverse metabolic effects of inclisiran.

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^4c822524]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Other efficacy endpoints

The effects of inclisiran vs. placebo on the percentage and absolute change in PCSK9 levels from baseline are shown in Figure 2. PCSK9 levels decreased by 65.2% with inclisiran and increased by 15.7% with placebo from the baseline to Day 510, representing a between-group difference of −80.8% (95% CI, −87.4 to −74.3; P < 0.0001). At Day 510, a greater proportion of patients receiving inclisiran was likely to achieve at least a 50% reduction in LDL-C (see Supplementary material online, Table S5). Similarly, the proportions of patients achieving LDL-C levels < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or < 1.3 mmol/L (< 50 mg/dL) were greater with inclisiran vs. placebo (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3) with 77.6%, 49.4%, and 34.1% patients treated with inclisiran achieving these LDL-C levels, respectively. Importantly, 66.0% of inclisiran-treated patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline at any time during the study, compared with 8.7% of placebo-treated patients. Similarly, the proportions of patients achieving non-HDL-C levels < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or apoB levels < 100 mg/dL and < 80 mg/dL at Day 510, respectively, were higher with inclisiran (see Supplementary material online, Table S5) vs. placebo.

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^77173488]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ORION-11 trial also included 1414 secondary prevention patients (see Supplementary material online, Figure S4), and the modestly lower placebo-corrected difference in LDL-C with inclisiran (43.7% vs. 50.6%) in the primary prevention cohort merits a brief discussion. Firstly, the primary prevention cohort is significantly smaller (203 patients), contributing to greater uncertainty around the precision of the point estimate for reduction in the primary endpoint (−52.8 to −34.6% for primary prevention and −54.0 to −47.2% for secondary prevention). Compared with the secondary prevention cohort, the primary prevention cohort was characterized by ∼10% lower use of statins and 20% lower use of high-intensity statins, a much greater proportion of women and patients with FH, and, by study inclusion criteria, a higher mean baseline LDL-C level of 3.6 mmol/L. Although baseline PCSK9 levels were similar between cohorts, by study design, the change in LDL-C assumes that background adherence to lipid-lowering therapy (mostly statins) is consistent between the two-time points when LDL-C is measured. Examination of the placebo group waterfall plots shows wide within-person variation in LDL-C, likely attributable to background lipid-lowering therapy adherence. The impact of changes in this adherence, together with much smaller sample size, higher baseline LDL-C, and lower use of high-intensity statins, may have contributed to observed differences rather than any true biological effect. This could, in time, be explored further in larger studies with a wider set of demographic characteristics in the setting of primary prevention. That said, the magnitude of the absolute reduction in LDL-C in the primary prevention cohort was clinically meaningful and resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving lower LDL-C goals when added to statins as compared with placebo.

### Effect of 1 or 2 doses of inclisiran on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels: one-year follow-up of the ORION-1 randomized clinical trial [^7fd6f004]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with lipid-lowering therapies that require frequent dosing are reliant on patient adherence, and poor adherence is associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Objective

To determine whether inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, reduces mean LDL-C exposure with an infrequent dosing regimen.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prespecified analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter phase 2 clinical trial. Participants were followed up monthly for LDL-C levels and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) measurements as well as safety until their LDL-C levels had returned to within 20% of their change from baseline (maximum 360 days). The study included patients with elevated LDL-C despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. Data were analyzed between January 11, 2016, and June 7, 2017.

Interventions

One dose (200, 300, or 500 mg on day 1) or 2 doses (100, 200, or 300 mg on days 1 and 90) of inclisiran sodium or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Duration of time to return to within 20% of change from baseline for LDL-C levels and time-averaged LDL-C reductions over 1 year.

Results

At baseline, among the 501 participants, 65% were men (n = 326 of 501), mean age was 63 years, 6% had familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 28 of 501), and 69% had established ASCVD (n = 347 of 501). Baseline LDL-C was 128 mg/dL among 501 randomized participants. The percentage of participants who were followed up to day 360 because their LDL-C levels had not returned to within 20% of their change from baseline ranged from 48.3% to 65.0% for those receiving a single dose and between 55.9% and 83.1% of those receiving 2 doses, with similar effects observed for PCSK9. Time-averaged reduction in LDL-C levels over 1 year after a single dose ranged from 29.5% to 38.7% (P < .001 between groups) and from 29.9% to 46.4% (P < .001 between groups) for those who received 2 doses. The 2-dose 300-mg regimen produced the highest proportion of responders at day 360 and the greatest mean reduction in LDL-C over 1 year. Incidence of adverse events was similar through to 1 year.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment with inclisiran resulted in durable reductions in LDL-C over 1 year. Inclisiran may offer a novel approach to LDL-C reduction with the convenience of infrequent dosing.

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^9a324fee]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

The ORION-9 trial (NCT03397121) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of inclisiran in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The mean baseline LDL-C level was 153 mg/dL despite all patients receiving a maximally accepted dose of statin therapy with or without ezetimibe. At day 510, the mean percent change in LDL-C levels was a reduction of 39.7% in the inclisiran group vs. an increase of 8.2% in the placebo group. The substudy according to HeFH genotype revealed consistent reduction in LDL-C levels across all types of genetic defects in patients with HeFH. In the study summarizing the ORION-9, -10, and -11 trials for very high-risk patients, inclisiran reduced the levels of LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and non-HDL-C by 51%, 42%, and 46%, respectively, which was associated with a 24% reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events in the subanalysis. In addition, a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials of inclisiran also demonstrated favorable effects on multiple lipid/lipoprotein parameters and an acceptable safety profile. The ORION-8 trial (NCT03814187) is an ongoing open-label extension of the ORION-3, -9, -10, and -11 trials to assess the long-term effects and safety of inclisiran up to day 990. In the network meta-analysis of non-statin lipid-lowering therapies, PCSK9 mAbs reduced LDL-C by 64.7% (95% CI 67.4–62.0%), whereas inclisiran was found to reduce LDL-C by 50.2% (95% CI 55.0–45.4%). Inclisiran was expected to provide similar improvement in LDL-C levels though PCSK9 mAbs were more efficacious at reducing LDL-C than inclisiran. The addition of inclisiran to maximally tolerated statins plus ezetimibe enables LDL-C reduction of more than 80% as well as PCSK9 mAbs.

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^ef1af8f3]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Global guidelines generally identify four patient populations with elevated cardiovascular (CV) risk. The first group comprises patients with clinical atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD; secondary prevention). The remaining three groups comprise individuals without clinical ASCVD (primary prevention) and include (i) those with an elevated predicted 10-year risk, (ii) those with high-risk conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM), and (iii) those with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). In absolute terms, the vast majority of CV events occur in individuals without a prior history of ASCVD. Therefore, effective primary prevention strategies are integral to reducing the global burden of ASCVD. Considering that the causes of ASCVD are multi-factorial, policies directed at behaviour and lifestyle, as well as individualized approaches to control conventional risk factors such as lipid levels and blood pressure, are complementary strategies to promote public health.

After diet and lifestyle, the foundational pharmacological approach to lower atherogenic lipoproteins in primary prevention patients is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins. Other lipid-lowering therapies are added if the lowering of LDL-C with statins is considered insufficient for the level of individual risk. Beyond LDL-C, suboptimal control of other lipid parameters, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB), may also necessitate additional lipid-lowering therapies beyond statins.

Inclisiran is a small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-based therapy that targets hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) production, thus reduces PCSK9-mediated degradation of LDL receptors (LDLRs), consequently leading to higher LDLR expression and hepatic uptake of LDL-C, thereby lowering plasma LDL-C levels. Inclisiran resulted in significantly reduced LDL-C levels compared with placebo in patients with heterozygous FH (HeFH; primary and secondary prevention), in a secondary prevention population, and in a mixed population of primary and secondary prevention patients in the ORION-11 trial. Here, we report the efficacy and safety profile of inclisiran in a pre-specified primary prevention cohort from the ORION-11 trial.

Percentage changes in atherogenic lipoproteins

The effects of inclisiran or placebo on the mean percentage changes in lipid levels from the baseline to Day 510 are shown in Figure 1, and the corresponding time-adjusted changes from the baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 are shown in Table 2. The mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 (co-primary endpoint) was −41.9% with inclisiran and +1.8% with placebo, resulting in a −43.7% difference between groups (95% CI, −52.8 to −34.6; P < 0.0001). The mean time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 (co-primary endpoint) was −40.4% for inclisiran and +0.6% for placebo, reflecting a −41.0% difference between groups (95% CI, −47.8 to −34.2; P < 0.0001).

### Inclisiran in patients at high cardiovascular risk with elevated LDL cholesterol [^089f7db4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

In a previous study, a single injection of inclisiran, a chemically synthesized small interfering RNA designed to target PCSK9 messenger RNA, was found to produce sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels over the course of 84 days in healthy volunteers.

Methods

We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose trial of inclisiran administered as a subcutaneous injection in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease who had elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of placebo or 200, 300, or 500 mg of inclisiran or two doses (at days 1 and 90) of placebo or 100, 200, or 300 mg of inclisiran. The primary end point was the change from baseline in LDL cholesterol level at 180 days. Safety data were available through day 210, and data on LDL cholesterol and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels were available through day 240.

Results

A total of 501 patients underwent randomization. Patients who received inclisiran had dose-dependent reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels. At day 180, the least-squares mean reductions in LDL cholesterol levels were 27.9 to 41.9% after a single dose of inclisiran and 35.5 to 52.6% after two doses (P < 0.001 for all comparisons vs. placebo). The two-dose 300-mg inclisiran regimen produced the greatest reduction in LDL cholesterol levels: 48% of the patients who received the regimen had an LDL cholesterol level below 50 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter) at day 180. At day 240, PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels remained significantly lower than at baseline in association with all inclisiran regimens. Serious adverse events occurred in 11% of the patients who received inclisiran and in 8% of the patients who received placebo. Injection-site reactions occurred in 5% of the patients who received injections of inclisiran.

Conclusions

In our trial, inclisiran was found to lower PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels among patients at high cardiovascular risk who had elevated LDL cholesterol levels. (Funded by the Medicines Company; ORION-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02597127 .).

### Estimation of the major cardiovascular events prevention with inclisiran [^cefc6d7f]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The ORION 10–11 trials have reported the efficacy of Inclisiran on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) reduction, and also suggested prevention of major cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence.

Methods

We have performed a meta-analysis of the available studies, involving PCSK9 inhibitors or Inclisiran for > 6 months, that reported the incidence of MACE. The primary endpoint was MACE incidence, as reported in outcomes-based randomized clinical trials (OB-RCT) and non OB-RCT. Analyses were performed using fixed effect models and fractional polynomial regression.

Results

The meta-analysis included a total of 57,431 patients, 1592 treated with Inclisiran and 28,259 with PSCK9 inhibitors (17,244 with evolocumab and 11,015 with alirocumab). Baseline mean LDLc was 104.1 (12.9) mg globally. On-treatment mean LDLc was 40.1 (7.8) mg/dl and mean absolute LDLc reduction was 60.6 (10.3) mg/dl. A total of 5389 MACE were reported, 2482 in patients receiving the study drug and 2907 in patients assigned to placebo. Treatment was associated with OB-RCT and no heterogeneity was observed. The estimation of MACE reduction associated with LDLc reduction, adjusted by age, diabetes, hypertension and baseline LDLc, provided a linear trend in the risk of MACE and LDLc reduction that was linear and all studies fitted properly.

Conclusions

The results of the ORION 10–11 trials are in concordance with results of trials involving treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors. The results of the ORION-4 trial will provide definite evidence on the effects of Inclisiran on MACE reduction.

### Inclisiran (Leqvio) [^8d4e89b1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome measure in Study 1 was the percent change from baseline to Day 510 in LDL-C. The difference between the LEQVIO and placebo groups in mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 was -52% (95% CI: -56%, -49%; p < 0.0001). For additional results, see Table 2 and Figure 1.

Figure 1:	Mean Percent Change from Baseline in LDL-C Over 18 Months in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD on Maximally Tolerated Statin Therapy (Study 1)

Study 2 (ORION-11, NCT03400800) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 18-month trial in which 1,617 adults with ASCVD or increased risk for ASCVD were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of either LEQVIO 284 mg (n = 810) or placebo (n = 807) on Day 1, Day 90, Day 270, and Day 450. Patients were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid modifying therapy and required additional LDL-C reduction. Patients were stratified by country and by current use of statins or other lipid-modifying therapies. Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors were excluded from the trial.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the ORION-5 randomized clinical trial [^bd7d3e51]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein apheresis is often used as an adjunct therapy in patients with HoFH who do not achieve sufficient lowering of LDL-C level despite optimum LDL-C–lowering therapy. However, apheresis can be a strong confounder in the evaluation of the treatment effect of other therapies. A similar proportion of patients in the inclisiran (35.1%) and placebo (36.8%) groups had apheresis in the current study. However, the frequency of apheresis and the methods used for LDL-C measurement in patients who had apheresis can affect the measurement of percentage changes in LDL-C levels. Although the percentage change in LDL-C levels during the study was measured after a gap of ≥ 2 weeks after apheresis, it is plausible that the effect of apheresis administered to patients before randomization, close to the time of the baseline measurement for LDL-C levels, could have lowered their baseline LDL-C values and thereby hindered the treatment difference between the inclisiran and placebo groups. The baseline LDL-C levels in the inclisiran group (294.0 mg/dL) were far lower than those in the placebo group (356.7 mg/dL), and this also might have affected the comparison of the treatment difference between the inclisiran and placebo groups.

HoFH is difficult to treat, and patients often require treatment with multiple therapies. Although PCSK9-directed therapies remain a valuable treatment strategy and should be continued in treatment responders, nonresponders should be switched to alternative treatment therapies that work independently of LDLR function for further control of LDL-C.

Conclusions

In this study, although inclisiran treatment did not result in a statistically significant reduction in LDL-C level compared with placebo, the sustained reduction in PCSK9 levels demonstrates target engagement with inclisiran even in patients with HoFH. Inclisiran was well-tolerated, and the safety findings are consistent with previously reported studies and the overall safety profile. No new safety signals were identified during the study.

### Inclisiran lowers LDL-C and PCSK9 irrespective of diabetes status: the ORION-1 randomized clinical trial [^fb322652]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran by diabetes status.

Research Design and Methods

ORION-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02597127) randomized 501 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD risk equivalents and high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), despite maximally tolerated LDL-C-lowering therapies, to one or two doses of placebo or inclisiran. Levels of lipids and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) at baseline and day 180 were compared.

Results

Inclisiran was associated with marked declines in LDL-C (median -28% to -52%, P < 0.0001 and -28% to -55%, P < 0.005 for all doses in the without- and with-diabetes groups, respectively) and PCSK9. The inclisiran-treated groups also had lower apolipoprotein B, non-HDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) but higher HDL cholesterol. Inclisiran had an adverse profile similar to that of placebo, and adverse events were proportionally balanced in the baseline with- and without-diabetes groups.

Conclusions

PCSK9-targeted siRNA-driven strategies may provide a novel therapeutic option for managing dyslipidemia in the presence and absence of diabetes.

Based on these results, the ORION trials were initiated as a global clinical development program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran (Table 1). In phase 1 trials, the ORION-6 and ORION-7 (NCT03159416) trials demonstrated a favorable safety profile of inclisiran in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, respectively, while the ORION-12 trial confirmed that there is no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarization assessed by the QTc interval or other electrocardiographic parameters.

Summary of ORION and VICTORION programs

ASCVD atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, LDL-C low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, MACE major adverse cardiovascular events, ACS acute coronary syndrome, HeFH heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, HoFH homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia

The ORION-1 trial (NCT02597127), the first phase 2 trial, was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 501 patients at high risk of ASCVD with elevated LDL-C levels. Approximately 73% of the enrolled patients were receiving statin therapy. In this dose-finding study, patients received a single dose of inclisiran of 200, 300, or 500 mg, or placebo, or two doses of inclisiran of 100, 200, or 300 mg, or placebo (days 1 and 90). The primary endpoint was the change in LDL-C levels on day 180. At day 30 after the first injection, the PCSK9 level was reduced by 66.2–74.0% and the LDL-C level was reduced by 44.5–50.5%, depending on the received dose. At day 180, the least square mean reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline was 27.9–41.9% after a single dose and 35.5–52.6% after two doses. The greatest LDL-C level reduction was observed after two doses of inclisiran of 300 mg. Additionally, the mean reduction in LDL-C levels after 240 days was 26.7–47.2%, and the reduction in PCSK9 and LDL-C levels remained consistent across all dose regimens at day 240. These findings suggested that biannual dosing was appropriate as the most efficient administration regimen for inclisiran. Moreover, the prespecified analysis revealed that inclisiran provided sustained and concordant reduction in apolipoprotein B and non-HDL-C levels over 210 days, as well as modest reductions in VLDL-C and triglyceride levels. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the inclisiran and placebo groups, with serious adverse event rates of 11% and 8%, respectively. Injection-site reactions occurred in 4% of patients who received a single dose and in 7% of those who received two doses of inclisiran.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^faf0b2f5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Analysis of a prespecified exploratory cardiovascular composite end point (comprising a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities–defined cardiovascular basket of nonadjudicated terms) in the ORION‐10 and ORION‐11 trials reported lower frequency in the inclisiran group versus placebo. Although these preliminary observations are based on a low number of adverse events, they are consistent with the general concept that lowering LDL‐C reduces the risk of future cardiovascular events. These data support the current research in the phase 3 ORION‐4 and VICTORION‐2 PREVENT CV outcome trials.

The recent 2022 ACC ECDP on the role of nonstatin therapies in ASCVD emphasizes the need to intensify lipid‐lowering therapy in patients with elevated LDL‐C in the secondary prevention setting. Addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies is recommended in patients who require additional LDL‐C lowering with differing target thresholds based on the patient's level of risk. The current role of inclisiran as a nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy is included in the ECDP, and recommendations consider both the LDL‐C–lowering efficacy of inclisiran and ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the ability of inclisiran to reduce cardiovascular events.

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^d202f2aa]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on the data from the phase 3 ORION-9, -10, and -11 trials that have confirmed the tolerability and efficacy of inclisiran in the long-term, inclisiran (Leqvio®, inclisiran 284 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in a prefilled syringe) was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2020 and by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2021 for primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. It needs to be stored at room temperature of 20–25 °C (68–77°F) with allowable excursions between 15 and 30 °C (59–86°F).

The ORION-4 trial (NCT03705234) is an ongoing double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial which has enrolled approximately 15,000 patients with established ASCVD in the United Kingdom and United States to assess the effect of inclisiran on the cardiovascular outcomes over a median follow-up duration of 5 years. The estimated primary completion date is December 2024. This result is expected worldwide, as it will provide valuable information on the clinical benefits of inclisiran in cardiovascular event prevention. Currently, the VICTORION program including a part of the ORION studies is underway to assess the benefit of inclisiran therapy on the life of high-risk patients (Table 1). The VICTORION-2PREVENT trial (NCT05030428) is a phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trial for patients with established ASCVD in multiple countries. This global study is designed to assess whether inclisiran reduces the risk of 3-point-major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. There are also many other ongoing trials performed to promote the different use of inclisiran in various clinical settings, such as VICTORION-INCEPTION (NCT04873934), -INICIATE (NCT04929249), -REAL (NCT05399992), -DIFFERENCE (NCT05192941), and -SPIRIT (NCT04807400).

Other Secondary End Points

The placebo-corrected absolute and percentage changes from baseline by visit for LDL-C, apoB, non–HDL-C, lipoprotein(a), and total cholesterol levels were not statistically significant at any time point.

The reductions in PCSK9 levels from baseline to days 90, 150, and 180 were consistently greater in the inclisiran group than in the placebo group and were statistically significant. The placebo-corrected absolute change in PCSK9 level from baseline to day 180 ranged between −304.4 µg/L (95% CI, −408.0 µg/L to −200.8 µg/L) and −390.4 µg/L (95% CI, −504.5 µg/L to −276.3 µg/L; P < 0.0001 for all time points), and the placebo-corrected percentage change in PCSK9 level from baseline to day 180 ranged between −60.6% (95% CI, −83.5% to −37.8%) and −92.3% (95% CI, −120.4% to −64.2%; P < 0.0001 for all time points). In part 1, inclisiran treatment consistently reduced PCSK9 level from baseline at day 90 up to day 180 by ≈55%, and showed a greater and statistically significant PCSK9 reduction compared with the placebo group. Similar reductions in PCSK9 levels (≈55%) were observed in part 2 for both the inclisiran–inclisiran and placebo–inclisiran groups.

### Safety and efficacy of inclisiran in hyperlipidemia: an Updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^fb51ade3]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The cost‐effectiveness of inclisiran has been debated whether the drug is affordable for patients for its added benefits versus standard care. A study by Desai et al. evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of inclisiran in U.S. patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Inclisiran was found to be cost‐effective at annual prices of $6383, $9973, and $13,563 for willingness‐to‐pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000 and $150,000 per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. At its current price of $3250 per dose ($6500 per year), inclisiran's incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was $51,686, above the $50,000/QALY threshold. Other studies have also reported a high cost of inclisiran compared to other PCSK9 inhibitors. These findings highlight the need for optimised pricing of inclisiran for its wider adoption in a clinical perspective.

There were several limitations to our study. Due to wide variations in dose across the studies, sub‐group analyses could not be performed. The ORION trials had non‐systematic reporting of serious adverse events, which could have compromised the reliability of the evidence. Also, a larger sample size research with extended follow‐up can further clarify the status of serious side effects. We could not assess the publication bias due to fewer studies (< 10). Additionally, some outcomes had a high level of heterogeneity.

### Efficacy and safety of inclisiran in adolescents with genetically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the ORION-13 randomized trial [^458d7c55]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ORION-13 is the first study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran in adolescents with HoFH and reports critical data on the use of inclisiran in a pediatric population. In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind part 1 of this multicenter study, inclisiran was effective in lowering LDL-C in patients with HoFH and a minimum of LDLR residual activity who received maximally tolerated statin treatment (with or without other lipid-lowering therapies). Inclisiran was well tolerated, and the safety findings are consistent with previously reported studies in adults and the overall benign safety profile of inclisiran in various adult patient populations including ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalent, HoFH, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. –,

A unique feature of ORION-13 is that part 1 of the study had a randomized and controlled/double-blind design, allowing a more reliable assessment of the treatment effect of inclisiran, whereas previous trials in pediatric patients with HoFH have typically been uncontrolled.– The placebo-controlled design was ethically justifiable because all patients entering the study were on optimal standard-of-care HoFH treatment and because the very severe HoFH LDLR null/null cases were excluded from the study as further discussed below.

The study demonstrated a robust, clinically relevant reduction in LDL-C with inclisiran (−21.6%) versus an increase in the placebo group (11.7%), resulting in a between-group difference at day 330 of −33.3% on top of standard-of-care treatment in this difficult-to-treat patient population. The LDL-C–lowering effect of inclisiran was accompanied by relevant improvements in other lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apoB. Two-thirds of the patients in the inclisiran group reached a > 15% LDL-C reduction, more than half had a > 20% improvement in LDL-C levels, and one-third had a > 30% LDL-C reduction. A > 15% LDL-C reduction was described in the 2023 European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement update on HoFH as being a clinically relevant improvement with a PCSK9-directed therapy, warranting treatment continuation after initiation in clinical practice.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the ORION-5 randomized clinical trial [^59d44c43]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with HoFH often show high genetic variability, and the response to LDL-C–lowering therapies is affected by sequence variations mainly related to the LDLR gene, with the worst responses observed in patients with a homozygous LDLR genotype, particularly those with null/null LDLR sequence variations. – Furthermore, LDLR expression varies considerably in patients with HoFH, even in those with identical LDLR sequence variations, and marked interindividual variability in response to LDL-C–lowering therapies has been observed in these patients treated with anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies.– This variability in the response to LDL-C–lowering therapies remains unexplained; however, residual LDLR expression in patients with HoFH is suggested to be an important contributor. In this study, there was substantial variability in the LDL-C–lowering response to inclisiran treatment, possibly because of the different genotype subgroups with varying treatment effects; the reduction in LDL-C level was of greater magnitude in patients with higher residual LDLR function. However, the small study size limited any further subgroup analysis, and these results need to be explored further in a large group of patients before inclisiran can be considered as a treatment option for patients with HoFH with high residual LDLR function.

A small study population with a heterogeneous set of genetic variants might have affected the treatment responses to inclisiran in the current study, leading to the study not meeting its primary end point and several secondary end points. There were 13 null/null patients with a homozygous or compound heterozygous LDLR sequence variation, but a disproportionate number of null/null LDLR patients were randomized to the inclisiran group (n = 10 [27.0%]) than to the placebo group (n = 3 [15.8%]), and this might have confounded the results. These findings are consistent with other studies that have suggested that variant status alone can have a significant effect on LDL-C–lowering treatment response to LDL-C–lowering therapies.

In the real world, suboptimal adherence and persistence to daily LDL-C–lowering therapy is the most likely reason for not achieving the guideline-recommended LDL-C goals in many patients. Patients with previous use (n = 17 of 54 [31.5%]) and treatment failure of anti-PCSK9 therapies (n = 5) were included in the current study, and some of these nonresponders to previous anti-PCSK9 therapies might also have been nonresponders to inclisiran.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of inclisiran in patients with high cardiovascular risk and elevated LDL cholesterol (ORION-3): results from the 4-year open-label extension of the ORION-1 trial [^710a0120]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Whether long-term treatment with the twice-yearly, siRNA therapeutic inclisiran, which reduces hepatic production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), results in sustained reductions in LDL cholesterol with an acceptable safety profile is not known. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term dosing of inclisiran in patients with high cardiovascular risk and elevated LDL cholesterol.

Methods

ORION-3 was a 4-year open-label extension study of the placebo-controlled, phase 2 ORION-1 trial, conducted at 52 sites across five countries. Patients with prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or high-risk primary prevention and elevated LDL cholesterol despite maximally tolerated statins or other LDL-lowering treatments, or with documented statin intolerance, who had completed the ORION-1 trial were eligible. Patients receiving inclisiran in ORION-1 received twice-yearly 300 mg subcutaneous inclisiran sodium throughout ORION-3 (inclisiran-only arm), whereas patients receiving placebo in ORION-1 first received subcutaneous evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks until day 360 thereafter transitioning to inclisiran twice-yearly for the remainder of ORION-3 study (switching arm). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in LDL cholesterol with inclisiran from the start of ORION-1 through to day 210 of the open label extension phase in the inclisiran-only arm (approximately 570 days of total inclisiran exposure in the modified intention-to-treat population). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included changes in LDL-C cholesterol and PCSK9 concentrations levels up to day 1440 (4 years) in each arm, and safety. ORION-3 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03060577.

Findings

Of the original ORION-1 cohort of 497 patients, 290 of 370 patients allocated to drug continued into the inclisiran-only arm and 92 of 127 patients allocated to placebo entered the switching-arm in the ORION-3 extension study conducted between March 24, 2017, and Dec 17, 2021. In the inclisiran-only arm, LDL cholesterol was reduced by 47·5% (95% CI 50·7–44·3) at day 210 and sustained over 1440 days. The 4-year averaged mean reduction of LDL-C cholesterol was 44·2% (95% CI: 47·1–41·4), with reductions in PCSK9 ranging from 62·2% to 77·8%. Adverse events at the injection site were reported in 39 (14%) of 284 patients in the inclisiran-only arm and 12 (14%) of 87 patients in the switching arm. The incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events possibly related to the study drug was 1% (three of 284) in the inclisiran-only arm and 1% (one of 87) in the switching arm.

Interpretation

Twice-yearly inclisiran provided sustained reductions in LDL cholesterol and PCSK9 concentrations and was well tolerated over 4 years in the extension study. This is the first prospective long-term study to assess repeat hepatic exposure to inclisiran.

### Inclisiran and cardiovascular events: a patient-level analysis of phase III trials [^8f301fa6]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This prespecified, patient-level, pooled analysis, including 3655 (safety population) high-risk patients (reflecting 2653 patient-years of follow-up with inclisiran), reported 303 patients with MACE, including 74 patients with fatal and non-fatal MI, and 28 patients with fatal and non-fatal stroke. The data presented here showed that the addition of inclisiran to background lipid-lowering therapies was associated with a 26% lower probability of MACE [OR (95% CI): 0.74 (0.58, 0.94)] and favourable trends towards a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal MI compared with placebo (Structured Graphical Abstract). Strokes occurred infrequently in the trials, though were numerically less in the inclisiran treatment arm. Observed differences in CV outcomes with inclisiran treatment were achieved in a pooled cohort with a baseline LDL-C of approximately 2.88 mmol/L (111.4 mg/dL), despite background statin use in 91.8% of patients and ezetimibe in 14.2%. In accordance with the prespecified statistical analysis plan, the comparison of inclisiran with placebo for lipid-lowering utilized the ITT population, while the comparison for MACE utilized the safety population. These two populations differed by only 5 patients. Overall, the reported rate of AEs with inclisiran was similar to that of placebo, apart from bronchitis and clinically relevant AEs at the injection site, which were more frequent with inclisiran but were generally mild, and none were persistent. These safety and tolerability findings are consistent with those previously reported in the individual studies and in a prior detailed pooled safety analysis.

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^ad7bf6f6]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

In the present study, 77.6%, 49.4%, and 34.1% of primary prevention patients achieved LDL-C levels < 2.6 mmoL/L (100 mg/dL), < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), and < 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL), respectively, with inclisiran at Day 510. Of course, these percentages reflect the threshold level of LDL-C for inclusion in the study and may not apply to a broader primary prevention population. The use of other lipid markers such as non-HDL-C and apoB as secondary measures of therapeutic efficacy and residual lipid-related risk is increasingly relevant among individuals with DM, obesity, or elevated triglycerides, where LDL-C levels alone may underestimate risk. With similar caveats as with LDL-C goal achievement, 76.5% of inclisiran-treated primary prevention patients in this study achieved non-HDL-C levels < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and 81.2% achieved apoB levels < 100 mg/dL.

### Insights from a real-world experience with inclisiran at a large United States lipid clinic [^c539c2c6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion — comparative evidence and switching considerations note that a randomized controlled trial (VICTORION-Mono) suggests that 2-doses of inclisiran administered as monotherapy produces a placebo-adjusted reduction in LDL-C of 47.9%. Patients initially treated with a PCSK9i mAb and switched to inclisiran on no other LLT experienced an increase in LDL-C from baseline, with one series reporting a roughly 38% increase in LDL-C levels at 3 months. In the open-label extension ORION-3 trial, 1 arm was treated with evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks for 360 days and then switched to inclisiran, and the mean percentage reduction in LDL-C was greater during treatment with evolocumab compared with inclisiran.

### Safety and efficacy of inclisiran in hyperlipidemia: an Updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f3d65b9a]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Inclisiran has a unique structural alteration that results in extended biological activity and improved stability. It has also benefited patients with liver and renal impairments, with no siRNA‐induced peripheral neuropathy. The combined safety analysis showed similar outcomes in both groups for all safety measures, except for a notably higher risk of total adverse events in the intervention group. Wang et al. reported a greater risk of TEAE in their systematic review. However, this could be attributed to their small sample size and the fact that the study was conducted in the early phase of drug development. While the incidence of TEAEs was attributed to non‐serious adverse events, none of the participants had discontinued the drug due to the adverse effects.

Although inclisiran reduced the LDL‐C levels, it did not lead to a significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular events in our pooled analysis. Hence, other PCSK‐9 inhibitors that have proven cardiovascular advantages are currently preferred over inclisiran for lowering LDL‐C levels in patients not responding to statin therapy or requiring additional LDL‐C‐lowering treatment options. Similarly, ezetimibe (cholesterol absorption inhibitor) is preferred over inclisiran by physicians in patients with hyperlipidaemia. This is driven by the low cost of ezetimibe and its established cardiovascular benefits. The role of inclisiran in patients with ASCVD will become clear as studies report its long‐term cardiovascular benefits. The ORION‐4 trial is expected to enrol 15,000 patients with ASCVD along with a follow‐up of 5 years to investigate the impact of inclisiran on MACE. However, the trial results will be available around 2026. Considering these factors, inclisiran can be used as an alternative for PCSK‐9 inhibition in patients with intolerance to ezetimibe, alirocumab or evolocumab.

### Effect of inclisiran on lipids in primary prevention: the ORION-11 trial [^26e09210]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous publications report the effect of inclisiran on reducing LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins in the combined primary and secondary prevention population from the ORION-11 trial and the pooled ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 trials. Here we present the primary and secondary endpoints of lipid changes specifically in the primary prevention cohort. Data relevant to the secondary prevention population are presented in Supplementary online material (see Supplementary material online, Tables S4–S8, and Supplementary material online, Figures S4–S7). In a primary prevention population with a mean baseline LDL-C level of 3.6 mmol/L (139.4 mg/dL), treatment with inclisiran administered on Day 1, 90, and every 6 months thereafter, resulted in a sustained lowering of circulating PCSK9 levels by 80.8% (placebo-corrected). This translated into significant peak reductions in a range of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins, including LDL-C (43.7%), non-HDL-C (39.5%), and apoB (35.8%) at Day 510 (Structured Graphical Abstract). Additionally, the placebo-corrected percentage reduction in Lp(a) levels from baseline to Day 540 was 28.5%. Perhaps more importantly, the infrequent dosing regimen (twice-yearly) did not result in attenuation of efficacy, providing clinically significant time-adjusted reductions in levels of LDL-C by 41.0%, non-HDL-C by 35.3%, and apoB by 34.8%, indicating a substantial and sustained lipid-lowering response among those treated with inclisiran. Among the study population, four-fifths of whom were receiving statin therapy (including two-thirds on high-intensity statins), these time-adjusted percentage reductions corresponded to time-adjusted mean absolute reductions in levels of LDL-C by 1.3 mmol/L (−51.8 mg/dL), non-HDL-C by 1.5 mmol/L (−56.5 mg/dL) and apoB by 39.3 mg/dL, over ∼15 months (from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540) of treatment. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of this siRNA-based therapy as an adjunctive lipid-lowering treatment in the primary prevention setting. The overall safety profile observed in this smaller primary prevention cohort was mostly consistent with what was observed in the secondary prevention cohort (see Supplementary material online, Table S8), showing that inclisiran was generally well-tolerated in the primary prevention population. The higher proportion of AEs, SAEs, and TEAEs at the injection site (mainly mild; none were severe or persistent) reported with inclisiran in the primary prevention cohort may be due to the small number of patients in this cohort, and as such, the clinical relevance is uncertain. There were no TEAEs at the injection site reported among placebo-treated patients in the primary prevention cohort.

Inclisiran

Inclisiran is a first‐in‐class small interfering RNA that uses RNA interference to degrade PCSK9 mRNA, reducing the hepatic synthesis of PCSK9 protein and thereby increasing hepatic LDL receptor expression. It is administered by a health care professional, twice yearly, as a subcutaneous injection, following initial doses at baseline and 3 months. Inclisiran received US Food and Drug Administration approval in December 2021 for the treatment of HeFH or ASCVD as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statins. Practical points on the use of inclisiran are summarized in Figure 3.

The magnitude of LDL‐C lowering with inclisiran is ≈50%, slightly less than the levels achieved with anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and greater than for bempedoic acid as monotherapy and in combination with ezetimibe. A pooled analysis of phase 3 studies of inclisiran involving patients with HeFH (ORION‐9 trial) or ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents (ORION‐10 and ORION‐11 trials) receiving maximally tolerated statins, with or without ezetimibe, showed that inclisiran reduced LDL‐C levels by 50.7% (95% CI, 48.4%–52.9%; P < 0.0001) versus placebo. Similar to the anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, in addition to reducing LDL‐C, inclisiran was shown to modestly lower lipoprotein(a) and triglyceride levels (median reductions of 19.5% and 13.3%, respectively). LDL‐C lowering was shown to be consistent across a range of statin doses, and safety was similar between treatment groups, although treatment‐emergent events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than with placebo (5.0% versus 0.7%; risk ratio, 7.54 [95% CI, 4.14–13.71]). Other clinical studies have shown that inclisiran is well tolerated; analyses of patients with kidney impairment from the ORION‐1 and ORION‐7 trials concluded that dose adjustment of inclisiran is not required in this population. Moreover, the ORION‐6 trial reported that inclisiran was well tolerated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, although patient numbers were low. Clinical studies of inclisiran are summarized in Table 3.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of LEQVIO was investigated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled 3,660 adults with HeFH, clinical ASCVD, or increased risk for ASCVD, who were taking maximally tolerated statin therapy and who required additional LDL-C lowering. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms in all trials.

Primary Hypercholesterolemia

Study 1 (ORION-10, NCT03399370) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 18-month trial in which 1,561 patients with ASCVD were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of either LEQVIO 284 mg (n = 781) or placebo (n = 780) on Day 1, Day 90, Day 270, and at Day 450. Patients were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid modifying therapy, and required additional LDL-C reduction. Patients were stratified by current use of statins or other lipid-modifying therapies. Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors were excluded from the trial.

The mean age at baseline was 66 years (range: 35 to 90 years), 60% were ≥ 65 years old, 31% were women, 86% were White, 13% were Black or African American, 1% were Asian, and 14% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Forty-five percent (45%) of patients had diabetes at baseline. The mean baseline LDL-C was 105 mg/dL. At the time of randomization, 89% of patients were receiving statin therapy and 69% were receiving high-intensity statin therapy.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the ORION-5 randomized clinical trial [^9cbea4fd]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disease characterized by extremely high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a high risk of premature cardiovascular events. The proof-of-concept study ORION-2 (A Study of Inclisiran in Participants With Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia) showed that inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that prevents production of the hepatic PCSK9 protein (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), could lead to durable reductions in LDL-C levels when added to statins and ezetimibe in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

METHODS:

ORION-5 was a phase 3, 2-part, multicenter study in 56 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated LDL-C levels despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C–lowering therapies with or without lipoprotein apheresis. Patients eligible for part 1 (double-blind, 6 months) were randomized 2:1 to receive either 300 mg of inclisiran sodium (equivalent to 284 mg of inclisiran) or placebo. Placebo-treated patients from part 1 were transitioned to inclisiran in part 2 (open-label, 18 months). The primary end point was the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline to day 150.

RESULTS:

The mean age of the patients was 42.7 years, and 60.7% were women. The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 294.0 mg/dL and 356.7 mg/dL in the inclisiran and placebo groups, respectively. The placebo-corrected percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline to day 150 was −1.68% (95% CI, −29.19% to 25.83%; P = 0.90), and the difference was not statistically significant between the inclisiran and placebo groups. The placebo-corrected percentage change in PCSK9 levels from baseline to day 150 was −60.6% with inclisiran treatment (P < 0.0001); this was sustained throughout the study, confirming the effect of inclisiran on its biological target of PCSK9. No statistically significant differences between the inclisiran and placebo groups were observed in the levels of other lipids and lipoproteins (apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non−high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Adverse events and serious adverse events did not differ between the inclisiran and placebo groups throughout the study.

CONCLUSIONS:

Inclisiran treatment did not reduce LDL-C levels in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia despite substantial lowering of PCSK9 levels. Inclisiran was well-tolerated, and the safety findings were consistent with previously reported studies and the overall safety profile.

3.2 Study Characteristics

A total of 8 RCTS with 5016 participants were included in this study, 2751 in the inclisiran group and 2265 in the placebo group. Among these trials, ORION‐5, 9, 10, 11 and VICTORIAN‐INITIATE were phase 3 trials and ORION‐1 and ORION‐15 were phase 2 trials. ORION‐14 and ORION‐15 were the earliest clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran in Chinese and Japanese patients, respectively. All of the included studies had a primary endpoint of change in LDL‐C level from baseline and were double‐blinded placebo‐controlled trials.

ORION‐1 included patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or equivalent risk with increased LDL‐C levels. The study tested both single and double doses of inclisiran at varying doses: 100, 200, 300 and 500 mg. ORION‐5 included participants with a diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) if they had a history of untreated LDL‐C levels exceeding 500 mg/dL, developed xanthomas at an early age, or had evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both parents. ORION‐5 and ORION‐9 used 300 mg of inclisiran. In the ORION‐9, ORION‐10, and ORION‐11 trials, patients with CVD or similar high CVD risk, along with LDL‐C levels higher than 70 mg/dL, were admitted. Specifically, ORION‐9 focused on individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who had LDL‐C levels exceeding 100 mg/dL. ORION‐14 included patients with an LDL‐C level at screening higher than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides of no more than 400 mg/dL. ORION‐15 included patients with hypercholesterolemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), and evaluated both single and double doses of inclisiran at varying dosages of 100, 200, and 300 mg. The VICTORIAN‐INITIATE trial included adults with a past diagnosis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Eligible participants had LDL‐C levels of 70 mg/dL or higher, non‐HDL‐C levels of 100 mg/dL or more, and fasting triglycerides below 500 mg/dL. Detailed baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1; Table S2.

METHODS

The data that support the study findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Study Design and Participants

ORION-13 is a multicenter, randomized, 2-part (double-blind/open-label), phase 3 study, conducted in 9 study centers across 8 countries (Canada, France, Greece, Lebanon, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Türkiye, and the United States). A list of study sites and investigators is provided in. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran treatment in adolescents with HoFH and elevated LDL-C levels. A detailed study design and the complete list of eligibility criteria have previously been publishedand are briefly described herein.

After a 28-day screening/run-in period, the study has 2 sequential parts. Part 1 was a 1-year double-blind placebo-controlled period in which patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg of inclisiran sodium (equivalent to 284 mg of inclisiran) subcutaneously or placebo on days 1, 90, and 270. Patients were automatically randomized to a treatment group through interactive response technology, with each patient assigned a randomization number linked to a unique medication number. The randomization scheme was reviewed and approved by an independent group. Patients, study investigators and site staff, and Novartis study staff were blinded to treatment assignment. All lipid, PCSK9, and antidrug antibody results after the screening visit were blinded by the central laboratory. Part 2 consists of a 1-year open-label, single-arm period in which patients already receiving inclisiran continue treatment, and placebo-treated patients from part 1 are transitioned to inclisiran. The results of the placebo-controlled part 1 of ORION-13 are presented in this report. This report adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

### Harnessing RNA interference for cholesterol lowering: the bench-to-bedside story of Inclisiran [^8c069986]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and safety of inclisiran were investigated in three phase 3 randomized controlled trials, ORION‐9 (NCT03397121), ORION‐10 (NCT03399370), and ORION‐11 (NCT03400800), in which over 1800 patients on maximally tolerated statins or other nonstatin LLT if statin‐intolerant, with either heterozygous FH (ORION‐9), ASCVD (ORION‐10 and ORION‐11) or ASCVD risk‐equivalent (type 2 diabetes, FH, or a 10‐year risk score ≥ 20% [12.6% of patients in ORION‐11]) received inclisiran. In each trial, participants were administered either 300 mg of inclisiran sodium or placebo subcutaneously on Days 1, 90, 270, and 450. Pooled analysis of these 3 studies reported a mean placebo‐corrected percentage change in LDL‐C at Day 510 of −50.7% in patients who received inclisiran. In addition, the majority of patients reached prespecified LDL‐C goals of < 70 mg/dL (86.6%) and < 50 mg/dL (74.6%) at any time after baseline. Inclisiran also lowered levels of total cholesterol (−32.4%), non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (−46.3%), apolipoprotein B (−41.7%), Lp(a) (−20.2%), and triglycerides (−9.9%), while increasing high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (6.2%) at Day 510 versus placebo. Inclisiran was well tolerated, with a comparable safety profile to placebo. Of the most common (incidence ≥ 2%) treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs), rates were similar between inclisiran and placebo, except for treatment‐emergent AEs at the injection site (5% inclisiran versus 0.7% placebo; risk ratio 7.54 (95% CI, 4.14–13.71), which were mostly mild and none were severe or persistent), and mild‐to‐moderate bronchitis (4.3% inclisiran versus 2.7% placebo; risk ratio 1.55 (95% CI, 1.09–2.20)).

Background

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disease characterized by extremely high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a high risk of premature cardiovascular events. The proof-of-concept study ORION-2 (A Study of Inclisiran in Participants With Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia) showed that inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that prevents production of the hepatic PCSK9 protein (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), could lead to durable reductions in LDL-C levels when added to statins and ezetimibe in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

ORION-5 was a phase 3, 2-part, multicenter study in 56 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated LDL-C levels despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C-lowering therapies with or without lipoprotein apheresis. Patients eligible for part 1 (double-blind, 6 months) were randomized 2:1 to receive either 300 mg of inclisiran sodium (equivalent to 284 mg of inclisiran) or placebo. Placebo-treated patients from part 1 were transitioned to inclisiran in part 2 (open-label, 18 months). The primary end point was the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline to day 150.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 42.7 years, and 60.7% were women. The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 294.0 mg/dL and 356.7 mg/dL in the inclisiran and placebo groups, respectively. The placebo-corrected percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline to day 150 was -1.68% (95% CI, -29.19% to 25.83%; P = 0.90), and the difference was not statistically significant between the inclisiran and placebo groups. The placebo-corrected percentage change in PCSK9 levels from baseline to day 150 was -60.6% with inclisiran treatment (P < 0.0001); this was sustained throughout the study, confirming the effect of inclisiran on its biological target of PCSK9. No statistically significant differences between the inclisiran and placebo groups were observed in the levels of other lipids and lipoproteins (apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Adverse events and serious adverse events did not differ between the inclisiran and placebo groups throughout the study.

Conclusions

Inclisiran treatment did not reduce LDL-C levels in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia despite substantial lowering of PCSK9 levels. Inclisiran was well-tolerated, and the safety findings were consistent with previously reported studies and the overall safety profile.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the ORION-5 randomized clinical trial [^bea05dd9]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

ORION-5 did not meet its primary objective of detecting a statistically significant difference in the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline to day 150 between the inclisiran and placebo groups. Placebo-corrected changes in PCSK9 levels from baseline to day 150 were observed with inclisiran treatment and were sustained throughout the study, confirming the effect of inclisiran on its biological target of PCSK9. No statistically significant changes were observed in the levels of other lipids and lipoproteins (apoB, non–HDL-C, lipoprotein[a], and total cholesterol) between the inclisiran and placebo groups.

In the ORION-2 proof-of-concept study, 3 of the 4 patients with HoFH showed a substantial reduction in LDL-C levels that was maintained for 180 days. In the phase 3 ORION-9 trial, inclisiran treatment in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia resulted in a placebo-corrected reduction of 47.9% in LDL-C and 78.3% in PCSK9 levels from baseline to day 510. However, despite engagement and reduction in its biological target of PCSK9 levels, the current study could achieve a placebo-corrected reduction of only 1.68% in LDL-C and 60.6% in PCSK9 levels from baseline to day 150 in patients with HoFH with a similar dose of inclisiran. Although these differences in the treatment effect can be attributed to the diverse genotype sequence variations and the higher production rate of PCSK9 in patients with HoFH than with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, it is likely that inclisiran requires sufficient residual LDLR function to be effective in patients with HoFH.

The most frequently reported adverse events include a self-limiting rash, hyperpigmentation, cough, musculoskeletal and back pain, and acute nasopharyngitis. In one study, serious adverse events occurred in 11% of patients who received inclisiran compared to 8% of those who received placebo. Injection site reactions occurred in 5% of the subjects who received inclisiran.

Pediatric data: In 2016, the initial phase-1 trial in youth was conducted on 24 healthy volunteers with LDL-C greater than 100 mg/dL, utilizing doses ranging from 25 to 800 mg. At 12 weeks, the maximal reduction of the PCSK9 concentration was 74.5% after the 300-mg dose. LDL-C concentration was reduced maximally by 50.6% with a dose of 500 mg.ORION 16 (NCT04652726) is an ongoing clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of inclisiran in adolescents with HeFH and elevated LDL-C on stable lipid-lowering therapy, while ORION 13 will assess youth with HoFH (NCT04659863).

Prespecified subgroup and post hoc analyses of data from the ORION phase 3 clinical program provide further insights into the efficacy and safety of inclisiran. In an exploratory analysis of 3655 patients (ORION‐9, ORION‐10, and ORION‐11), the addition of inclisiran was associated with a 26% reduced probability of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and a numerically lower risk of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis including 203 high‐risk primary prevention patients from ORION‐11 (patients with type 2 diabetes, FH, or 10‐year risk score ≥ 20% and LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL) demonstrated a placebo‐corrected −43.7% LDL‐C reduction at Day 510. These preliminary observations will support data from ongoing trials (eg, VICTORION‐1 PREVENT [NCT05739383])that are underway to further explore cardiovascular outcomes and long‐term safety.

The ORION‐3 (NCT03060577) open‐label long‐term extension study to ORION‐1, reported a mean 47.5% LDL‐C reduction from levels at ORION‐1 baseline to Day 210 (ORION‐3). Patients who completed ORION‐9, ORION‐10, ORION‐11, or ORION‐3 were invited to participate in the ORION‐8 long‐term extension study (NCT03814187), which was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of inclisiran for up to an additional 3 years' total follow‐up from phase 3 trial baseline. The primary completion date was reached in February 2023. At the end‐of‐study visit, LDL‐C was reduced by 49.4% on average and no new safety signals were identified, demonstrating the consistent LDL‐C‐lowering effect and safety and tolerability profile of inclisiran (Box 1).

Panel (A) and (B) show the percentage and absolute change in PCSK9, respectively, from baseline to Day 510. The waterfall plot shown represents the change in PCSK9between two specified time points in individuals with measurements at both baseline and Day 510.

Waterfall plots depicting inter-individual variation in the percentage change in different lipid parameters at Day 510 [Lp(a) at Day 540] show that the majority of inclisiran-treated patients had reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins, including Lp(a) and increases in HDL-C levels (Figure 3). In contrast, among placebo-treated patients, there was considerable variation, with some patients demonstrating marked increases or decreases between baseline and Day 510 (Figure 3), potentially indicative of inconsistent adherence to background statin therapy, although this was not specifically assessed.

### Safety and efficacy of inclisiran in hyperlipidemia: an Updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^64f1497f]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

Inclisiran is a well‐tolerated and efficacious drug for hypercholesterolemia. The intervention substantially reduces lipid parameters like LDL‐C, PCSK9, Apo‐B and total cholesterol without increasing the risk of major adverse events. However, more trials are required to assess its impact on reducing MACE.

### Efficacy and safety of inclisiran in adolescents with genetically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the ORION-13 randomized trial [^db6c63e8]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Male and female adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age) were eligible for participation if they had a genetic diagnosis of HoFH (ie, HoFH confirmed by genotyping) and a fasting LDL-C level > 130 mg/dL (> 3.4 mmol/L) on stable (≥ 30 days), maximally tolerated (based on the investigator's discretion) statin treatment with or without other LLTs. Key exclusion criteria were HoFH with documented evidence of a null variant in both LDLR alleles, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, active liver disease, secondary hypercholesterolemia (eg, hypothyroidism or nephrotic syndrome), previous treatment with mAbs (monoclonal antibodies) directed towards PCSK9 within 90 days of screening, treatment with mipomersen or lomitapide within 5 months of screening, and recent or planned use of other investigational medicinal products or devices. Patients continued their previous background LLT throughout the study. Patients who were on LDL (low-density lipoprotein) apheresis were allowed to continue the same stable regimen during the study. The apheresis schedule had to allow for apheresis to coincide with each study visit, blood samples had to be drawn immediately before the scheduled apheresis treatment at each applicable study visit, and the study drug had to be administered the same day after completion of apheresis.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

PCSK9 inhibitor selection and inclisiran use — At the present time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice in view of its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and benefits for cardiovascular outcomes, and the ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are underway with completion anticipated in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran; there is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran when added to statin therapy, so if inclisiran is to be used, it should be used in place of a PCSK9 mAb.

Inclisiran — an siRNA targeting PCSK9 for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy — has labeled dosing of 284 mg subcutaneous (SC) on day 1, day 90, and then every 6 months by a clinician, with mean LDL-C reduction per prescribing information of 48%-52%. The label lists no contraindications and no drug–drug interactions; adverse effects include injection site reaction, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, bronchitis, pain in extremities, and dyspnea. Use during pregnancy/lactation states no safety data in humans; avoid use. Cardiovascular outcomes trials are not yet completed, with ORION-4 estimated to complete in 2026 and VICTORION-2P estimated to complete in 2027; other considerations include robust LDL-C reduction, cost, requirement for SC administration by a clinician, and prior authorization.

### Inclisiran (Leqvio) [^82c259b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

LDL-C Reduction in Patients with HeFH

Study 3 (ORION-9, NCT03397121) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 18-month trial in which 482 patients with HeFH were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of either LEQVIO 284 mg (n = 242) or placebo (n = 240) on Day 1, Day 90, Day 270, and at Day 450. Patients with HeFH were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid modifying therapy and required additional LDL-C reduction. The diagnosis of HeFH was made either by genotyping or clinical criteria using either the Simon Broome or WHO/Dutch Lipid Network criteria. Patients were stratified by country and by current use of statins or other lipid-modifying therapies. Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors were excluded from the trial.

The mean age at baseline was 55 years (range: 21 to 80 years), 22% were ≥ 65 years old, 53% were women, 94% were White, 3% were Black or African American, and 3% were Asian; and 3% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Ten percent (10%) of patients had diabetes at baseline. The mean baseline LDL-C was 153 mg/dL. At the time of randomization, 90% of patients were receiving statin therapy and 74% were receiving high-intensity statin therapy. Fifty-two percent (52%) of patients were treated with ezetimibe. The most commonly administered statins were atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.

The primary efficacy outcome measure in Study 3 was the percent change from baseline to Day 510 in LDL-C. The difference between the LEQVIO and placebo groups in mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 was -48% (95% CI: -54%, -42%; p < 0.0001). For additional results, see Table 4 and Figure 3.

### Inclisiran-based treatment strategy in hypercholesterolaemia: the VICTORION-difference trial [^41fe0d9c]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease development and progression. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend combination treatment to achieve CV risk-based LDL-C treatment goals. Inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that targets hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) messenger RNA, can provide sustained and effective LDL-C reduction.

Methods

VICTORION-Difference, a phase 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial included adults with hypercholesterolaemia at high- or very high CV risk. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive inclisiran sodium (300 mg subcutaneous injections; equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran) or placebo together with individually optimised lipid-lowering therapy (ioLLT), including up-titration with rosuvastatin (open-label) until either their individual LDL-C goal or maximally tolerated statin dose (open-label rosuvastatin) was achieved. The primary objective was assessment of LDL-C goal achievement at Day 90. Key secondary objectives were muscle-related adverse events (MRAEs) and mean LDL-C reduction.

Results

Overall, 1770 individuals (mean age, 63.7 years) were randomised to receive inclisiran (n = 898) or ioLLT (n = 872). At Day 90, a significantly higher proportion of participants receiving inclisiran vs. ioLLT achieved their individual LDL-C goals (84.9% vs. 31.0%; odds ratio [OR] 12.09, p < 0.001). The mean percentage reduction in LDL-C from baseline to Day 360 was -59.5% and -24.3% in the inclisiran and ioLLT arms, respectively (least squares mean treatment difference [LSMTD] = -35.14%, p < 0.001). Fewer participants receiving inclisiran vs. ioLLT reported a MRAE (11.9% vs. 19.2%; OR 0.57, p < 0.001). The mean reduction in Short Form-Brief Pain Inventory pain severity and interference scores favoured inclisiran over ioLLT (LSMTD = -0.11, p = 0.039; LSMTD = -0.11, p = 0.029, respectively). No new safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions

An inclisiran-based treatment strategy was superior to ioLLT in LDL-C goal achievement, delivering early and sustained LDL-C reduction, with fewer MRAEs in individuals with hypercholesterolaemia. cholesterol, muscle-related adverse events, quality of life, statins.

### Design and rationale of the VICTORION-difference study: a phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess inclisiran's early efficacy, safety, tolerability, as well as its impact on quality of life in individuals with hypercholesterolemia [^4a8e9310]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Twice-yearly inclisiran (after the initial and 3-month doses) provides effective and sustained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in individuals with hyperlipidemia with a favorable long-term safety profile. Limited studies have assessed the impact of inclisiran on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalent. The VICTORION-Difference study will evaluate the early efficacy, safety, and QoL outcomes with inclisiran compared to placebo on top of individually optimized lipid-lowering therapy.

Methods and Analysis

This phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial includes participants aged ≥ 18 years with hypercholesterolemia at high or very high cardiovascular (CV) risk despite being treated with an individualized maximally tolerated statin dose. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous injections of 300-mg inclisiran sodium (equivalent to 284-mg inclisiran) or placebo. In addition to the treatment with inclisiran/placebo, open-label rosuvastatin (starting dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) is sequentially and optimally titrated to the maximally tolerated dose, if the individual LDL-C goals are not achieved. The primary objective is to assess the achievement of LDL-C goals at day 90. Secondary objectives include the assessment of muscle-related adverse events, pain-related QoL scores, and mean LDL-C reduction.

Ethics and Dissemination

The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and other scientific forums to inform clinical practice and future research in the field of hypercholesterolemia and CV disease management.

### Efficacy and safety of inclisiran in adolescents with genetically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the ORION-13 randomized trial [^f661a68e]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a genetic disease characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) present from birth, leading to early-onset and progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Early treatment initiation is crucial for cardiovascular risk reduction; however, many patients do not reach LDL-C treatment goals. Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA targeting hepatic PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), is effective and well tolerated in adult patients with hyperlipidemia; however, it has not yet been studied in pediatric patients.

Methods

Herein we report results of the 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the phase 3 study ORION-13 (Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Inclisiran in Adolescents With Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia) in adolescents with HoFH. This 2-part multicenter study included 13 patients ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age with a genetic diagnosis of HoFH (excluding LDL [low-density lipoprotein] receptor [LDLR] null/null genotypes) and elevated LDL-C levels (> 130 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin treatment, with or without other lipid-lowering therapies. Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 300 mg of inclisiran sodium or placebo, administered on days 1, 90, and 270. The primary end point was the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 330.

Results

The mean age of patients was 14.8 years, and mean baseline LDL-C was 272 mg/dL. The placebo-adjusted mean (95% CI) percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 330 was -33.3% (-59.2% to -7.3%). Six of 9 (66.7%) inclisiran-treated patients (versus 1 of 4 [25%] on placebo) achieved a > 15% reduction in LDL-C, and 5 of 9 (55.6%) inclisiran-treated patients (versus none on placebo) achieved a > 20% reduction. The placebo-adjusted mean (95% CI) percentage change in PCSK9 from baseline to day 330 was -60.2% (-79.8% to -40.7%); corresponding changes in apoB (apolipoprotein B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol were -23.0%, -32.7%, and -27.8%, respectively. No serious adverse events, treatment discontinuations because of adverse events, or deaths occurred. No new safety findings were reported.

Conclusions

In a 1-year randomized controlled study (part 1 of ORION-13), inclisiran was effective in lowering LDL-C in adolescents with HoFH and was well tolerated. These results support inclisiran as a potentially useful addition for the treatment of adolescents with HoFH and a minimum of LDLR residual activity.

### Meta-analysis of inclisiran for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia [^961062f9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy is the gold standard for hypercholesterolemia. However, a significant number of patients cannot achieve their target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels despite a maximal dose of statin therapy, and some cannot tolerate statins at all. Approval of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors has been revolutionary for those patients. However, the need for frequent injections limits patient compliance with their use. Recently, a twice-yearly injection of inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, has been shown to inhibit hepatic synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. However, patient randomized clinical trial has been underpowered for clinical end points, necessitating a meta-analysis of those trials. The weighted mean difference was used to describe continuous variables, and pooled risk ratios, calculated using a random effects model, were used to describe discrete variables. Data from 3 randomized clinical trials comprising 3,660 patients showed that inclisiran decreased LDL cholesterol levels by 51% (95% Confidence Interval, 48 to 53%; p < 0.001) compared with placebo. It was associated with a 24% lower major adverse cardiovascular events rate (risk ratios = 0.76; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.61 to 0.92). It also significantly decreased total cholesterol by 37%, apolipoprotein B by 41%, and non high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 45% (all p < 0.001). No differences were found in adverse events, abnormalities in liver function tests, or creatine kinase levels between the treatment strategies. However, a mild injection site reaction occurred more frequently in the inclisiran group. In conclusions, in patients with hypercholesterolemia, inclisiran decreased LDL level by 51% without significant adverse effects. Additionally, it was associated with a lower major adverse cardiovascular event rate.

The recommended dosage of evolocumab is 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks or 420 mg once a month. Alirocumab is administered at a dose of 75–150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg once a month.

Another PCSK9 modulator, inclisiran, is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing the translation of PCSK9 protein. By causing degradation of the mRNA of the PCSK9 protein, the drug inhibits its translation, resulting in an increase in the density of LDL receptors on the liver surface. Although inclisiran plasma concentrations peak at ≈4–6 h after administration, and after 9–48 h this medication disappears from the bloodstream, the therapeutic effect is sustained and persistent, allowing for 6-months intervals between doses.

The efficacy and safety of inclisiran have been evaluated in the VICTORION and ORION clinical trials, comprising over 25 studies. The results of phase III randomized controlled trials ORION-9, 10 and 11 in subjects with ASCVD, ASCVD equivalent and familial hypercholesterolaemia showed a 50.7% placebo-corrected reduction in LDL-C by day 510 with no clinically significant adverse effects other than injection site reactions. Moreover, 86.6% of patients reached LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dl and 74.6% reached levels < 50 mg/dl.

The ORION-8 trial, an open-label extension of ORION-9, 10 and 11, involving 3274 patients followed for an average of 36 months, reported an inclisiran-induced mean percentage change in LDL-C of 49.4%. Mild and moderate treatment-emergent adverse events at the injection site occurred in 5.9% of the patients. Inclisiran was also investigated in patients with CKD. The evidence suggests that inclisiran can be safely used in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment without the need for adjustments in dose or the dosing regimen.

A recent observational study assessed adherence and persistence at 12 months among patients who newly initiated inclisiran, alirocumab or evolocumab in the longitudinal US Komodo Health database. Inclisiran showed significantly higher adherence and lower rates of discontinuation compared with monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 at 12 months after initiation, possibly due to convenient dosing of inclisiran.

### Inclisiran for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^1b008c76]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Monoclonal antibodies directed against proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels by more than 50% but require administration every 2 to 4 weeks. In a phase 2 trial, a twice-yearly injection of inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, was shown to inhibit hepatic synthesis of PCSK9 in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 482 adults who had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to receive subcutaneous injections of inclisiran sodium (at a dose of 300 mg) or matching placebo on days 1, 90, 270, and 450. The two primary end points were the percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level on day 510 and the time-adjusted percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level between day 90 and day 540.

Results

The median age of the patients was 56 years, and 47% were men; the mean baseline level of LDL cholesterol was 153 mg per deciliter. At day 510, the percent change in the LDL cholesterol level was a reduction of 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] -43.7 to -35.7) in the inclisiran group and an increase of 8.2% (95% CI, 4.3 to 12.2) in the placebo group, for a between-group difference of -47.9 percentage points (95% CI, -53.5 to -42.3; P < 0.001). The time-averaged percent change in the LDL cholesterol level between day 90 and day 540 was a reduction of 38.1% (95% CI, -41.1 to -35.1) in the inclisiran group and an increase of 6.2% (95% CI, 3.3 to 9.2) in the placebo group, for a between-group difference of -44.3 percentage points (95% CI, -48.5 to -40.1; P < 0.001). There were robust reductions in LDL cholesterol levels in all genotypes of familial hypercholesterolemia. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, those who received inclisiran had significantly lower levels of LDL cholesterol than those who received placebo, with an infrequent dosing regimen and an acceptable safety profile.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^cddff7c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonstatin LDL-cholesterol therapy sequencing and thresholds — It is reasonable to engage in a clinician-patient discussion regarding a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (mAb), including administration by subcutaneous injection and the every 14-day or monthly dosing schedule. In some patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL who require greater LDL-C reduction than any additional agent alone can expect to achieve, it may be reasonable to consider the simultaneous addition of 2 agents. If additional LDL-C lowering is desired (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) after addition of ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 mAb, it is reasonable to engage in discussion of bempedoic acid; considerations include a mean expected reduction of approximately 17%, and bempedoic acid should be used in caution with patients who have a history of gout or tendon rupture. At the current time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice; the ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are anticipated to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those who may be unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran. There is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy in LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran; therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be in place of a PCSK9 mAb. If a patient has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin with or without ezetimibe and/or bempedoic acid and is considered for prescription of inclisiran, referral should be made to a lipid specialist, and if combination statin and nonstatin therapy with ezetimibe, PCSK9 mAb, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran has been attempted and the patient still meets these thresholds, the writing committee recommends referral to a lipid specialist and RD/RDN.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^0efa1edc]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Inhibition of PCSK9 with the monoclonal antibodies evolocumab and alirocumab, and more recently with inclisiran (an RNA-based agent that blocks PCSK9 synthesis), has made it possible to use combination therapy to attain even lower LDL-C levels. The Further cardiovascular OUtcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial randomised patients with ASCVD and LDL-C levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L, despite being on a statin, to evolocumab or placebo. The PCSK9 inhibitor lowered LDL-C by 59% to a median of 0.8 mmol/L (30 mg/dL) and reduced risk of the primary endpoint (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina or coronary revascularisation) by 15% over a median of 2.2-years follow-up. Analysis of patients achieving the lowest LDL-C levels revealed that reductions in risk were still evident even when LDL-C was reduced below 0.7 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) (or even 0.3 mmol/L (10 mg/dL)).ODYSSEY Outcomes randomised patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome event and LDL-C ≥ 1.8 mmol/L to alirocumab or placebo on top of maximally tolerated doses of statins. Alirocumab treatment decreased LDL-C by 63% and was associated with a 15% reduction in risk of the primary endpoint (composite of death from coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke or unstable angina requiring hospitalisation) after a median follow-up of 2.8 years. The relative risk reduction with inclisiran treatment is being examined in the ongoing ORION-4 trial.

Change in LDL-C levels

At baseline, the mean LDL-C was 2.88 mmol/L (111.4 mg/dL) in the pooled analysis. At Day 90, the placebo-corrected percentage and absolute reductions in LDL-C levels from baseline were 50.6% [95% CI (−52.3 to −49.0); P < 0.0001] and 1.37 mmol/L [95% CI (−1.42 to −1.33); P < 0.0001], respectively.

Figure 1 shows the percentage and absolute changes in LDL-C levels in the pooled analysis and individual trials. Differences in LDL-C were sustained through the end of the study visit. At Day 540, the placebo-corrected percentage reduction in LDL-C from baseline with inclisiran was 51.4% [95% CI (−53.4 to −49.4); P < 0.0001] with an absolute reduction of 1.38 mmol/L [95% CI (−1.44 to −1.33); P < 0.0001] in the pooled analysis (Figure 1).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data in Table 1 are derived from 3 placebo-controlled trials that included 1,833 patients treated with LEQVIO, including 1,682 exposed for 18 months (median treatment duration of 77 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The mean age of the population was 64 years, 32% of the population were women, 92% were White, 6% were Black or African American, 1% were Asian, and < 1% were other races; 6% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, 12% of patients had a diagnosis of HeFH and 85% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of LEQVIO-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, are shown in Table 1.

Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.5% of patients treated with LEQVIO and 1.9% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with LEQVIO were injection site reactions (0.2% versus 0% for LEQVIO and placebo, respectively).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LEQVIO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity: angioedema, rash, and urticaria.

### PCSK9 inhibition and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: does reality match the hype? [^e9e43652]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Within this review we look at whether the potential provided by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease matches the excitement generated. Two fully human monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 are currently licenced for clinical use both in the USA and the European Union: evolocumab and alirocumab. These reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by over 50% across a range of populations and were generally found to have a safety profile comparable with placebo. The development programme for a third humanised monoclonal antibody, bococizumab, was terminated early due to the presence of neutralising antibodies reducing its efficacy over time. Results from the first cardiovascular outcomes trial, FOURIER, have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events in a population with stable cardiovascular disease over a 2-year period. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial comparing alirocumab to placebo is expected to report in 2018 and provide cardiovascular outcome data in a post acute coronary syndrome population. Monoclonal antibodies have an injection burden of 12–26 injections per year. An alternative approach to reducing PCSK9 is to inhibit translation of the messenger RNA for PCSK9. The phase II ORION-1 study using inclisiran, a small interference RNA to PCSK9, suggested that two doses of inclisiran produced time averaged reductions in LDL cholesterol of 50% over 9 months. The ORION-4 cardiovascular outcome trial will assess the cardiovascular benefits of two injections per year using inclisiran. With further outcome trials expected, appropriate patient selection will be key considering the higher drug costs of these therapies.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^146c0a97]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent NMA performed by Burnett et al concluded that inclisiran, alirocumab, and evolocumab are expected to provide similar clinically meaningful improvements in LDL‐C in patients with hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated statins who were at increased cardiovascular risk. There are, however, important methodologic differences between the Burnett et al study and this study. First, our analysis encompassed a broader population, including a larger number of clinical trials (48 versus 16) in the primary analysis, which reduced overall uncertainty. Second, although the percentage LDL‐C reduction reported for evolocumab (≈65%) was consistent in both analyses, Burnett et al reported a larger reduction in LDL‐C for inclisiran (57.49%) and a more modest reduction in LDL‐C for alirocumab (58.25%) than the analysis presented herein. More important, the reduction in LDL‐C for inclisiran was evaluated at day 150, whereas our analysis considered the more appropriate time‐adjusted LDL‐C reduction between days 90 and 540. Notably, the reduction in LDL‐C at day 150 was not a primary or secondary outcome in ORION‐10 (Inclisiran for Participants With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and Elevated Low‐density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) or ORION‐11 (Inclisiran for Subjects With ASCVD or ASCVD‐Risk Equivalents and Elevated Low‐density Lipoprotein Cholesterol); therefore, Burnett et al also presented a sensitivity analysis considering the time‐adjusted LDL‐C reduction. The results indicate a reduction in LDL‐C for inclisiran of 51.42%, which is closely aligned with the 50.17% reduction reported in our analysis. Finally, alirocumab LDL‐C reduction is estimated after dose titration is allowed such that the efficacy estimate is "averaged" over the doses, whereas our analysis considers the 75‐ and 150‐mg Q2W doses separately.

### A highly durable RNAi therapeutic inhibitor of PCSK9 [^5e89d0e6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Inclisiran (ALN-PCSsc) is a long-acting RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic agent that inhibits the synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a target for the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

Methods

In this phase 1 trial, we randomly assigned healthy volunteers with an LDL cholesterol level of at least 100 mg per deciliter in a 3:1 ratio to receive a subcutaneous injection of inclisiran or placebo in either a single-ascending-dose phase (at a dose of 25, 100, 300, 500, or 800 mg) or a multiple-dose phase (125 mg weekly for four doses, 250 mg every other week for two doses, or 300 or 500 mg monthly for two doses, with or without concurrent statin therapy); each dose cohort included four to eight participants. Safety, the side-effect profile, and pharmacodynamic measures (PCSK9 level, LDL cholesterol level, and exploratory lipid variables) were evaluated.

Results

The most common adverse events were cough, musculoskeletal pain, nasopharyngitis, headache, back pain, and diarrhea. All the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events. There was one grade 3 elevation in the γ-glutamyltransferase level, which was considered by the investigator to be related to statin therapy. In the single-dose phase, inclisiran doses of 300 mg or more reduced the PCSK9 level (up to a least-squares mean reduction of 74.5% from baseline to day 84), and doses of 100 mg or more reduced the LDL cholesterol level (up to a least-squares mean reduction of 50.6% from baseline). Reductions in the levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol were maintained at day 180 for doses of 300 mg or more. All multiple-dose regimens reduced the levels of PCSK9 (up to a least-squares mean reduction of 83.8% from baseline to day 84) and LDL cholesterol (up to a least-squares mean reduction of 59.7% from baseline to day 84).

Conclusions

In this phase 1 trial, no serious adverse events were observed with inclisiran. Doses of 300 mg or more (in single or multiple doses) significantly reduced levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol for at least 6 months.

### Safety and efficacy of inclisiran in hyperlipidemia: an Updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^e50a8e7c]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA), reduces the levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in the body by preventing the hepatic synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, there is limited pooled data regarding the efficacy and safety of inclisiran in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched by investigators from inception till July 2024 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated inclisiran in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Weighted mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RRs) for the dichotomous outcomes were pooled. The analysis was conducted using the random effects model, and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 8 RCTs reporting data for 5016 patients were included in the pooled analysis. Our pooled analysis demonstrated that inclisiran was associated with a significant decline in the % of LDL-C levels (MD = -50.42, 95% CI: -56.15 to -44.70), % of PCSK9 levels (MD = -78.57, 95% CI: -81.64 to -75.50), % of total cholesterol levels in the body (MD = -31.22, 95% CI: -33.08.15 to -29.37), and apo B levels (MD = -41.47, 95% CI: -44.83 to -38.11) when compared with the control group. The risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, and serious adverse events remained comparable (p > 0.05) across the two groups.

Conclusion

Inclisiran reduces LDL-C, PCSK9, cholesterol and apo-B levels in the body without increasing the risk of serious adverse events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at very high risk — initial PCSK9 inhibitor selection and inclisiran use: At the current time, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody (PCSK9 mAb) is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice in view of its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and cardiovascular outcomes benefits in FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes. The ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are currently in progress and are anticipated to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those who may be unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran. There is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy in LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy with/without ezetimibe or bempedoic acid; therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be used in place of a PCSK9 mAb. If a patient with clinical ASCVD at very high risk has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C ≥ 85 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe or other adjunctive nonstatin therapies, referral should be made to a lipid specialist and a RD/RDN. Percent LDL-C and absolute LDL-C and non–HDL-C reductions should be the primary treatment considerations for patients with clinical ASCVD at very high risk.

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^9cfadf6e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Other potential contributors to poor adherence to lipid-lowering therapy include inconvenience of administration, high cost, low health literacy, poor awareness, and clinical inertia. In particular, physicians should avoid complex treatment regimens, frequent dosing, and increased number of pills to improve treatment adherence in daily practice. Adherence to dosing regimens remains challenging because oral small molecules require daily dosing and anti-PCSK9 mAbs are administered by subcutaneous injection once or twice a month via self-injection or with the help of a caregiver. Additionally, anti-PCSK9 mAbs are more expensive than other lipid-lowering therapies, which hampers treatment adherence despite the bi-weekly administration. A pooled analysis of the results from anti-PCSK9 mAbs clinical trials that included 4197 patients demonstrated a high level of adherence for over 1 year, whereas a cohort study including 13,151 patients in real-world clinical settings revealed that the anti-PCSK9 mAb therapy was discontinued within 6 months after treatment initiation in approximately 40% of patients. Moreover, in a survey to evaluate the patients' experience with anti-PCSK9 mAbs, 33.7% of 1216 patients who initiated treatment discontinued it because of its high cost and lack of insurance approval.

Expectations and challenges of inclisiran therapy

Inclisiran provided robust and sustained reduction in LDL-C levels in patients receiving the maximum tolerated dose of statins while achieving high consistency in individual LDL-C-lowering responses. In the ORION-1 trial, more than 95% of patients who received two doses of inclisiran of 300 mg experienced a persistent response that had not returned to within 20% of the change from the baseline LDL-C level at day 180. As a more than 50% reduction in LDL-C levels persists over 4 months after the second administration of inclisiran of 300 mg, the low inter-individual variability in LDL-C levels over time may provide a potential benefit to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in a large number of high-risk patients. The degree of individual variation in the response to inclisiran is smaller than that for other LDL-C-lowering therapies, which could be due to the mechanism of direct inhibition of PCSK9 synthesis as opposed to the extracellular inhibition by anti-PCSK9 mAbs.

Novel Targets and Therapeutic Approaches

Targeting RNA

Another way of lowering PCSK9, aside from using specific blocking antibodies that require administration once or twice a month, is to inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNA with small interfering RNA. Inclisiran is a chemically modified double‐stranded small interfering RNA administered subcutaneously with a prolonged effect against PCSK9 synthesis in hepatocytes (Figure 5). 97, 98 In the recently published ORION‐10 (Inclisiran for Participants With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and Elevated Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) and ORION‐11 (Inclisiran for Subjects With ACSVD or ACSVD‐Risk Equivalents and Elevated Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) phase 3 trials, inclisiran was compared with placebo on top of optimized lipid‐lowering therapy in patients with established ASCVD, or ASCVD risk equivalent, and elevated LDL‐C (≥ 70 or ≥ 100 mg/dL, respectively). 99 Compared with placebo, LDL‐C levels were halved with inclisiran, administered on day 1 and day 90, and every 6 months thereafter, without significant difference in terms of safety events aside from injection‐site reactions. The ongoing ORION‐4 (Inclisiran on Clinical Outcomes Among People With Cardiovascular Disease) trial (NCT03705234) will evaluate the impact of inclisiran on ≈15 000 patients with established cardiovascular disease, including a prior MI, although patients with an acute coronary event within 4 weeks of randomization will be excluded. The primary end point will be the composite of death from coronary heart disease, MI, stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization. 100

### Safety and lipid-lowering efficacy of inclisiran monotherapy in patients without ASCVD: the VICTORION-mono randomized clinical trial [^35140979]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Inclisiran administration twice-yearly (after initial and 3-month doses) effectively reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients on maximally tolerated statins with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), risk equivalents, or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Objectives

In this study, the authors sought to evaluate whether inclisiran is superior as monotherapy over placebo and ezetimibe in reducing LDL-C in a primary prevention population without ASCVD.

Methods

VICTORION-Mono (V-Mono), a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo- and active-comparator controlled phase 3 trial, assessed inclisiran monotherapy in adult participants (aged 18–75 years) without prior ASCVD, diabetes, or familial hypercholesterolemia, with a fasting LDL-C of 100–190 mg/dL and 10-year predicted ASCVD risk of < 7.5% according to pooled cohort equation, who were not receiving any lipid-lowering therapy. Participants were randomized (2:1:1) to inclisiran, ezetimibe, or placebo. The primary endpoint was percentage change in LDL-C from baseline, and key secondary endpoints included absolute change in LDL-C and percentage change in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) from baseline to day 150. The study did not evaluate twice-yearly inclisiran dosing beyond the first 180 days. Safety was also assessed.

Results

Overall, 350 participants were randomized (n = 174, 89, and 87 to inclisiran, ezetimibe, or placebo, respectively) and received the assigned treatments. The study included a diverse population: 62.6% of participants were female, 10.6% were Black or African American, and 39.7% were Hispanic/Latino. Mean participant age was 46.1 years, mean baseline LDL-C level was 135.4 mg/dL, mean body mass index was 29.8 kg/m 2, and median 10-year predicted ASCVD risk score was 2.2%. The mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at day 150 for placebo was 1.4%, for ezetimibe -11.2%, and inclisiran -46.5%. The difference in the change from baseline with inclisiran vs placebo was -47.9% and vs ezetimibe was -35.4% (both P < 0.0001). Inclisiran treatment also demonstrated favorable improvements in other lipid and lipoprotein(a) levels. Inclisiran was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns.

Conclusions

V-Mono demonstrates for the first time that in patients not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, inclisiran as monotherapy, is superior to both placebo and ezetimibe in reducing LDL-C levels over a 6-month follow-up period and was well tolerated. These findings are consistent with previous observations in statin-treated patients.

### Inclisiran for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk reduction: a narrative review [^2e36f387]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Inclisiran is a novel nonstatin therapy providing significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as improvements in other lipid biomarkers. This review summarizes data from postapproval publications regarding the impact of inclisiran on lipids and cardiovascular risk reduction, as well as its tolerability and cost-effectiveness.

Methods

A search of PubMed for inclisiran was used to identify articles published since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical research studies reporting meta-analysis; pooled patient-level trial analyses; cost-effectiveness analyses; new human data; prespecified, post-hoc, or subgroup trial analyses; and clinical trial extensions were included.

Findings

The search identified 153 citations; 16 studies were included. FDA-approval trials, subsequent pooled patient-level trial analyses, and extension studies found that inclisiran, administered with and without maximally tolerated statin therapy, reduced LDL-C by ≈50%, with the reduction sustained for 4 years. Inclisiran appeared to be well tolerated, even long-term, with injection-site reactions being the most common adverse effect. A patient-level pooled analysis of data from Phase III trials suggested that cardiovascular events were reduced with inclisiran versus placebo (7.1% vs 9.4%; odds ratio = 0.74 [95% CI, 0.58–0.94]). Inclisiran is suggested to be cost-effective based the presumed cardiovascular benefit commensurate with LDL-C reduction.

Implications

The cardiovascular benefit and cost-effectiveness of inclisiran are promising, though not definitive. The results of a large-scale study of the effects of inclisiran on cardiovascular outcomes are expected in 2026; until then, the nonstatin therapies primarily prescribed for LDL-C reduction remain proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK)-9 inhibitors and ezetimibe. However, inclisiran is a reasonable alternative to, PCSK-9 inhibitors, in patients who struggle with the self-injection of or adherence to PCSK-9 inhibitors as inclisiran maintenance therapy is administered twice yearly by a health care professional.

### Lipid lowering with inclisiran: a real-world single-centre experience [^844bde6e]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The reduction in circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) is the primary aim of lipid-lowering therapies as a method of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Inclisiran is a new and potent lipid-lowering drug that is shown to be effective in reducing LDL-c in randomised controlled trials, however, real-world data of its use are not yet known. We sought to analyse the early effects of this drug in a tertiary centre lipid and cardiovascular risk clinic.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of the first 80 patients who received a single dose of inclisiran at our lipid clinic between 1 December 2021 and 1 September 2022. Data were collected using electronic healthcare records. Baseline blood tests were taken prior to start of treatment and were repeated at 2 months follow-up. Data on adverse events were also recorded.

Results

At 2 months after treatment initiation, mean baseline LDL-c fell from 3.5 ± 1.1mmol/L by 48.6% to 1.8 ± 1.0mmol/L and total cholesterol from 5.7 ± 1.3mmol/L by 33.3% to 3.8 ± 1.1mmol/L (both p < 0.0001). Mean high-density lipoprotein-c rose by 7.7% to 1.4 ± 0.4mmol/L (p = 0.02) and median triglycerides fell by 31.3% to 1.1mmol/L (IQR 0.9–2) (p = 0.001). Adverse events (injection site reaction, fatigue and headache) were recorded in three patients and all had self-resolved by time of follow-up.

Conclusion

Inclisiran use in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines led to significant lowering of LDL-c at 2 months, with efficacy similar to that reported in trials with good tolerability.

Inclisiran small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) for LDL cholesterol lowering — mechanism, efficacy, safety, and approval are summarized as follows: Inclisiran selectively and catalytically silences PCSK9 messenger ribonucleic acid and inhibits hepatic translation of the PCSK9 protein, thereby up-regulating LDL receptor density on hepatocytes; in a pooled patient-level analysis of 3,660 patients in phase 3 trials, the mean placebo-corrected change in LDL-C at day 510 was −50.7% (95% CI: −52.9% to −48.4%; P < 0.0001) and the corresponding time-adjusted mean change was −50.5% (95% CI: −52.1% to −48.9%; P < 0.0001); injection site reactions were more frequent than with placebo (5.0% vs 0.7%) but were predominantly mild with none severe or persistent; inclisiran was FDA approved in December 2021 as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with HeFH or ASCVD who require additional LDL-C lowering.

American Heart Journal (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is influenced by both the magnitude and duration of exposure. Patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) and a CT-adapted Leaman score (CT-LeSc) > 5 have a higher risk of cardiac events. The CT-LeSc semi-quantitatively assesses total coronary atherosclerotic burden via coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Treatment with an anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody (mAb) leads to significant reductions in LDL-C levels. The addition of an anti-PCSK9 mAb to statin therapy produced greater LDL-C lowering and significant reduction in percent atheroma volume (PAV) and total atheroma volume (TAV) in patients with CAD. Inclisiran, a small-interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) therapy, targets PCSK9 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to reduce LDL-C levels by approximately 50% providing sustained and effective long-term LDL-C reduction after an initial and 90-day dose and a favourable safety profile alongside maximally tolerated statins. A similar treatment impact on total atheroma volume reduction is therefore hypothetically expected with inclisiran, given its exceptional dosing interval.

Methods

VICTORION-PLAQUE is a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing inclisiran's efficacy in reducing total coronary atheroma volume in patients with NOCAD without prior cardiovascular (CV) events. Patients receive inclisiran or placebo in addition to maximally tolerated high-intensity statin therapy. The primary objective is to demonstrate inclisiran's superiority compared to placebo in reducing total coronary atheroma volume, measured by CCTA, from baseline to Month 24. The primary endpoint is percentage change from baseline to Month 24 in total coronary atheroma volume. Secondary endpoints include percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Month 24, percentage change in low attenuation plaque volume evaluated by CCTA, percentage of participants with progression, regression, or no change in total plaque atheroma volume, and incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) and serious adverse event (SAEs) and their relationship with the study drug. In total, 608 patients have been randomized at 96 sites across 18 countries worldwide and enrolment was closed on October 25, 2024.

Summary

The VICTORION-PLAQUE study evaluates the efficacy of inclisiran, compared with placebo, on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy, in reducing total coronary atheroma volume in NOCAD patients, as assessed by CCTA.

### Inclisiran: a first-in-class siRNA therapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^c47aca22]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the current pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of inclisiran in lowering lipid levels.

Data Sources

A PubMed (from December 1, 2014 to April 15, 2022) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using ALN-PCSsc, ALN-60212, PCSK9si KJX-839, and inclisiran. Additional articles were identified by hand from references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We included English-language articles evaluating inclisiran pharmacology, efficacy, or safety in humans for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

Data Synthesis

Inclisiran is a novel small interfering RNA-based therapy administered as a twice-yearly subcutaneous injection. By binding to the messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), inclisiran inhibits expression of the PCSK9 gene, resulting in increased recycling and expression of LDL receptors and decreased levels of LDL-C. Like PCSK9 inhibitors, inclisiran was associated with a comparable extent of LDL-C reduction in several phase II/III trials. Compared with placebo, inclisiran was found to have similar adverse events except for injection-site reaction.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Currently, inclisiran lacks data on clinical outcome improvement or long-term safety. However, it may play a role in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD risk equivalent if optimal LDL-C cannot be achieved by statins and PCSK9 inhibitors cannot be tolerated. The drug may be used for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Conclusion

Inclisiran is an effective and safe medication for lowering LDL-C levels. Additional data regarding efficacy on cardiovascular outcomes and long-term safety profile with inclisiran are needed.

4 Discussion

In this comprehensive meta‐analysis, which encompassed 8 RCTs, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety profile of inclisiran in hyperlipidemia. Our pooled analysis found a significant decline in lipid profiles, including changes in LDL‐c levels, percentage of PCSK9, cholesterol, and apo‐B. However, the risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiac events, and stroke were comparable between the two groups. Regarding safety outcomes, there was an increased risk of total adverse events and injection site reactions with inclisiran.

Since LDL‐C significantly contributes to ASCVD risk, achieving and maintaining target levels is paramount. A substantial number of high‐risk patients on statins have been shown to discontinue the treatment either due to inconvenience from the high frequency of its intake or symptoms of myalgia or myopathy. Hence, due to its efficacy, inclisiran addresses the dual obstacles of high cholesterol: the requirement for additional lowering of LDL‐C levels and the challenge of low compliance. Furthermore, inclisiran is a brief synthetic siRNA that functions as a guide, capable of bonding with the corresponding mRNA of PCSK9 and prompting its degradation. This inhibition causes a decrease in intra‐and extra‐cellular PCSK9 protein levels, resulting in an effective and durable reduction in LDL levels. Additionally, compared to monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9, which require frequent injections, inclisiran has a twice‐yearly dosing regimen, which can improve its adherence rate and provide a long‐term reduction in cardiovascular events.

### Effect of an siRNA therapeutic targeting PCSK9 on atherogenic lipoproteins: prespecified secondary end points in ORION 1 [^e72dc40c]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ORION-1 trial (Trial to Evaluate the Effect of ALN-PCSSC Treatment on Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol [LDL-C]) demonstrated that inclisiran, an siRNA therapeutic that targets protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 mRNA within hepatocytes, produces significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. The effects of inclisiran on other lipids are less well described.

Methods

ORION-1 was a phase 2 trial assessing 6 different inclisiran dosing regimens versus placebo. Participants with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol despite receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy received a single-dose (200, 300, or 500 mg) or 2-dose starting regimen (100, 200, or 300 mg on days 1 and 90) of inclisiran or placebo. This prespecified analysis reports the percentage reductions in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), triglycerides, HDL-C, and apo A1 at the primary efficacy time point (day 180) with mixed-effect models for repeated measures. Additional prespecified analyses report time course of changes from baseline at each visit to day 210, interindividual variation in response, and lipid goal attainment.

Results

The mean age of the 501 participants was 63 years, 65% were male, 69% had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 73% used statins, and mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 128 mg/dL. A single dose of inclisiran reduced apo B, non-HDL-C, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol over 210 days. A second dose of inclisiran provided additional lowering of these lipids. At day 180, non-HDL-C was lowered dose-dependently: by 25% from 148 ± 43 to 110 ± 45 mg/dL in the 200-mg single-dose group and by 46% from 161 ± 58 to 91 ± 58 mg/dL in the 2-dose 300-mg group. For the same dosing regimens, apo B was reduced by 23% from 101 ± 23 to 78 ± 29 mg/dL and by 41% from 106 ± 31 to 65 ± 33 mg/dL (P < 0.001 for all groups versus placebo). In the 300-mg 2-dose group, all individuals experienced apo B and non-HDL-C reductions. There was larger interindividual variation in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) reductions. In the 300-mg 2-dose group, the percentages of patients achieving guideline-recommended apo B goals for high- and very-high-risk patients at day 180 were 78% and 90%; 68% and 83% of participants achieved non-HDL-C < 100 and < 130 mg/dL.

Conclusions

Inclisiran produces significant and prolonged reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins, suggesting that inhibiting the synthesis of protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 through siRNA may be a viable alternative to other approaches that target protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.
