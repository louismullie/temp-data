## Question

With a symptomatic case of sinking skin flap syndrome, that is severe and observable by naked eye, with the site of the craniectomy dramatically sunken in, and midline shift of brain observable on imaging, what is currently known or at least assumed, about how that would impact that patient's cognitive capacity? Is it possible they could maintain their legal competency for signing enforceable contracts while in that condition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with severe, symptomatic sinking skin flap syndrome (syndrome of the trephined) and radiographic midline shift can maintain legal competence to sign enforceable contracts, and what evidence-based reasoning supports that conclusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and its typical cognitive and neurological manifestations. Then, I should verify how midline shift correlates with consciousness and executive function. Next, I will examine the rapid reversibility of deficits after cranioplasty and what that implies about ongoing brain dysfunction. After that, I need to translate these medical findings into legal competence standards and the clinical assessment requirements. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical next steps for evaluation and documentation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its spectrum. Sinking skin flap syndrome (syndrome of the trephined) is a recognized complication after decompressive craniectomy characterized by neurological deterioration that often improves after cranioplasty, with reported symptoms including cognitive deficits, language impairment, motor weakness, orthostatic phenomena, and altered consciousness, among others [^112BrBB4] [^1153KRDb].

> Wait, let me verify the cognitive burden in symptomatic cases. Prospective cohorts using standardized neuropsychological batteries demonstrate that more than half of craniectomized patients manifest a spectrum of cognitive and motor symptoms attributable to SoT, with measurable deficits in attention, processing speed, executive function, language, and visuospatial domains, and with improvement typically documented within days after cranioplasty, underscoring the functional significance of the syndrome when symptomatic [^113SoPjq] [^112FcoAD] [^115JeRT6].

> I need to check the implication of a visible, severely sunken flap with midline shift. Radiographic signs of brain structure shifting — including midline deviation, paradoxical herniation, and compressed ventricles — are strongly associated with SoT and correlate with clinical deterioration; importantly, the absence of a sunken flap does not exclude SoT, but its presence with midline shift heightens concern for ongoing compromise of cerebral perfusion, venous drainage, and CSF dynamics that can impair cognition and consciousness [^117EuGM2] [^116rVx3X] [^117DnJUs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about consciousness solely from midline shift. I initially thought a midline shift greater than roughly 5 mm would reliably predict impaired alertness and thereby negate competence, but I should double-check that assumption; in fact, while larger midline shift is associated with worse outcomes and can track with declining consciousness, pupillary reactivity and basal cistern status are more robust bedside correlates of mass effect than midline shift alone, and midline shift by itself is not a linear determinant of competence in isolation from clinical examination and cognitive testing [^115vyPrb] [^113NiD11] [^1114j8Eo].

> Next, I should review the evidence for reversibility and what it implies about current function. Multiple prospective studies show rapid improvement in motor and cognitive function within 1–4 days after cranioplasty in SoT, with disability reductions that persist at 90 days; this pattern supports that the observed deficits reflect ongoing, biologically mediated dysfunction rather than static injury, reinforcing the inference that severe, symptomatic SoT with midline shift signifies active compromise of higher-order capacities during the symptomatic interval [^115JeRT6] [^1126JpbF] [^117EuGM2].

> I will now examine the legal competence construct. Contractual competence generally requires the capacity to understand, appreciate, reason about, and communicate decisions; in medical contexts, clinicians assess decisional capacity using a similar four-pronged framework, and severe TBI and its complications frequently impair these processes, particularly executive function and appreciation of consequences, which are commonly affected in SoT cohorts with documented cognitive slowing, inattention, and impaired processing speed [^113SoPjq] [^115JeRT6].

> But wait, what if the patient appears "awake" and conversant — could they still lack capacity? Yes, preserved conversational ability does not exclude impaired executive function or impaired appreciation of consequences; SoT cohorts include patients with relatively preserved consciousness who nonetheless demonstrate measurable deficits on Trail Making, digit span, and executive tasks, and the orthostatic worsening with upright posture further underscores physiologic vulnerability that can transiently degrade cognition even when the patient seems superficially intact [^113SoPjq] [^1153KRDb] [^1176f5oh].

> Let me synthesize the risk profile for this specific scenario. Severe, clinically evident skin flap depression plus radiographic midline shift in a symptomatic SoT presentation signals substantial atmospheric-pressure–mediated brain distortion, compromised perfusion, and impaired CSF dynamics that plausibly degrade attention, processing speed, executive function, and self-awareness; given the documented reversibility after cranioplasty, the current state likely reflects active, functionally significant cognitive compromise rather than stable residual deficit, which materially undermines the reliability of contractual capacity at this time [^117DnJUs] [^115JeRT6] [^1126JpbF].

> I should confirm the practical clinical implications. Competence is task- and time-specific; a structured capacity assessment by a clinician familiar with executive dysfunction and TBI sequelae is required, ideally timed when the patient is upright if orthostatic symptoms are suspected, and repeated after cranioplasty if feasible, because improvement within days would corroborate SoT-related incapacity during the symptomatic interval and could reframe future determinations once stabilized [^1153KRDb] [^115JeRT6].

> Conclusion and recommendation: It is highly unlikely that a patient with severe, symptomatic sinking skin flap syndrome accompanied by a visibly sunken flap and imaging-confirmed midline shift possesses the reliable cognitive capacity required for valid contract execution at this time; the combination of objective brain structure shift, documented cognitive-executive deficits in SoT, and rapid post-cranioplasty improvement collectively indicate ongoing, biologically mediated impairment of understanding, appreciation, and reasoning that would not meet legal competence standards until stabilized and reassessed [^117EuGM2] [^113SoPjq] [^115JeRT6].

> Next steps: I need to ensure a formal capacity evaluation is performed using standardized tools and domain-specific probes for executive function and consequence appreciation, document orthostatic variability if present, and coordinate expedited neurosurgical consultation for cranioplasty; if decisions are urgent, surrogate decision-making should be invoked in accordance with applicable laws and patient values, with reassessment of capacity after cranial reconstruction to capture potential recovery of decisional abilities [^115JscPd] [^115JeRT6].

---

Patients with severe, symptomatic sinking skin flap syndrome (SSFS) and visible midline shift on imaging typically have **significant cognitive impairment** due to altered cerebral hemodynamics, CSF dynamics, and cortical deformation [^112BrBB4] [^117DnJUs]. This can impair attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed, often with orthostatic worsening [^1153KRDb] [^115vVysx]. Legal competency is **unlikely** in this state, as the syndrome can compromise understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and communication; however, competency is decision-specific and must be assessed case-by-case. If decisions are urgent, use supported decision-making or legal guardianship; otherwise, prioritize urgent cranioplasty, which often reverses cognitive deficits and may restore competency [^115JeRT6] [^1126JpbF].

## Cognitive impact of severe sinking skin flap syndrome

Severe SSFS with midline shift causes **multifactorial cognitive impairment**:

- **Cerebral blood flow impairment**: Atmospheric pressure on the exposed brain reduces perfusion, causing ischemia and hypoxia that impair cognition [^117Sv2qH] [^116JJHAY].

- **CSF dynamics disruption**: Midline shift and cortical deformation alter CSF flow, causing hydrocephalus and metabolic dysfunction that impair cognition [^116QovHx] [^117DnJUs].

- **Cortical deformation**: Mechanical distortion disrupts neural networks, causing deficits in attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed [^notfound].

- **Orthostatic cognitive fluctuations**: Symptoms often worsen upright, reflecting dynamic impairment of cerebral physiology [^1153KRDb] [^115vVysx].

---

## Clinical evidence of cognitive impairment in SSFS

Clinical studies document **cognitive impairment** in SSFS:

- **Prospective cohort evidence**: Patients with SSFS show measurable cognitive deficits that improve within days after cranioplasty, confirming the syndrome's causal role [^115JeRT6] [^112FcoAD].

- **Systematic review findings**: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of SSFS, with deficits in attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed [^112BrBB4] [^112FcoAD].

- **Case reports**: Severe SSFS presents with cognitive decline, language deficits, and altered consciousness that improve after cranioplasty [^1133w8D2] [^1176f5oh].

---

## Legal competency considerations

Legal competency requires the capacity to **understand, appreciate, reason, and communicate** decisions. Severe SSFS with midline shift **can compromise these capacities** through impaired attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed, as well as fluctuating consciousness and confusion, which further undermine reliable decision-making [^112BrBB4] [^1133w8D2]. Given these deficits, patients with severe SSFS are **unlikely to meet legal competency standards** unless formally assessed and documented otherwise.

---

## Reversibility of cognitive impairment after cranioplasty

Cranioplasty is the definitive treatment and **often reverses cognitive impairment** in SSFS:

- **Rapid improvement**: Cognitive and motor function typically improve within 1–4 days after cranioplasty, confirming reversibility [^115JeRT6] [^1126JpbF].

- **Long-term benefits**: Improvement often persists, with better functional outcomes and quality of life [^115JeRT6] [^1126JpbF].

- **Physiological restoration**: Cranioplasty restores intracranial dynamics, cerebral blood flow, and CSF circulation, enabling cognitive recovery [^117JYXq9] [^116JJHAY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **early recognition and management**:

- **Early cranioplasty**: Perform cranioplasty as soon as brain swelling resolves to prevent irreversible deficits and restore competency [^113oUNXp] [^115pu1BH].

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Use neurological and cognitive evaluations to detect and monitor SSFS-related impairment [^112FcoAD] [^116rVx3X].

- **Legal and ethical considerations**: Assess competency case-by-case; use supported decision-making or legal guardianship when competency is impaired [^notfound].

---

## Practical implications for clinicians and legal professionals

Clinicians should **routinely screen for SSFS** in patients with large craniectomy defects and midline shift, using neurological and cognitive assessments to detect impairment [^112FcoAD] [^116rVx3X]. Legal professionals should **request formal competency assessments** when SSFS is suspected, recognizing that impairment may be reversible after cranioplasty [^115JeRT6] [^1126JpbF]. Both parties should **prioritize early cranioplasty** to restore cerebral physiology, reverse cognitive deficits, and potentially restore legal competency [^113oUNXp] [^117DnJUs].

---

Patients with severe, symptomatic SSFS and midline shift **typically have significant cognitive impairment** that likely precludes legal competency. Cranioplasty can reverse these deficits, so clinicians and legal professionals should act promptly to restore capacity.

Detailed neurologic assessment is instrumental in detecting SoT

A detailed neurologic and cognitive assessment within 4 days before and after the cranioplasty allowed us to detect milder forms of SoT that we termed the "a posteriori" SoT. "A posteriori" SoT manifested in slow rehabilitation progress followed by a measurable neurologic improvement within four days after the cranioplasty. The repeated neurologic testing after the cranioplasty improved diagnostic sensitivity and explains a significantly increased incidence of SoT. Our study adds to the growing body of literature demonstrating that a significant proportion of patients improve after cranioplasty even without evident neurologic worsening beforehand. Our findings of an improved neurologic function in the "a posteriori" SoT group corroborate the observations that a proportion of patients improve after cranioplasty even without an apparent worsening beforehand. Thus, our findings suggest that "a priori" and "a posteriori" SoT constitute a clinical spectrum of SoT. Consequently, a significant proportion of patients after craniectomy are susceptible to develop SoT. Slow rehabilitation progress in craniectomized patients should alert clinicians to consider tailoring the cranioplasty timing to an individual patient.

The SoT diagnosis remains challenging due to the absence of robust diagnostic criteria. In the current study, the radiologic assessment revealed that 81% of the SoT group presented at least one sign of shifting brain structures, e.g. sinking skin flap, paradoxical midline shift, compressed lateral or 3 rd ventricle, but their diagnostic yield individually remained low. SoT manifested without the classical radiologic sign of sinking skin flap in 50% and without paradoxical herniation in more than 80% of the "a posteriori" SoT patients, corroborating the data from our previous study. As a result, the absence of a sinking skin flap or paradoxical herniation does not exclude SoT, and careful clinical evaluation should guide the diagnosis. Conversely, radiologic signs of the brain structure shifting should warrant a careful repeated neurologic evaluation and to consider an expedited cranioplasty.

### Nonsurgical management of syndrome of the trephined: a systematic review [^1174h17F]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of the Trephined (SoT), also known as sunken or sinking skin flap syndrome (SSFS), is a rare sequela of decompressive craniectomy caused by an atmospheric pressure gradient over the underlying brain parenchyma following bone flap removal. Cranioplasty is the definitive treatment of SoT, although some patients are not surgical candidates or require bridging to definitive treatment. This systematic review identified 7 articles describing nonsurgical interventions for patients with SoT. Three treatment modalities emerged: external orthotics, scalp traction, and Trendelenburg positioning. These approaches demonstrated rapid improvements in neurological symptoms, including restored motor function, improved cognition, resolution of midline shifts, and, in some cases, re-expanded brain parenchyma. While these results are limited to case reports and small case series, they demonstrate promising early outcomes for the noninvasive management of Syndrome of the Trephined.

### Syndrome of the trephined: clinical spectrum, risk factors, and impact of cranioplasty on neurologic recovery in a prospective cohort [^1153KRDb]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syndrome of the trephined (SoT) is an underrecognized complication after decompressive craniectomy (DC) with poorly determined incidence ranging between 1 and 40%. SoT manifests by a delayed sensorimotor or cognitive worsening after craniectomy and is often associated with varying symptomatology, including headache, tinnitus, dizziness, fatigability, pain/discomfort at the site of craniectomy, feeling of apprehension, or depression. The wide range of clinical manifestations and absence of well-defined diagnostic criteria makes SoT a challenging diagnosis. One hallmark feature of SoT is a temporary improvement of symptoms in a supine position, termed orthostatic phenomena, which can help guide the diagnosis prior to cranioplast; whereas a definite improvement after a cranioplasty confirms SoT.

Furthermore, SoT is often associated with a sinking skin flap morphology, a radiologic and clinical sign. Although this association led to the development of new terminology for the syndrome ("sinking skin flap syndrome"), numerous findings in the literature indicate the existence of SoT in patients without sinking skin flap morphology. Thus, there is growing evidence that the incidence of SoT might be underestimated because of a lack of detailed evaluation of subtle neurologic manifestations in the absence of a sinking skin flap. Since DC is increasingly utilized to treat refractory intracranial hypertension for various etiologies, including stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is an unmet demand for a better understanding of the post-craniectomy related complications.

### Syndrome of the trephined [^1176f5oh]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

"Syndrome of the trephined" or "sinking skin flap syndrome" is an unusual syndrome in which neurological deterioration occurs following removal of a large skull bone flap. The neurological status of the patient can occasionally be strongly related to posture. A 77-year-old male patient with an acute subdural hematoma was treated using a hemicraniectomy and evacuation of the hematoma. On the 9th postoperative day there was deterioration in sensorium associated with a sunken scalp flap and worsening midline shift on CT. A significant improvement in sensorium and a filling up of the scalp flap occurred after maintaining the patient's head in a dependent position. The patient subsequently made an excellent recovery following replacement of the bone flap. The pathophysiology of "syndrome of the trephined" or "sinking skin flap syndrome" is reviewed.

Decompressive craniectomy is reclaiming a role in neurocritical care. The altered pathophysiology found in a cranium converted from a 'closed' box to an 'open' box' carries benefits and risks. In some craniectomy patients, the forces of atmospheric pressure and gravity overwhelm intracranial pressures, and the brain appears sunken. This can lead to paradoxical herniation and the sinking skin flap syndrome, also called the syndrome of the trephined. At the other polar extreme, external brain tamponade occurs when subgaleal fluid accumulates under pressure and 'pushes' on the brain across the craniectomy defect. The neuro-intensive care team should be prepared to diagnose and treat a spectrum of decompressive craniectomy complications including: cerebral contusions, infections, seizures, intra- and extra-axial hemorrhages and fluid collections, sinking skin flap syndrome or syndrome of the trephined, paradoxical herniation, and external brain tamponade. The treating physicians must set aside the Monro-Kellie doctrine and recognize the new pathophysiologic state of these 'open box' patients.

Background

Syndrome of the trephined (SoT) is a rare, important complication of a craniectomy characterized by neurological dysfunction that improves with cranioplasty. Its varied symptoms include motor, cognitive, and language deficits. Its exact characterization appears suboptimal, with differing approaches of evaluation. Accordingly, this topic is in great need of further investigation.

Objective

To accurately describe SoT and explore methods of an objective diagnosis/evaluation.

Methods

Electronic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and PsycINFO databases used the key words "syndrome of the trephined" and "sinking skin flap". Non-English-language and duplicate articles were eliminated. Title and abstract reviews were selected for relevance. Full-text reviews were selected for articles providing individual characteristics of SoT patients.

Results

This review identified that SoT most often occurs in male patients (60%) at 5.1 ± 10.8 months after craniectomy for neurotrauma (38%). The average reported craniectomy is 88.3 ± 34.4 cm and usually exists with a "sunken skin flap" (93%). Symptoms most commonly include motor, cognitive, and language deficits (57%, 41%, 28%, respectively), with improvement after cranioplasty within 3.8 ± 3.9 days. Functional independence with activities of daily living is achieved by 54.9% of patients after 2.9 ± 3.4 months of rehabilitation. However, evaluation of SoT is inconsistent, with only 53% of reports documenting objective studies.

Discussion

SoT is a variable phenomenon associated with a prolonged time to cranioplasty. Due to current weaknesses in objectivity, we hypothesize that SoT is often underdiagnosed and recommend a multifaceted approach for consistent evaluation.

Conclusion

SoT is a serious complication that lacks exact characterization and deserves future investigation. Improved understanding and recognition have important implications for early intervention and patient outcomes.

### Sinking flap syndrome revisited: the who, when and why [^116QovHx]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

The sinking flap syndrome (SFS) is one of the complications of decompressive craniectomy (DC). Although frequently presenting with aspecific symptoms, that may be underestimated, it can lead to severe and progressive neurological deterioration and, if left untreated, even to death. We report our experience in a consecutive series of 43 patients diagnosed with SFS and propose a classification based on the possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms. In 10 years' time, 43 patients presenting with severely introflexed decompressive skin flaps plus radiological and clinical evidence of SFS were identified. We analysed potential factors involved in SFS development (demographics, time from decompression to deterioration, type, size and cause leading to DC, timing of cranioplasty, CSF dynamics disturbances, clinical presentation). Based on the collected data, we elaborated a classification system identifying 3 main SFS subtypes: (1) primary or atrophic, (2) secondary or hydrocephalic and (3) mixed. Very large DC, extensive brain damage, medial craniectomy border distance from the midline < 2 cm, re-surgery for craniectomy widening and CSF circulation derangements were found to be statistically associated with SFS. Cranioplasty led to permanent neurological improvement in 37 cases. In our series, SFS incidence was 16%, significantly larger than what is reported in the literature. Its management was more complex in patients affected by CSF circulation disturbances (especially when needing the removal of a contralateral infected cranioplasty or a resorbed bone flap). Although cranioplasty was always the winning solution, its appropriate timing was strategical and, if needed, we performed it even in an emergency, to ensure patient's improvement.

### Decompressive craniectomy for acute ischemic stroke [^117Sv2qH]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A long-term complication after DC is the syndrome of the trephined or sunken skin flap syndrome, which occurs weeks to months after DC and is often characterized by neurological deterioration after initial rehabilitative improvements. An obvious finding on clinical and radiological examinations of affected patients is the severely sunken sink flap overlying the craniectomy defect (Fig. 9), which is even more obvious in the vertical position and can be exacerbated by CSF diversion or significant atrophy of the infarcted territory. The pathophysiology of this syndrome appears to be a mismatch between atmospheric pressure and intracranial pressure, leading to the impairment of cerebral perfusion, venous drainage, and CSF dynamics. The vast majority of cases will significantly improve after cranioplasty.

Quality of life after DC

While the RCTs mentioned above were primarily looking at mortality and functional outcome (i.e. mRS within the first year), data on long-term outcome, quality of life, participation in activities of daily living and work, patient-reported outcomes, opinion of family and caregivers, and depression and anxiety is limited. For DESTINY II, the rates of retrospective consent obtained from survivors, assessment of quality of life (EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires), and frequency of major depression were published. Additionally, Rahme and co-workers as well as Woertgen and co-workers provide similar information. In summary, 60–80% of survivors and/or caregivers gave retrospective consent to DC, which indicates an at least acceptable outcome. Quality of life was impaired (mean overall reduction of almost 50%) and major depression occurred frequently (almost 60%), but both to an extent known from survivors of other significant cerebral insults. In a small series published by Vahedi and co-workers, no patient (mean age 41 years) returned to prior employment. Quality of life after DC for supratentorial malignant stroke appears to be acceptable for the majority of patients, and most do not regret having undergone DC despite relevant rates of impairment and depression. However, although Woertgen and co-workers indicate that no difference in quality of life was observed when comparing dominant and non-dominant hemisphere stroke patients, those with aphasia might be underrepresented especially in patient-reported outcomes and could be at higher risk of psychosocial impairment.

### Temporary skin lifting using elastic traction for sinking skin flap syndrome [^114aysKE]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Sinking skin flap syndrome (SSFS) is a rare but significant complication after decompressive craniectomy, caused by atmospheric pressure compressing the brain through a cranial defect. Although cranioplasty is the primary treatment, infection may delay reconstruction, leaving patients vulnerable to progressive neurological decline. The authors report a case of SSFS after removal of infected cranial implants. To alleviate intracranial compression during the infection control period, the authors developed a temporary skin lifting technique using thermoplastic resin and elastic loops. This method successfully reversed midline shift and neurological symptoms without skin complications. Twenty days after skin lifting, delayed cranioplasty was performed without incident. This case highlights the potential utility of elastic traction-based skin elevation as a safe and effective bridge therapy in SSFS management when early cranioplasty is not feasible. Further clinical application may help optimize outcomes in similar complex cases.

### Sinking skin flap syndrome in glioblastoma [^113Q8cEy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Sinking skin flap syndrome (SSFS) is a rare neurological complication in patients with traumatic haemorrhage, stroke or cerebral oedema who undergo decompressive craniectomy to relieve increased intracranial pressure. Hallmark of SSFS is the sinking of the scalp to a plane lower than the edges of the skull defect in the setting of neurological deterioration. Our objective is to report that SSFS can present after small craniotomy without cerebral cortex compression and to share our diagnostic/therapeutic approach. A 62-year-old woman with a glioblastoma developed SSFS after a small craniectomy and tumour resection without cerebral cortex compression but a decrease in the surgical cavity volume. Brain MRI showed decreased size of the surgical cavity. Interestingly, the patient also developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). This case highlights an atypical presentation of SSFS and the possible association with PRES. It also illustrates how an early cranioplasty can successfully reverse SSFS.

Neurologic assessment, disability, and imaging biomarkers

All patients underwent a comprehensive neurologic, including cognitive, assessment at admission, within 4 days before and 4 days after the cranioplasty. The neurologic assessment included a standard neurologic examination and a specific battery of motor tests: Motricity Index, grip strength evaluation with Jamar hand dynamometer, Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients, and qualitative gait independence score (0 – bedridden; 1 – walking with substantial assistance from a therapist and < 10 meter distance, 2 – walking with a therapist and > 10 meter distance; 3 – independent gait with auxiliary equipment; 4 – independent gait without auxiliary equipment). The cognitive evaluation covered multiple domains, including working memory (digit span forward), executive function and processing speed (Trail Making Test A and B, Regard's 5-point non-verbal fluency test), language (institutional 12 object naming test, and Token test), and visuospatial function (Bells cancellation test quantitatively categorized: 0 – no neglect, 1 – mild, 2 – moderate, 3 – severe neglect). The clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of the SoT-related symptoms or improvement in motor/cognitive evaluation performed within 4 days before and after the cranioplasty. A clinically significant change in neurologic function was defined using the reliable change indices (RCI). Using RCI in psychometric tests allows the determination of whether the change of scores in an individual is significant and is greater than occurring due to random measurement error alone.

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to measure the degree of disability within 4 days after the cranioplasty, with mRS 0–3 defined as a good outcome. We also recorded the mRS at 90 days to evaluate the long-term functional status.

All patients underwent a head CT scan (Siemens Somatom Force or GE Discovery 750 HD) in a supine position. Imaging biomarkers and standard radiologic signs of the SoT were recorded as reported in our previous publication. The following markers indicated a shift of brain structures: the sinking skin flap at the craniectomy site, deviation of the midline structures (Fig. 1), axial diameter, and slit-like third ventricle and anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The paradoxical herniation of midline structures was marked with positive values, while deviation towards the craniectomy side was marked with negative values.

Brain sunken ratio

We did not find a correlation between the brain sunken ratio and complication rate, contrary to the study by Lee et al. Unfortunately, we were not able to analyze this brain sunken ratio in all patients: most of our neurosurgeons decided to schedule a patient for CP based on physical examination of the skin flap only, and many patients did not routinely receive pre-CP CT-imaging in a clinically stable setting or at the outpatient clinic. Whether patients received pre-CP CT-imaging was not associated with a difference in complication rate. Additionally, there was a large heterogeneity in time between CT-imaging and CP in the remaining patients who did receive pre-CP CT-imaging. Possibly, future studies can elucidate the possible benefits of routine pre-CP CT-imaging, with added emphasis on timing before CP. Such imaging may also be helpful in patients suffering from pre-CP symptomatic hydrocephalus, treated with external ventricular/lumbar CSF drainage, to carefully monitor the consequences of drainage on brain sinking.

Limitations of the study and future perspectives

The present study has several limitations. First, data collection was performed retrospectively. Second, CP patients were dichotomized by ≤ 3 months or > 3 months after DC, similar to recent systematic reviews. In our cohort this led to a skewed distribution of timing with only 37 out of the 145 patients falling within the early group. But since 37 is still a substantial number of patients, we consider our conclusions as relatively solid. Third, there was no standardized preoperative treatment protocol in patients with symptomatic CSF flow disturbance, or standardized operative technique of CP. The high variability in pre- and intraoperative treatment was not a prognostic factor of complications, but a more stringent and uniform treatment/surgical protocol may result in less complications For example, to prevent pre-CP overdrainage of CSF, one may close external lumbar/ventricular CSF drains or lumbar/ventricular-peritoneal shunts a minimum number of days before CP. Furthermore, a uniform intraoperative protocol (including a minimum number of tack-up sutures and method of flap fixation) could be implemented. Also, if all patients would receive routine pre-CP CT scans, a potential correlation between the brain sunken ratio and complications rate could be better identified, and could then serve to implement a minimum brain sunken ratio in the treatment protocol. The very high complication rate in the subgroup of patients with symptomatic CSF flow disturbance prior to CP is clearly unacceptably high. We should undertake any effort possible to lower this rate in the coming years.

### Can we do better at measuring patient-reported outcomes after cranioplasty? A systematic review [^117JYXq9]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cranioplasty is a common procedure to repair a skull defect resulting from a previous operation or injury. While the procedure is primarily performed to protect the brain from outside forces, cranioplasty can improve neurological function, enhance glymphatic fluid circulation, and restore intracranial pressure adaptations and cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Recent studies have also highlighted the impact of cranioplasty on syndrome of the trephined or "sinking flap syndrome". This syndrome refers to the neurological deterioration that occurs after a large craniectomy, with various symptoms including headaches, motor weakness, worsened hemisyndrome, language deficits, and cognitive disorders with or without an orthostatic component. These symptoms can improve or resolve entirely as early as 3–4 days after a cranioplasty.

Although the neuroprotective functions of cranioplasty are critically important, cranioplasty is also an important rehabilitation procedure that can improve a patient's quality of life by restoring the appearance of the skull. An abnormal calvarial shape can affect how patients view themselves and how they are perceived by others. Such perceptions have important implications for psychological well-being, distress, and social performance.

Despite the necessity and frequency of cranioplasty, it has substantial risk. A national analysis database study of 8275 patients reported that more than one-third of individuals who underwent cranioplasty experienced perioperative complications. Older age, larger cranioplasty size, and delayed timing were associated with higher complication risk overall. Twenty-six percent of complications, including wound dehiscence, wound infection, implant exposure, and bleeding related complications were specifically related to the cranioplasty surgery itself. The remaining complications were due to other nonsurgical factors such as deep vein thrombosis, thromboembolism, and pulmonary complications. There were also other neurological complications such as dysphagia, dysrhythmia, and paralysis that may have been related to the cranioplasty surgery or underlying neurological impairment. However, this could not be determined from the study cited. Therefore, this 26% is likely an underestimation of true cranioplasty-related complications in this cohort. Patients who experience cranioplasty surgery-related complications often report negative impacts on their quality of life (QOL), including pain, impairments in facial function, emotional distress, worsened work life, and appearance-related concerns.

The three-hit hypothesis for developing SoT

Based on the study results, we suggest a three-hit hypothesis for the pathophysiology of SoT:
Initial brain injury by TBI causes a wide range of functional short- and long-term neurologic deficits associated with contusions and diffuse axonal injury with underlying healthy brain tissue that has the potential to recover.
Cranial window results in brain structure shift and disturbs physiologic intracranial fluid dynamics. The physical shift of brain structures and compression by a sinking skin flap causes blood flow disturbances, cerebral metabolism impairment, and changes in the CSF flow. The loss of the brain's rigid enclosing causes reduced pulse wave amplitude, which impairs intracranial fluid movement, including capillary blood flow, CSF circulation, and perivascular drainage.
Hemorrhagic lesions further impair CSF production and clearance. Increased atmospheric pressure and blood degradation products in the brain parenchyma and subarachnoid space impair CSF formation and clearance through blockage of arachnoid granulations by blood clots. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that perivascular drainage plays an important role in the drainage of brain solutes; thus, the impairment of perivascular drainage may additionally contribute to impaired brain fluids dynamics and SoT development.

Interestingly, although recent studies have shown an association between craniectomy size and SoT, we could not confirm these findings. In a study by Tarr et al. SoT incidence increased when craniectomy area reached 50 cm² or more. Although we did not find a difference in mean craniectomy area between the SoT and non-SoT groups, the inclusion of only large craniectomies in our study (mean craniectomy area 112.8 ± 35.4 cm²) limited the sensitivity to detect this association. However, our findings suggest that there might be a ceiling effect when SoT risk stops increasing after a certain threshold of craniectomy area is reached. As a result, large craniectomies may have been an additional contributor to the high incidence of SoT in our cohort.

Risk factors

The unadjusted logistic regression model identified that TBI, ipsilateral hemorrhagic lesions, and shifting of brain structures were significantly associated with SoT (Table 2). In the multivariable regression model adjusted for age, we found that ipsilateral hemorrhagic lesions, and shifting of brain structures remained strong independent predictors of SoT, while TBI maintained a weak association with SoT. The model explained a significant proportion of the SoT occurrence variability (Cox and Snell R² = 0.45) and had a strong predictive power (AUC = 0.93).

SoT clinical features and subtypes

All 26 SoT patients presented a rapid motor, cognitive improvement, or improvement in SoT symptoms (orthostatic phenomena, headache, vertigo, etc.) within 4 days after the cranioplasty. In Table 3, we present the most common clinical characteristics of SoT.

When comparing the two modes of SoT presentation, the "a posteriori" SoT individuals were younger (38.8 ± 10.2 vs. 52.5 ± 11.8 years, p = 0.004) but did not differ in other clinical and demographic characteristics. The "a posteriori" SoT presented with less prominent radiologic features. Sinking skin flap (50% vs. 93%, p = 0.026) and paradoxical herniation (17% vs. 64%, p = 0.021) were less common in the "a posteriori" SoT group but did not differ in other radiologic features.

### Syndrome of the trephined: a rare challenge in head&neck reconstruction [^1115o5rx]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Syndrome of the trephined (ST) refers to the rare, reversible event of neurological deterioration following craniectomy. ST is also known as "sinking skin flap syndrome" and typically occurs in the weeks to months following operation. The mechanism underlying syndromic onset is poorly understood. Changes to cerebrospinal fluid flow, alteration of temperature-related perfusion, and scarring at the intracranial surgical site have all been proposed. Patients present with a variety of symptoms related to paradoxical increased intracranial pressure. Sometimes falsely attributed as a consequence of the initial cranial insult, ST is more specifically a symptomatic process resulting as direct consequence of the craniectomy procedure. With timely identification and subsequent cranioplasty, the associated neurological dysfunction can be corrected - this rectification being the primary confirmatory feature of the syndrome.

Case

A 59-year-old female was seen with regards to a wound of the temporoparietal scalp, with exposed cranial implant. She had suffered a traumatic brain injury and underwent craniectomy after a motor vehicle accident 10 years prior. Her injury was complicated by necrosis of her cranial bone flap after reimplantation and at least 10 subsequent attempts to reconstruct her wound. When delayed cranial reconstruction was attempted on two separate occasions, the patient suffered severe syndrome of the trephined and required hospitalization for symptoms of impending herniation. Ultimately, she required revision and replacement of titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi free flap for soft tissue coverage of the titanium mesh.

Conclusion

This case presents a unique surgical challenge in that chronic infection was perpetuated by the replacement of implant material in the wound. Soft tissue reconstruction alone was not possible given the patient's severe ST. Free tissue transfer was required in order to bring vascularized myofascial tissue to prevent recolonization of the newly implanted mesh and allow the cranial wound to heal.

In addition, the time of onset of "a posteriori" SoT cannot be fully appreciated as this insidious form rarely presents the anticipated "red flags", such as sinking skin flap, paradoxical herniation, or clinical features of orthostatic phenomena, headaches, or vertigo. Despite the common insidious onset of SoT, our findings suggest that some of the SoT symptoms might not be fully reversible, further adding to the argument in favor of an earlier cranioplasty. In line with our findings, in previous studies the proportion of complete recovery ranged from 34.6 to 78%. It is possible that earlier cranioplasty could prevent SoT but it remains unclear if an earlier cranial repair may be beneficial in all craniectomized patients or a subgroup with higher SoT risk. Performing cranioplasty as soon as brain tissue edema resolves may be preferable as it could facilitate participation in rehabilitation and improve long-term neurologic outcomes. Because of the varying delay to brain swelling resolution and growing observational evidence of neurologic improvement after cranioplasty, future studies should seek to risk-stratify patients and tailor the timing of the cranioplasty to an individual patient rather than perform it at a fixed delay.

The reasons for the delay between brain edema resolution and cranioplasty in our study are not entirely clear. However, some of the contributing factors might be administrative and logistical considerations in organizing the cranioplasty surgery. It is crucial to foresee a timely transfer to a neurosurgical center when it is not available in the rehabilitation center's vicinity. Secondly, some delays may occur due to the logistical delays required to produce and deliver a personalized cranial implants, such as the custom-made polyetheretherketone flap. Thus, efforts should be made to establish an early collaboration between the rehabilitation and neurosurgical teams to streamline the logistical aspects of the cranioplasty procedure.

Why is CSF flow disturbance prior to CP associated with more complications?

Similar to our findings, Piedra et al. and Tsang et al. found that the presence of a permanent pre-CP CSF shunt was significantly associated with complications. Tsang et al. suggested that external lumbar/ventricular CSF drainage prior to CP would be a better alternative in patients who are CSF drainage-dependent at the time of CP. Our results do not support this suggestion: five of the 12 patients with an external lumbar/ventricular CSF drain prior to CP developed a complication. Hypothetically, patients treated for pre-CP CSF flow disturbance are at higher risk of complications due to potential pre-CP overdrainage of CSF, causing relatively negative intracranial pressure which may cause postsurgical hemorrhage. On the other hand, CP may serve to restore normal CSF flow, and sometimes even improve neurologic outcome, especially in patients with clinical signs of sinking skin flap syndrome. Indeed, CP resolved symptomatic hydrocephalus in half of our patients suffering from pre-CP symptomatic hydrocephalus. CSF flow disturbance should therefore not be a reason to restrict performing CP, but the amount of pre-CP CSF drainage should be carefully monitored and, if possible, minimized. Alternatively, a longer interval between DC and CP could be considered to evaluate whether spontaneous recovery of pre-CP hydrocephalus occurs. However this may lead to a longer admission to the hospital or delayed initiation of rehabilitation. In brief, we do not have an easy solution for the remarkably high complication rate in patients with pre-CP hydrocephalus. CP in such patients should be performed with highest caution.

### Complications in cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy: timing of the intervention [^114aggwR]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Decompressive craniectomy (DC) can be a lifesaving measure in patients with refractory intracranial hypertension due to space-occupying infarct, traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral venous thrombosis. When patients survive and the cerebral swelling has subsided, they need to undergo cranioplasty (CP) to restore cerebral protection and craniofacial cosmesis, and to prevent or treat post-craniectomy complications such as sinking skin flap syndrome.

Malcolm et al. recently reported that early CP is associated with greater neurological improvement, and therefore advocate early CP. Although CP is not a complex surgical procedure, high complication rates up to 37% have been published, without an encompassing theory as to causes or risk factors. Meta-analyses by Xu et al. and Malcom et al. showed comparable complication rates between early CP (within three months after DC) and late CP (more than three months after DC). However, several studies included in the meta-analysis of Malcolm et al. and studies published here after, did report significantly higher complication rates in patients undergoing early CP.

To further investigate the remarkably high complication rate in patients undergoing CP, we analyzed the long-term complication rate in a large cohort of consecutive patients undergoing CP after DC, and analyzed patient characteristics for predictors of complications, with a special emphasis on timing of the procedure.

### Sinking skin flap syndrome and paradoxical herniation after hemicraniectomy for malignant hemispheric infarction [^116mNjcj]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

"Sinking skin flap" (SSF) syndrome is a rare complication after large craniectomy that may progress to "paradoxical" herniation as a consequence of atmospheric pressure exceeding intracranial pressure. The prevalence and characteristics of SSF syndrome after hemicraniectomy for malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery are not well known.

Methods

We analyzed a prospective cohort of 27 patients who underwent hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. All had a clinical and brain imaging follow-up at 3 months and were followed until cranioplasty.

Results

Three of 27 patients (11%) had, at 3 to 5 months posthemicraniectomy, SSF syndrome with severe orthostatic headache as the main symptom. In addition, 4 patients (15%) had radiological SSF syndrome but no clinical symptoms except partial seizures in one. Patients with SSF syndrome had a smaller surface of craniectomy (76.2 cm² versus 88.7 cm², P = 0.05) and a tendency toward larger infarct volume, an older age, and a longer delay to cranioplasty than those without this syndrome.

Conclusions

SSF syndrome either clinically symptomatic or asymptomatic affects one fourth of patients 3 to 5 months after hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. It should be diagnosed as early as possible to avoid progression to a paradoxical herniation.

### Syndrome of the trephined: clinical spectrum, risk factors, and impact of cranioplasty on neurologic recovery in a prospective cohort [^113SoPjq]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This prospective longitudinal study demonstrates that SoT manifests with a spectrum of cognitive and motor symptoms in more than half of the patients undergoing craniectomy, causing significant concern for neurorehabilitation. We present two distinct types of SoT, including failure to progress during the rehabilitation and neurologic deterioration prior to cranioplasty, both requiring clinicians to consider the SoT diagnosis. Our findings suggest that ipsilateral hemorrhagic lesions, shifting of brain structures, and brain lesions related to TBI are independently associated with the pathophysiology of SoT. Cranioplasty performed as soon as brain edema resolves could help prevent the development of SoT and improve neurologic recovery. However, further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing for cranial repair at an individual level.

### Radiological signs of the syndrome of the trephined [^116YtJKb]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Syndrome of the trephined (ST) is a post-craniectomy complication. It is characterized by the appearance of new neurological symptoms following the craniectomy, which are relieved after cranioplasty. The purpose of our work was to identify radiological signs and imaging biomarkers of the ST.

Methods

CT images of 32 patients were retrospectively analyzed (ST = 13, controls = 19). While the shapes of craniectomy flap were qualitatively assessed, deviation of the midline structures, relative intracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, and the 3rd ventricle's volume were quantitatively measured.

Results

We did not find between-group differences in the mean age or number of post-craniectomy days. ST was diagnosed during the second post-craniectomy month. The occurrence of a sunken skin flap sign was similar in both groups (69.23% in ST group, 57.89% in control group). Occurrence of paradoxical herniation and deviation of the midline structures were not significantly different between groups. Mean relative intracranial CSF volume was significantly smaller in ST patients (ST = 5.59%, controls = 8.12%, p = 0.01). ST patients, compared to controls, had also significantly smaller mean 3rd ventricle volumes (ST = 1748 mm³, controls = 2772.97 mm³, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

ST is an infrequent and delayed post-craniectomy complication. The most common radiological findings (paradoxical herniation, deviation of the midline structures, and sunken skin flap sign) might not be specific for ST. Significantly lower 3rd ventricle, and relative intracranial CSF volumes, suggest that altered biophysical CSF properties underlie ST pathophysiology. Therefore, volume measurements of 3rd ventricle could be useful for identification of patients who have higher probability of developing the ST.

### Sinking flap syndrome with abdominal pain: an atypical presentation [^115D8QiF]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Unlabelled

A 53-year-old man developed significant mass effect secondary to an ischaemic stroke and was treated with decompressive craniectomy. During the first few days postsurgery he developed orthostatic vertigo with nausea. After a month, with increasing mobilisation and rehabilitation, he started reporting of severe abdominal pain. No aetiology could be found despite extensive local work up and the symptoms were resistant to any symptomatic treatment. Within days postcranioplasty there was a complete resolution of all the symptoms.

Conclusion

the sinking flap syndrome can cause abdominal pain and orthostatic vertigo.

### Space-expanding flap in decompressive hemicraniectomy for stroke [^113HrF9u]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DCE) is the standard of care for space-occupying malignant infarction of the medial cerebral artery in suitable patients. After DCE, the brain is susceptible to trauma and at risk for the syndrome of the trephined. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using temporary space-expanding flaps, implanted during DCE, to shield the brain from these risks while permitting the injured brain to expand.

Methods

The authors performed a prospective feasibility study to analyze the safety of space-expanding flaps in 10 patients undergoing DCE and evaluated clinical and radiological outcomes.

Results

The relatives of 1 patient withdrew consent, leaving 9 patients in the final analysis. No patients required removal of the space-expanding flap because of uncontrolled increase of intracranial pressure or infection. One patient required additional external ventricular drainage and 1 received mannitol. The mean (range) midline shift decreased from 6.67 (3–12) mm to 1.26 (0–2.6) mm after DCE with the space-expanding flap. The authors observed no cases of sinking skin flap syndrome, other complications, or deaths. One patient underwent further treatment due to infection of the reimplanted autologous bone flap. Two patients later refused cranioplasty, preferring to keep the space-expanding flap and thus avoid the potential risks of cranioplasty.

Conclusions

This feasibility study showed that the concurrent use of space-expanding flaps appeared to be safe in patients who underwent DCE for malignant infarction of the medial cerebral artery. Moreover, space-expanding flaps may permit patients to avoid a second surgery for reimplantation of the autologous bone flap and the risks inherent to this procedure.

### Reversibility of murine motor deficits following hemi-craniectomy and cranioplasty [^113dq4f6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hemi-craniectomy is a common surgical procedure which allows the brain to swell and herniate and is often utilized to treat traumatic brain injury. When left untreated the scalp skin typically sinks on the side of the craniectomy creating a phenotype termed "sinking skin flap syndrome". In addition, these same patients often develop long-term neurocognitive deficits termed "syndrome of the trephined" as a result of their craniectomy which reverse when the cranial skull is replaced. The authors hypothesize that a mouse animal model can be developed demonstrating long-term neurologic deficits attributed to hemi-craniectomy skull defects similar to humans with syndrome of the trephined.

Methods

Thirty C57 mice were randomized among 3 groups: Group 1 = control group (sham surgery), Group 2 = hemi-craniectomy only, and Group 3 = hemi-craniectomy with immediate cranioplasty. Motor deficits were studied using a beam walk test. Statistical comparison of differences among the 3 groups was performed.

Results

Beam walk test results demonstrated the craniectomy group had a statistically higher contralateral footfault slip/step ratio when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Comparison of the control group and the cranioplasty group demonstrated contralateral footfault slip/step ratio that was statistically different for 7 days postoperative but no statistical differences thereafter. Comparison of the craniectomy group and the cranioplasty group demonstrated statistically significant differences for 14 days; however, motor deficits were not statistically different than baseline thereafter. No ipsilateral footfault deficits were detected in this study.

Conclusion

Motor deficits that are attributed to hemi-craniectomy bone defects alone are demonstrated in a mouse animal model. These motor deficits resemble some symptoms associated with human syndrome of the trephined.

Based on these clinical findings, an "a priori" SoT was diagnosed. CT imaging at 10 weeks showed the craniectomy site's sinking appearance, paradoxical deviation of midline structures (red arrow), slit third ventricle, and AHLV (white arrowheads). D Cranioplasty was performed at week 11, resolving the radiologic signs of SoT and orthostatism. After cranioplasty, the motor function returned to baseline, consciousness improved (GCS 14), and the patient started to communicate in writing.

Lastly, we included the radiologic signs of ipsilateral hemorrhagic lesion defined as a composite variable of bleeding in the leptomeningeal compartment either pre- or post-craniectomy procedure: intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, blossoming contusion, or hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke (Fig. 1). Subdural and epidural hemorrhages were not included as being outside pial and subarachnoid space they would not affect the perivascular drainage pathways. All measurements were obtained using the Osirix software (Pixmeo Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland).

### Sinking skin flap syndrome: a case of improved cerebral blood flow after cranioplasty [^116JJHAY]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Sinking skin flap syndrome is defined as a series of neurologic symptoms with the skin depression at the site of cranial defect, which develop several weeks to months after large external cerebral decompression. The case of a 28-year-old female with the sinking skin flap syndrome is reported together with the evaluation of cerebral blood flow using xenon computed tomography (CT). Although her general condition stabilized within 7 months after the injury, the skin of the bilateral temporal regions was markedly depressed due to large bone defects. She was confined to bed and showed reduced levels of consciousness. We decided to treat this case by performing cranioplasty with a hydroxyapatite ceramic implant. Not only were good cranial contour reconstructed after cranioplasty, but neurologic conditions were also improved after cranioplasty. Regarding the change in cerebral blood flow in the present case, as measured with xenon CT, the cerebral blood flow 3 days after the injury was 18.7 ± 12.3 mL/100 mL/min and 26.5 ± 11.6 mL/100 mL/min in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. After the bilateral cranioplasty, it had increased by approximately 2-fold to 36.4 ± 23.2 mL/100 mL/min in the left hemisphere and approximately 1.5-fold to 43.8 ± 23.3 mL/100 mL/min in the right hemisphere as compared with the levels obtained 3 days after the injury. Therefore, xenon CT appears to be useful in the monitoring of regional cerebral blood flow in patients with cranial bone defects that are directly affected by atmospheric pressure and in predicting functional prognosis. For the sinking skin flap syndrome cases, cranioplasty is not only useful for cerebral protection and improvement of appearance, but cranioplasty is also useful for improving neurologic symptoms.

### Cranioplasty complications in severe traumatic brain injury: implications of timing of surgery, implant material and incidence of vetriculomegaly versus post-traumatic hydrocephalus [^115au8Wy]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Background Despite the increasing number of decompressive craniectomy (DC) in neurotrauma, the optimal timing for elective cranioplasty (CP) is still debated. Little is known about the CP complications related to surgery, implant material, and post-traumatic hydrocephalus. Objectives To explore the correlation between CP timing, implant material, and the incidence of postoperative complications in patients undergoing CP after DC for severe head injuries. Materials and methods A retrospective multicenter study was conducted from January 2010 to December 2021 across 9 European neurosurgical centers. A cohort of 4007 patients who underwent CP following DC for severe head injury was analyzed. Timing was categorized as: ultra-early (< 30 days), early (31–90 days), late (> 90 days). Complications were defined according to Clavien-Dindo classification, requiring revision surgery and/or hospital readmissions. Results Among the 4007 patients, 352 (8.8%) had ultra-early CP, 1627 (40.5%), and 2028 (51.7%) had early and late CP respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derangement was more frequently associated with large defects and the incidence of Sinking Skin Flap Syndrome (SSFS). SSFS was more frequently diagnosed in patients undergoing late surgery whereas hydrocephalus and epilepsy were less frequently encountered in the ultra-early and early groups (p < 0,05). The overall complication rate was 24.6% (985 patients) including internal hydrocephalus (20%), infection (18%), external hydrocephalus (15%), epilepsy (15%), acute extradural (14%) or subdural hematomas (10%), and subdural hygroma (8%). CP stabilized CSF derangement in 80% of cases, which did not progress into overt hydrocephalus, whereas 17% with definite diagnosis of post-traumatic hydrocephalus required a Ventriculo-Peritoneal shunt (VPS). Simultaneous CP and VPS led to infections in all cases, regardless of implant material. Conclusion Surgery timing has a greater impact on CP complications than implant material. CSF derangement represents the single most relevant factor influencing the clinical course of patients undergoing CP.

### Use of hinge craniotomy for cerebral decompression. technical note [^115jjEK5]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Decompressive craniectomy to relieve cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension due to traumatic brain injury is a generally accepted practice; however, the procedure remains controversial because of its uncertain effects on outcome, specific complications such as the syndrome of the sinking skin flap, and the need for subsequent cranioplasty. The authors developed a novel craniotomy technique using titanium bone plates in a hinged fashion, which maintains cerebral protection while reducing postoperative complications and eliminating subsequent cranioplasty procedures. The authors conducted a retrospective review of data obtained in all consecutive patients who had undergone posttraumatic cerebral decompression craniotomy using the hinge technique at a Level I trauma facility between 1990 and 2004. Twenty-five patients, most of whom were male (88%) and Caucasian (88%) with a mean age of 38.2 ± 16.1 years, underwent the hinge craniotomy. The in-hospital mortality rate was 48%, and good cerebral decompression was achieved. None of the patients required surgery for flap replacement. Long-term follow-up data showed that one patient required subsequent cranioplasty due to infection and one patient presented with cranial deformities. None of the patients presented with bone resorption or sinking flap syndrome. The hinge technique effectively prevents procedure-related morbidity and the need for subsequent surgical bone replacement otherwise introduced by traditional decompressive craniectomy. A randomized controlled trial is required to substantiate these findings.

### Orthostatic mesodiencephalic dysfunction after decompressive craniectomy [^115vVysx]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

An extreme syndrome of the trephined after decompressive craniectomy is reported here. The most extensive clinical syndrome observed was established over 4 weeks and consisted of bradypsychia, dysartria, and limb rigidity with equine varus feet predominating on the right. The syndrome was aggravated when the patient was sitting with the sequential appearance over minutes of a typical parkinsonian levodopa-resistant tremor starting on the right side, extending to all four limbs, followed by diplopia resulting from a left abducens nerve palsy followed by a left-sided mydriasis. All signs recovered within 1–2 h after horizontalisation. It was correlated with an orthostatic progressive sinking of the skin flap, MRI and CT scan mesodiencephalic distortion without evidence of parenchymal lesion. Brain stem auditory evoked potential wave III latency increases were observed on the right side on verticalisation of the patient. EEG exploration excluded any epileptic activity. Symptoms were fully recovered within 2 days after cranioplasty was performed. The cranioplasty had to be removed twice due to infection. Bradypsychia, speech fluency, limb rigidity and tremor reappeared within a week after removal of the prosthesis. While waiting for sterilisation of the operative site, the symptoms were successfully prevented by a custom-made transparent suction-cup helmet before completion of cranioplasty.

Effect of cranioplasty on neurologic symptoms and disability

All SoT patients improved in motor and cognitive function within 4 days after the cranioplasty confirming the SoT diagnosis. In contrast, Honeybul et al. reported a 16% improvement rate in patients undergoing cranioplasty. However, their cohort did not include patients with worsening neurologic status before the cranioplasty (i.e. "a priori" SoT), arguably representing less severe SoT cases. According to the literature, the delay to improvement observed after cranioplasty varies from 1 to 4 days. There is also evidence suggesting that cerebral perfusion abnormalities improve in a similar timeframe. As a result, evaluating neurologic symptoms within 4 days in this study was considered optimal for increasing the SoT detection sensitivity.

Our results revealed that neurologic improvement after cranioplasty in SoT patients led to a significant improvement in the quality of life (i.e. decreased disability) and a shift towards good neurologic outcome. This study adds to the growing body of literature on the positive impact of cranioplasty on neurologic recovery.

### Clinical and patient-reported outcome after patient-specific 3D printer-assisted cranioplasty [^116j6rLA]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 31 consecutive adult patients (n = 17 male, 54.8%) with a mean age of 51.9 (± 16) years (range 22–90 years). The most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension (n = 10, 32.3%), epilepsy (n = 7, 22.6%), and cerebrovascular insult (n = 5, 16.1%). The most common preoperative symptoms were hemiparesis (45.2%), visual disturbance (12.9%), visible indentation around the bone defect (12.9%), and symptom constellations like matching sinking skin flap syndrome (9.7%). Seventeen patients (54.8%) had a preoperative mRS of between 0 and 2, and 27 patients (87.1%) had a GCS between 13 and 15 points (Table 1).

The indication for patient-specific 3D printer-assisted cranioplasty was mainly due to prior infection (45.2%), unavailability due to tumor infiltration (19.4%), or due to resorption of the autologous bone flap (19.4%). Patient-specific 3D printer-assisted cranioplasty was used to reconstruct a frontotemporoparietal defect in 19 cases (61.3%), a frontotemporal with orbital involvement in six cases (19.4%), a frontotemporal defect without orbital involvement in four cases (12.9%), and a bifrontal defect in two cases (6.5%) (Table 1).

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^114kaYM9]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury decompressive craniectomy — evidence gaps are highlighted, noting that the optimal time to perform bone flap replacement (cranioplasty) is insufficiently understood at present. Current literature predominantly relates to secondary decompressive craniectomy (DC), in which the bone flap is removed in a delayed fashion to treat refractory elevation of intracranial pressure, whereas a paucity of literature informs primary DC defined as leaving the bone flap off after initial mass lesion surgery; the ongoing RESCUE-SDH randomized controlled trial is hoped to help inform performance of primary DC with high-quality data.

Size, Shape, and Dura

Surgical decision making for DC includes the size of the decompression, anatomical location, handling of the dura, use of adjuncts, and postoperative ICP monitoring. One multicenter and one single-center RCT evaluated the effects of the size of DC. Both studies compared unilateral frontotemporoparietal craniectomy standard trauma craniectomy (STC) with a bone flap size of 12 × 15 cm to a limited smaller (LC) temporoparietal craniectomy (8 × 6 cm). Frontotemporoparietal craniectomy was found to be associated with lower mortality (26.2%) compared with LC (35.1%; p < 0.05), with favorable GOS outcomes at 6 months in 39.8% of STC patients compared with 28.6% of LC patients (p = 0.05), and 12-month favorable outcomes of 56.8% and 32.4%, respectively (p = 0.035).– Frontotemporoparietal craniectomy was associated with larger ICP reduction and lower rates of postoperative hematoma and subdural effusion. The 2020 BTF guidelines recommend a large rather than small STC DC (not less than 12 × 15 cm or 15 cm in diameter) for reducing mortality in patients with severe TBI. For both bifrontal and unilateral hemicraniectomy, the relative risks and benefits are an important gap in knowledge. A working hypothesis is that DC should be tailored to intracranial pathology in a personalized manner, that is, bifrontal DC might be better suited for patients with bifrontal/bitemporal contusions and bilateral brain edema and no midline shift. In contrast, a unilateral hemicraniectomy may benefit patients with lesions (extra-axial or parenchymal) predominantly in one hemisphere, with midline shift. Importantly, the skin incision should be larger than the intended size of the craniectomy, and the pinna should be avoided. The bone flap size should be large, and the dura should be widely opened. The optimal materials for duraplasty, the necessity of sutured expansile duroplasty, the method of bone flap storage, and the removal (or not) of bone overlying the superior sagittal sinus when performing bifrontal DC remain areas for further research. An RCT found no difference in sutured duraplasty versus nonsutured duraplasty in wound dehiscence, 10/69 versus 4/37, respectively (p = 0.766), or in surgical site infection, 6/69 versus 2/37, respectively (p = 0.710).

### Thiopental and decompressive craniectomy as last-tier ICP-treatments in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: is functional recovery within reach? [^112A5yL7]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

ICP-treatments – step 4

Primary DC without ICP monitoring was done early in case of severe mass effect/perioperative brain swelling in association with surgical clipping (usually after the simultaneous evacuation of an ICH). Secondary DC was a last-tier treatment and performed if any of these four indications were met: (i) midline shift, but no significant ICH to evacuate (thiopental contraindicated), (ii) elevated ICP despite thiopental treatment, (iii) adverse effects of thiopental, and (iv) the patient was judged not to tolerate thiopental (patients with high risk of severe adverse events and multiple organ failure, e.g. older adults and patients with respiratory, circulatory, and kidney failure or more severe infections). However, DC was withheld for patients with extreme ICP elevation (above 50 mmHg) who did not respond to thiopental with severe brain injuries on imaging, when functional recovery was considered beyond reach. The DC of choice was hemi-DC if there was a lateralized brain injury/swelling with midline shift. A bifrontal DC was performed in the event of diffuse, bilateral brain swelling when no midline shift was present, sparing a bone ridge in the midline, if the patients did not tolerate or respond to thiopental infusion. In all cases, the aim was to maximize decompression by removing a large bone flap combined with duraplasty.

Cranioplasty

Following DC, cranioplasty (CP) was scheduled 3 months after DC, but often occurred later due to long waiting lists. Autologous bone flaps from the DC were saved and stored in a – 70 °C freezer until CP. For long waiting times for CP, a synthetic implant was used, based on the decision of the responsible neurosurgeon.

### Advances in management of subdural effusion after decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury [^116q9R8w]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Subdural effusion is a common complication after decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury. While many cases are asymptomatic and resolve with conservative management, some patients develop significant mass effect, leading to elevated intracranial pressure, midline shift, and clinical worsening, which may require surgery. Current treatment strategies vary widely, with no established consensus. This paper reviews the pathogenesis, diagnosis, classification, and management of subdural effusion to guide clinical decision-making and improve outcomes following decompressive craniectomy.

### Syndrome of the trephined: clinical spectrum, risk factors, and impact of cranioplasty on neurologic recovery in a prospective cohort [^113oUNXp]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Does timing of the cranioplasty improve neurologic recovery?

We found an association between improved neurologic recovery and shorter delays to cranioplasty. Although our results are in line with the emerging evidence that cranioplasty may improve neurologic function, and earlier cranioplasty may enhance this effect, the question of optimal timing for cranioplasty procedure remains a complex issue. Multiple factors are at play when determining the optimal timing. One of them, addressed in our study, is the resolution of brain swelling giving place to successfully restore the skull integrity.

Our study results suggest a potential window of opportunity to perform cranioplasty as early as two weeks after the craniectomy as soon as the brain swelling resides. Potential benefits from cranioplasty, such as improved postural blood flow, cerebrovascular reserve capacity, cerebral metabolism, and CSF flow, offer compelling arguments in favor of an earlier cranioplasty. In line with these previous studies, intracranial pressure monitoring studies showed that cranioplasty restored the physiological intracranial pressure dynamics during changes from supine to vertical position. Thus, earlier cranioplasty could improve the aptitude to perform rehabilitation activities in a physiologic vertical position. However, to fully understand the equation for optimal cranioplasty timing, multiple variables have to be considered, such as the cranioplasty-related complications, risk of infection, role of post-traumatic hydrocephalus, over-drainage related to ventriculoperitoneal shunting, pre-cranioplasty morbidity, bleeding diathesis, and conditions related to the initial etiology for a craniectomy.

The evidence for complication risk regarding the timing of cranioplasty is conflicting. In our clinical experience, cranioplasty is often performed three or more months after DC. Some authors suggest that delaying the cranioplasty beyond 2 or even 6 months after DC may reduce the risk of complications and surgical site infections. Contrary to these findings, a meta-analysis of 18 studies and 2254 patients did not show any difference in infection rates when cranioplasty was performed earlier or later than three months after DC. Another meta-analysis of 1209 patients confirmed similar infectious and hemorrhagic complication rates regardless of timing. However, they also found an increased risk of hydrocephalus in the early cranioplasty group (relative risk 2.67, 95% CI 1.24–5.73), highlighting the complex relation of CSF circulation and the timing of cranioplasty.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^111zqkHb]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Decompressive craniectomy in severe traumatic brain injury — treatment of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation is central to management. The volume of the intracranial contents often increases after traumatic brain injury from hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and hydrocephalus, leading to herniation. An increase in volume within the rigid skull can increase ICP leading to a compartment syndrome which impedes or reverses the blood flow to the brain, and the ensuing cerebral ischemia can ultimately result in disability or death. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is the temporary removal of a large portion of skull used to treat ICP elevation; primary DC occurs when the bone flap is not replaced after an intracranial mass lesion is evacuated early after a head trauma, while secondary DC involves removal of the bone flap later in the patient's course to treat the elevation of ICP refractory to other treatments.

### Syndrome of the trephined: clinical spectrum, risk factors, and impact of cranioplasty on neurologic recovery in a prospective cohort [^1126JpbF]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of the trephined (SoT) is an underrecognized complication after decompressive craniectomy. We aimed to investigate SoT incidence, clinical spectrum, risk factors, and the impact of the cranioplasty on neurologic recovery. Patients undergoing a large craniectomy (> 80 cm²) and cranioplasty were prospectively evaluated using modified Rankin score (mRS), cognitive (attention/processing speed, executive function, language, visuospatial), motor (Motricity Index, Jamar dynamometer, postural score, gait assessment), and radiologic evaluation within four days before and after a cranioplasty. The primary outcome was SoT, diagnosed when a neurologic improvement was observed after the cranioplasty. The secondary outcome was a good neurologic outcome (mRS 0–3) 4 days and 90 days after the cranioplasty. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors for SoT and the impact of cranioplasty timing on neurologic recovery. We enrolled 40 patients with a large craniectomy; 26 (65%) developed SoT and improved after the cranioplasty. Brain trauma, hemorrhagic lesions, and shifting of brain structures were associated with SoT. After cranioplasty, a shift towards a good outcome was observed within 4 days (p = 0.025) and persisted at 90 days (p = 0.005). Increasing delay to cranioplasty was associated with decreased odds of improvement when adjusting for age and baseline disability (odds ratio 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99, p = 0.012). In conclusion, SoT is frequent after craniectomy and interferes with neurologic recovery. High suspicion of SoT should be exercised in patients who fail to progress or have a previous trauma, hemorrhage, or shifting of brain structures. Performing the cranioplasty earlier was associated with improved and quantifiable neurologic recovery.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^115JscPd]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Outcomes and decision-making — decompressive craniectomy (DC) for severe TBI — are framed around what constitutes acceptable (or "good") recovery and aligning care with patient values. The text states that this debate centers on "what constitutes acceptable (or 'good') neurological recovery", that "different cultures, families, and patients define what is meaningful function and what makes life worth living differently", and that "decision-makers familiar with patients' values and preferences should be provided with the best information available and included in clinical decision making". Practice impact is also noted: "Anecdotal evidence suggests that these new RCTs have not markedly changed practice. DC continues to be performed", and despite advances it "remains hard to accurately predict outcomes for an individual patient".

### Optimal timing of cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy: timing or collapse ratio [^113obY6W]. Operative Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This retrospective study aimed to identify predictors of overall complications after CP to determine the procedure's optimal timing. Patients were classified into complication and noncomplication groups based on the occurrence of complications. Our findings suggest that the collapse ratio is an independent predictor of overall postoperative complications.

Decompression craniotomy is a frequently performed neurosurgical procedure involving the temporary removal of a portion of the skull to accommodate brain swelling, facilitate exposure for intracranial surgery, and effectively treat conditions such as brain tumors, intracerebral hematomas, aneurysms, and subdural hematomas. This technique not only reduces intracranial pressure but is also crucial in managing severe intracranial hypertension or impending cerebral herniation. However, post-DC, the equilibrium between brain tissue, CSF, and blood is disrupted due to the absence of part of the skull, potentially leading to decreased intracranial pressure. This condition can result in motor, cognitive, and language deficits associated with trephine syndromeand aesthetic concerns. Consequently, survivors of DC often undergo CP, which significantly enhances neural function and cognitive abilities by improving cerebral blood perfusion.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^112wmVEV]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury decompressive craniectomy — updated Level IIA recommendations state: Secondary decompressive craniectomy (DC) performed for late refractory intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation is recommended to improve mortality and favorable outcomes. Secondary DC performed for early refractory ICP elevation is not recommended to improve mortality and favorable outcomes. A large frontotemporoparietal DC (not less than 12 × 15 cm or 15 cm in diameter) is recommended over a small frontotemporoparietal DC for reduced mortality and improved neurological outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). For ICP control, secondary DC, performed as a treatment for either early or late refractory ICP elevation, is suggested to reduce ICP and duration of intensive care, though the relationship between these effects and favorable outcome is uncertain. Recommendation #2 should not be extrapolated to primary DC in which the bone flap is left off when an intracranial mass lesion is evacuated early after injury.

Results

Cohort characteristics

Of 40 patients included in the analysis, 26 (65%) improved motor or cognitive function after the cranioplasty and were diagnosed with SoT. Fourteen patients (35%) developed clinically appreciable neurologic symptoms before the cranioplasty and improved within 4 days after the cranioplasty, termed "a priori" SoT, whereas twelve (30%) patients presented with failure to progress during the rehabilitation but improved within 4 days after the cranioplasty and were considered "a posteriori" SoT. The mean delay to cranioplasty was 112.8 ± 35.4 days. Table 1 presents the univariate comparison of clinical and imaging characteristics between SoT and non-SoT groups. There was a strong association between SoT and ipsilateral hemorrhagic lesions (p = 0.004) and shifting of brain structure (p < 0.001). There was also a weak association between SoT and TBI and an inverse association with ischemic stroke, although it did not maintain statistical significance after the FDR correction. Two patients, both in the SoT group, required placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt for post-traumatic hydrocephalus prior to cranioplasty. The material used for cranioplasty did not differ between the groups and was autologous bone in 33 (82.5%), polyetheretherketone implant in 6 (15%), and titanium plating in 1 (2.5%).

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^116LJqTd]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Expert opinion — decompressive craniectomy (DC) in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) — indicates that DC remains a treatment option but "should not be applied indiscriminately", with additional efforts to assess the likelihood of positive outcomes prior to DC. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging may reveal lesions predicting lack of benefit, and patients with evidence of "good" brain function who decline as a direct consequence of intracranial pressure elevation are described as likely the best candidates for decompression. The group emphasized longer-term outcome measures aligned with improvements "from 6 to 24 mo postinjury" and noted DC is "a tier 3 treatment option" in SIBICC management algorithms. Evidence also supports that DC "reduces ICP", and that DC of "insufficient size is associated with poor outcomes", and recent consensus concluded both bifrontal and lateral decompressions are reasonable to perform.

### Visual cognition in disorders of consciousness: from V1 to top-down attention [^1173svtA]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

What is it like to be at the lower boundaries of consciousness? Disorders of consciousness such as coma, the vegetative state, and the minimally conscious state are among the most mysterious and least understood conditions of the human brain. Particularly complicated is the assessment of residual cognitive functioning and awareness for diagnostic, rehabilitative, legal, and ethical purposes. In this article, we present a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging exploration of visual cognition in a patient with a severe disorder of consciousness. This battery of tests, first developed in healthy volunteers, assesses increasingly complex transformations of visual information along a known caudal to rostral gradient from occipital to temporal cortex. In the first five levels, the battery assesses (passive) processing of light, color, motion, coherent shapes, and object categories (i.e., faces, houses). At the final level, the battery assesses the ability to voluntarily deploy visual attention in order to focus on one of two competing stimuli. In the patient, this approach revealed appropriate brain activations, undistinguishable from those seen in healthy and aware volunteers. In addition, the ability of the patient to focus one of two competing stimuli, and switch between them on command, also suggests that he retained the ability to access, to some degree, his own visual representations.

### Preoperative brain shift is a prognostic factor for survival in certain neurosurgical diseases other than severe head injury: a case series and literature review [^115vyPrb]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In neurosurgical patients, brain shift on neuroradiological imaging is a key sign in surgical decision-making. The first paper dealing with brain shift in intraparenchymal or subdural hematomas or large middle cerebral artery stroke determined that its progressive increase decreases the level of consciousness, up to deep coma. This result has been confirmed, and a larger mean shift is associated with poor outcomes. The significant value of this measurement to outcomes in severe brain injury has been demonstrated repeatedly.

Whether brain shift significantly affects outcomes in other neurosurgical diseases is unclear. Such information could indicate prompt surgical treatment or timely conduct in diseases exhibiting the same brain shift measure. Besides, we daily observe radiological reports lacking brain shift measures or having an overestimated shift missing any anatomic level. This deficiency may either push the neurosurgeon to delay treatment or prompt an emergency procedure, regardless of the patient's neurological condition. This study aimed to evaluate a standard anatomical level at which to measure brain shift and the prognostic value of brain shift in neurosurgical diseases other than a severe head injury that exert a mass effect, in order to compel the routine inclusion of brain shift measurement in radiological reports and neurosurgical practice.

### CSF disturbances and other neurosurgical complications after interdisciplinary reconstructions of large combined scalp and skull deficiencies [^113VP1Jq]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

The risk of treatment failure, focusing on neurosurgical complications such as CSF disturbances with influence on microvascular free flap acceptance has been reported previously in one case report in 2017. Here, the negative pressure gradients cause substantial flap sinking or melting. Flap failure was indeed observed in our cohort in 5 cases, but not directly related to CSF disturbances. To our knowledge, complications related to CSF circulation disorders have otherwise not been reported yet.

In total, 8 patients developed a hydrocephalus after scalp and skull reconstruction with free flap transfer, while patients with local axial flaps had complications with preexisting shunts such as clotting or sudden changes in pressure gradients but did not develop a new hydrocephalus. Patients undergoing reconstructive surgery for complex composite defects are indeed at an increased risk of deep postoperative infection and CSF leaks, but the new onset of CSF disturbances with the need of surgical treatment and VP-shunting have not been described so far. Long-term outcomes and neurosurgical pathologies are often underreported in studies on reconstructive techniques, and recurrent CSF leaks may be correlated to undetected hydrocephalus, but we lack detailed information in current literature.

Unfortunately, long-term results including the neurological outcome and ventricle width are often understated in publications, and studies report only on flap loss or wound revisions. After an extensive search, we did not find any literature on CSF disturbances and reconstructive techniques in skull and scalp deficiencies, or information on the placement and need of external ventricular drains. Also, information on the occurrence of ventriculitis with antibiotic administration is not mentioned in manuscripts focusing on the success of scalp and skull reconstruction.

Unfortunately, we did not identify the underlying cause of a new hydrocephalus onset in patients undergoing skull reconstruction. Several authors discussed possible etiologies leading to CSF resorption problems. A suggested cause could be an impairment of the glymphatic system, ventricular squeezing, or reduced arterial pulsations due to arachnoiditis or arteriopathy. Unfortunately, we did not perform specific MRI imaging or metabolic analysis to test for the described hypothesis.

### Imaging for the diagnosis and management of traumatic brain injury [^111bDweN]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Children are particularly susceptible to diffuse cerebral swelling following TBI, with the incidence of diffuse swelling being approximately twofold higher in children than in adults. Children and young adults are more prone to post-traumatic dysautoregulation, which leads to vasodilatation, hyperemia, and cerebral swelling. When swelling is severe, ICP increases and CPP falls, resulting in infarction and cerebral damage.

Medical strategies to combat the deleterious effects of cerebral swelling and lower ICP include head elevation, moderate hyperventilation, hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol, and the appropriate use of sedatives and analgesics (barbiturates) to prevent pain or agitation from exacerbating elevated ICP. However, when ICP is refractory to maximal medical therapy, decompressive craniectomy has been used in an attempt to lower ICP. Studies on the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy generally suggest that it can lower ICP and may improve functional outcome. Decompressive craniectomy also results in radiologic improvement, with better visualization of basilar cisterns and decreased midline shift, both of which correlate with improved outcome. However, the specific clinical criteria and context for decompressive surgery have yet to be established.

### Local coverage for acute severely herniated brain using scalp and forehead flaps in a pediatric patient with head trauma [^113CxrGj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old-boy required emergent craniectomy and drainage of a large right-sided acute subdural hematoma after head trauma, during which massive sinus hemorrhage with brain swelling occurred. Acute intraoperative management entailed dural cover using synthetic dural membrane substitute and scalp coverage over the herniated brain using acellular dermal matrix. After intensive monitoring and control of raised intracranial pressure over the next few days, the exposed brain was then covered by scalp and forehead flaps with cadaveric skin grafting to the donor site. This temporary coverage continued until adequate resolution of the intracranial swelling and control of the hydrocephalus using a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Ultimately, the flaps were derotated and the craniectomy site was reconstructed with autologous banked bone. The child had a significant functional recovery with some residual left-sided weakness. This case is the first report of local tissue flaps used for temporary coverage of malignant brain herniation in a pediatric head trauma patient and highlights their effective use. Through serial surgical procedures the brain was successfully covered without significant blood loss and the patient's local tissues returned to their original donor sites with good cosmetic outcome, without sacrifice of the patient's own skin or free flap options.

Methods

This is a single center, prospective, observational study performed at Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo University, Brazil. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee, in May/23/2017 (REB register 66721217.0.0000.0068) and registered under number NCT03144219 (available at ClinicalTrials.gov). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, and informed consent was obtained from all legally authorized representatives or next of kin instead of the patients because of illness severity.

Participants and Protocol

The inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of ABI within 5 days of hospital admission submitted to ICP monitoring according to the guidelines of the Brain Trauma Foundation for patients with traumatic brain injury and tomographic evaluation in the case of nontraumatic patients. Exclusion criteria were absence of TCD acoustic windows, neurological examination indicative of brain death, and absence of informed consent. Computed tomography (CT) scans, performed within 24 h prior or posterior to inclusion, were assessed to separate patients in groups according to injury severity, corresponding to the following: no skull opening group (Sk1), surgical mass evacuation group (Sk2), and primary decompressive craniectomy (DC) group (Sk3). Decision for surgical management was performed according to the local institutional neurosurgical guidelines. Nevertheless, surgical management was based either on the presence of mass lesions greater than 30 cm³, midline shift more than 0.5 cm, or imminent risk of herniation in the case of severe brain swelling on admission CT scans. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected at the day of study inclusion.

### Disorders of consciousness: responding to requests for novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions [^115eUSWD]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Severe brain injury can leave patients with chronic disorders of consciousness. Because of impaired responsiveness, many of these patients have traditionally been regarded as unaware. However, findings from recent clinical studies herald a potential paradigm shift: functional imaging and neurophysiological studies have identified ways to assess awareness and have revealed astounding cases of awareness despite clinical unresponsiveness. Hence, diagnostic classifications have been rewritten, prognostic knowledge is improving, and therapeutic studies have regained momentum, showing for the first time some therapeutic effects on responsiveness. Clinicians must increasingly respond to requests by patients' families and surrogate decision makers to use novel techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, and in doing so several ethical and social issues need to be considered. Such requests provide an opportunity for clinicians to learn about patients' values and preferences and to maintain clinical acumen for changes in patient status with the patients' best interests in mind.

### Syndrome of the trephined: clinical spectrum, risk factors, and impact of cranioplasty on neurologic recovery in a prospective cohort [^116Vyd3w]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Although known for almost a century, the pathophysiology and risk factors predisposing to SoT are largely unknown; as a result, SoT prediction remains challenging. Furthermore, many patients improve after cranioplasty without previous clinical worsening, possibly due to a recovery impediment caused by insidious and underreported forms of SoT. Although emerging evidence suggests that earlier cranioplasty may improve the recovery of neurologic function, it remains unclear whether the improvement is related to insidious forms of SoT. Diagnostic methods allowing an early diagnosis of SoT and a better risk stratification are needed to inform clinical care and improve neurologic recovery.

To better understand the actual incidence and risk factors of SoT and assess the impact of cranioplasty timing on neurologic recovery, we performed a prospective observational study. We aimed to (1) evaluate the neurologic function immediately before and after the cranioplasty, (2) compare clinical and radiologic variables between patients with and without SoT, and (3) evaluate the association between the cranioplasty timing and improvement of disability immediately after the procedure.

### Severe cerebral edema following nivolumab treatment for pediatric glioblastoma: case report [^1146JVPY]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of glioblastoma. The authors present the case of a 10-year-old girl with glioblastoma treated with nivolumab under compassionate-use guidelines. After the first dose of nivolumab the patient developed hemiparesis, cerebral edema, and significant midline shift due to severe tumor necrosis. She was managed using intravenous dexamethasone and discharged on a dexamethasone taper. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated after the second dose of nivolumab, demonstrating hemiplegia, seizures, and eventually unresponsiveness with a fixed and dilated left pupil. Computed tomography of her brain revealed malignant cerebral edema requiring emergency decompressive hemicraniectomy. Repeat imaging demonstrated increased size of the lesion, reflecting immune-mediated inflammation and tumor necrosis. The patient remained densely hemiplegic, but became progressively more interactive and was ultimately extubated. She resumed nivolumab several weeks later, but again her condition deteriorated with headache, vomiting, swelling at the craniectomy site, and limited right-sided facial movement following the sixth dose. MRI demonstrated severe midline shift and uncal herniation despite her craniectomy. Her condition gradually declined, and she died several days later under "do not resuscitate/do not intubate" orders.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^111wuvde]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerebral edema, more specifically with respect to patients with traumatic brain injury, BTF 2017 guidelines recommend to do not perform bifrontal decompressive craniectomy as a means to improve outcomes in patients with severe and diffuse traumatic brain injury (without mass lesions), although recognizing that this procedure is effective to reduce ICP and may decrease ICU length of stay.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^113udTFk]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Changes from prior edition — 2017 Level IIA recommendations and current actions are as follows. Bifrontal DC is not recommended to improve outcomes as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months post-injury in severe TBI patients with diffuse injury (without mass lesions), and with ICP elevation to values > 20 mm Hg for more than 15 minutes within a 1-h period that are refractory to first-tier therapies; however, this procedure has been demonstrated to reduce ICP and to minimize days in the intensive care unit (ICU). The second 2017 recommendation stated that a large frontotemporoparietal DC (not less than 12 × 15 cm or 15 cm diameter) is recommended over a small frontotemporoparietal DC for reduced mortality and improved neurological outcomes in patients with severe TBI. In the update, the authors state that we have removed the first recommendation and restated the second and that they also provide 3 new level-IIA recommendations.

### Midline shift is unrelated to subjective pupillary reactivity assessment on admission in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury [^113NiD11]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between pupillary reactivity and midline shift and basal cistern status on admission brain CT in TBI. Any mechanistic interaction between these factors is likely to relate to the effect of raised ICP due to supra-tentorial mass effect driving brainstem compression. The relationship between basal cistern effacement and raised ICP is well supported. Similarly, past studies have generally — though not always — demonstrated an associative relationship between ICP and midline shift, though the extent of this relationship is likely to depend on the nature and location of the lesion, brain tissue compliance, and interhemispheric pressure gradients.

A direct relationship between pupillary reactivity and midline shift, an imaging marker of supra-tentorial mass effect, is not borne out in our data. A statistically significant difference between mean midline shifts among patients with different pupillary reactivity categories was found only for patients with at least one unreactive pupil compared to normal pupils. On logistic regression, midline shift fails to reach formal statistical significance for as a predictor of abnormal or bilaterally unreactive pupils, though trends toward it for the former. Inclusion of age and basal cistern appearance in multiple regression models causes midline shift to lose predictive significance entirely. As such, our results demonstrate no robust statistical evidence that midline shift is independently associated with pupillary reactivity. The results when extremes of age (> 50) were excluded were similar to the entire amalgamated cohort, though the impact of age is still unclear as this study is likely underpowered to detect meaningful differences between age groups.

### Early postoperative serum S100 beta levels predict ongoing brain damage after meningioma surgery: a prospective observational study [^11189vHj]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Serum S100β levels perform poorly as an indicator of tumour characteristics for patients with meningiomas.

- Significant increases in serum S100β levels occur after neurosurgery prior to patient capability to undergo complex clinical neurological testing.

- Higher immediate postcraniotomy serum S100β levels correlate with eventual postoperative deterioration in performance of the MMSE.

- Persistently elevated postoperative levels of serum S100β (24 to 48 hours after craniotomy) are associated with postoperative CT scan evidence of bleeding, edema, and midline shift.

### Thiopental and decompressive craniectomy as last-tier ICP-treatments in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: is functional recovery within reach? [^116MgqMb]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Thiopental and DC patients showed a more severe primary brain injury, as indicated by a higher WFNS grade, a higher frequency of unreactive pupils, and a greater amount of blood on the initial CT. These patients also suffered more complications (e.g. rebleeding and DIND). In many cases, secondary and primary brain injury probably contributed to the refractory intracranial hypertension. The patients were also younger, which meant less brain atrophy and thus an even smaller additional volume could create ICP problems. Moreover, it probably reflects a lower threshold to proceed with aggressive treatments in younger patients because of a better chance of recovery.

Before thiopental and DC, the patients showed severe intracranial hypertension, as indicated by the radiological variables and the ICP monitoring data. Specifically, the thiopental patients showed signs of a global mass effect with compressed/obliterated cisterns and convexity sulci, but with limited midline shift. In contrast, DC patients also had a severe midline shift before treatment. These findings were consistent with our management protocol, i.e. not to use thiopental treatment but to proceed with DC if a significant midline shift has occurred. Thiopental was used in the progressive development of ICP situations when the patients were deemed treatable with relatively good chances and in situations when the likelihood of successful treatment was low but worth trying. Thiopental was also occasionally used to treat rapid ICP elevations directly following rebleeding. If there were a lack of ICP response combined with severe brain injury on imaging and the medical treatment was deemed futile, a decision was made to withdraw care rather than proceed with DC. This explains the high mortality rate (nearly two-thirds during NIC) in the thiopental cohort. This also explains why the variables of mass effect on imaging worsened, and ICP did not improve after thiopental in the entire cohort. Against this background, we analyzed surviving thiopental cases separately, and excluding fatal cases showed that ICP declined significantly as expected. It was also noteworthy that, although the favorable outcome rate was only 10% in the entire thiopental group, 28% of the survivors had a favorable neurological outcome. It should also be emphasized that in cases when thiopental did not relieve ICP and the brain injury was not considered too severe, a DC was performed to alleviate the intracranial hypertension.

### Feasibility study of endoscopic surgery for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with large hematoma: a comparison with craniotomy using propensity score matching analysis [^114KpJ98]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The debate over the surgical treatment of ICH remains unresolved, with no current consensus. Surgery theoretically offers several benefits, including hematoma evacuation, alleviation of mass effect, relief of neurological compression symptoms, improved perfusion, and reduction of secondary injury. These advantages have made surgery a common clinical practice. However, large clinical studies such as Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH) and the STICH II have not demonstrated significant benefits of surgical treatment for patients with ICH. Notably, these studies excluded some critically ill cases. However, surgery could potentially save lives and improve prognoses in this subgroup. Currently, there is a scarcity of studies specifically analyzing surgical treatments, particularly endoscopic surgery, in critically ill patients with ICH with large hematomas. Most existing research consists of subgroup analyses rather than comprehensive studies.

For patients with large hematomas, the mass effect and associated brain edema can elevate ICP, potentially leading to cerebral herniation and posing a life-threatening risk. The prevailing surgical approach is craniotomy for hematoma evacuation with or without decompressive craniectomy. Craniotomy effectively evacuates the hematoma, achieves hemostasis under direct vision, and reduces mortality. Decompressive craniectomy can further lower ICP following bone flap removal, significantly reduce midline shift, and provide a buffer for rebleeding and delayed edema. Research indicates that combining decompressive craniectomy with craniotomy yields better therapeutic outcomes than craniotomy alone. However, craniotomy involves excessive mechanical traction, electrocoagulation, and cauterization, which can cause huge brain injury. Additionally, the procedure is lengthy and associated with many postoperative complications. Craniectomy also alters the normal cranial structure, potentially leading to unpredictable side effects, such as subdural fluid accumulation and hydrocephalus, which may require secondary cranioplasty. These factors increase patient trauma and associated risks, rendering craniectomy a less preferred option.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116vAscG]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Craniectomy for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) synopsis — Large supratentorial ICH is often associated with clinical deterioration and elevated ICP that is refractory to medical management. This guideline is based primarily on data from small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective series, a systematic review, and a meta-analysis. As a primary recommendation, decompressive hemicraniectomy may be considered to reduce mortality in patients with supratentorial ICH who are in a coma, have large hematomas with midline shift, or have elevated ICP refractory to medical management. No clear differences have been demonstrated between decompressive hemicraniectomy with and without clot evacuation, and the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy for improving functional outcomes is uncertain.

Thiopental and decompressive craniectomy — mass effect on imaging and intracranial pressure dynamics before and after treatment

Before thiopental (Table 3), the median midline shift was 0 (IQR 0–5) mm, whereas many patients had compressed/obliterated cisterns (66%) and compressed/obliterated convexity sulci (82%). On the follow-up CT, midline shift was unchanged, but more thiopental patients exhibited compressed/obliterated cisterns (79%) or compressed/obliterated convexity sulci (84%). The median percentage of monitoring time with ICP > 20 mmHg was 38% (IQR 5–90%), and the median percentage of monitoring time of CPP < 60 mmHg was 2% (IQR 0–20%) 1 h before thiopental infusion. These variables did not significantly change on the 6th hour following infusion start (Table 3). If the 25 thiopental cases who died (24 due to severe intracranial hypertension and 1 due to circulatory arrest) during NIC were excluded from these analyses, the radiological mass effect did not increase. The median percentage of monitoring time with ICP > 20 mmHg decreased from 29% (IQR 4–82) before thiopental to 0% (IQR 0–3) after thiopental infusion.

Mass effect and cerebral physiology before and after thiopental. One of the patients treated with thiopental had no available radiological imaging pre- and postoperatively. ICP and CPP were analyzed 1 h before and between hours 5 and 6 in the group treated with thiopental infusion without DC

Before DC, the median midline shift was 10 (IQR 7–12) mm, and most patients had compressed/obliterated cisterns (90%) and compressed/obliterated convexity sulci (98%), as shown in Table 4. On the follow-up CT, the median midline shift was 2 (IQR 1–5) mm, 22% exhibited compressed/obliterated cisterns, and fewer (63%) patients had compressed/obliterated convexity sulci. Moreover, before DC, the median percentage of monitoring time of ICP > 20 mmHg was 56% (IQR 13–91%), and the median percentage of monitoring time of CPP < 60 mmHg was 5% (IQR 0–32%), which significantly improved to a median of 0% in both variables after DC (Table 4). The exclusion of seven patients (three with severe intracranial hypertension post-DC and four due to circulatory arrest after withdrawal of care) who died during NIC from these analyses did not impact the results.

Decompressive craniectomy–cranioplasty outcomes

After DC, 31 (60%) patients underwent CP: one patient refused to proceed with CP, 17 died before CP, and three were lost to follow-up as they were discharged to another neurosurgical facility (Supplementary Table 1). CP was done in a median of 7 (IQR 4–9) months post-DC, and autologous bone rather than synthetic implants was used in almost all cases (94%). Of these 31 CP patients, 13 (42%) required a re-operation: 6 (20%) underwent surgical removal of the implant due to infection, 5 (16%) due to bone resorption, and in 2 (6%) implant re-positioning was performed.

The goals are to "identify key questions, review the literature for evidence, assess and assimilate the evidence, derive recommendations, identify research gaps, and deliver the information to the brain trauma community for integration into its various activities and environments". The methods outline sections for "Systematic Evidence Review and Synthesis" and "Development of the Recommendations", with research subgroups comprising "the Methods Team and the Clinical Investigators". The review approach details scope and study selection processes including "topic refinement", "analytic frameworks", and methods such as "literature search strategies, abstract and full-text review, use of indirect evidence, use of intermediate outcomes, quality assessment of individual studies, data abstraction, synthesis, identification of subtopics and synthesis, quality of the body of evidence, and applicability". Regarding scope, topics were "primarily carried forward from the 3rd Edition", and "Two topics were added (Decompressive Craniectomy and Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage)".

### Surgical management of traumatic parenchymal lesions [^116gPXQD]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Indications

Patients with parenchymal mass lesions and signs of progressive neurological deterioration referable to the lesion, medically refractory intracranial hypertension, or signs of mass effect on computed tomographic (CT) scan should be treated operatively. Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 6 to 8 with frontal or temporal contusions greater than 20 cm³ in volume with midline shift of at least 5 mm and/or cisternal compression on CT scan, and patients with any lesion greater than 50 cm³ in volume should be treated operatively. Patients with parenchymal mass lesions who do not show evidence for neurological compromise, have controlled intracranial pressure (ICP), and no significant signs of mass effect on CT scan may be managed nonoperatively with intensive monitoring and serial imaging.

Timing and Methods

Craniotomy with evacuation of mass lesion is recommended for those patients with focal lesions and the surgical indications listed above, under Indications. Bifrontal decompressive craniectomy within 48 hours of injury is a treatment option for patients with diffuse, medically refractory posttraumatic cerebral edema and resultant intracranial hypertension. Decompressive procedures, including subtemporal decompression, temporal lobectomy, and hemispheric decompressive craniectomy, are treatment options for patients with refractory intracranial hypertension and diffuse parenchymal injury with clinical and radiographic evidence for impending transtentorial herniation.

### Complications of decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury [^116gbWHR]. Neurosurgical Focus (2009). Low credibility.

Decompressive craniectomy is widely used to treat intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two randomized trials are currently underway to further evaluate the effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy for TBI. Complications of this procedure have major ramifications on the risk-benefit balance in decision-making during evaluation of potential surgical candidates. To further evaluate the complications of decompressive craniectomy, a review of the literature was performed following a detailed search of PubMed between 1980 and 2009. The author restricted her study to literature pertaining to decompressive craniectomy for patients with TBI. An understanding of the pathophysiological events that accompany removal of a large piece of skull bone provides a foundation for understanding many of the complications associated with decompressive craniectomy. The author determined that decompressive craniectomy is not a simple, straightforward operation without adverse effects. Rather, numerous complications may arise, and they do so in a sequential fashion at specific time points following surgical decompression. Expansion of contusions, new subdural and epidural hematomas contralateral to the decompressed hemisphere, and external cerebral herniation typify the early perioperative complications of decompressive craniectomy for TBI. Within the 1st week following decompression, CSF circulation derangements manifest commonly as subdural hygromas. Paradoxical herniation following lumbar puncture in the setting of a large skull defect is a rare, potentially fatal complication that can be prevented and treated if recognized early. During the later phases of recovery, patients may develop a new cognitive, neurological, or psychological deficit termed syndrome of the trephined. In the longer term, a persistent vegetative state is the most devastating of outcomes of decompressive craniectomy. The risk of complications following decompressive craniectomy is weighed against the life-threatening circumstances under which this surgery is performed. Ongoing trials will define whether this balance supports surgical decompression as a first-line treatment for TBI.

### The impact of sociodemographic background on clinical presentation of high-grade gliomas: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis [^113AJ37N]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

As far as how age at diagnosis impacts survival, multiple studies have shown that a younger age at diagnosis correlates with improved survival in glioblastoma and HGG in general. There are a few possible explanations for this phenomenon. As expected, younger patients have far less co-morbidities than older patients, giving them a better chance to handle a new cancer. Secondly, younger patients are enrolled in research trials disproportionately more frequently and, in a similar vein, are treated far more aggressively.

The current study focuses on sociodemographic differences in clinical presentation of HGG. In our analyses, we found that White patients were more likely to present with a cognitive deficit while less likely to present with midline shift and mass effect on imaging than non-White patients. These findings are bolstered by the fact that there was no significant association between SVI and presence or absence of any of the clinical signs and symptoms examined in this study. This suggests that factors such as lack of healthcare access and agency may not have played a role in the presence of more aggressive symptoms at presentation. Interestingly, the literature is sparse on the variation in clinical presentation in HGG among different racial and ethnic groups. One hypothesis for the results observed in our study is that White patients may develop less aggressive and slower growing tumors. As a result, they present with more indolent symptoms (cognitive deficit) rather than more severe symptoms such as midline shift or mass effect. Furthermore, brain tumor patients with high-risk symptoms, such as focal neurological deficits, may be diagnosed more quickly than patients with lower-risk and nonspecific symptoms. Why this effect was enhanced in White patients in our study is unknown, and it warrants further studies with larger sample sizes.

Methods

Study Design

This is a cohort study with retrospective analysis of available patient data within electronic patient records and archived neuroimaging. From a database of 358 patients with TBI, we identified 204 patients for whom both CT imaging and pupil reactivity status were available. All patients were admitted to the Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit (NCCU) at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust between March 2005 and December 2016. Patients suffered either moderate-to-severe TBI or mild TBI and subsequently deteriorated to a point where they required ICP monitoring, sedation and mechanical ventilation as part of ICP management. Demographic data (sex, age, admission GCS and pupillary response) were recorded and therefore available to the study retrospectively through database analysis. Since all data were extracted from the hospital records and fully anonymized, no data on patient identifiers were available, and formal patient or proxy consent was not required.

The first assessment of pupil reactivity status recorded in the emergency department and noted in the archived electronic medical records was extracted and recorded as normal bilaterally, unilateral unreactive, or bilaterally unreactive in accordance with the IMPACT model criteria. The first admission CT was used for each patient to evaluate midline shift and basal cisterns status. The exact time between assessment of pupillary reactivity and CT is unknown, but likely within 1–2 h in most cases. This time period was selected to avoid confounding by sedation, as subsequent CTs were more likely to be conducted under sedatives, and progression of intracranial injury after admission clinical assessment. CT images were evaluated by a single consultant neurosurgeon blinded to pupillary status to determine extent of midline shift, lesion type, and basal cistern appearance. Midline shift was assessed on admission brain CT, using the distance of the septum pellucidum from bony midline (derived from the line connecting the crista galli to the inion) at the level of the foramen of Monro. Basal cisterns were graded via an ordinal system (0 = normal, 1 = compressed, 2 = absent/completely effaced).

Acute SDH large craniotomy technique — In patients with an acute SDH, perform a large craniotomy for optimal damage control, including evacuation of the hematoma, identification of the bleeding source, and meticulous hemostasis. A large craniotomy bone flap (≈ 12 × 15 cm) is created to effectively visualize sources of hemorrhage and this also maximizes the opportunity for primary and secondary decompression; the 15 cm recommendation may be excessive in some patients with smaller heads, while a bone flap of at least 13 cm in the vertical plane provides the opportunity for optimal decompression of the middle fossa. Additional bony removal in the subtemporal region and the sphenoid wing can be considered to augment exposure and decompression, and no role exists for attempted burr hole drainage of solid clots. A large reverse question mark incision is made starting 1 cm anterior to the tragus at the root of the zygoma while staying 1.5–2 cm lateral to midline, and burr holes are placed to enable a large craniotomy for decompression of the anterior and middle fossa floor.

### Research progress on the impact of cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy on brain function [^115FQUyj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Decompressive craniectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat cerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and brain herniation caused by elevated intracranial pressure. The primary purpose of decompressive craniectomy is to reduce intracranial pressure and alleviate compression on brain tissue. It is typically used in patients with brain tissue swelling or refractory intracranial hypertension. Cranioplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair cranial defects. It not only restores the normal anatomic structure of the skull and improves the appearance of the patient's head but also helps to some extent in correcting complications that arise after decompressive craniectomy. This article reviews and analyzes the impact of cranioplasty on brain function from the perspectives of intracranial physiological conditions and clinical neurological manifestations.

### Hinge / floating craniotomy as an alternative technique for cerebral decompression: a scoping review [^114MCNsk]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative parameters

The majority of patients undergoing HC were comatose (GCS < 9), with abnormal CT findings (significant midline shift and Rotterdam score) (Table 3). Pre-operative ICP values were sparse. Hinge craniotomy resulted in reduced ICP, a reduction in midline shift and also improved Rotterdam scores (Table 3). The GCS was not reported as a post-operative outcome. Specifically, of the studies that had pre-operative ICP recorded, patients undergoing HC demonstrated a reduced ICP post-operatively. Patients in the Guttman et al. series had pre-operative ICP of 32.7 ± 8.1 mmHg compared to 16.0 ± 12.1 mmHg post-operatively. In Valenca et al. the pre-operative ICP range was 15–35 mmHg and 6–12 mmHg post-operatively.

Table 3
Perioperative data

Direct comparison of HC to DC in relation to perioperative variables was limited (Table 6). Kenning et al. demonstrated that ICP control at post-operative day 5 was adequate and equivalent (HC 12.1 ± 2.6 mmHg; DC 15.0 ± 6.3 mmHg), despite the smaller volume of expansion (HC 77.5 ± 54.1 ml; DC 105.1 ± 65.1 ml). The imaging in 15 of the patients revealed reversal of midline shift (MLS) pre- and post-operatively (HC post-op MLS 6.4 ± 4.4 mm; DC 5.5 ± 4.6 mm), although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the MLS in patients receiving HC was also reduced. Peethambaran et al. demonstrated a MLS of 13.1 ± 4.78 mm reduced to 6.6 ± 3.9 mm post-operatively, whilst Schmidt et al. 10.6 to 5.1 mm following HC.

The 2018 practice guideline on disorders of consciousness marks an important turning point in the care of patients with severe brain injury. As clinicians and health systems implement the guideline in practice, several ethical challenges will arise in assessing the benefits, harms, feasibility, and cost of recommended interventions. We provide guidance for clinicians when interpreting these recommendations and call on professional societies to develop an ethical framework to complement the guideline as it is implemented in clinical practice.

### Midline shift is unrelated to subjective pupillary reactivity assessment on admission in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury [^1114j8Eo]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this sample of moderate-to-severe TBI patients, supra-tentorial midline shift is not directly related to subjectively assessed pupillary reactivity. Basal cistern effacement is a robust predictor of impaired pupillary reactivity and is intimately associated with supra-tentorial midline shift. These results reinforce the idea that pupillary dysfunction is a late clinical correlate of progressive supra-tentorial mass effect and emphasize the utility of basal cistern effacement as a key neuroimaging characteristic to guide intervention in TBI.
