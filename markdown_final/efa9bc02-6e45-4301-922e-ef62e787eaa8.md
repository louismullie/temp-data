## Question

Patient with high blood pressure taking lisinopril 40mg DAILY

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a patient with hypertension who is taking lisinopril 40 mg daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether 40 mg daily is an appropriate maintenance dose for hypertension based on labeling and evidence. Then, I should verify whether this is maintenance therapy versus a new start, because initiation dosing and monitoring differ substantially. Next, I will assess renal function for dosing safety, screen for diuretics and NSAIDs that affect hemodynamics and kidneys, evaluate hyperkalemia risk, determine if blood pressure is at target and whether to add a second agent, consider special populations, review contraindications and precautions, set a monitoring plan, and finalize patient counseling and the decision framework, while I keep checking myself at each step to avoid unwarranted assumptions.

> Let me first confirm the dose appropriateness, because I need to ensure 40 mg is within the maintenance range for hypertension and not excessive for routine use, and the FDA labeling supports a maintenance range of 20–40 mg daily with a maximum of 80 mg, with lisinopril effective in once-daily dosing across 10–80 mg, so 40 mg sits squarely at the top of the usual maintenance window and is evidence-based for established hypertension therapy [^116DC8nj] [^1153XTfh] [^114qHuXU].

> Wait, let me verify the treatment context, because starting at 40 mg would be inappropriate and risks first-dose hypotension, whereas maintenance at 40 mg after titration is acceptable; labeling recommends initial doses of 5–10 mg daily with up-titration based on response and tolerability, so I should confirm this patient was titrated from a lower dose and is not a new start [^116DC8nj] [^1153XTfh] [^117YJkqR].

> I need to check renal function next, since lisinopril is renally cleared and accumulation occurs when GFR falls below about 30 mL/min, meaning no dose adjustment is required if CrCl is above 30 mL/min, but below this threshold, exposure increases and dose reduction is necessary, and if CrCl is under 10 mL/min the recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg, so ordering a recent creatinine and eGFR to ensure safety at 40 mg is essential [^116R3HTp] [^111dXKB3] [^111ZuRpN] [^117Na5Ww].

> Hold on, I should verify concurrent diuretic use, because patients on thiazide or loop diuretics have a heightened risk of excessive blood pressure reduction when ACE inhibitors are initiated or uptitrated, warranting lower starting doses and supervised first-dose monitoring; even on stable therapy, I should assess for orthostatic symptoms, volume status, and electrolyte derangements, and if hypotension occurs, consider diuretic dose adjustment rather than pushing lisinopril beyond 40 mg [^117YJkqR] [^117YJkqR].

> Next, I will examine NSAID exposure, since NSAIDs including COX-2 inhibitors can precipitate reversible renal function deterioration when combined with ACE inhibitors, particularly in older or volume-depleted patients or those with CKD, so I should review all prescription and OTC analgesics, counsel avoidance, and increase renal monitoring intensity if NSAIDs are unavoidable [^117YJkqR] [^1123Wx8S].

> Let me consider hyperkalemia risk, because ACE inhibition lowers aldosterone and raises serum potassium, especially with renal insufficiency, diabetes, or concomitant potassium-sparing diuretics, supplements, or salt substitutes, so baseline and periodic potassium checks are prudent and if potassium is significantly elevated, for example above 5.5 mEq/L, I should reduce or stop lisinopril and remove other contributors after confirming the result [^1123Wx8S].

> I should double-check blood pressure control and the need for combination therapy, because if BP remains above goal on lisinopril 40 mg monotherapy it is usually more effective to add a second class than to exceed typical maintenance ceilings, and combinations with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide are guideline-consistent, with evidence suggesting ACE inhibitor plus CCB may yield superior cardiovascular outcomes versus ACE inhibitor plus thiazide, while dual RAS blockade with ACE inhibitor plus ARB should be avoided [^114qHuXU] [^115CKgwF] [^114bnyEQ].

> Let me think about practical combination choices, since fixed-dose lisinopril/HCTZ tablets are available and allow titration across lisinopril 10–80 mg and HCTZ 12.5–50 mg, and when adding HCTZ to high-dose lisinopril it can be sensible to step back the ACE inhibitor dose to 20 mg to minimize dose-dependent effects while achieving synergistic BP lowering, provided renal function and electrolytes are stable [^113BFNus] [^114qHuXU].

> I need to ensure I account for age and race, because older adults have higher exposure and AUC and may need slower titration even if they ultimately tolerate 40 mg, and Black patients tend to have a smaller BP response to ACE inhibitors and a higher incidence of angioedema, making early addition of a thiazide or CCB a reasonable strategy if response is suboptimal or risk is higher [^111dXKB3] [^117Na5Ww] [^112v6oqH].

> Next, I should review comorbid diabetes and heart failure, since in type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria ACE inhibition reduces albuminuria beyond BP effects and supports renoprotection, albeit with heightened hyperkalemia vigilance, and in HFrEF, lisinopril typically starts at 5 mg with a 20–40 mg target, with ATLAS showing fewer hospitalizations on higher doses despite no mortality difference, consistent with current ESC heart failure guidance for ACE inhibitor-based foundational therapy when tolerated [^112iuaxU] [^1123Wx8S] [^114mb1QW] [^115paYJ8] [^115oYdqE].

> I will now examine contraindications and precautions, noting that absolute contraindications include any prior ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema and pregnancy, and I must use caution with bilateral renal artery stenosis, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, perioperative settings, and concomitant mTOR inhibitors due to angioedema risk; but wait, I initially labeled bilateral renal artery stenosis as an absolute contraindication, and I should clarify that while ACE inhibitors can precipitate renal dysfunction in renal artery stenosis, this is generally a precaution with close monitoring rather than an absolute contraindication in all cases [^1123Wx8S] [^1179yinj].

> Let me first confirm a monitoring plan, because after initiation or dose change, checking serum creatinine and potassium at baseline and again within 1–2 weeks is standard, followed by periodic reassessment, with continued BP measurements each visit, orthostatic symptom review, and if creatinine rises markedly, for example by more than about 30% from baseline, I should reassess for renovascular disease, volume depletion, NSAIDs, or diuretic effects and adjust therapy accordingly [^1123Wx8S].

> I should double-check patient education elements, advising immediate care for facial swelling or dyspnea suggestive of angioedema, avoidance of OTC NSAIDs, caution with potassium supplements and salt substitutes, slow positional changes to mitigate orthostatic symptoms, and not stopping therapy abruptly without a plan, as these steps reduce preventable adverse effects and maintain BP control [^1123Wx8S] [^117YJkqR] [^114mnP1b].

> Hold on, let me summarize the decision thresholds clearly to avoid ambiguity, because lisinopril 40 mg daily is appropriate if this is maintenance therapy after titration, eGFR is above roughly 30 mL/min without rising creatinine, potassium is within range, BP is controlled or trending toward target, no history of ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema exists, and no symptomatic hypotension is present, whereas uncontrolled BP favors adding a complementary agent rather than exceeding the typical 40 mg maintenance range, and reduced kidney function or hyperkalemia should prompt dose reduction and investigation of contributing factors [^116DC8nj] [^116R3HTp] [^1123Wx8S] [^113i4TjW].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall recommendation to ensure alignment with guidelines, and the bottom line is that lisinopril 40 mg once daily is an evidence-based maintenance dose for hypertension when renal function and potassium are stable and no contraindications exist, and if BP is not at goal on this regimen the preferred strategy is to add a second class such as a CCB or thiazide rather than push beyond typical maintenance, while avoiding ACE inhibitor plus ARB combinations and maintaining ongoing monitoring for renal function, potassium, and hemodynamics [^116DC8nj] [^115CKgwF] [^113i4TjW] [^114bnyEQ].

Lisinopril 40 mg daily is a **high-dose ACE inhibitor** for hypertension [^1153XTfh], with a **maximum dose of 80 mg/day** [^116DC8nj]. It is effective for BP control and organ protection [^112iuaxU], but monitor for **hyperkalemia [^1123Wx8S] and renal impairment** [^117YJkqR]. If BP remains uncontrolled, **add a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker** [^115CKgwF]; **avoid dual RAS blockade** [^114bnyEQ]. Monitor **renal function and electrolytes** regularly, and **adjust dose if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^111dXKB3] [^117Na5Ww].

---

## Pharmacological properties

The **mechanism of action** involves inhibiting ACE, reducing angiotensin II and aldosterone, leading to vasodilation and lower BP [^112i21Ha]. Pharmacokinetics include ~25% oral bioavailability, a peak at ~7 hours, a ~12-hour half-life, and excretion unchanged in the urine [^117Na5Ww].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Blood pressure control is achieved with **once-daily dosing** [^116em1Sr] that provides **24-hour coverage** [^115hceBh]. Organ protection includes **reduced proteinuria** [^111TSr9s], **slowed CKD progression**, and **lower cardiovascular risk** in high-risk patients [^115paYJ8].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Dizziness, hypotension, cough [^1123Wx8S], hyperkalemia, renal impairment [^111uTQPT].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Angioedema [^1123Wx8S], acute renal failure, severe hyperkalemia, hepatotoxicity [^114zvRXA].

- **Monitoring**: Regular renal function and electrolytes; adjust dose if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111dXKB3].

---

## Clinical considerations and recommendations

- **Indications**: Hypertension, heart failure, CKD, diabetic nephropathy, post-MI management [^111vFe12].

- **Contraindications**: History of angioedema, pregnancy, bilateral renal artery stenosis, severe renal impairment [^1123Wx8S].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, and dual RAS blockade [^114bnyEQ].

- **Dose adjustments**: Reduce dose in renal impairment [^111dXKB3]; consider combination therapy if BP uncontrolled [^116oYz48].

---

## Alternative antihypertensive therapies

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Effective add-on therapy; consider chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide [^115FQHjS].

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Amlodipine or felodipine as alternatives or adjuncts.

- **Beta-blockers**: Consider in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [^1175p4Lu].

- **ARBs**: Losartan or valsartan if ACE inhibitors not tolerated [^115tMHxs].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **ESC 2024 guidelines** endorse ACE inhibitors for hypertension, heart failure, and CKD, and advise avoiding dual RAS blockade. ESH 2023 guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors for hypertension management and suggest considering **combination therapy for resistant hypertension**.

---

Lisinopril 40 mg daily is **effective for hypertension and organ protection** [^115x2qQ6], but requires monitoring for adverse effects and interactions. If BP remains uncontrolled, add a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker [^115FQHjS], and **avoid dual RAS blockade** [^114bnyEQ].

Lisinopril

- **Hypotension - patients on diuretic therapy**: Patients on diuretics, especially those who have recently started diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction in blood pressure after initiating lisinopril therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake before starting treatment with lisinopril. If continuing the diuretic is necessary, initiate lisinopril therapy at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour [see WARNINGS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In elderly patients, those with depleted volume (including those on diuretic therapy), or those with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, may lead to deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving both lisinopril and NSAID therapy.

### Zestril [^111dXKB3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Impaired renal function decreases the elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys. This decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. However, with greater impairment, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, the time to peak concentration increases, and the time to attain a steady state is prolonged [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.

- **Pediatric patients**: The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 and 16 years of age with a glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m². After doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours, and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function. In a multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 pediatric hypertensive patients with stable kidney transplants (ages 7 to 17 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), dose-normalized exposures were in the range reported previously in children without a kidney transplant.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics may be underutilized for postpartum hypertension because of their teratogenicity during pregnancy. We evaluated whether combined oral hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril therapy produced superior short-term blood pressure control when compared with nifedipine among postpartum individuals with hypertension requiring pharmacologic treatment.

We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial (October 2021 to June 2022) that included individuals with chronic hypertension or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with two systolic blood pressure measurements ≥ 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure measurements ≥ 100 mm Hg within 72 hours after delivery. Participants were randomized to receive either combined hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril therapy or nifedipine therapy after stratifying the participants by diagnosis (chronic hypertension vs. hypertensive disorders of pregnancy).

The primary outcome was stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg), determined using a home blood pressure monitor on days 7 to 10 after delivery or at readmission to the hospital for blood pressure control.

Secondary outcomes included:

- **Severe maternal morbidity**: Any of the following: intensive care unit admission; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count syndrome; eclampsia; stroke; cardiomyopathy; or maternal death.
- **Need for intravenous medications after randomization**.
- **Hospital length of stay**,
- **Blood pressure during first clinic visit**.

### Is the extrapolated adult dose of fosinopril safe and effective in treating hypertensive children [^1113TU3S]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relationship of fosinopril in children aged 6 to 16 years with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure, with an associated medical condition requiring treatment. The study was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 78 clinical sites in the United States, Russia, and Israel. There were four phases: a screening phase of 10 days maximum, a 4-week dose-response phase, a placebo withdrawal phase of 2 weeks maximum, and a 52-week open-label safety phase.

- **Primary objective of the dose-response phase**: Determine whether low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg), or high (0.6 mg/kg) doses of fosinopril, based on established adult dosing, affect trough seated systolic blood pressure. During the dose-response phase, all three doses were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure.

- **Placebo withdrawal phase results**: There was an adjusted mean systolic blood pressure increase of 5.2 mm Hg for the placebo group and 1.5 mm Hg for the fosinopril group, indicating a net withdrawal effect of 3.7 mm Hg (P = 0.013).

- **Adverse events**: Fosinopril was well tolerated; serious adverse events occurred infrequently and were generally not attributed to fosinopril.

Because children appear to be more sensitive to lower doses of fosinopril than adults, starting doses for children should be ≤ 0.1 mg/kg.

### Omapatrilat versus lisinopril: Efficacy and neurohormonal profile in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients [^113iSnEU]. Hypertension (2001).

Omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase and ACE. The efficacy and hormonal profile of omapatrilat and lisinopril were compared in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients.

Upon enrollment, antihypertensive medications were withdrawn, and patients received a single-blind placebo. On day 15, salt-sensitivity determinations were made. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients returned within 5 to 10 days for baseline evaluations of ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, ambulatory systolic blood pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide. These patients were then randomized to receive double-blind omapatrilat (n = 28) or lisinopril (n = 33) at initial doses of 10 mg for 1 week, which increased to 40 mg for omapatrilat and 20 mg for lisinopril over an additional 3 weeks.

Ambulatory blood pressure and urinary atrial natriuretic peptide were assessed at study termination. Both omapatrilat and lisinopril significantly reduced mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressures. However, omapatrilat produced significantly greater reductions in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.008), ambulatory systolic blood pressure (P = 0.004), and ambulatory mean arterial pressure (P = 0.005) compared with values from lisinopril. Both drugs potently inhibited ACE over 24 hours.

Omapatrilat significantly (P < 0.001) increased urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide over 0- to 24-hour (3.8-fold) and 12- to 24-hour (2-fold) intervals, while lisinopril produced no change. Omapatrilat also significantly (P < 0.001) increased urinary excretion of cGMP over the 0- to 24-hour period.

### Zestoretic [^1179yinj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril is associated with several precautions and potential adverse effects.

- **Aortic stenosis/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**: As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be administered with caution to patients experiencing obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.

- **Impaired renal function**: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure and/or death.

- **Hypertension and renal artery stenosis**: In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, especially when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of lisinopril and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115aJoE7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

One trial that supports the first-line status of thiazides, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). This trial randomized 33,357 people aged ≥ 55 years with hypertension and ≥ 1 other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor to receive chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril. All-cause mortality was not different between the groups, and while systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in the amlodipine and lisinopril groups compared with the chlorthalidone group, the difference was statistically but not clinically significant at 0.8 to 2 mm Hg (P < 0.05). However, there were some notable differences in secondary outcomes, like higher rates of heart failure (HF) in the amlodipine group (10.2%) versus the chlorthalidone group (7.7%). Nevertheless, since the primary outcome and other secondary outcomes were comparable, this was not considered by the Joint National Committee (JNC) 8 as a strong enough reason to recommend thiazide diuretics as the sole initial antihypertensive class.

The American Society of Hypertension/International Society of Hypertension (ASH/ISH) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) make a distinction for those aged < 55 to 60 years to favor an ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), while those aged ≥ 55 to 60 years should start with a thiazide or CCB. β-blockers are included as first-line options for adults aged < 60 years in the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines and for adults aged < 80 years in the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) guidelines. Although combination therapy with β-blockers can be very effective, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrated a lower rate of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in their losartan group compared with the atenolol group.

### Fosinopril sodium [^112v6oqH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension and may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. They are also indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy, including diuretics with or without digitalis.

When using fosinopril sodium, it is important to consider that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been associated with agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not pose a similar risk.

In controlled trials, ACE inhibitors have shown a less pronounced effect on blood pressure in black patients compared to non-black patients. Furthermore, available data indicate a higher rate of angioedema in black patients than in non-black patients when using ACE inhibitors.

### SPL drug information for lisinopril [^116R3HTp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lisinopril sodium PO (also known as Zestril) in patients with CrCl > 30 mL/min: use is acceptable with no dose adjustment required.

### Zestoretic [^114qHuXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment for hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy, using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing doses of either component.

The side effects (see WARNINGS) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose. Those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g. pancreatitis), with the former being much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects, but the addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only following a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

- **Dose titration guided by clinical effect**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure lead to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives include quantifying the blood pressure-lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, compared to placebo or no treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Authors of relevant papers were contacted regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were targeted.

### Diverse effects of increasing lisinopril doses on lipid abnormalities in chronic nephropathies [^111TSr9s]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia frequently complicates chronic nephropathies and increases the risk of renal and cardiovascular events, which might be ameliorated by drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that effectively reduce proteinuria.

- **Methods and results**: In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which uptitration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximum tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/d) ameliorated proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids progressively and dose-dependently decreased during uptitration to maximum doses. Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at lisinopril maximum doses, and persisted after treatment withdrawal. Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite more proteinuria reduction, had less decrease in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r = -0.89, P = 0.003) and recovered promptly after treatment withdrawal. Lisinopril was well tolerated and did not affect renal hemodynamics.

Hypertension after cardiothoracic surgery is common, often requiring pharmacologic management. The recommended first-line antihypertensives in pediatrics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Captopril and enalapril are approved for infants and children; however, lisinopril is only approved for those older than 7 years of age. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of converting from captopril to lisinopril using a pre-defined conversion of 3 mg captopril to 1 mg lisinopril.

This was a single-center, retrospective study including patients less than 7 years of age admitted for cardiothoracic surgery who received both captopril and lisinopril from 01/01/2017 to 06/01/2022. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline for 72 hours after conversion from captopril to lisinopril. A total of 99 patients were enrolled.

There was a significant decrease in mean SBP (99.12 mmHg vs. 94.86 mmHg; p = 0.007) with no difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (59.23 mmHg vs. 61.95 mmHg; p = 0.07) after conversion to lisinopril. Of the 99 patients who transitioned to lisinopril, 79 (80%) had controlled SBP, 20 (20%) remained hypertensive, 13 (13%) received an increase in their lisinopril dose, and 2 (2%) required an additional antihypertensive agent. There was a low overall rate of acute kidney injury (3%) and hyperkalemia (4%).

This study demonstrates that using lisinopril with a conversion rate of 3 mg of captopril to 1 mg of lisinopril was safe and effective for controlling hypertension in pediatric patients following cardiothoracic surgery.

### A new dimension in hypertension management with the amlodipine/perindopril combination [^115WKprX]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines consistently acknowledge that most hypertensive patients require at least two drugs for optimal blood pressure (BP) control. Trial data support the use of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (i.e. an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) plus a diuretic, a RAS blocker plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a CCB plus a diuretic.

The ACCOMPLISH trial demonstrated convincingly that an ACE inhibitor/CCB is superior to the same ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide. In the ASCOT trial, amlodipine/perindopril proved superior to beta-blocker/thiazide in its effects on all major cardiovascular outcomes and new-onset diabetes. Further substudies of ASCOT provided plausible explanations for the benefits of the amlodipine/perindopril strategy.

- **Effectiveness in reducing central BP**: In the CAFE substudy, amlodipine/perindopril was significantly more effective in reducing central BP compared to atenolol/bendroflumethiazide, despite similar reductions in brachial BP.

- **Long-term BP variability analysis**: More recent analyses of long-term BP variability further explained the reduction in cardiovascular events with amlodipine/perindopril in ASCOT.

Thus, the combination of perindopril and amlodipine seems to be an ideal evidence-based pair of antihypertensive agents to select.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oYz48]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) published one of the earliest clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension, which were later updated in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, the WHO published some recommendations for the management of hypertension in guidelines for the assessment and management of total cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, these are now outdated considering new evidence and practices. Guidance is particularly needed now on some controversial issues, such as the threshold level of blood pressure (BP) at which to start pharmacological treatment and whether laboratory testing and CVD risk assessment are needed before initiating antihypertensive pharmacological therapy.

In the past decade, the WHO included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total CVD risk approach as part of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) from 2007, 2010, and 2013. However, this approach preceded recent advances in the pharmacological management of hypertension. More recently, the WHO has provided information about the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Global HEARTS Initiative, including the HEARTS Technical Package and the HEARTS in the Americas Program. However, these too provide general practical information and not specific guidelines and recommendations.

The WHO Essential Medicines List includes ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics for the management of hypertension. In June 2019, single-pill combination antihypertensive medications were considered.

### Zestoretic [^114mnP1b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Hypotension and related effects: excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt/volume-depleted persons such as those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Syncope has been reported in 0.8 percent of patients receiving Zestoretic. In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent. The overall incidence of syncope may be reduced by proper titration of the individual components (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In patients with severe congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.

If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is no longer uncommon, and monitoring should be continuous to ensure patient safety.

### Individual titration for maximal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in proteinuric patients: a feasible strategy [^113YyoX2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Agents that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reduce proteinuria and afford renal protection. The combination of different measures that aim to maximize RAS blockade is thought to improve antiproteinuric efficacy. The feasibility and efficacy of such a combination strategy were studied in nondiabetic patients with residual proteinuria during previous RAS blockade by individual antiproteinuric titration. Previous medication was replaced by irbesartan 300 mg combined with a diuretic. Lisinopril was added in increasing doses until a maximal dose of 40 mg/day was achieved.

Titration stopped when target proteinuria of less than 1 g/day or when significant side effects, such as excessive blood pressure decline, occurred. In this study, 26 patients underwent RAS blockade maximization. Results demonstrated a significant further reduction of proteinuria from 2.1 ± 1.2 to 0.87 ± 0.6 g/day. Blood pressure decreased slightly. However, two patients developed renal adverse events without irreversible renal failure (one had a serum potassium level increase to 5.5 mmol/L, one had more than a 50% increase in serum creatinine), and one experienced dizziness.

In conclusion, individual titration for maximal RAS blockade, entailing dose titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on top of high-dose angiotensin II antagonists with diuretics, induces further proteinuria reduction in this patient population.

### Low doses vs. high doses of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in chronic heart failure: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on the assessment of treatment with lisinopril and survival (ATLAS) study [^112ozrTw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2000). Low credibility.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted on high and low doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril in the treatment of chronic heart failure.

- **Methods**: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using data from a randomized controlled trial, ATLAS, where 3,164 patients with chronic heart failure were allocated either to a high-dose strategy (daily target dose 32.5–35 mg) or a low-dose strategy (daily target dose 2.5–5.0 mg) of lisinopril. Differential costs were based on resource use data collected in the trial, costed using UK unit costs. The cost-effectiveness analysis related differential costs to differential life-years during a 4-year trial follow-up.

- **Results**: The mean total number of hospital in-patient days per patient was 18.5 in the high-dose group and 22.5 in the low-dose group. Over the entire duration of the trial, the mean (S.D.) daily dose of lisinopril in the high-dose group was 22.5 mg (15.7 mg) compared to 3.2 mg (2.5 mg) in the low-dose group. The mean difference in cost per patient was £397 lower in the high-dose group [95% CI (high-dose-low-dose) -£1,263 to £436]. Mean life-years per patient were 0.085 years higher in the high-dose group [95% CI (high-dose-low-dose) -0.0074 to 0.1706]. Based on mean costs and life-years, high-dose therapy dominates low-dose therapy as it is less costly and more effective. Allowing for uncertainty in mean costs and life-years, there is an 82% probability that high-dose therapy is less costly than low-dose therapy. If a decision maker is willing to pay at least £3,600 per life-year gained, the probability of choosing the high-dose therapy increases accordingly.

### Randomised controlled trial of dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system in patients with hypertension, microalbuminuria, and non-insulin dependent diabetes: the candesartan and lisinopril microalbuminuria (CALM) study [^112iuaxU]. BMJ (2000). Low credibility.

To assess and compare the effects of candesartan or lisinopril, or both, on blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in patients with microalbuminuria, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, a prospective, randomised, parallel group, double-blind study was conducted with a four-week placebo run-in period followed by 12 weeks of monotherapy with candesartan or lisinopril, and then 12 weeks of monotherapy or combination treatment.

- **Setting**: The study was carried out in tertiary hospitals and primary care centres across four countries (37 centres).

- **Participants**: The study enrolled 199 patients aged 30 to 75 years.

- **Interventions**: Patients received either candesartan 16 mg once daily or lisinopril 20 mg once daily.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes were blood pressure reduction and the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio.

Results showed that at 12 weeks, the mean (95% confidence interval) reductions in diastolic blood pressure were 9.5 mm Hg (7.7 mm Hg to 11.2 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and 9.7 mm Hg (7.9 mm Hg to 11.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001) for candesartan and lisinopril, respectively. The urinary albumin:creatinine ratio reductions were 30% (15% to 42%, P < 0.001) for candesartan and 46% (35% to 56%, P < 0.001) for lisinopril.

At 24 weeks, the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater with combination treatment (16.3 mm Hg, 13.6 mm Hg to 18.9 mm Hg, P < 0.001) compared to candesartan (10.4 mm Hg, 7.7 mm Hg to 13.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001) or lisinopril (10.7 mm Hg, 8.0 mm Hg to 13.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001). Additionally, the reduction in the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio with combination treatment (50%, 36% to 61%, P < 0.001) was greater than with candesartan (24%, 0% to 43%, P = 0.05) and lisinopril (39%, 20% to 54%, P < 0.001).

### Hypertension guidelines in elderly patients: Is anybody listening [^115h6KPN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Previous guidelines for the management of uncomplicated hypertension in elderly patients have recommended diuretic agents and then beta-blockers. We examined trends in the initial treatment choice for elderly people with hypertension and the effects of a government-sponsored program to publish and disseminate a simplified version of the national guidelines for the treatment of hypertension to all physicians in Ontario, Canada.

Linked administrative databases containing information on the more than 1.2 million elderly residents in Ontario were used. Time series analysis was performed to determine prescribing trends from 1993 to 1998 for patients who began antihypertensive medication for the treatment of hypertension and to examine the effects of the simplified guidelines that were distributed in July of 1995.

Diuretic agents were the most commonly prescribed medications, with annual rates from 35% to 38% (P = 0.59) throughout the study. Beta-blocker prescribing rose from 12% to 16% (P < 0.01), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescribing rose from 27% to 32% (P < 0.01). Prescriptions for calcium channel blockers dropped significantly, from 23% to 14% (P < 0.01). However, the publication and dissemination of the Ontario hypertension guidelines had no statistically significant effects on the proportion of patients who began treatment with a diuretic agent (P = 0.55), beta-blocker (P = 0.32), ACE inhibitor (P = 0.09), or calcium channel blocker (P = 0.07).

### Valsartan in combination with lisinopril versus the respective high dose monotherapies in hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria: the VALERIA trial [^11387McU]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is known as an independent predictor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The purpose of the VALERIA trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of valsartan and lisinopril with high-dose monotherapies of valsartan and lisinopril in patients with hypertension and microalbuminuria.

This study was a randomized, double-blind, interventional, parallel-group trial. Following a 3-week washout/placebo-run-in phase, 133 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either lisinopril 40 mg, valsartan 320 mg, or a combination of valsartan/lisinopril 320/20 mg for 30 weeks.

At baseline, the urine albumin creatinine ratio was similar across the three treatment groups, with geometric means of lisinopril 9.6 mg/mmol, valsartan 9.1 mg/mmol, and valsartan/lisinopril 9.5 mg/mmol. After 30 weeks of treatment, the geometric mean urine albumin creatinine ratio decreased in all groups by 41%, 51%, and 62% to 5.7 mg/mmol (lisinopril), 4.5 mg/mmol (valsartan), and 3.6 mg/mmol (valsartan/lisinopril). The reduction for valsartan/lisinopril was statistically significantly greater compared to lisinopril, with an adjusted ratio of 60% and a confidence interval of 38–94% (P = 0.029). Normalization of microalbuminuria was highest with valsartan and valsartan/lisinopril, with 17% for lisinopril, 31% for valsartan, and 38% for valsartan/lisinopril of patients achieving normalization. This was statistically significant for lisinopril compared to valsartan/lisinopril (P = 0.034). However, differences in blood pressure reduction between the groups were not statistically significant.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in hypertension: Is there evidence for benefit independent of blood pressure reduction [^112i21Ha]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension (HTN). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are first-line antihypertensive drug classes that are potent, effective, and largely safe. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have shown similar blood pressure (BP) reduction but are associated with more side effects. The efficacy of ACEIs and ARBs for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal protection has been promoted to extend beyond what could be explained by BP reduction alone.

- **Pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**: We will briefly discuss this in the review.
- **Clinical evidence for ACEIs, ARBs, and DRIs in HTN**: Analysis of these drug classes in managing hypertension.
- **Comparison of ACEIs vs. ARBs and combination therapy**: Evaluating the advantages of each approach.
- **Role of RAAS inhibitors in specific patient populations**: Examination of efficacy in distinct demographic groups.
- **Safety profile of RAAS inhibitors**: Assessment of safety concerns associated with these medications.
- **Guideline recommendations and future perspectives**: Exploring the current guidelines and potential future directions.

Closer scrutiny of outcome data shows little, if any, evidence that the efficacy of RAAS blockers in HTN extends beyond BP reduction.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review, initially published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, which include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors, are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension. They are especially recommended for individuals with diabetes due to their postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite their widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality outcomes.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system blockade at optimal doses for proteinuria [^115iFpk4]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

The antiproteinuric effect of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist losartan was compared to that of the optimal antiproteinuric doses of monotherapy.

- **Methods**: To this purpose, lisinopril and losartan were studied in 9 nondiabetic renal patients with median proteinuria of 4.5 g/day (95% CI, 3.5, 6.4), creatinine clearance of 80 mL/min (95% CI, 66, 96), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 102 mm Hg (95% CI, 93, 112). First, in two protocols with six-week treatment periods per dose, the optimal antiproteinuric dose of each drug was established in each patient. Losartan and lisinopril were used in randomized order, each preceded by a baseline period without medication. The doses of losartan (mg/day) were 50, 100, 150, and again 50. The lisinopril doses were 10, 20, 40, and again 10. After the second protocol, patients were treated with a combination, using the optimal antiproteinuric doses established for the individual drugs.

- **Results**: The antiproteinuric response by losartan was optimal at 100 mg (-46%; 95% CI, -60, -24%), being larger than at the 50 mg dose (-27%; 95% CI, -42, -4%, P < 0.05), but not different from the 150 mg dose (-46%; 95% CI, -58, -20%). Proteinuria decreased further at each up-titration step of lisinopril to -75% (95% CI, -85, -43%) at the 40 mg dose. Combination therapy reduced proteinuria more effectively (-85%; 95% CI, -96, -58) than monotherapy with losartan, and to a lesser extent than with lisinopril. Optimal blood pressure responses were obtained at similar doses.

### Zestoretic [^117Na5Ww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and metabolism

Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours.

- **Renal function and elimination**: Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases, and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: To use or not to use [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients. In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors regarding the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall, withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, a risk-to-benefit analysis suggests that currently there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### Familial factors in the antihypertensive response to lisinopril [^1111pWSC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). High credibility.

Although it is widely recognized that familial elements play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, remarkably little is known about the influence of family history on the response to specific antihypertensive agents.

- **Methods**: This study was designed to address this issue by comparing the depressor response to lisinopril in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg in 74 patients enrolled as sibling pairs. Since all patients were treated with lisinopril, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an objective measure not influenced by the investigators, was used to assess the primary blood pressure (BP) outcome variable.

- **Results**: Diastolic BP was highly correlated between sibling pairs at baseline (r = 0.476; P < .03) and during treatment (r = 0.524; p = 0.0021). Ethnicity and race had a notable influence on lisinopril dose and response rate. Among African American patients, 23 of 28 reached the top dose of 40 mg/day, whereas only 14 of 36 Caucasian patients reached that dose level. Among Caucasians, 92% responded, while only 48% of African Americans did. Responders were characterized by being younger and heavier, having significantly lower microalbuminuria at baseline, higher baseline renal plasma flow (RPF), and higher urinary kallikrein.

- **Conclusion**: Among Caucasians, the presence of a hypertensive sibling predicts a striking therapeutic response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^1175p4Lu]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice. Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension, and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended.

Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category. The addition of antihypertensive drugs is only recommended for approximately 30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline, and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG.

For many other treatment differences, the two guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy, but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone or indapamide.

### Evaluation of recent fixed-dose combination therapies in the management of hypertension [^115CKgwF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Control of hypertension remains sub-optimal, with only half of patients achieving adequate control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend the initial use of two antihypertensive agents in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This review discusses the drug combinations that have additive effects and those that do not provide additional benefits while increasing adverse events.

Results from late-breaking trials have shown that combinations of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are superior to a diuretic with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for reducing cardiovascular events. Additionally, in patients with vascular disease who have relatively 'controlled' blood pressure at baseline, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker did not reduce cardiovascular endpoints compared with either monotherapy and modestly increased the incidence of adverse effects.

Combination therapy of antihypertensive agents (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretics) as initial therapy in stage 2 hypertension can lead to markedly improved blood pressure control in patients compared with monotherapeutic regimens.

### Long-term dual blockade with candesartan and lisinopril in hypertensive patients with diabetes: The CALM II study [^117Bdefn]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

To assess and compare the long-term effects of the combination of candesartan and lisinopril with high-dose lisinopril on systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and diabetes, a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study was conducted with a 12-month follow-up. Drug therapy consisted of either lisinopril 40 mg once daily or dual-blockade treatment with candesartan 16 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg once daily. The study included 75 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients aged 35–74 years. The main outcome measures were seated and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure.

A reduction in systolic blood pressure was achieved in both treatment arms. The mean reduction at final follow-up was 6 mmHg for the dual-blockade and 2 mmHg for lisinopril; however, no significant difference was found between dual-blockade and lisinopril 40 mg once daily (P = 0.10). Both treatments were generally well tolerated, with similar low rates of side effects in the two groups.

There was no statistically significant difference between lisinopril 40 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with candesartan 16 mg once daily in reducing systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetes.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116em1Sr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy results: There was no difference in the BP control rate at the end of the study (Week 26) between patients receiving valsartan 320 mg as a morning dose (40.7%) or evening dose (39.7%) or when compared with lisinopril 40 mg (43.3%, P = 0.4989 for lisinopril versus valsartan a.m.). Likewise, the percentage of patients achieving BP control at Week 12 was similar irrespective of the time of dosing of valsartan (36.7% a.m. versus 35.0% p.m. P = 0.6752) or when compared with lisinopril treatment (39.5%, P = 0.4641 versus valsartan a.m.).

The change in maSBP from baseline to Week 12 showed no difference between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. groups (−10.6 versus −9.8, P = 0.4219, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.30 to 0.96, with no adjustment for multiplicity) and between the valsartan a.m. and lisinopril groups (−10.6 versus −10.7, P = 0.8966, 97.5% CI, adjusted for multiplicity: −1.76 to 1.98). The CI limits were well within the noninferiority margins of ± 4 mmHg. The mean hourly SBP and DBP values were also comparable among the three treatment groups at Week 12, with the circadian BP profile being similar for the morning and evening dosing of valsartan. Additionally, the change from baseline in maSBP and maDBP at the end of the study (Week 26) was also similar between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. dosing groups.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use as first-line? This review answers that question.

- **Primary objective**: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

- **Search strategy**: An electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane clinical trial register was conducted, using the standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one year in duration comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment were included. More than 70% of participants must have had a baseline blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

- **Main results**: Of the 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95), and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (1 RCT) were not analyzed further here.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: Controversies in hypertension - con side of the argument [^114iinKP]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The 2018 European guideline proposed that the combination of medications targeting multiple mechanisms, such as blocking the renin-angiotensin system and inducing vasodilatation and diuresis, reduces the heterogeneity of the blood pressure (BP) responses to initial treatment and provides a steeper dose response than is observed with escalating doses of monotherapy. Whereas this might be true during the first six months after starting BP-lowering treatment, this certainly does not apply to the long-term life course treatment of hypertension. A post hoc analysis of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation Trial did not confirm the widely promoted notion in single-pill combination (SPC) publications that earlier short-term differences in BP lowering would, over the long run, reduce cardiovascular endpoints. Furthermore, the European and International Societies of Hypertension instructions ignored that the association of multiple drugs in a single pharmaceutical formulation may affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each component and may lead to undesired interactions between components.

The trials and observational studies reviewed in this debate article were generally not powered or had a duration not long enough to highlight serious adverse effects. An observational study of patients aged 50 years or more, reflecting a real-world setting, showed that the use of SPCs was associated with a greater risk of hypotension than titrated single-drug (SD) free combinations. Moreover, an abstraction made of commonly attributable adverse effects, for example, could lead to inaccurate conclusions about the safety of SPCs.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of the effectiveness and safety of lisinopril for children with hypertension [^1179kB32]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread use of lisinopril in hypertensive children, its safety and effectiveness had not been previously tested in a controlled study. This study explored the dose-response relationship and safety of lisinopril in 115 hypertensive children, aged 6 to 16 years.

Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion for 2 weeks into one of three doses by body weight at baseline: low (1.25 mg), middle (5 mg), and high (40 mg) for those weighing or equal to 50 kg. The dose-response for lisinopril was evaluated by analyzing the change in slope in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP) by dose after 2 weeks of therapy compared to baseline. Patients then entered a double-blind withdrawal, where they were either switched to placebo or continued their lisinopril treatment for up to 2 weeks.

Antihypertensive effectiveness between placebo and lisinopril was determined for all doses, and adverse events were carefully monitored.

There was a dose-response relationship between the lowest and each of the higher doses of lisinopril. Blood pressure in the placebo group increased after withdrawal of lisinopril. The dose-response relationship was consistent across all subgroups (i.e. age, Tanner stage, ethnicity, gender).

Lisinopril, administered once daily, is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive in children aged 6 to 16 years. An initial dose of 0.07 mg/kg, administered once daily, effectively lowered BP within 2 weeks.

### Treatment-resistant hypertension and outcomes based on randomized treatment group in ALLHAT [^114uFnHh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Although hypertension guidelines define treatment-resistant hypertension as blood pressure uncontrolled by three or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, it is unknown whether patient prognosis differs when a diuretic is included.

- **Methods**: Participants in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) were randomly assigned to first-step therapy with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril. At a year 2 follow-up visit, those with an average blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher systolic or 90 mm Hg or higher diastolic on three or more antihypertensive medications, or blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg on four or more antihypertensive medications, were identified as having apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. The prevalence of treatment-resistant hypertension and its association with ALLHAT primary (combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and secondary (all-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure, combined coronary heart disease, and combined cardiovascular disease) outcomes were identified for each treatment group.

- **Results**: Of participants assigned to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril, 9.6%, 11.4%, and 19.7%, respectively, had treatment-resistant hypertension. During a mean follow-up of 2.9 years, primary outcome incidence was similar for those assigned to chlorthalidone compared with amlodipine or lisinopril (amlodipine- vs. chlorthalidone-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.39; p = 0.53; lisinopril- vs. chlorthalidone-adjusted HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.70–1.60; p = 0.78).

### Aceon [^115abfW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2013). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

- **Hypertension**: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure, measured just before the next dose, is controlled or to a maximum of 16 mg per day.

	- **Use in uncomplicated hypertensive patients**: In patients with essential hypertension, the recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated as needed to a maximum of 16 mg per day. The usual maintenance dose range is 4 mg to 8 mg, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses.

	- **Use in elderly patients**: The recommended initial daily dosage of Aceon for the elderly is 4 mg daily, given in one or two divided doses. Experience with Aceon is limited in the elderly at doses exceeding 8 mg. Dosages above 8 mg should be administered with careful blood pressure monitoring and dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

	- **Use with diuretics**: In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension can occur following the initial dose of Aceon. Consider reducing the dose of diuretic prior to starting Aceon [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Stable coronary artery disease**: In patients with stable coronary artery disease, Aceon should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks, and then increased as tolerated, to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily.

### Efficacy and safety of high-dose lisinopril in chronic heart failure patients at high cardiovascular risk, including those with diabetes mellitus. Results from the ATLAS trial [^115paYJ8]. European Heart Journal (2000). Low credibility.

An analysis was designed to determine whether chronic heart failure patients at high cardiovascular risk benefited to the same extent from high-dose lisinopril as the whole ATLAS population.

- **Methods and results**: A retrospective analysis was performed on high-risk heart failure patients in the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril And Survival (ATLAS) trial, totaling 3,164 patients. This study compared high-dose (32.5–35 mg/day) versus low-dose (2.5–5 mg/day) lisinopril over a median of 46 months. The high-risk patients included those with hypotension, hyponatremia, compromised renal function, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline. In the whole study population, high-dose lisinopril led to a trend in risk reduction of all-cause mortality (primary endpoint P = 0.128) and a significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality plus hospitalization (principal secondary endpoint P = 0.002). Subgroup analyses were conducted for these endpoints. There were no consistent interactions between age, baseline sodium, creatinine or potassium values, and treatment effect. Diabetics exhibited a beneficial response to high-dose therapy that was at least as favorable as that in non-diabetics. The higher morbidity/mortality rates in diabetics mean that high-dose lisinopril has potential for greater absolute clinical impact in these patients.

- **Conclusion**: Long-term high-dose lisinopril was as effective and well-tolerated in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes mellitus, as it was for the ATLAS study population as a whole.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: What is the 'right' dose [^113C3CKD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

It is important to consider the actual dose in the treatment arms in the two larger trials. In ATLAS, these were 4.5 versus 33.2 mg of lisinopril, and in HEAAL, 46 versus 129 mg of losartan. ATLAS is perhaps most striking in suggesting that even a small dose (one-seventh of the higher dose) preserves much of the benefit of a larger dose of an ACE inhibitor. However, we still face the problem of determining the equivalent dose of enalapril or candesartan corresponding to 4.5 mg of lisinopril. There are no satisfactory comparisons of doses of lisinopril and enalapril, or doses of lisinopril and candesartan, in individuals with heart failure. However, existing data and comparisons in hypertension suggest that the low dose of lisinopril used in ATLAS was probably equivalent to less than 10 mg of enalapril.

In both HEAAL and ATLAS, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drugs did not differ between the high and low-dose groups. In both trials, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalaemia occurred more frequently in the higher dose group, but there was no significant excess of discontinuation for any of these reasons in the higher dose group in either trial.

Although three trials comparing doses of beta-blockers showed a greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction with larger doses, each trial was small and reported too few deaths and hospital admissions (or reported these incompletely) to draw any meaningful conclusion about a dose-related effect on outcomes. Two of these trials compared carvedilol over a wide daily dose range (5 to 50 mg).

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^115hceBh]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the BP efficacy of valsartan for once-daily dosing, the sample size calculation was based on a non-inferiority comparison of the 320 mg valsartan-based treatment strategy to the 40 mg lisinopril-based treatment strategy by a clinically accepted margin (delta) of 4 mmHg. Lisinopril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor with effective 24-hour BP lowering with once-daily dosing. A sample size of 264 patients per arm was required to have at least 90% power (standard deviation (SD) = 13 mmHg, α-level for statistical significance of 0.0125 (one-sided) following a Bonferroni adjustment). All statistical analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints were performed using two-sided tests with a significance level of 5%. For all efficacy variables, the intent-to-treat population was used for the analyses. The safety population consisted of patients who received at least one dose of the double-blind study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. The randomization visit was used as the baseline measurement period for all efficacy analyses. The BP control rates were compared using logistic regression with treatment, sex, and statin use at baseline as fixed factors and age as a covariate. Changes in 24-hour maSBP from baseline at Weeks 12 and 26 were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline as a covariate and considering a non-inferiority margin of 4 mmHg. The same ANCOVA model was applied for the analyses of the secondary variables. Descriptive analyses for nondipper rates, daytime/night-time SBP and DBP ratio, early morning BP lowering, were conducted.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful, and the actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes) were included. These trials compared the combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as the initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report outcomes such as mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

### Lisinopril therapy for hemodialysis hypertension: Hemodynamic and endocrine responses [^111kKjud]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril, a renally excreted angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, we assessed supervised administration of the drug after hemodialysis (HD) three times weekly. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed by interdialytic 44-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) monitoring, and endocrine responses were assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA) before and after dialysis. The lisinopril dose was titrated at biweekly intervals. If this was not effective after full titration (lisinopril to 40 mg three times weekly), ultrafiltration was added to reduce dry weight.

The primary outcome variable was the change in BP from the end of the run-in period to the end of the study. No change in mean ABP was noted during the run-in period. However, mean 44-hour ABP decreased from 149 ± 14 (SD)/84 ± 9 to 127 ± 16/73 ± 9 mm Hg, a decrease of 22/11 mm Hg.

At the final visit, five patients had a systolic ABP of ≥ 135 mm Hg, and one patient had diastolic hypertension (≥ 85 mm Hg). Four patients were administered 10 mg of lisinopril; five patients, 20 mg; and two patients, 40 mg. Only one of these patients required ultrafiltration therapy. There was a persistent antihypertensive effect over 44 hours. BP reduction was achieved without an increase in intradialytic symptomatic or asymptomatic hypotensive episodes. PRA increased in response to dialysis, as well as lisinopril.

In conclusion, supervised lisinopril therapy is effective in controlling hypertension in chronic HD patients. This may be related to the blockade of…

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^116RrMfd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related BP lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension. To determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate and to evaluate adverse events (mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects, and specific adverse events such as dry cough, diarrhea, and angioedema).

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared renin inhibitors to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.

### Long-term effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and diastolic function in elderly, previously untreated hypertensive patients: the ELVERA trial [^1137H1Vy]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a calcium antagonist (amlodipine) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) on left ventricular mass and diastolic function in elderly, previously untreated hypertensive patients.

- **Design**: A double-blind randomized parallel group trial examined the effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and diastolic function, specifically the E/A ratio, as part of the ELVERA trial.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in rural northern Netherlands with a population screening for newly diagnosed hypertensive subjects.

- **Patients**: The study population comprised 166 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, aged 60–75, with a diastolic blood pressure between 95–115 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure between 160–220 mmHg.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly allocated to receive either 5–10 mg of amlodipine or 10–20 mg of lisinopril for a duration of two years.

- **Main outcome measures**: Left ventricular mass, indexed by body surface (LVMI), was estimated using 2-D mode echocardiography according to the Devereux method and the Penn convention before, and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. The early to atrial filling ratio (E/A) was assessed by transmitral flow. Changes from baseline in LVMI and E/A ratio were evaluated using repeated measurements to analyze the treatment effect in an intention-to-treat analysis.

Results indicated both amlodipine and lisinopril led to equivalent reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. By the end of the study, the amlodipine group experienced a reduction in LVMI by 21.8 g/m (95% confidence interval, 18.3–25.3) and an increase in the E/A ratio by 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05–0.11). In the lisinopril group, the decrease in LVMI was 22.4 g/m (95% CI, 19.0-).
