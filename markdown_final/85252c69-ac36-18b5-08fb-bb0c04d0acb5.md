expound on the pathophysiology of LCH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical paradigm and how it shifted from inflammatory to neoplastic. Then, I should verify the clonal and genetic evidence, especially MAPK pathway mutations. Next, I will examine the cell of origin and developmental hierarchy. After that, I need to integrate how these biological insights explain clinical heterogeneity and organ tropism. Finally, I should consider therapeutic implications, limitations, and future directions, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the historical context and the paradigm shift. Historically, LCH was viewed as a reactive inflammatory disorder, but the demonstration of clonal histiocytes and recurrent activating MAPK pathway mutations has reclassified LCH as a clonal myeloid neoplasm with inflammatory features, a position reflected in contemporary WHO and International Consensus classifications and echoed by multiple expert reviews and guidelines [^60a0a2c7] [^2c91f30f] [^3a6bc71f].

> Wait, let me verify the clonality and genetic drivers before drawing conclusions. Clonality of lesional CD1a+/CD207+ cells has been demonstrated, and recurrent somatic mutations in the MAPK pathway are found in the vast majority of cases, with BRAF V600E in roughly 50–60% and MAP2K1 in about 10–28%, while other MAPK genes such as KRAS, NRAS, ARAF, and rare fusions or indels account for additional cases, yielding near-universal ERK activation across lesions regardless of the specific mutation [^d41056d1] [^b1dd50c6] [^92d3f45a].

> Hold on, I should verify the cell of origin because this shapes phenotype. Early models assumed epidermal Langerhans cells as the source, but emerging data indicate that LCH arises from myeloid precursors, with multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells implicated in high-risk multisystem disease and more committed myeloid precursors in low-risk or single-system disease; single-cell and epigenomic studies reveal a developmental hierarchy within lesions, including proliferative progenitors and differentiated LCH cells, which helps explain clinical heterogeneity [^0c750172] [^bddf612a] [^2ab29531].

> I need to check how these mutations mechanistically drive disease. BRAF V600E and other MAPK alterations confer constitutive ERK signaling, promoting proliferation, survival, and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype in myeloid cells; in model systems, BRAF V600E expression in early progenitors induces senescence with a SASP that skews differentiation toward mononuclear phagocytes and fosters lesional inflammation, while extracellular vesicles from LCH cells carry transcripts that can activate NK cells, linking oncogenic signaling to immune modulation and tissue damage [^059eb3fb] [^41d6dff5] [^6c4147d4].

> Let me consider the clinical heterogeneity and organ tropism through this lens. The same MAPK mutation in a more primitive progenitor tends to produce multisystem, risk-organ disease, whereas the same mutation in a committed precursor yields localized, single-system disease; tissue-specific cues and the inflammatory milieu likely modulate lesional architecture, explaining predilection for bone, skin, pituitary, liver, spleen, lung, and CNS, and the observation that BRAF V600E associates with more extensive disease and higher risks of treatment failure and neurodegeneration, although extent remains the dominant prognostic factor [^bddf612a] [^d41056d1] [^f652df73].

> But wait, what if the inflammatory component is not just epiphenomenal. I should double-check the role of cytokines and immune cells. LCH lesions contain a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with T cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and osteoclast-like giant cells, and there is a lesional and systemic cytokine storm with elevated TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and others; this inflammatory milieu contributes to tissue destruction and may persist even when CD1a+ LCH cells are sparse, underscoring that both clonal myeloid cells and their secretome shape disease biology [^610933a0] [^63314420] [^41d6dff5].

> Next, I should review therapeutic implications and where they fall short. Risk-adapted chemotherapy remains standard, with vinblastine plus prednisone for multisystem disease, but BRAF and MEK inhibitors achieve rapid clinical responses and suppress systemic inflammation; however, they rarely eradicate the mutant clone, and relapse after discontinuation is common, prompting interest in combination strategies and in longitudinal mutation monitoring to guide therapy and detect persistence of HSC-derived clones [^f24c9b8a] [^d34b59e7] [^3f1f8a41].

> Hold on, I should verify the neurodegeneration piece because it is a major morbidity. LCH-associated neurodegeneration appears to reflect a T cell–dominated inflammatory process with neuronal and axonal loss and microglial activation, sometimes without direct CD1a+ infiltration; emerging data suggest circulating BRAF-mutant myeloid cells may precede blood–brain barrier disruption and CNS infiltration, and skull-base bone lesions may portend higher ND risk, though mechanisms remain under active investigation [^711576db] [^514669ea] [^3f1f8a41].

> I should confirm the current diagnostic standards that reflect this pathophysiology. Contemporary guidelines recommend tissue confirmation when feasible, immunophenotyping for CD1a/CD207, and molecular testing for BRAF V600E with broader MAPK panel when BRAF is wild-type, integrating clinical and imaging features; this molecular-genetic approach supports both diagnosis and identification of actionable targets for therapy [^350a7778] [^5e80a5c9] [^d8ee4bd7].

> Let me reconsider limitations and future directions so I don't overstate certainty. Key gaps include the precise identity of the LCH precursor, why the same mutation produces different phenotypes, how to eradicate the mutant HSC clone, and how to predict and prevent neurodegeneration; longitudinal, multi-omic studies and international collaboration are emphasized to build biomarker-driven, personalized strategies and to test combinations of targeted and conventional therapy [^683b8e88] [^bb0b360d] [^e1f3c6fa].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent: LCH is a clonal myeloid neoplasm driven by MAPK-activating mutations that arise at different stages of myeloid differentiation, producing a developmental hierarchy of pathogenic cells whose proliferation, survival, and secretory programs create inflammatory granulomas and organ dysfunction; this unified model explains clinical heterogeneity, guides risk stratification, and supports targeted therapy, while acknowledging that cure likely requires deeper eradication of the mutant clone and mitigation of inflammatory sequelae [^3a6bc71f] [^0c750172] [^059eb3fb].

LCH is a **clonal myeloid neoplasm** driven by **MAPK pathway activation** (most often BRAF V600E) in myeloid precursors, leading to accumulation of CD1a+/CD207+ cells in lesions [^3a6bc71f] [^d41056d1]. These cells show **senescence with a SASP** that fuels inflammation and tissue damage, explaining the disease's inflammatory phenotype and organ tropism [^059eb3fb]. The clinical spectrum reflects the mutation's timing and lineage: early progenitor mutations cause multisystem, risk-organ disease, while committed precursor mutations yield localized disease [^bddf612a]. Targeted MAPK inhibition controls disease but rarely eradicates the clone, so relapse is common and cure remains elusive [^d34b59e7] [^3f1f8a41].

---

## Genetic and molecular basis

- **Clonal myeloid neoplasm**: LCH arises from clonal expansion of myeloid precursors with MAPK pathway activation, most commonly BRAF V600E, and also MAP2K1, KRAS, NRAS, ARAF, and ERBB3 mutations [^3a6bc71f] [^d41056d1] [^92d3f45a].

- **Universal ERK activation**: Nearly all lesions show phospho-ERK, indicating MAPK pathway activation regardless of the specific mutation [^d34b59e7] [^b8e3455d].

- **Cell of origin**: Mutations occur in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells or committed myeloid precursors, not epidermal Langerhans cells, explaining the myeloid phenotype [^0c750172] [^bddf612a].

---

## Cellular mechanisms

- **Senescence and SASP**: BRAF V600E induces senescence in myeloid precursors with a SASP that promotes inflammation, recruitment, and tissue damage [^059eb3fb].

- **Extracellular vesicles**: LCH cells release EVs enriched in MAPK and adhesion transcripts that activate NK cells and propagate inflammation [^41d6dff5] [^6c4147d4].

- **Immune evasion**: LCH lesions show a suppressive microenvironment with reduced T-cell function, aiding persistence [^41d6dff5].

---

## Clinical heterogeneity

Clinical heterogeneity reflects **mutation timing and lineage**: early progenitor mutations drive multisystem, risk-organ disease, whereas committed precursor mutations yield localized disease [^bddf612a]. Organ tropism is shaped by chemokine/cytokine gradients and the SASP, explaining predilection for bone, skin, liver, spleen, lung, and CNS [^6bf22b6b] [^059eb3fb].

---

## Therapeutic implications

- **MAPK inhibition**: BRAF/MEK inhibitors achieve rapid responses but rarely eradicate the clone, so relapse is common after cessation [^d34b59e7] [^3f1f8a41].

- **Combination strategies**: Trials combining MAPK inhibitors with chemotherapy aim to eradicate mutant clones and reduce relapse [^e1f3c6fa].

- **Biomarkers**: Detectable BRAF V600E in blood predicts relapse and may guide therapy intensity [^notfound].

---

## Unresolved questions

Unresolved questions include the **exact cell of origin** — whether HSCs or committed precursors are the critical reservoir — and the **mechanisms of neurodegeneration**, including how BRAF-mutant myeloid cells cross the blood–brain barrier and whether resident microglia are involved [^514669ea]. Additional priorities are strategies to eradicate **persistent clones** and prevent relapse, and the development of biomarkers to predict relapse and neurodegeneration risk [^683b8e88].

---

LCH is a **clonal myeloid neoplasm** with MAPK-driven senescence and inflammation; **targeted therapy controls disease** but does not cure, and **persistent clones** drive relapse and late sequelae.

### New insights into the molecular pathogenesis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^610933a0]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare proliferative disorder characterized by an accumulation of cells sharing the major phenotypic features of cutaneous Langerhans cells. Given its variable clinical evolution, ranging from self-limiting lesions to multisystemic forms with a poor prognosis, in the last decades it has been debated whether LCH might not have a neoplastic rather than an inflammatory nature. However, although the fundamental events underlying the pathogenesis of LCH are still elusive, recent advances have strikingly improved our understanding of the disease. In particular, the identification of multiple interplays between LCH cells and their tumor microenvironment, along with the recognition of the lesional cytokine storm as a key determinant of LCH progression, has substantiated new opportunities for devising targeted therapeutic approaches. Strikingly, the detection of the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma isoform B(V600E) gain-of-function mutation as a genetic alteration recurring in more than 50% of patients has fueled the paradoxical picture of LCH as a tumor of the antigen-presenting cells that can evade rejection by the immune system. Thus, new evidence regarding the ontogeny of LCH cells, as well as a better understanding of the putative immune system frustrating strategy in LCH, may help to define the precise pathogenesis.

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a clinicopathologic review and molecular pathogenetic update [^538b4956]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) comprises a wide spectrum of clinical disorders that have in common a proliferation of Langerhans-type cells with characteristic morphologic, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural features. In part because of the diverse clinical manifestations of LCH, there has long been controversy over whether LCH is best considered a reactive process or a neoplasm. Herein, we discuss the clinical and pathologic features of LCH, including recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease that support its categorization as a neoplasm. We also review the implications that these recently described molecular characteristics may have on risk stratification and treatment of LCH.

### How I treat Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^2c91f30f]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

"Langerhans cell histiocytosis" (LCH) describes a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from a single bone lesion or trivial skin rash to an explosive disseminated disease. Regardless of clinical severity, LCH lesions share the common histology of CD1a(+)/CD207(+) dendritic cells with characteristic morphology among an inflammatory infiltrate. Despite historical uncertainty defining LCH as inflammatory vs neoplastic and incomplete understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis, clinical outcomes have improved markedly over the past decades through cooperative randomized clinical trials based on empiric therapeutic strategies. Significant advances include recognition of high- and low-risk clinical groups defined by hematopoietic and/or hepatic involvement, and of the importance of optimal intensity and of duration of chemotherapy. Nevertheless, mortality of high-risk patients, disease recurrence, lack of robustly tested salvage strategies, and significant disease morbidity of both high- and low-risk patients remain challenges. Recent discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway genes at critical stages of myeloid hematopoietic differentiation in LCH patients supports redefinition of the disease as a myeloproliferative disorder and provides opportunities to develop novel approaches to diagnosis and therapy.

### Recent advances in the understanding of Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^c6b1fd2d]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a proliferative disease of cells that share phenotypic characteristics with the primary antigen presenting cells of the epidermis. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable, extending from very benign forms to a disseminated, aggressive disease that causes significant mortality. Although many of the fundamental pathogenetic features of LCH have been enigmatic, recent advances have led to a much clearer understanding of the disease. In particular, careful molecular analyses of mouse models and human LCH samples suggest that LCH's cell of origin may not be the epidermal LC itself but a myeloid-derived precursor. Advanced genomic technologies have revealed the presence of activating, somatic BRAF mutations in the majority of patient specimens. Together, these observations have produced a new picture of LCH as a myeloid neoplasm. These advances are likely to have profound implications for the use of targeted therapeutics in LCH.

### Histiocyte society blueprint for Langerhans cell histiocytosis research: from cell-of-origin to a more comprehensive cure [^683b8e88]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare myeloid neoplastic disorder driven by tissue-accumulating histiocytes expressing somatic mutations mostly in genes encoding components of the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from self-limiting unifocal lesions to severe, multisystem disease. As a result of new therapeutic strategies, the outcomes of patients with LCH have improved significantly during the past decade. Although mortality risk is minimal nowadays, a substantial proportion of patients experience significant morbidity due to (recurrent) disease reactivations or the development of (late) complications such as organ dysfunction - including neurodegeneration - or second hematologic cancers. To date, there are no prognostic tools that adequately predict who is at risk of developing such late sequelae. Given that all major clinical advances in the field of LCH have been driven by pivotal discoveries regarding its pathophysiology, we advocate that a deeper understanding of the cell-of-origin that gives rise to pathology-inducing cells found in the patients' blood and tissues before treatment initiation and occasionally even after treatment completion is an important missing piece of evidence with respect to understanding the pathophysiology of LCH and its late effects. Emerging techniques, such as longitudinal monitoring of driver mutations in the blood, now offer the potential to unveil the biological dynamics of the disease over its natural history. It is hoped that the much needed information, obtainable only through international collaboration and sustained long-term research projects, will bridge current gaps in clinical decision-making with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes of LCH patients worldwide.

Conclusions

While it may be rare today for a patient to die directly from LCH, patients' outcomes are still burdened by significant morbidity, caused by repeated reactivations and long-term sequelae of the disease. To improve outcomes of all patients with LCH, we must gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease persistence and the biological determinants of CNS damage. This is essential to optimize preventive and personalized treatment approaches. International collaboration remains an essential priority, as the rarity of LCH makes randomized controlled trials challenging and time-intensive. Conducting regional well-designed prospective studies combined with molecular driver and other candidate biomarker monitoring studies, coordinated by established consortia (COG, ECHO, NACHO) under the umbrella of the Histiocyte Society, would be the way forward to reach these goals. The histiocytosis community should assist in increasing awareness of LCH among relevant healthcare providers and assure patients' access to local centers of expertise in which LCH-dedicated care and research are optimally integrated.

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): guidelines for diagnosis, clinical work-up, and treatment for patients till the age of 18 years [^8a4776ef]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by accumulation of dendritic cells with features similar to epidermal Langerhans cells in various organs. Any organ or system of the human body can be affected, but those more frequently involved are the skeleton (80% of cases), the skin (33%), and the pituitary (25%). Other organs involved are the liver, spleen, the hematopoietic system and the lungs (15% each), lymph nodes (5–10%), and the central nervous system excluding the pituitary (2–4%). The clinical course may vary from a self-limiting disease to a rapidly progressive one that might lead to death. Between 30% and 40% of patients may develop permanent adverse sequelae. Treatment options vary depending on the extent of the disease and the severity at onset. Response to front-line treatment is an important information to adapt the therapeutic strategy. As LCH is a rare disease, only a limited number of large surveys or of randomized clinical trials are available in the literature and many aspects of the management of patients remain obscure or controversial. The presented guidelines are based on published evidence and the clinical expertise of the authors. They are intended to provide guidance with respect to diagnosis and clinical work-up of LCH occurring in patients < 18 years old. The recommendations can neither replace the physician's own professional judgement nor consider all special clinical circumstances which may apply to individual cases.

### International expert consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in adults [^211fbfae]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

An international, multidisciplinary group of physicians and scientists convened at the annual Histiocyte Society meeting on 3 November 2019 to initiate the process of updating the adult LCH consensus recommendations. The group was comprised of experts from multiple subspecialties with experience in the clinical care/research of LCH and related histiocytic disorders (supplemental Table 1). The proposed update was based on 1) novel data since prior guideline publication in 2013 and 2) group members' evolving experience with LCH in adults. We generated key recommendation statements (consensus statements or CS#1–32) (Table 1) and recorded the votes by coauthors as "agreement", "disagreement", and "not-qualified to answer" using a modified Delphi approach as previously described (supplemental Appendix 1). The degree of consensus for each statement was categorized into: A (strong consensus: ≥ 95%), B (consensus: 75–94%), and C (majority agreement: 50–74%).

### Progress in understanding the pathogenesis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis: back to histiocytosis X? [^440e0dc9]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), the most common histiocytic disorder, is characterized by the accumulation of CD1A(+) /CD207(+) mononuclear phagocytes within granulomatous lesions that can affect nearly all organ systems. Historically, LCH has been presumed to arise from transformed or pathologically activated epidermal dendritic cells called Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the ERK signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology. Based on these findings, we propose that LCH should be re-defined as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasia. Increased understanding of LCH pathogenesis will provide opportunities to optimize and personalize therapy through improved risk-stratification, targeted therapy and assessment of therapy response based on specific molecular features and origin of the pathological myeloid cells.

### Clinical implications of oncogenic mutations in pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^542a61ed]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a neoplasm of dendritic cells with a wide clinical spectrum. Localized pulmonary LCH occurs in young adults with a history of smoking and can either resolve spontaneously or lead to progressive decline in pulmonary function. Young children can also present with localized disease - frequently bone or skin - or with multifocal or multisystem disease. Clinical outcomes in these patients also vary widely, ranging from spontaneous resolution to multiorgan failure and death. This review describes recent developments in our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of LCH and how these discoveries and other research are affecting how the disease is classified, treated and monitored.

Recent Findings

Somatic mutations resulting in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway were recently identified as a key pathogenetic mechanism in both pediatric and pulmonary LCH.

Summary

Knowledge of underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of LCH transforming how this disease and other histocytic/dendritic disorders are classified, treated and monitored.

### Cell (s) of origin of Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^bddf612a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is heterogeneous disease characterized by common histology of inflammatory lesions containing Langerin(+) (CD207) histiocytes. Emerging data support a model in which MAPK activation in self-renewing hematopoietic progenitors may drive disseminated high-risk disease, whereas MAPK activation in more differentiated committed myeloid populations may induce low-risk LCH. The heterogeneous clinical manifestations with shared histology may represent the final common pathway of an acquired defect of differentiation, initiated at more than one point. Implications of this model include re-definition of LCH as a myeloid neoplasia and re-focusing therapeutic strategies on the cells and lineages of origin.

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^3a6bc71f]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is caused by clonal expansion of myeloid precursors that differentiate into CD1a+/CD207+ cells in lesions that leads to a spectrum of organ involvement and dysfunction. The pathogenic cells are defined by constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Treatment of LCH is risk-adapted: patients with single lesions may respond well to local treatment, whereas patients with multisystem disease require systemic therapy. Although survival rates for patients without organ dysfunction is excellent, mortality rates for patients with organ dysfunction may reach 20%. Despite progress made in the treatment of LCH, disease reactivation rates remain above 30%, and standard second-line treatment is yet to be established. Treatment failure is associated with increased risks for death and long-term morbidity, including LCH-associated neurodegeneration. Early case series report promising clinical responses in patients with relapsed and refractory LCH treated with BRAF or MEK inhibitors, although potential for this strategy to achieve cure remains uncertain.

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): guidelines for diagnosis, clinical work-up, and treatment for patients till the age of 18 years [^459f45b6]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

METHODS

This document is derived from the project Euro Histio Net 2008, a reference network for LCH and associated syndromes in the European Union which received funding within the framework of the Public Health Program. The guidelines were designed and established by European and North American physicians considered to be experts in the field of pediatric histiocytic disorders. They are active members of the international medical society of histiocytoses "Histiocyte Society" (HS), of the European national societies of Hematology/Oncology, and of their respective national groups for the study and treatment of these diseases. The guidelines have been developed for use as recommended practice in the evaluation and treatment of children and teenagers up to 18 years with LCH. Scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals up to January 2012 were systematically reviewed. In addition to the medical literature, the following guidelines are a synthesis of different international and national guidelines and recommendation documents.

Evidence was ranked in four levels: (A) meta-analyses, high quality systematic reviews, or randomized controlled trials with a low risk of bias; (B) systematic reviews of case–control or cohort studies; (C) non-analytic studies; for example, case reports, case series, small retrospective studies; (D) expert opinion. Level of agreement between experts and data was ranked in three classes: (2) general agreement between all experts or between available studies; (1) discussed recommendation, but no formal objections between experts or mild difference between studies, without contradiction for the main endpoint; (0) divergence of opinion or contradictory results for the main endpoint.

### Langerhans-cell histiocytosis' insight into DC biology' [^6bf22b6b]. Trends in Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Langerhans-cell histiocytosis (LCH) is caused by an uncontrolled pathogenic clonal proliferation of dendritic cells (DCs) with Langerhans-cell (LC) characteristics. LCH cells are arrested in an immature, partially activated stage and show a deviant regulation of cell division. Their aberrant interactions with T cells and the lesional microenvironment are typified by high level production of diverse cytokines. Chemokine and chemokine receptor patterns probably explain LCH predilection sites and lesion composition, reminiscent of chronic granulomatous inflammation. Recent advances in LCH immunology suggest that clonal changes in DCs might underlie the aberrant immune interaction with T cells, leading to a unique pathological picture, which combines features of carcinogenesis and chronic inflammation.

### Epigenomics and single-cell sequencing define a developmental hierarchy in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^0c750172]. Cancer Discovery (2019). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare neoplasm predominantly affecting children. It occupies a hybrid position between cancers and inflammatory diseases, which makes it an attractive model for studying cancer development. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of LCH and its characteristic clinical heterogeneity, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic diversity in primary LCH lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified multiple recurrent types of LCH cells within these biopsies, including putative LCH progenitor cells and several subsets of differentiated LCH cells. We confirmed the presence of proliferative LCH cells in all analyzed biopsies using IHC, and we defined an epigenomic and gene-regulatory basis of the different LCH-cell subsets by chromatin-accessibility profiling. In summary, our single-cell analysis of LCH uncovered an unexpected degree of cellular, transcriptomic, and epigenomic heterogeneity among LCH cells, indicative of complex developmental hierarchies in LCH lesions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study sketches a molecular portrait of LCH lesions by combining single-cell transcriptomics with epigenome profiling. We uncovered extensive cellular heterogeneity, explained in part by an intrinsic developmental hierarchy of LCH cells. Our findings provide new insights and hypotheses for advancing LCH research and a starting point for personalizing therapy. See related commentary by Gruber et al., p. 1343. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1325.

### Genomic alterations in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^d41056d1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a myeloid neoplastic disorder characterized by inflammatory lesions with clonal histiocytes. LCH is driven by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations. BRAF V600E is the most common mutation and is associated with more extensive disease at presentation and risks of front-line treatment failure, liver disease, and LCH-associated neurodegeneration. Genetic ancestry influences LCH with highest incidence in Hispanic populations. MAPK inhibitors are effective, but do not achieve cure in most cases. Clinical trials prospectively testing risk-stratification based on somatic mutation and/or detectable mutation in peripheral blood may improve outcomes for LCH patients.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an updated overview of the pathogenesis and treatment of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD).

Recent Findings

There is ongoing debate as to the exact pathogenesis of these disorders and their classification as reactive versus neoplastic. Proinflammatory cytokines are known to play a role in both LCH and ECD and strengthen the hypothesis that, at least in part, they are disorders of immune dysregulation. The recent discovery of activating mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF in a subset of LCH patients suggests that LCH is in fact a neoplastic disorder. Understanding of the mechanisms that promote proliferation and migration of histiocytes has led researchers to explore targeted immune-modulatory therapies for ECD. Similarly for LCH, alternative chemotherapeutic agents and reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplant are being evaluated for refractory disease.

Summary

More research is needed to better understand the cause of these disorders and may help in identifying new targeted therapies, particularly for patients with refractory or relapsed disease. Multinational trials are ongoing for LCH and are urgently needed for ECD.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease. Depending on which organs are involved, the disease may prove rapidly fatal, develop a chronic reactivating but therapy-responsive pattern or resolve spontaneously. Understanding of the pathology of the disease is progressing rapidly, and while clinical trials of standard chemotherapy agents continue, it is likely that novel targeted therapy will become feasible in the next decade. Permanent consequences of the disease are more commoner than generally realised.

### Blood spotlight on Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^43e4d150]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease affecting people of any age, with widely variable clinical manifestations and different outcomes. The precise chain of events driving lesional granuloma formation has remained elusive for many years. There is evidence for inherited predisposition to and derangement of apoptosis and inflammation in lesional dendritic cells. Recently somatic BRAF(V600E) mutation in myeloid precursor dendritic cells was associated with the more aggressive form of the disease, although the same mutation in a more differentiated dendritic cell might drive a less aggressive disease. Whether this picture convincingly put LCH in the field of myeloid neoplasm remains to be determined. Altogether, these findings suggest that future therapeutic strategy might incorporate a screening of this genetic mutation for high-risk patients potentially suitable for target therapy.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of pathological CD1a + and CD207 + cells in one or more organ systems. Once called histiocytosis X (X standing for "unknown"), it was renamed LCH after the discovery of langerin expression in biopsies from subjects with the disorder. Langerin is a protein encoded by the CD207 gene which is essential for forming Birbeck granules, the zipper-like organelles that are unique to normal Langerhans cells (LC). Transcriptomic profiling of LCH biopsies performed several decades later revealed, however, that pathological histiocytes accumulating in LCH lesions have a unique transcriptomic profile, which minimally overlaps transcriptomic activity of resident tissue LC. Lesional CD1a + /CD207 + histiocytes often co-express myeloid lineage markers (CD33, CD14 and CD163) typically expressed by circulating monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. This fits with the reported potential of the latter cells to differentiate into CD1a + /CD207 + cells when exposed to certain growth factors. These more recent findings suggest that monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells are the immediate precursor cells of LC 'look-alike' histiocytes found in LCH lesions.

LCH lesions additionally comprise lymphocytes and other myeloid cells such as granulocytes, macrophages, and osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells. Collectively, these cells induce inflammation and structural damage to infiltrated organs. Due to its clonal nature and expression of gain-of-function somatic mutations, LCH is best described as a clonal myeloid neoplastic disorder with inflammatory features. Accordingly, LCH is part of a combined group of histiocytic/dendritic cell-driven neoplastic disorders recognized by the International Consensus Classification and the World Health Organization classification of hematolymphoid tumors. As our biological understanding of LCH has progressed over the past decades, so too has our ability to treat the disease. The Histiocyte Society has played a major role in several international clinical trials and death from LCH is now incredibly rare due to well-established frontline therapy. However, relapses and long-term morbidities, such as devastating neurodegeneration, remain clinical challenges.

The aim of this paper is to review the major clinical and pathobiological milestones in LCH reached in the last two decades. We also spotlight critical, unanswered questions that need to be addressed to further improve the clinical management and outcomes of patients with LCH.

Perspectives

LCH is a rare disease potentially resulting in death or permanent sequelae. The burden of therapy may also be extremely heavy. There is an obvious need for a full assessment of each patient with a rational treatment tailored to the risks of the individual patient, which contributes to further fundamental and clinical research in this field.

In 2010, Badalian-Very et al. reported somatic mutations of the BRAF oncogene in about half of the LCH patients in their series, and this finding was recently confirmed by other teams. This discovery may have a significant potential impact if we consider the possibility of treating LCH with the new class of BRAF inhibitors. However, this promising discovery will need to be verified and concretized before these drugs can be used for treatment of LCH. The group(s) of LCH patients who may benefit from BRAF inhibitor treatment must be determined and balanced with toxicities as in the case of melanoma. Knowledge about drug schedule and safety, especially long-term effects and mechanisms of resistance must be acquired.

Progress may be expected from collaborations organized at national and international levels, among specialist groups and expert networks. Collection of tissue and blood samples in biobanks is essential for improving the understanding of the biology of this rare and fascinating condition. New international protocols will soon be opened and continue to represent an opportunity to develop global research in LCH (seeand).

Lack of information on incidence, natural history and long-term outcomes

Despite numerous advances in deciphering the biology and treatments of non-LCH, their true incidence is unknown. There is a need to determine the global incidence and prevalence of these disorders to aid with targeted resource allocation and educational efforts. There is also a lack of understanding of the natural history and long-term outcomes to inform treatment choices. While there is some sense of predictors of 'high-risk' disease (liver, spleen, bone marrow involvement) in LCH, such data are very sparse in non-LCH. Conversely, the predictors of 'low-risk' disease are equally important as patients with such disease may not warrant systemic treatments. Indeed, existing cohorts have reported spontaneous, remissions in all non-LCH subtypes, even within MHN. Furthermore, with improvement in treatments, there is a growing population of non-LCH survivors who are at risk of late complications as a result of the disease and/or its treatments. Recent studies have demonstrated the occurrence of clonally related myeloid neoplasms in ECD and ECD/LCH overlap, leading to near universal mortality. The delayed diagnosis further complicates the morbidity burden, leading to organ dysfunction that may not be reversible. There is a need for large studies to address these unresolved issues.

Histiocytic neoplasms are rare hematologic disorders characterized by pathological infiltration of myeloid-derived cells in various organs, resulting in diverse manifestations. Traditionally, histiocytic neoplasms were classified into Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and non-LCH, the latter comprising a heterogeneous group of diseases including Erdheim-Chester disease, xanthogranuloma family of lesions, Rosai-Dorfman disease, indeterminate cell histiocytosis, and malignant histiocytic neoplasms. Over the past decade, the discovery of recurrent somatic alterations in the MAPK pathway has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of these disorders, enabling the use of targeted therapies and significantly improving patients' outcomes. Despite these advances, critical gaps remain in our understanding and treatment of non-LCH. Challenges include adverse effects from prolonged use of targeted therapies, insufficient data on the natural history of these diseases, outdated nomenclature and classification systems that fail to account for emerging insights, and limited availability of clinical trials due to the rarity of the conditions. In this article, we synthesize key advancements in the field and propose a blueprint for future research to address these unmet needs. We emphasize the importance of collaborative efforts, such as large, multi-institutional registries and novel clinical trials, to generate robust, high-quality data that can guide diagnostic, management, and prognostic strategies.

### Neuropathology of CNS disease in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^711576db]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

CNS involvement in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare but potentially devastating disorder. Different types of involvement have been described by MRI. CNS changes can have space-occupying or degenerative character. Little is known about the underlying neuropathology and pathophysiology. In our study we reviewed brain samples from 12 patients with LCH. The neuropathology findings were correlated with the MR morphology and the clinical presentation. By neuropathology, three types of lesions were distinguished. (i) Circumscribed granulomas within the brain's connective tissue space corresponded to tumorous lesions in the meninges or choroid plexus on MRI. They showed a composition similar to Langerhans granulomas in peripheral organs, with variable presence of CD1a-reactive cells and pronounced CD8-positive (+) T-cell infiltration. (ii) Granulomas occur within the brain's connective tissue spaces with partial infiltration of the surrounding CNS parenchyma by CD1a-reactive histiocytes. This was associated with profound T-cell-dominated inflammation and severe neurodegeneration, characterized by a nearly complete loss of neurons and axons, and gliosis. (iii) Neurodegenerative lesions lacking infiltration of CD1a+ cells, mainly affecting the cerebellum and brainstem, exhibited a profound inflammatory process dominated by CD8-reactive lymphocytes, associated with tissue degeneration, microglial activation and gliosis. Patients with such lesions showed different stages of neurological deterioration. This study indicates that neurodegeneration in LCH occurs on the background of a T-cell-dominated inflammatory process and is characterized by neuronal and axonal destruction with secondary demyelination, resembling paraneoplastic encephalitis.

Roadmap for future research

Establishing large, collaborative patient registries

The rarity and heterogeneity of non-LCH demand largescale collaboration. A global network of clinicians and researchers through scientific organizations (e.g. the Histiocyte Society) and patient advocacy groups (e.g. the Histiocytosis Association and ECD Global Alliance) can facilitate data-sharing, standardize diagnostic criteria, and improve patients' access to specialized care. It is critical to develop and expand international registries and biobanks to collect longitudinal clinical, genetic, and treatment data from patients across the spectrum of non-LCH. A centralized pathology repository using digital images may be a novel mechanism to develop uniform and systematic definitions for diagnostic criteria. Such resources will enable robust large-scale studies integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data, leading to a clinically and biologically informed classification system that supports precision diagnostics and therapy selection (Figure 5). In the long-term, such collaborative registries can inform the natural history of histiocytoses, which can in turn lead to risk stratification for clinical trials and practice.

### Clinicogenomic associations in childhood Langerhans cell histiocytosis: an international cohort study [^2d3c5ba3]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare hematologic neoplasm characterized by the accumulation of myeloid-differentiated cells with characteristic CD1a and CD207 expression in various tissues and organs. This disease primarily affects children, with an incidence similar to pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma. The clinical manifestation of LCH is highly heterogeneous, ranging from self-healing skin lesions or a solitary bone lesion to a life-threatening disease involving multiple organ systems (supplemental Figure 1). Disease extent is an established prognostic factor in pediatric LCH. The most severe clinical form of the disease tends to affect young children (aged < 2 years) and typically involves risk organs (ROs), including the hematopoietic system, liver, and spleen. LCH with RO involvement is often refractory to chemotherapy and associated with an increased risk of death; therefore, it is called "high-risk LCH". Although overall mortality of patients with LCH is low, a significant proportion of them experiences disease relapsesand/or develops permanent consequences, such as diabetes insipidus (DI) or neurodegenerative (ND)-LCH. Currently, the biological mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous clinical presentation and outcome of LCH remain incompletely understood.

### LCH, disseminated… [^47284589]. seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Per the IARC/WHO Committee for ICD-O and included in the WHO Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, Revised 4th Ed, Volume 2, only LCH disseminated/multisystem is now assigned /3 behavior. All other forms of LCH are no longer malignant and are not reportable except for benign Brain and CNS tumors.

1. **DISSEMINATED/MULTISYSTEM**: Occurs in infants who present with fever, cytopenia, skin and bone lesions, and hepatosplenomegaly. Pulmonary disease in childhood is clinically variable. The skin, bone, and marrow are preferential sites of involvement. The liver and spleen are also common sites; however, they are typically metastatic and not the primary site. Involvement of bone marrow, liver, and lung are regarded as high-risk factors.
2. **SOLITARY/UNIFOCAL form**: Usually occurs in older children or adults who most commonly present with a lytic bone lesion eroding the cortex.

Solitary lesions may occur at other sites as mass lesions or enlarged lymph nodes. Other sites include adjacent soft tissue and less commonly lymph nodes, skin and lung.

Unanswered questions and future directions

Reactivation rates remain significant in pediatric LCH, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 37% in MS-RO – patients and 25–29% in MS-RO + patients treated with the 12-month LCH-III regimen. Relapse rates are even higher in patients who stop targeted therapy. Moreover, the incidence of long-term sequelae, such as DI and ND-LCH, has not decreased in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. It is unknown whether this is also the case in patients on MAPKi therapy. Treatment decisions are still stratified by disease localization(s) due to the lack of consensus biomarkers associated with poor LCH outcome. A deeper understanding of pathological cells driving LCH complications will aid in developing tools that can identify patients at risk of clinical or radiological abnormalities earlier. This process could benefit from the integration of health-related quality of life measures, ultimately advancing a more patient-centered approach to survivorship (Figure 4).

Focusing solely on molecular analysis of circulating myeloid cells may not fully elucidate the pathogenesis of ND-LCH. While data from the LCH mouse model developed by Wilk et al. suggest that the accumulation of circulating BRAF V600E -mutant myeloid cells precedes disruption of the blood-brain barrier and influx of pathological macrophage precursor cells, it may also be worth exploring the potential role of other cell types such as BRAF V600E lymphocytes (Figure 2B). Investigating their persistence and potential contribution to pathological processes in the brain could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying the presumed breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, a process with potentially significant clinical implications. Aberrant bone-brain interactions may also contribute to ND-LCH. LCH lesions in specific skull bones located near the brain have been associated with an increased risk of developing overt clinical neurodegeneration. Investigating RNA and protein expression by cells present in these CNS-risk lesions may provide new clues on inflammatory signaling occurring inside the lesions. Unfortunately, the scarcity of fresh biopsies remains a significant obstacle to the advance of this line of research. This issue may be circumvented by performing in vitro studies with relevant cell types generated from patient-derived iPSC. Collaborative efforts involving researchers focused on more common neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis may help to discover and validate biomarkers associated with disturbed blood-brain barrier function. Such interdisciplinary approaches could offer novel insights and accelerate the development of preventive strategies. Networking initiatives aimed at advancing the LCH field, such as the Nikolas Symposium for the Histiocytoses, are excellent platforms for fostering such crossover studies.

### BRAF-induced senescence drives Langerhans cell histiocytosis pathophysiology [^059eb3fb]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a potentially fatal condition characterized by granulomatous lesions with characteristic clonal mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) harboring activating somatic mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes, most notably BRAF V600E. We recently discovered that the BRAF V600E mutation can also affect multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in multisystem LCH disease. How the BRAF V600E mutation in HPCs leads to LCH is not known. Here we show that enforced expression of the BRAF V600E mutation in early mouse and human multipotent HPCs induced a senescence program that led to HPC growth arrest, apoptosis resistance and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP, in turn, promoted HPC skewing toward the MNP lineage, leading to the accumulation of senescent MNPs in tissue and the formation of LCH lesions. Accordingly, elimination of senescent cells using INK-ATTAC transgenic mice, as well as pharmacologic blockade of SASP, improved LCH disease in mice. These results identify senescent cells as a new target for the treatment of LCH.

Response assessment and monitoring

Response assessment and surveillance strategies in LCH vary based on multiple factors: organ involvement at diagnosis, type of treatment used, and patient preference (CS#31). For patients with abnormal FDG-PET/CT findings at diagnosis, the first response assessment should occur in 2 to 3 months of initiation of therapy and every 3 to 6 months thereafter (CS#32). In select cases, organ-specific imaging (CT, HRCT, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging) may be necessary to assess for a response. Additional testing may be necessary based on clinical manifestations and organs involved, with specific tailoring for single-system PLCH (Table 8). There are no established response criteria for adults with LCH, and pediatric criteria set forth by the International LCH Study Groupmay not be applicable in adults. Recent adult histiocytosis clinical trials and retrospective studies have used clinical and radiographic criteria that are preferred in adult LCH (Table 7). Any degree of improvement in clinical or radiographic findings is considered a response. It may take several months to attain the best response, especially with oral therapies. Once the best response is achieved and disease has stabilized, the frequency of imaging studies can be individualized. As endocrinopathies involving the pituitary or hypothalamus may not resolve with LCH-specific therapy, it is necessary to monitor the hormone levels and continue replacement, preferably in collaboration with an endocrinologist.

### Biological and clinical significance of somatic mutations in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and related histiocytic neoplastic disorders [^2851d608]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) represent histiocytic disorders with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Until recently, mechanisms of pathogenesis have been speculative and debate has focused on classification of these conditions as reactive versus neoplastic. Genomic studies have been challenged by scarce tissue specimens, as well as heterogeneous nature of the lesions with variable infiltration of pathologic histiocytes. Whole-exome sequencing recently revealed a very low frequency of somatic mutations in LCH, JXG, and ECD compared to other neoplastic disorders. However, at least in the cases of LCH and ECD, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1, in LCH and NRAS in ECD. In ECD, recurrent mutations in the PI3K pathway gene PIK3CA have also been described. The heterogeneous clinical manifestations of these disorders may therefore be the cumulative result of activation of MAPK mutations (along with modifying signals from other pathways) at distinct stages of myeloid differentiation. Implications of this model include redefinition of LCH, JXG, and ECD as a group of clinically diverse myeloid neoplastic disorders with a common mechanism of pathogenesis. This model supports refocusing therapeutic strategies for these diseases on a personalized approach based on specific mutations and the cell(s) of origin.

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a neoplasm and consequently its recurrence is a relapse: in memory of bob arceci [^0d9f4d62]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) remains a poorly understood disorder with heterogeneous clinical presentations characterized by focal or disseminated lesions that contain excessive CD1a+ langerin+ cells with dendritic cell features known as "LCH cells". Two of the major questions investigated over the past century have been (i) the origin of LCH cells and (ii) whether LCH is primarily an immune dysregulatory disorder or a neoplasm. Current opinion is that LCH cells are likely to arise from hematopoietic precursor cells, although the stage of derailment and site of transformation remain unclear and may vary in patients with different extent of disease. Over the years, evidence has provided the view that LCH is a neoplasm. The demonstration of clonality of LCH cells, insufficient evidence alone for neoplasia, is now bolstered by finding driver somatic mutations in BRAF in up to 55% of patients with LCH, and activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (where MEK and ERK are mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, respectively) pathway in nearly 100% of patients with LCH. Herein, we review the evidence that recurrent genetic abnormalities characterized by activating oncogenic mutations should satisfy prerequisites for LCH to be called a neoplasm. As a consequence, recurrent episodes of LCH should be considered relapsed disease rather than disease reactivation. Mapping the complete genetic landscape of this intriguing disease will provide additional support for the conclusion that LCH is a neoplasm and is likely to provide more potential opportunities for molecularly targeted therapies.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease characterized by lesions infiltrated by CD1a + /CD207 + cells. The discovery of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activating mutations, predominantly BRAFV600E, a common pleiotropic oncogene, and the clonal expansion of CD1a + /CD207 + cells, led to its classification as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm. Although patients with single-system involvement have favorable prognoses, with lesions often resolving spontaneously, those with multisystem involvement, particularly affecting the risk-organs hematopoietic system, spleen, and liver, face poorer prognoses. These patients may also develop a life-threatening form of LCH characterized by hyperinflammation with high fever, pancytopenia, and a cytokine storm. Moreover, up to 30% of patients develop devastating and irreversible neurodegeneration years after remission. MAPK-pathway inhibitors (MAPKis) are currently used in patients with LCH, but monotherapy does not seem to eradicate the malignant clone. Important pathophysiological aspects of LCH remain elusive: although BRAFV600E is present in different hematopoietic cells, including CD34 + progenitor cells, the immediate precursor of the pathognomonic LCH cells is uncertain because both monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) can acquire CD1a/CD207 expression. Additionally, it is unclear which cells cause systemic inflammation, because these symptoms can persist even after lesions disappear, nor which downstream targets are affected by MAPKis in LCH. Furthermore, it is unresolved whether neurodegenerative central nervous system (CNS) LCH (ND-CNS-LCH) is caused by mutated cells migrating to the brain from the periphery or by resident microglia acquiring the BRAFV600E mutation early during fetal development. A lack of mechanistic models contributes to this knowledge gap: LCH is rare and predominantly affects children, thus primary samples are scarce and small in size. Moreover, no distinct marker distinguishes mutated cells in the periphery or bone marrow (BM). Furthermore, no LCH cell lines exist and current murine models, in which BRAFV600E is often expressed at nonphysiological levels, do not fully recapitulate the disease, showing an extremely aggressive phenotype with massive liver and spleen infiltration, not seen in humans. Few human LCH in vitro models exist but they either exploit JAG2 stimulation to induce a LCH phenotype in healthy donor monocytes or require introducing BRAFV600E into CD34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) with limited proliferation and differentiation potential.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) are caused by mutations of the MAPK pathway, most often BRAFV600E, in myeloid dendritic cells that lead to some overlapping and other unique presentations of the two diseases. LCH occurs in both children and adults, but ECD is primarily found in the latter. The challenges in diagnosing these conditions relates to the rarity of the conditions and that they mimic diseases that are more widely understood, such as certain rashes; bone, lung, and renal diseases; and other malignancies. The histopathology of LCH is definitive, but not so for ECD. Treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors has become one of the important advances in the care of these patients.

Pulmonary LCH — a distinct entity?

Pulmonary LCH (PLCH) may occur as part of multisystem LCH or, more commonly, as an isolated disease (single-system PLCH). Single-system PLCH was initially thought to be an inflammatory/reactive disorder given the near-universal association with smokingand instances of remission upon smoking cessation. Earlier studies assessing clonality of single-system PLCH showed mixed results, but more recent studies have identified recurrent MAPK pathway alterations in 85% of these lesions, including BRAF -V600E in 36% to 50% of cases. The latter finding supports the contention that single-system PLCH is indeed a clonal process; more studies are needed to understand its natural history and the role of smoking in disease modulation.

Investigation of combination therapies incorporating sequential or concomitant targeted and non-targeted agents (chemotherapy) to achieve cure should also be considered, as is being undertaken in LCH.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) — epidemiology, survival, and classification are summarized as follows: LCH is the most common histiocytic disorder and occurs more frequently in children than adults. The incidence of disseminated LCH is estimated to be 5 to 9 cases per 1 million in children (> 15 years) and 0.07 cases per 1 million in adults (> 18 years). A study examining SEER registry data in the United States showed that 5-year overall survival for adults with LCH was 88.5%, while rapidly progressing and/or disseminated life-threatening disease may also occur. The Histiocyte Society's initial 1987 classification categorized LCH as an immunologic inflammatory disease but not as a neoplasm; however, presence of clonal histiocytes supports the neoplastic origin of LCH, and recurrent activating mutations in the MAPK pathway are found in the vast majority of cases, supporting the WHO's classification of histiocytic disorders, particularly LCH as a neoplastic process. In the Histiocyte Society's revised classification, four categories of LCH are identified: single system, pulmonary-involved, multisystem with risk organ involvement, and multisystem without risk organ involvement.

The majority of LCH patients present with single-system disease, and among the remaining cases, 15% present with MS-RO + disease. The initial clinical evaluation should include biopsies taken from affected tissues, total-body imaging for disease staging and laboratory tests to assess organ dysfunction. As LCH shares some histopathological and molecular features with other histiocytic disorders, such as indeterminate cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease, experienced pathologists are required to aid in interpreting the diagnosis.

Historically, LCH was considered a reactive inflammatory condition, but evidence of a clonal neoplastic origin has challenged this paradigm since the early 1990s. The identification of a recurrent, ERK-activating driver mutation in exon 15 of BRAF (BRAF V600E) in over 50% of LCH lesions marked a transformative era in understanding LCH pathophysiology and its clinical management (Figure 2A). Additional mutations have since been identified in BRAF V600E -negative, phosphoERK + LCH lesions. The majority of these molecular alterations also affect cytoplasmic mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling and include point mutations, deletions, or indels in KRAS, NRAS, ARAF, BRAF (exon 12), and MAP2K1, and fusions involving BRAF. Rare mutations in ERBB3, CSF1R, MAP3K1, and PIK3CA have also been reported. Despite advances in unraveling the molecular landscape of LCH, its pathogenesis still remains poorly understood, with the most debated issue being its cell-of-origin.

### Aggressive histiocytic disorders that can involve the skin [^a2bfa898]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Histiocytoses are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of reactive or neoplastic histiocytes. Three classes of histiocytoses have been defined: class I, Langerhans cell disease; class II, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disease without features of malignancy; and class III, malignant histiocytic disorders. Although the disorders in classes I and II usually have a benign appearance on histology and are commonly non-aggressive and self-healing, some can cause debilitating or even fatal outcomes. Such cases beg the question: what stimulates aggressive behavior of a classically benign disease? New molecular information may now provide insight into the driving force behind many of the aggressive histiocytoses. In this article, we review Langerhans cell disease and seven aggressive histiocytoses that can involve skin, discuss histologic features that may forecast a poor prognosis, and discuss the molecular findings that help to explain the pathophysiology of these aggressive histiocytic disorders.

Research on LCH has focused on CD1A + CD207 + cells, aiming to inhibit these "LCH cells" as a cure for patients with the disease. We provide a novel view on LCH by placing the spotlight on non-CD1A + CD207 + cells: BRAF -mutated cells present in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Extrapolating from the key observations in this prototypic analysis of one patient, we speculate that the CD1A + CD207 + cells are a differentiated end point that is the pathognomonic finding in LCH, but that BRAF -mutated blood cells need to be regarded as an important part of the disease. The clinically most detrimental effects of LCH are not the tissue lesions but the organ failure, caused by the BRAF V600E -harboring cells (or possibly by cells with other MAPK pathway mutations causing LCH). It will be necessary to validate this hypothesis in a large cohort, but the careful analysis of this patient provides a blueprint for further analyses within an international framework.

Advancements in Langerhans cell histiocytosis

LCH is the most well-recognized histiocytic disorder, affecting multiple organs, including bones, skin, lymph nodes, lungs, liver, pituitary gland, and brain. Historically, LCH was described through different clinical presentations: eosinophilic granuloma (solitary bone lesions), Hand-Schüller-Christian disease (chronic disease with a characteristic triad), and Letterer-Siwe disease (severe multisystem involvement). The term histiocytosis X was introduced by Lichtenstein to unify these entities, and later, the Histiocyte Society formally adopted the name Langerhans cell histiocytosis to reflect the lesional cell's phenotype.

Figure 1.
The Histiocyte Society structure, committees, and partnerships. HLH: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; LCH: Langerhans cell histiocytosis; Int'l: international.

A major breakthrough came in 1994 when LCH was recognized as a clonal disease, shifting the perspective from an immune disorder to a neoplastic condition. The discovery of the BRAF V600E mutation in over 50% of LCH casesfurther revolutionized disease understanding and therapeutic strategies. LCH is now classified as a clonal hematopoietic neoplasm in both the International Consensus Classificationand the World Health Organization classification. In the article " Histiocyte Society blueprint of Langerhans cell histiocytosis research: improving outcome and quality of life by understanding its 'cell-of-origin '", Pegoraro et al.explore the biological underpinnings of LCH and the implications of emerging technologies such as peripheral blood BRAF V600E monitoring. The review also highlights key areas for future research, including deciphering mechanisms of treatment resistance and mitigating long-term complications such as neurodegeneration.

LCH and concomitant hematologic/solid neoplasms

Several institutional and population-based studies have shown high incidence and prevalence of other malignancies in patients with LCH, including myeloid neoplasms (acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, etc), lymphomas, and solid organ malignancies (especially lung and thyroid cancer). LCH of the thyroid gland can cooccur with papillary thyroid cancer harboring BRAF -V600E mutations.LCH foci have also been found incidentally around resected specimens of renal cell carcinoma. Patients with PLCH, in particular, have a high incidence of concomitant lung carcinomas, likely due to their smoking history.LCH-like lesions and aggregates of Langerhans cells (LCs) may cooccur in lymph node biopsies of lymphomas and likely represent a "bystander" phenomenon where the lymphoma subtype drives treatment. Clinicians should be aware of the occurrence of second malignancies at any time point (before, during, or after) in relation to the LCH diagnosis as this may influence surveillance and management.

### Dabrafenib and trametinib in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and other histiocytic disorders [^d34b59e7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

The ontology of LCH lesions has been linked to bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic precursor cells. Activating mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway play a central role in the pathogenesis of LCH. Approximately 50–60% of LCH lesions harbor a recurrent activating mutation in the BRAF gene, specifically BRAF -V600E. Furthermore, even in cases without the BRAF -V600E mutation, there is ubiquitous activation of downstream phosphorylated kinases, phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK. This suggests that activation of the BRAF-MEK-ERK axis is universal in this disease, regardless of BRAF -V600E mutational status. Given these findings, there has been growing interest in BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibitors for the treatment of histiocytic diseases. Several studies have shown that BRAF and MEK inhibitors hold promise as salvage therapy for the treatment of high-risk LCH, particularly for patients with multisystem disease or those with risk organ involvement. The utility and feasibility of these treatments as first-line therapies have yet to be elucidated.

Herein, we describe our experience using dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, to treat LCH and other histiocytic disorders. We initially treated several children whose disease was refractory to conventional treatments or who had relapsed after therapy. Based on the observed responses and safety profiles in these patients, we offered targeted, first-line inhibitor therapy to newly diagnosed patients. All patients were treated off-label as described in detail under the methods section.

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a neoplastic disorder driven by ras-ERK pathway mutations [^b8e3455d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disorder of myeloid neoplasia of dendritic cells that affects 1 in 200,000 children < 15 years of age and even fewer adults. LCH presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. High-risk stratification is reserved for infiltration of blood, spleen, liver, and lungs. After decades of debate on the disease pathogenesis, a neoplastic mechanism is now favored on the basis of LCH cell clonality, rare cases of familial clustering, and recent evidence of mutations involving the Ras/Raf/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in lesional biopsy specimens. Somatic mutations are most often found in BRAF (BRAF V600E in 47.1% of reported patients) and MAP2K1 (21.7%) and uncommonly found in MAP3K1 or ARAF. Increased levels of phospho-ERK in lesional tissue, activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling with these mutations in vitro, and the mutual exclusivity of these mutations in a given patient suggest a central role for activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK oncogenic pathway in LCH. Immunohistochemical assessment of lesional tissue using the VE1 BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody can serve as a screening tool for BRAF V600E -positive LCH. Case reports suggest that BRAF V600E -positive LCH unresponsive to standard therapy might respond to B-Raf-MEK pathway inhibition, but rigorous randomized clinical trials have yet to be performed.

### Histiocyte society blueprint for Langerhans cell histiocytosis research: from cell-of-origin to a more comprehensive cure [^716f6640]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent iPSC-based in vitro model of differentiation showed that MAPKi therapy specifically affects functional features of mature BRAF -mutant monocytic cells, but not of iP-SC-derived stem/progenitor cells. We therefore advocate the importance of longitudinal sampling and biobanking of peripheral blood from LCH patients receiving multiple tiers of therapy, as this will provide valuable insights into the natural disease course and long-term fibro-inflammatory consequences of LCH. It is hoped that this much needed information will answer the key question of whether persistence of a single BRAF -mutated HSC clone also drives the onset of late sequelae. Whether the same scenario also applies to the 40% of non- BRAF V600E -mutated cases still needs to be addressed. Ultimately, the outcomes of prospective monitoring studies will help to design tailored approaches to treatment intensification for patients with persistent HSC activity to prevent frontline therapy resistance, relapses and late sequelae.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare hematologic disorder that affects children and adults. LCH was one of the first histiocytic disorders to be recognized as a hematopoietic neoplasm by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to the establishment of clonality. Subsequently, the discovery of BRAF -V600E mutation in about 50% of cases solidified the notion that LCH is a neoplastic disease.LCH is included among the "L-group" of the revised classification of histiocytic disorders and is grouped along with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). Most of our current understanding of LCH is derived from pediatric studies, with a paucity of data examining adult counterparts. The exact incidence of adult LCH is undefined, estimated at 1 to 1.5 cases per million population per year. Since the previous publication of adult LCH guidelines in 2013, several key advances have occurred in our understanding of the disease, including the discovery of MAPK pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) mutations beyond BRAF -V600E, and efficacious treatments using kinase pathway inhibitors. Tissue next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies have revealed that BRAF - wild-type LCH may harbor several other mutations in the MAPK-ERK pathway genes (eg, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, ARAF, NRAS, KRAS). Similar to ECD, kinase fusions (BRAF, ALK, NTRK1), BRAF - duplications, insertions, deletions, and rare mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway have been reported in LCH as well. These molecular discoveries have implications for the diagnosis and management of LCH, and in conjunction with other recent studies on LCH in adults, have necessitated an update of the existing recommendations.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) — epidemiology, outcomes, classification, and organ involvement: LCH is the most common histiocytic disorder and occurs more frequently in children than adults, with disseminated incidence estimated at 5 to 9 cases per 1 million in children and 0.07 cases per 1 million in adults. In adults, 5-year overall survival was 88.5%, although many cases are mild or asymptomatic and rapidly progressing and/or disseminated life-threatening disease may also occur. Historically the Histiocyte Society's 1987 classification categorized LCH as an immunologic inflammatory disease but not as a neoplasm; clonal histiocytes and recurrent activating MAPK pathway mutations support a neoplastic origin. In the revised classification, four categories of LCH are identified: single system, pulmonary-involved, multisystem with risk organ involvement, and multisystem without risk organ involvement. Common organ sites include bone, skin, pituitary gland, liver, spleen, bone marrow, lungs, and lymph nodes. Adult pulmonary LCH is associated with smoking. Multifocal bone lesions may occur without other organ involvement and bone mineral density may be lower than expected in adults with LCH. Permanent endocrinopathy is common, such as diabetes insipidus (now referred to arginine vasopressin [AVP] deficiency), which more commonly occurs with multisystem disease.

### Clinicogenomic associations in childhood Langerhans cell histiocytosis: an international cohort study [^9fb64fca]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Why specific mutations associate with distinct LCH clinical presentations remains an interesting and important issue for further investigation. Notably, specific genetic alterations also associate with distinct histiocytic entities, again demonstrating the intimate relationship between molecular pathogenesis and clinical histiocytosis phenotype. Differential ERK activation inflicted by the different genetic alterations may play a role, although this was not apparent for MAP2K1 exon 2 vs exon 3 mutations in our cohort. In addition, the association of BRAF V600E with severe clinical forms of LCH may rely on (thus far unknown) mediators or confounders, such as additional (epi)genomic alterations, tissue- or context-specific factors, and the mutated cell-of-origin (supplemental Figure 11). Although previous whole-exome sequencing studies have revealed infrequent additional genomic alterations in LCH, several studies have indicated a distinct impact of BRAF V600E on the LCH-lesional immune microenvironment. Furthermore, several studies have suggested an important role for the mutated cell-of-origin in governing LCH clinical phenotype, with high-risk disease caused by mutations in multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and low-risk disease caused by the same mutations in more committed myeloid precursors. However, this simplified model also does not fully explain LCH clinical phenotype, as recent studies have identified mutation-carrying (myeloid and lymphoid) cells in the blood from patients with low-risk or even SS LCH. Therefore, it remains important to elucidate how somatic mutations in multipotent progenitors can cause both SS and MS LCH and why progenitor cells active in children with high-risk LCH often harbor BRAF V600E.

Limitations of our study include the fact that not all patients without BRAF V600E were analyzed beyond BRAF V600E (Figure 2 A). Consequently, our study does not provide exact incidence rates of MAP2K1, BRAF exon 12, and rare MAPK pathway gene alterations. However, these alterations were detected in 109 children with LCH, allowing analysis of their clinical associations at unprecedented scale. Furthermore, because of the retrospective design, we cannot rule out some selection bias influencing the clinical spectrum of our cohort. However, our cohort included 288 (76.4%) patients with SS LCH compared with < 70% in the study by Héritier et al, strongly arguing against overrepresentation of patients with severe disease. Instead, we regard the relatively unbiased composition of our cohort as one of the strengths of our study. Nevertheless, our findings should be confirmed by sufficiently powered cohort studies; particularly the potential associations require further investigation (Table 3).

Adults and children with LCH also have an associated risk of developing solid and hematologic malignancies, similar to other histiocytoses, as well as malignancies manifesting in solid organs. Interestingly, patients with LCH may present with a secondary myeloid or lymphoid malignancy (mostly B-cell lymphoma), or both, despite the myeloid ontogeny of LCH. Clonally related lymphoma cells and CD1a + histiocytes residing in separate tissue localizations may express the same rearranged B- or T-cell receptor-encoding DNA sequence, suggesting that mature lymphocytes can transdifferentiate into myeloid cells under certain pathological conditions. Intriguingly, no patients have been reported to have LCH and hairy cell leukemia, a specific B-cell malignancies with recurrent BRAF V600E. Adults with LCH who subsequently develop a secondary myeloid malignancy may display myeloid cells with the same clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutation(s) in their LCH biopsy as found in their bone marrow or blood as is often the case in Erdheim-Chester disease. This indicates the need to extend our focus on driver mutations outside of the MAPK pathway.

Altogether, the potential persistence of mutant hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells may give rise to both LCH and other clonally related hematologic malignancies. Whether this situation is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and even mortality as suggested by recent epidemiological data needs to be further investigated.

Introduction to the Histiocyte Society Review Series

Histiocytic disorders encompass a diverse and rare group of conditions including histiocytic neoplasms such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and non-LCH, and hyperinflammatory diseases like hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Over the years, significant progress has been made in our understanding the pathogenesis, and treatment of these disorders, leading to improved outcomes for patients. This three-article series, commissioned by the Histiocyte Society, highlights progress in histiocytosis research and care.

The Histiocyte Society (https://histiocytesociety.org), founded in 1985, is the scientific organization that has played a pivotal role in advancing the study and treatment of histiocytic disorders. With a global network of physicians and scientists, the Society has been instrumental in establishing consensus classifications, leading clinical trials, and fostering collaboration to improve patients' outcomes. Recognizing the importance of nurturing the next generation of experts, the Society has actively engaged young investigators in its activities over the past decade. Shortly after the Society's formation, the Histiocytosis Association (https://histio.org), a worldwide non-profit organization, emerged to provide vital support for patients and families, advocate for research, and raise awareness. Complementing these efforts, the Erdheim-Chester Disease Global Alliance (https://erdheim-chester. org) has played a key role in advancing research and care for this ultra-rare histiocytic neoplasm. Together, these organizations have significantly shaped the modern landscape of histiocytosis research and care (Figure 1).

### Alternative genetic mechanisms of BRAF activation in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^b1dd50c6]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is characterized by inflammatory lesions containing pathologic CD207 + dendritic cells with constitutively activated ERK. Mutually exclusive somatic mutations in MAPK pathway genes have been identified in ∼75% of LCH cases, including recurrent BRAF-V600E and MAP2K1 mutations. To elucidate mechanisms of ERK activation in the remaining 25% of patients, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES, n = 6), targeted BRAF sequencing (n = 19), and/or whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq, n = 6) on 24 LCH patient samples lacking BRAF-V600E or MAP2K1 mutations. WES and BRAF sequencing identified in-frame BRAF deletions in the β3-αC loop in 6 lesions. RNA-seq revealed one case with an in-frame FAM73A-BRAF fusion lacking the BRAF autoinhibitory regulatory domain but retaining an intact kinase domain. High levels of phospho-ERK were detected in vitro in cells overexpressing either BRAF fusion or deletion constructs and ex vivo in CD207 + cells from lesions. ERK activation was resistant to BRAF-V600E inhibition, but responsive to both a second-generation BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor. These results support an emerging model of universal ERK-activating genetic alterations driving pathogenesis in LCH. A personalized approach in which patient-specific alterations are identified may be necessary to maximize benefit from targeted therapies for patients with LCH.

### Anti TNF-α therapy in patients with relapsed and refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a phase II study [^9c1986da]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is produced in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) lesions and is elevated in plasma of patients with active LCH. It has been postulated that TNF-α may play a role in the pathophysiology of LCH. Etanercept, an anti-TNF-α antibody, has been used in TNF-modulated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted a phase II study to determine the efficacy of etanercept for patients with refractory or relapsed LCH. Five LCH patients who had failed at least 2 prior treatments (range 2–9) received etanercept at a dose of 0.4mg/kg twice weekly for up to a total of 24 doses. Disease response was assessed at 4 and 8weeks. None of the five patients had improvement in their disease with etanercept treatment. Three progressed at week 4 and 1 progressed at week 8. One subject died after 3weeks of treatment from disease progression. During the study, only one drug-related toxicity was noted which spontaneously resolved. The study was concluded early due to lack of response to etanercept and insufficient accrual rate. This data suggests that etanercept as given in this study may not be effective for relapsed or refractory LCH. However, the number of patients treated was not adequate enough to power this study and it is possible that a different dose and regimen of etanercept may be required to successfully treat this disease.

### Diagnosis and management of Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^f7114d01]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare group of disorders without a well-understood etiology. Known formerly as histiocytosis X, the disease has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including eosinophilic granuloma (solitary bone lesion), diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos. It is also known by several eponyms, including Hand-Schüller-Christian disease when it manifests as a triad of cranial bone lesions and Letterer-Siwe disease when it is found in infantile patients with severely disseminated disease. Children aged 5 to 15 years are most commonly affected. Many of these patients initially present to orthopaedic surgeons, and misdiagnosis is frequent. To accurately diagnosis and treat these patients, the orthopaedic surgeon must be familiar with the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of the disease as well as the treatment guidelines and outcomes for Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Cutaneous histiocytoses constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by the cutaneous accumulation of cells with the cytological and phenotypic features of macrophages or dendritic cells. The clinical spectrum ranges from self-resolving, skin-limited conditions to severe, multiorgan disease with a high morbidity rate. Until recently, cutaneous histiocytoses were classified according to the immunophenotype of the pathological cells, with differentiation between Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) [CD1a+, CD207 (langerin)+] and non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (CD68+, CD163+, CD1a-, CD207-). Over the last 12years, a number of new pathophysiological findings (in particular, molecular pathology results) regarding histiocytoses have contributed to a new classification based on molecular alterations, as well as on clinical and imaging characteristics and the phenotype. The most frequent entities in children are juvenile xanthogranuloma and LCH.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is characterized by the accumulation of langerin + CD1a + myeloid cells (LCH cells) together with other immune cell populations in inflammatory lesions, which can be fatal or result in a diversity of long-term consequences, including neurodegeneration.

The molecular characteristics of LCH began to be understood when it was discovered that most lesions are affected by constitutively activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) due to somatic mutations in proteins of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In addition, BRAF V600E mutation in LCH patients was found to correlate with a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment and reduced disease-free survival. However, the underlying causes of LCH and the behavior of lesional cells remain elusive.

While research on immune stimulation has previously focused on soluble protein factors, such as cytokines, the role of extracellular vesicles (EV) in intercellular communication has only recently been described. EV are 30 nm to 1 mm in size and are secreted in a programmed fashion from the cell surface and endosomal system of all cells. They have been demonstrated to transport lipids, proteins and nucleic acids between cells to influence various processes, including tumor growth.EV can promote phenotypic changes in recipient cells by transferring oncoproteins that activate downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK or PI3K–AKT–mTOR, which makes them potential mediators of LCH pathology. However, neither abnormal vesicle trafficking nor EV have previously been investigated in LCH.

In this work, we have utilized an in vitro differentiation systemto generate mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) from blood monocytes of LCH patients and compare them to healthy controls or patients with Crohn's disease (CD), a non-histiocytic inflammatory disease often presenting with granulomas. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of these cells confirmed previously described aspects of LCH and revealed starkly increased levels of various membrane trafficking genes in LCH. We confirmed these expression profiles in lesions and performed functional analyses demonstrating that LCH cells displayed increased endocytosis, reacted specifically to interferon-γ (INFγ) treatment and secreted higher numbers of EV. Interestingly, LCH EV were associated with an enrichment of transcripts involved in cell adhesion, MAPK signaling, T-cell activation and vesicle trafficking, particularly in patients with active LCH. By treating lymphocytes with LCH secretome, a marked increase in the frequency of activated NK cells was observed. Together, these results point to novel mechanisms of LCH pathogenesis that may help to better understand the disease and provide potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare proliferative disorder where pathologic Langerhans cells accumulate in a variety of organs. Historically, the nomenclature regarding this entity has been confusing because the disease had been subcategorized simply based upon the different clinical manifestations. In the following article, we summarize the current recommendation of the Histiocyte Society regarding the classification, evaluation, prognosis, and treatment of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

### Clinical features and treatment outcomes of liver involvement in paediatric Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^ebe035cc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is the most common histiocytic disorder and is characterized by the clonal expansion of pathological dendritic cells. LCH mainly affects populations between 1 and 3 years of age. The clinical course is heterogeneous, ranging from self-limited and indolent disease to rapid progression of multiorgan involvement. LCH has been redefined as being a tumour derived from haematopoietic myeloid progenitor cells. Liver involvement is observed in 10.1% to 19.8% of patients with LCH and is characterized by sclerosing cholangitis (SSC), which manifests as progressive destruction of the biliary tree by histiocytes. LCH accompanied by haemophagocytic lymphoproliferative syndrome (HLH) may indirectly affect the liver. In such cases, a generalized activation of cellular immunity may lead to Kupffer cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, with resultant hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes (but without direct infiltration). These indirect effects are entirely reversible with treatment. The diagnosis of hepatic LCH is often difficult and delayed because of the absence of localized LCH. LCH patients with liver involvement could have a poor prognosis due to the high risk of the absence of timely and effective therapy, refractory disease, reactivation, and complications related to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The liver is considered a "risk organ" (RO) in LCH. For patients with liver involvement, the risk of death is three times greater than that for patients without liver involvement.

There have been few reports of hepatic LCH because it is a rare disorder, and its clinical characteristics and efficacy have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, we conducted a large, single-centre, retrospective cohort study to evaluate the clinical characteristics and analyse the prognosis of paediatric patients with LCH and liver involvement, with an aim of reducing misdiagnosis and providing a treatment strategy.

### Patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and hypothalamic-pituitary involvement: insights from the HEROS study cohort [^4bc8533f]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disease characterized by the proliferation of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The pathogenesis of LCH is not fully understood, exhibiting varying patterns of clinical involvement and outcomes. Incidence of the disease varies according to age, with a higher prevalence in children, reaching 3–5 cases per million per year, compared to1-2 cases per million among adults.

Many organs are susceptible to LCH infiltrates; the disease may manifest as localized lesions in specific organs or as a disseminated disease involving multiple organs. Commonly affected sites include bones, lungs and skin, which are involved in up to 50% of cases. The endocrine system, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, is also frequently affected. While the neurohypophysis is involved in up to 25% of cases, anterior pituitary deficiencies are also prevalent in 20% of patients with LCH. This involvement is believed to result from clonal proliferation in the pituitary region and an inflammatory response of the local immune system, leading to cytokine storm, contributing to the destruction of the pituitary cells.

The diagnosis of LCH relies mainly on the histopathological findings in biopsies from suspected lesions, which are performed whenever feasible. In cases where a biopsy is not possible, diagnosis may rely on radiological and clinical features. Patients diagnosed with LCH should undergo a comprehensive work-up, including endocrine evaluation to confirm or exclude hypothalamic-pituitary involvement.

This study aimed to assess the spectrum of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction in patients with LCH, characterize the clinical features of these patients, and evaluate their long-term outcomes during follow-up in a large cohort of LCH patients with neuroendocrine involvement.

### Myeloid cells from Langerhans cell histiocytosis patients exhibit increased vesicle trafficking and an altered secretome capable of activating NK cells [^6c4147d4]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a potentially life-threatening inflammatory myeloid neoplasia linked to pediatric neurodegeneration, whereby transformed LCH cells form agglomerated lesions in various organs. Although MAP-kinase pathway mutations have been identified in LCH cells, the functional consequences of these mutations and the mechanisms that cause the pathogenic behavior of LCH cells are not well understood. In our study, we used an in vitro differentiation system and RNA-sequencing to compare monocyte-derived dendritic cells from LCH patients to those derived from healthy controls or patients with Crohn's disease, a non-histiocytic inflammatory disease. We observed that interferon-γ treatment exacerbated intrinsic differences between LCH patient and control cells, including strikingly increased endo- and exocytosis gene activity in LCH patients. We validated these transcriptional patterns in lesions and functionally confirmed that LCH cells exhibited increased endo- and exocytosis. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing of extracellular vesicles revealed the enrichment of pathological transcripts involved in cell adhesion, MAP-kinase pathway, vesicle trafficking and T-cell activation in LCH patients. Thus, we tested the effect of the LCH secretome on lymphocyte activity and found significant activation of NK cells. These findings implicate extracellular vesicles in the pathology of LCH for the first time, in line with their established roles in the formation of various other tumor niches. Thus, we describe novel traits of LCH patient cells and suggest a pathogenic mechanism of potential therapeutic and diagnostic importance.

### Vemurafenib acts as a molecular on-off switch governing systemic inflammation in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^63314420]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a neoplasm marked by the accumulation of CD1A+CD207+ cells. It is most commonly driven by a somatic, activating mutation in the BRAF serine-threonine kinase (BRAFV600E). Multisystem disease with risk-organ involvement requires myelotoxic chemotherapy, making BRAF-inhibitors an attractive treatment option. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the course of an LCH patient treated with the combination of vemurafenib and salvage chemotherapy who achieved sustained clinical and molecular remission. We show that there is no relationship between peripheral blood BRAFV600E levels and clinical presentation during treatment with vemurafenib, but that vemurafenib leads to a fast, efficient, but reversible inhibition of clinical manifestations of systemic inflammation. In line, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines exactly mirror vemurafenib administration. Genotyping analysis identified the BRAFV600E mutation in multiple hematopoietic cell types, including NK cells and granulocytes. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells at time of diagnosis and during treatment indicate that RAF-inhibition abrogates the expression of inflammatory cytokines previously implicated in LCH such as IL1B and CXCL8. Together, our data suggest that while the CD1A+CD207+ histiocytes are the hallmark of LCH, other BRAF-mutated cell populations may contribute significantly to morbidity in patients with multisystem LCH.

### Long-term outcomes among adults with Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^d6d3645d]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder, with manifestations ranging from indolent unifocal disease to multisystem disease, causing morbidity and mortality. Over the last decade, our understanding of LCH has been revolutionized by the discovery of the clonal MAPK–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) and other mutations leading to near-universal ERK activation. These discoveries have reframed LCH from an inflammatory/autoimmune disease to a hematologic neoplasm. LCH is included in the "L" (Langerhans) group of histiocytosis in the 2016 classification by the International Histiocyte Society, along with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) and extracutaneous juvenile xanthogranuloma because of similar MAPK-ERK pathway alterations in these disorders.

### JAK2-mutated Langerhans cell histiocytosis associated with primary myelofibrosis treated with ruxolitinib [^31523893]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis and cellular origin of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) are debated. Recently, mutations on MAPK and PI3K pathways have been linked to disrupted cell proliferation in LCH. Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations play the same role in Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. We describe the case of a patient affected by JAK2-positive primary myelofibrosis (PMF) who developed a clonally related LCH while in treatment with ruxolitinib. JAK inhibitors are well known to affect function and differentiation of different hematological lineages, including mononuclear phagocytes precursors. Nevertheless, the literature describes cases of LCH clonally associated with non-LCH hematological neoplasm, suggesting how multilinear myeloid neoplasms may arise from bone marrow. Hence, we briefly discuss the possible pathogenic roles of genetic mutations and JAK inhibition therapy in the pathogenesis of LCH and associated neoplasms.

Although these drugs are effective at inducing clinical remission, a large proportion of both adults and children relapse after discontinuation of the treatment. This suggests that inhibitors are incapable of eradicating mutated HSC clones that give rise to LCH precursor cells. ND-LCH was shown to develop in some patients treated with vemurafenib, particularly in infants initially diagnosed with MS-RO + disease. Detectable levels of BRAF V600E cells in the blood and bone marrow of patients in remission after dabrafenibsupport the hypothesis that targeted therapy does not eradicate driver mutation-expressing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Further support for this hypothesis comes from studies involving longitudinal mutation monitoring in blood cells isolated from several LCH patients who had been on targeted therapy. An important topic of LCH research is to address whether myeloid cells associated with a relapse or ND-LCH develop from aberrant HSC harboring persistent pathological driver mutations. If so, the focus of treatment will likely shift from MAPKi-induced rapid disease control to chemotherapy-based eradication of the pathological clone.

Neurodegeneration and other late sequelae

ND-LCH is perhaps the most challenging complication of LCH, with a cumulative incidence of 6% in the largest published pediatric LCH cohortand between 1–10% in other cohorts. Radiographic features (i.e. signal abnormalities mostly involving the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the pons, sometimes leading to atrophy) are well described, but there are limited data clarifying its natural history. The term "neurodegenerative-LCH" was recently proposed to be replaced by two different entities, i.e. "LCH-associated abnormal CNS imaging" (LACI) for patients with radio-logic findings alone, and "LCH-associated abnormal CNS

### Langerhans cell histiocytosis treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^bd675b34]. NCI (2009). Low credibility.

The Langerhans histiocytosis cells in LCH lesions are immature dendritic cells, making up fewer than 10% of the cells present in the lesion. These cells are classically large oval cells with abundant pink cytoplasm and a bean-shaped nucleus on hematoxylin and eosin stain. BRAF leads to continuous phosphorylation, and thus activation, of MEK and ERK without the need for an external signal. Activation of ERK occurs by phosphorylation, and phosphorylated ERK can be detected in virtually all LCH lesions. In a mouse model of LCH, the. Other RAS-MAPK pathway alterations Because RAS-MAPK pathway activation, as well as variants in ARAF, MAP3K1, NRAS, ERBB3, PI3CA, CSF1R, and other rare targets. In an analysis of gene expression in LCH by gene array techniques, 2, 000 differentially expressed genes were identified. Of 65 genes previously reported to be associated with LCH, only 11 were found to be upregulated in the array results. The most highly upregulated gene in both CD207-positive and CD3-positive cells was. Several investigators have published studies evaluating the level of various cytokines or growth factors in the blood of patients with LCH.

These studies have included many of the genes found not to be upregulated by the gene expression results discussed above. One explanation for elevated levels of these proteins is a systemic inflammatory response, with the cytokines/growth factors being produced by cells outside the LCH lesions. A second possible explanation is that macrophages in the LCH lesions produce the cytokines measured in the blood or are concentrated in lesions.

### Genomic alterations in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^c34165c4]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The discovery of recurrent somatic genomic alterations in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) has led to a new understanding of LCH as a clonal neoplastic disorder. Most of the abnormalities described to date affect the RAS/RAF/MEK/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway: more than 50% of LCH cases carry activating mutations in BRAF, whereas another 10% to 28% carry activating mutations of MAP2K1, which encodes MEK1. The pathogenetic importance of these mutations has been confirmed by reports of significant clinical responses to RAF inhibitors.

### Treatment of Langerhans cell histiocytosis: role of BRAF / MAPK inhibition [^bdafa0e8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a clonally derived neoplasm with a highly variable clinical course. Although LCH was once considered a disorder of immune regulation, the identification of activating mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF-V600E in ~50%-60% of cases and MEK and ERK phosphorylation in 100% of examined cases, has changed the definition of LCH to a dendritic cell neoplasm with a strong inflammatory component. Current international LCH trials are focused on further improving the outcome of high-risk multisystem LCH patients, by decreasing the reactivation rate, optimizing early salvage regimens, and preventing late sequelae. Anecdotal responses to vemurafenib, a BRAF-V600E inhibitor, have been reported in a few cases of LCH and Erdheim-Chester disease. However, the development of resistance, as well as the potential risks of cutaneous and pancreatic cancers in patients with BRAF-V600E-mutated melanoma treated with single inhibitors, suggest the need for prospective trials with BRAF inhibitors, alone or in combination with other inhibitors of this pathway, for patients with refractory or multiply-relapsed LCH. The recent discovery of somatic mutations in ARAF and in MAP2K1, which lead to activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK -ERK pathway in the setting of wild-type BRAF, as well as the finding that activating mutation in MAP2K1 are relatively insensitive to MEK inhibitors, suggest that a more detailed understanding of this pathway in LCH may be necessary for the development of more effective targeted therapies.

### Transcriptomic landscape of circulating mononuclear phagocytes in Langerhans cell histiocytosis at the single-cell level [^ea70b942]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm caused by aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Circulating myeloid cells from patients often carry disease-associated mutations and can be differentiated into langerinhigh LCH-like cells in vitro, but their detailed immune-phenotypic and molecular profiles are lacking and could shed key insights into disease biology. Here we recruited 217 pediatric LCH patients and took blood and tissue samples for BRAFV600E analysis. Immune-phenotyping of the circulating Lin-HLA-DR+ immune population in 49 of these patients revealed that decreased frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was significantly linked to disease severity. By single-cell RNA sequencing of samples from 14 patients, we identified key changes in expression of RAS-MAPK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling-related genes and transcription factors in distinct members of the mononuclear phagocyte system in the presence of BRAFV600E. Moreover, treatment of patients with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib resulted in MAPK cascade inhibition, inflammation prevention, and regulation of cellular metabolism within mononuclear phagocytes. Finally, we also observed elevated expression of RAS-MAPK-ERK signaling-related genes in a CD207+CD1a+ cell subcluster in skin. Taken together, our data extend the molecular understanding of LCH biology at single-cell resolution, which might contribute to improvement of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics, and aid in the development of personalized medicine approaches.

Introduction

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder arising from the abnormal proliferation and subsequent deposition of CD1a + myeloid dendritic cells in various organs. Clinical features are heterogeneous and primarily depend on specific organ systems involved, ranging from skin rash and osteolytic skull lesions to treatment-refractory multiorgan failure in severe cases. Although LCH predominantly affects the pediatric population, an increasing number of adult-onset cases are being reported. We describe the case of a 51-year-old man with disseminated (multisystem) LCH stemming from an in-frame, oncogenic BRAF mutation.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) follow-up — response assessment and relapse indicators: Imaging (FDG-PET/CT [preferred], CT/MRI) of involved sites to evaluate treatment response should be done after 2 to 3 cycles of systemic therapy and after completion of treatment, and it should also be performed after completion of surgical curettage and after RT. LCH may relapse or reactivate following systemic therapy, which most commonly occurs in the first 2 years following treatment; development of AVP deficiency after treatment may be a sign of disease reactivation.

### Atypical cellular disorders [^ef22c93b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Some immunologic diseases are characterized by profound loss or primary dysfunction of a given population of cells. The atypical cellular disorders discussed here all bear some similarities in that abnormal proliferations of lymphocytes and macrophages or dendritic cells result in lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, bone lesions and infiltrations of nearly any other organ system. What are the similarities and the differences between Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML) or Rosai-Dorfman disease, and Castleman's disease (CD)? Studies on LCH have some advantages since it was described before the others, and organized clinical trials have been done since the 1980s. The understanding of SHML benefited from a registry maintained by Drs. Rosai and Dorfman. CD was described fifty years ago and for one subtype has the most clearly defined etiology (HHV-8 infection) of the three atypical cellular disorders discussed here. In Section I, Dr. Kenneth McClain examines the unanswered question of whether LCH is a malignant clonal disorder or an inflammatory response triggered by aberrant cytokine expression or a virus. Advocates of the malignant proliferation theory rest their case primarily on the following two points: Clonality of the CD1a+ Langerhans cells was demonstrated by analysis of the human androgen receptor in patients with single bone lesions (Low Risk) or multisystem disease including spleen, liver, bone marrow, or lung (High Risk). Although no consistent chromosomal abnormalities have been reported, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been defined by comparative genomic hybridization. Those in the "inflammatory response" camp note that non-clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells in adult pulmonary LCH also have LOH by the same method. The pathologic cells have not been successfully grown in culture or immune-deficient mice and don't have a "malignant" morphology. While the basic scientific arguments continue, important advances in the treatment of LCH have been made by international collaborations of the Histiocyte Society. Risk groups have been clearly defined and the response to therapy after the initial 6 weeks is known to be the strongest prognostic variable for outcome. In Section II, Dr. Yasodha Natkunam reviews the features of SHML, which most often presents as painless cervical lymphadenopathy, although many patients can have extranodal involvement as well. These sites include the skin, respiratory tract, bone, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. The diagnosis rests on finding intact lymphocytes in the cytoplasm of activated macrophages as well as accumulation of mature plasma cells. Hemolytic or non-hemolytic anemias, hypergammaglobulinemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentatin rate (ESR) are often found with SHML. An intriguing finding of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 viral proteins in SHML has been reported in several patients, but needs further study. SHML associated with lymphoproliferations triggered by defects in apoptosis are discussed since this mechanism may provide a clue to the etiology. Therapy for SHML varies greatly in reported case series. Many patients have spontaneous regression or resolution after surgical removal of isolated node groups. Others with systemic involvement may benefit from chemotherapy, but no clinical trials have been done. In Section III, Dr. Steven Swerdlow clarifies key features of the four types of CD. Localized cases are divided into the hyaline vascular type and plasma cell type. Both are usually cured by surgical excision and have symptoms mainly of a mass lesion, although the latter often also has constitutional symptoms. The two types are distinguished largely by the nature of the follicles and the number of interfollicular plasma cells. Interleukin (IL)-6 expression is increased in the plasma cell type. Multicentric CD of the plasmablastic type is most often found in HIV-positive patients with coincident HHV-8 infection. Many have lymphomas or Kaposi sarcomas. Other cases of multicentric CD are also most like the plasma cell type, however, with disseminated disease and constitutional symptoms. A wide variety of anti-neoplastic drugs, radiation therapy, anti-IL-6 and rituximab or atlizumab have been used with varying success in patients with multicentric CD. Clinical trials are needed for SHML and CD and registration of adult and pediatric patients on current LCH trials are encouraged.

Our case series is the first to report the use of BRAF inhibitors as first-line therapy in adults with LCH. We also report the efficacy with single-agent dabrafenib in adult LCH. All but one of our patients had favorable response to targeted therapy.

### Adult pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis [^9f4e12a6]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Adult pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder of unknown aetiology that occurs predominantly in young smokers, with an incidence peak at 20–40 yrs of age. In adults, pulmonary involvement with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis usually occurs as a single-system disease and is characterised by focal Langerhans' cell granulomas infiltrating and destroying distal bronchioles. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is essential to the diagnosis, typically showing a combination of nodules, cavitated nodules, and thick- and thin-walled cysts. A high macrophage count in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is a common but nonspecific finding that merely reflects exposure to tobacco smoke. BAL is useful for eliminating infections and the other infiltrating lung disorders that can be seen in young adults. Langerhans' cells can be identified in BAL fluid, but, in contrast to what was initially hoped, this test shows a very low sensitivity and is rarely useful in the diagnosis of the disease. The definite diagnosis of pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis requires identification of Langerhans' cell granulomas, which is usually achieved by surgical lung biopsy at a site selected by chest HRCT. In practice, however, lung biopsy is performed on a case-by-case basis. No effective treatment is available to date, and improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is urgently needed, and should help in the development of specific therapeutic strategies for patients with this orphan disease.
