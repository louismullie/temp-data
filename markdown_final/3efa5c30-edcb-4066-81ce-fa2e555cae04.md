## Question

Insomnia treatment while already on seroquel

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage insomnia in a patient who is already taking quetiapine (Seroquel). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current quetiapine regimen and whether it is being used for insomnia or for a primary psychiatric indication. Then, I should verify what evidence-based insomnia treatments are recommended and which ones to prioritize. Next, I will examine the risks of continuing or escalating quetiapine for sleep, including metabolic effects, anticholinergic burden, and discontinuation syndromes. After that, I need to consider special populations such as older adults and those with dementia. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan emphasizing CBT-I first, then carefully selected pharmacotherapy if needed, and close monitoring for safety and efficacy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and current quetiapine use. Quetiapine is FDA-approved for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder; insomnia is an off-label use, and when used for sleep, typical doses are much lower than for psychiatric indications, often in the 12.5–100 mg range, though evidence remains limited and mixed [^1128WzL8] [^115pk3ma] [^114reCVm]. I should also confirm formulation and timing, because Seroquel XR is generally dosed once daily in the evening, which can influence sedation timing and next-day effects, and abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal insomnia, so any dose changes must be gradual [^112WNG5A] [^112wZWHy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply increasing quetiapine for insomnia. I need to check guideline positions: major guidelines do not recommend antipsychotics, including quetiapine, as first-line for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy data and meaningful safety concerns; instead, they prioritize CBT-I as foundational therapy and, if medication is needed, agents with stronger evidence and better risk–benefit profiles [^116ztEmi] [^112P7P2s] [^112Fxg5n]. The VA/DoD guideline notes that evidence for quetiapine in chronic insomnia is limited and highlights boxed warnings and metabolic risks, advising against routine use for primary insomnia [^112Fxg5n] [^117DMi1h].

> Next, I should review what to try first. CBT-I is the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia and should be offered before or alongside any pharmacotherapy; if access is limited, brief digital CBT-I or referral can still be effective and safer than escalating sedating antipsychotics [^112P7P2s]. Wait, let me verify the strength of this recommendation: both AASM and ACP give strong or conditional support for CBT-I as initial therapy, and European guidance aligns with this approach, reinforcing that behavioral treatment should anchor care [^112P7P2s] [^115G4aEM].

> If CBT-I is insufficient or unavailable, I will now examine pharmacologic options with the best evidence and safety. Orexin receptor antagonists (suvorexant, lemborexant, daridorexant) are guideline-supported for chronic insomnia and may be particularly suitable in patients with psychiatric comorbidity because they do not worsen mood or carry the metabolic liabilities of antipsychotics; I should consider one of these as preferred pharmacotherapy after shared decision-making [^112fuig9] [^11411v2v] [^113anT9i]. Alternatively, short-term use of a benzodiazepine receptor agonist such as eszopiclone or zolpidem can be considered for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, with careful attention to duration, dependence risk, and next-day impairment; ramelteon is an option for sleep-onset difficulty with minimal next-day effects [^112HrsPY] [^117Ucop8] [^11411v2v]. I should double-check that these choices align with patient-specific risks and preferences before prescribing [^112P7P2s].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on quetiapine and benefiting psychiatrically, yet insomnia persists? I need to ensure we are not inadvertently worsening sleep with the psychiatric regimen; for example, activating antidepressants or stimulants can impair sleep, and evening dosing of sedating agents may help if timed appropriately, though quetiapine's peak sedation is relatively early and may wane overnight, contributing to maintenance insomnia in some cases [^112nAEhf] [^11395HhT]. Let me reconsider the total anticholinergic burden and next-day somnolence as well, because these can degrade sleep quality and daytime function even when total sleep time improves [^115ucJWp].

> I should confirm the risks of continuing or escalating quetiapine purely for insomnia. Antipsychotics carry metabolic risks (weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia), anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension, falls, and rare but serious events such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and tardive dyskinesia; these risks are not trivial even at low doses and must be weighed against uncertain sleep benefits [^114YQwMB] [^117DMi1h]. In older adults, the Beers Criteria and VA/DoD strongly advise avoiding antipsychotics for insomnia unless treating schizophrenia or bipolar disorder due to increased mortality, stroke, and cognitive decline risks; if used, the lowest effective dose and close monitoring are essential [^117DMi1h]. I need to ensure we are not exposing patients to these harms without a compelling indication [^117DMi1h].

> Let me think about discontinuation and dose changes. If quetiapine is being tapered or stopped, I should plan a gradual reduction to mitigate withdrawal insomnia and other discontinuation symptoms, which occur in about 12% after abrupt cessation and typically resolve within a week; tapering over weeks with close follow-up is prudent [^112wZWHy] [^113MQgKi]. Conversely, if quetiapine is being continued for a psychiatric indication and insomnia persists, I should avoid reflexively increasing the dose for sleep; instead, optimize sleep hygiene, CBT-I, and consider adding a guideline-supported hypnotic rather than pushing quetiapine into ranges that raise metabolic and neurologic risks [^117DMi1h] [^112Fxg5n].

> Special populations require extra caution. In older adults, I should prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies and, if medication is necessary, favor agents with lower fall and cognitive risks; orexin antagonists or short-course eszopiclone/zolpidem may be preferable to antipsychotics, and any antipsychotic exposure warrants fall-risk mitigation and metabolic monitoring [^115G4aEM] [^112fuig9] [^117DMi1h]. In patients with dementia-related psychosis, quetiapine is contraindicated for behavioral symptoms due to increased mortality; thus, I must not repurpose it for insomnia in this group and should explore nonpharmacologic sleep interventions and safer pharmacologic alternatives if absolutely necessary [^113ZYVxF] [^117DMi1h].

> Putting this together, my stepwise plan is as follows. First, implement CBT-I and optimize sleep hygiene while reviewing psychiatric medications for sleep-interfering effects. Second, if pharmacotherapy is needed, offer an orexin receptor antagonist or a carefully selected BzRA with explicit time limits and monitoring. Third, reserve sedating antidepressants such as low-dose trazodone or doxepin for select cases after discussing risks and benefits. Fourth, avoid escalating quetiapine solely for insomnia and, if already on quetiapine, maintain the lowest effective psychiatric dose while treating insomnia separately. Fifth, if quetiapine is to be discontinued, taper slowly to prevent withdrawal insomnia and monitor closely [^116ztEmi] [^112P7P2s] [^112fuig9] [^112wZWHy].

> Finally, I should confirm a monitoring and safety framework. Before adding any hypnotic, review concomitant CNS-active drugs, respiratory risk, hepatic impairment, and fall risk. With any antipsychotic exposure, monitor weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and lipids at baseline and periodically. Counsel on orthostatic precautions and next-day impairment. And reassess insomnia severity, daytime function, and psychiatric stability at each visit to ensure the chosen strategy remains appropriate and safe [^117DMi1h] [^114YQwMB] [^115ucJWp].

---

For insomnia in patients already on Seroquel, **CBT-I is first-line** [^112P7P2s] and should be prioritized over medication changes [^116ztEmi]. If pharmacotherapy is needed, **add a non-antipsychotic hypnotic** (e.g. eszopiclone, zolpidem, or an orexin antagonist) [^112HrsPY] [^112fuig9] rather than increasing quetiapine, due to metabolic and neurologic risks [^117DMi1h]. If quetiapine is used for insomnia, limit to 25–50 mg at bedtime and monitor for sedation, weight gain, and metabolic effects [^114reCVm] [^113S9xFw]. Avoid **quetiapine in older adults** because of increased mortality and stroke risk [^113ZYVxF] [^117DMi1h]. Taper quetiapine slowly to prevent withdrawal insomnia [^112wZWHy].

---

## Clinical evidence for quetiapine in insomnia

Quetiapine is **not FDA-approved for insomnia** [^1128WzL8]; its sedating effects are off-label and supported by limited evidence [^115pk3ma]. Low-dose quetiapine (25–100 mg) can reduce sleep latency and improve total sleep time, but benefits are modest and offset by adverse effects [^116ZHYbR].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of quetiapine in insomnia management

Quetiapine carries **significant risks**, especially at higher doses or with prolonged use:

- **Metabolic effects**: Weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and diabetes risk [^113S9xFw] [^114YQwMB].
- **Neurologic effects**: Sedation, somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, falls, and cognitive impairment [^115ucJWp] [^114YQwMB].
- **Withdrawal**: Insomnia, nausea, headache, and irritability on abrupt discontinuation [^112wZWHy].
- **Elderly risk**: Increased mortality and stroke risk in dementia-related psychosis [^113ZYVxF] [^117DMi1h].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend quetiapine as first-line therapy** for insomnia:

- **CBT-I**: First-line for chronic insomnia; pharmacotherapy only if CBT-I is unavailable or ineffective [^112P7P2s].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Use non-antipsychotic hypnotics (e.g. eszopiclone, zolpidem, orexin antagonists) [^112HrsPY] [^112fuig9].
- **Quetiapine**: Consider only when other treatments fail, and use the lowest effective dose (25–50 mg) with close monitoring [^114reCVm] [^117DMi1h].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments for insomnia

Several **alternatives have better risk–benefit profiles**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepine receptor agonists | Eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon | Sleep onset/maintenance | Short-term use; monitor for dependence and cognitive effects [^112P7P2s] [^115QVEeU] |
| Orexin receptor antagonists | Suvorexant, lemborexant, daridorexant | Sleep onset/maintenance | Favorable safety; minimal next-day sedation [^113anT9i] |
| Sedating antidepressants | Trazodone, mirtazapine, doxepin | Insomnia with depression/anxiety | Monitor for sedation, orthostasis, and anticholinergic effects [^notfound] |
| Melatonin agonists | Ramelteon | Sleep onset | Minimal dependence risk; modest efficacy [^114LUeHP] |

## Clinical considerations when adjusting quetiapine dosage

When adjusting quetiapine for insomnia, **taper slowly** to reduce withdrawal insomnia [^112wZWHy], and monitor for sedation, cognitive effects, metabolic changes, and withdrawal symptoms [^113S9xFw] [^114YQwMB].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly**: Avoid quetiapine due to increased mortality and stroke risk [^113ZYVxF] [^117DMi1h].
- **Comorbid psychiatric disorders**: Use caution; consider alternatives with fewer metabolic effects [^113anT9i].
- **Pregnancy/lactation**: Use caution; weigh risks and benefits [^116xiCBd].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **CBT-I**: Prioritize as first-line therapy [^112P7P2s].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Use non-antipsychotic hypnotics if medication is needed [^112HrsPY] [^112fuig9].
- **Quetiapine**: If used, limit to 25–50 mg at bedtime with close monitoring [^114reCVm].
- **Tapering**: Reduce dose slowly to minimize withdrawal insomnia [^112wZWHy].

---

Quetiapine is **not first-line for insomnia** because of limited efficacy and significant risks [^112Fxg5n]. Use CBT-I first, then non-antipsychotic hypnotics if needed; if quetiapine is used, keep the dose low and monitor closely [^112P7P2s] [^117DMi1h] [^114reCVm].

5.19 Discontinuation Syndrome

Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine extended-release tablets that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1993) for quetiapine extended-release tablets and 6.7% (71/1065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1-week post-discontinuation. Gradual dose reduction is advised [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.20 Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects

Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine extended-release tablets are used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility.

Quetiapine extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation.

### Quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar mania in older adults [^112jc3aP]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

A post hoc analysis of pooled data from two quetiapine monotherapy clinical trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine therapy (twice daily, 400–800 mg/day) among bipolar manic adults aged 55 years and older. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score at Day 21. A secondary endpoint was change from baseline in YMRS score at Day 84.

Methods

A total of 407 patients made up the safety population, consisting of 59 older adults (aged ≥ 55 years) and 348 younger adults. A total of 403 patients made up the efficacy population, consisting of 59 older adults and 344 younger adults. Efficacy outcomes were analyzed using covariance models (ANCOVA); descriptive statistics are presented for safety outcomes.

Results

Both older and younger individuals treated with quetiapine had significant improvement from baseline on YMRS scores compared with placebo-treated patients. The older adult group demonstrated a sustained reduction in YMRS score compared with placebo that was apparent by Day 4 of treatment. For the quetiapine treatment groups, the most common adverse effects (at a frequency ≥ 10%) were dry mouth, somnolence, postural hypotension, insomnia, weight gain, and dizziness in older adults, and dry mouth, somnolence, and insomnia in younger adults. For the placebo treatment groups, insomnia was the most common adverse event in both older and younger adults.

Conclusions

This secondary analysis suggests that quetiapine represents a potentially useful treatment option among older adults with bipolar I mania. Studies with a primary focus of geriatric bipolar mania, and including larger patient numbers, are needed to confirm these findings.

The results of the trials follow:

Monotherapy

In two 12-week trials (n = 300, n = 299) comparing Seroquel to placebo, Seroquel was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking Seroquel were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day (Studies 2 and 3 in Table 27).

Adjunct Therapy

In a 3-week placebo-controlled trial, 170 patients with bipolar mania (YMRS ≥ 20) were randomized to receive Seroquel or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. Seroquel was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. The majority of patients in this trial taking Seroquel were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day (Study 4 in Table 27).

Children and Adolescents (ages 10 to 17)

The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release tablets in the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) was extrapolated from a 3-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a manic episode were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Seroquel 400 mg/day (n = 95), Seroquel 600 mg/day (n = 98), or placebo (n = 91). Study medication was initiated at 50 mg/day and on day 2 increased to 100 mg/day (divided doses given two or three times daily). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to a target dose of 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day using increments of 100 mg/day, given in divided doses two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total YMRS score. Seroquel 400 mg/day and 600 mg/day were superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score (Study 5 in Table 27).

- How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

o Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
o Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
o Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

• 	thoughts about suicide or dying
• 	attempts to commit suicide
• 	new or worse depression
• 	new or worse anxiety
• 	feeling very agitated or restless
• 	panic attacks
• 	trouble sleeping (insomnia)
• 	new or worse irritability
• 	acting aggressive, being angry, or violent
• 	acting on dangerous impulses
• 	an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)
• 	other unusual changes in behavior or mood

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

• Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.

Appropriate supportive measures are the mainstay of management. For the most up-to-date information on the management of Seroquel XR overdosage, contact a certified Regional Poison Control Center (1–800–222–1222).

SEROQUEL XR overdose may lead to gastric bezoar formation and appropriate diagnostic imaging is recommended to further guide patient management. Routine gastric lavage may not be effective in the removal of the bezoar due to gum like sticky consistency of the mass. Endoscopic pharmacobezoar removal has been performed successfully.

Current hypnotic usage — prescription patterns and population use are summarized across U.S. datasets. Overall frequency of hypnotic prescriptions for insomnia declined during 1970–1990 from 5.3% to 2.5%. In office-based prescribing during 1987–1996, there was an over 50% decline in benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic prescriptions accompanied by a nearly 150% increase in trazodone prescriptions, and overall prescriptions for insomnia declined by about 25% during this period. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2010 data, just under 3% of the population had used these agents within the past month; BzRAs were most commonly prescribed (1.23% of the population), followed by trazodone (0.97%), BZDs (0.4%), quetiapine (0.32%) and doxepin. The use of antidepressants with poor or limited documentation was only 0.7% in the past month, increasing from 0.2% in the first year sampled to 3.5% in the final year (2009–2010). The 2005 National Sleep Foundation's survey found that 7% of respondents report using a prescription medication to improve sleep at least a few nights per month.

### Reduction of opioid-withdrawal symptoms with quetiapine [^116WFy19]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of quetiapine in a population undergoing ambulatory detoxification from opioids.

Method

Medications utilized in our outpatient clinic for opioid withdrawal were evaluated for quality-assurance purposes. The treatment regimen generally included clonidine, hydroxyzine, trazodone, diphenoxylate/atropine, and sometimes chlordiazepoxide. Patients were also initially given eight 25-mg tablets of quetiapine and instructed to take 1 or 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for symptoms of withdrawal or craving (with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg). Data were based on patient evaluations from June 2003 to June 2004.

Results

41% of all patients (N = 213) successfully completed the detoxification phase of the program (i.e., completed at least 5 days of abstinence). A medication questionnaire was instituted for quality-assurance purposes after some apparent initial success with quetiapine. A retrospective analysis of these data revealed that, of the 107 patients evaluated for medication response, 79 reported that quetiapine helped reduce craving for opioids, 52 reported that quetiapine helped reduce their anxiety, 24 reported a reduction in somatic pain, 22 reported that quetiapine helped alleviate insomnia, and 14 reported an improved appetite. Four individuals did not feel quetiapine had any benefit, and another 7 were unable to tolerate quetiapine because of side effects. The quetiapine dose used ranged from 25 to 600 mg/day (mean ± SD dose = 206 ± 122 mg/day).

Conclusions

Quetiapine use during opioid cessation was found to help abate symptoms of opioid withdrawal in our patient population and was generally well tolerated.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine extended-release tablets.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine Extended-release tablets are not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episode: In a single clinical trial in patients with bipolar depression, 14% (19/137) of patients on SEROQUEL XR discontinued due to an adverse reaction compared to 4% (5/140) on placebo. Somnolence 2 was the only adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 2% in SEROQUEL XR in the bipolar depression trial.

MDD, Adjunctive Therapy: In adjunctive therapy clinical trials in patients with MDD, 12.1% (76/627) of patients on SEROQUEL XR discontinued due to adverse reaction compared to 1.9% (6/309) on placebo. Somnolence 2 was the only adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 2% in SEROQUEL XR in MDD trials.

______________

2Somnolence combines adverse reaction terms somnolence and sedation.

Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials:

In short-term placebo-controlled studies for schizophrenia the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of SEROQUEL XR (incidence of 5% or greater) and observed at a rate on SEROQUEL XR at least twice that of placebo were somnolence (25%), dry mouth (12%), dizziness (10%), and dyspepsia (5%).

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

thoughts about suicide or dying
attempts to commit suicide
new or worse depression
new or worse anxiety
feeling very agitated or restless
panic attacks
trouble sleeping (insomnia)
new or worse irritability
acting aggressive, being angry, or violent
acting on dangerous impulses
an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)
other unusual changes in behavior or mood

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.
Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression, and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.
Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.
Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member take. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.
Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children. Talk to your child's healthcare provider for more information.

The results of the trials follow:

Monotherapy

In two 12-week trials (n = 300, n = 299) comparing SEROQUEL to placebo, SEROQUEL was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking SEROQUEL were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/ day (Studies 2 and 3 in Table 28).

Adjunct Therapy

In a 3-week placebo-controlled trial, 170 patients with bipolar mania (YMRS ≥ 20) were randomized to receive SEROQUEL or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. SEROQUEL was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. The majority of patients in this trial taking SEROQUEL were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day (study 4 in Table 28).

Children and Adolescents (ages 10–17)

The efficacy of SEROQUEL XR in the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) was extrapolated from a 3-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a manic episode were randomized into one of three treatment groups: SEROQUEL 400 mg/day (n = 95), SEROQUEL 600 mg/day (n = 98), or placebo (n = 91). Study medication was initiated at 50 mg/day and on day 2 increased to 100 mg/day (divided doses given two or three times daily). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to a target dose of 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day using increments of 100 mg/day, given in divided doses two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total YMRS score. SEROQUEL 400 mg/day and 600 mg/day were superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score (study 5 in Table 28).

5.19 Discontinuation Syndrome

Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine extended-release that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1,993) for quetiapine extended-release and 6.7% (71/1,065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1-week post-discontinuation. Gradual dose reduction is advised [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.20 Anticholinergic
(antimuscarinic) Effects

Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine extended-release is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine extended-release should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility.

Quetiapine extended-release should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation.

Treatment

Initially, 10 years prior to his latest presentation to our hospital, the patient was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. Accordingly, he started taking carbamazepine (200 mg once daily) and then donepezil 5 years later (5 mg later increased to 10 mg per day with carbamazepine). He did not show any improvement in his symptoms and a marked exacerbation of his forgetfulness, decreased functionality and increased agitation. He was assessed in an outpatient setting at our psychiatric facility and diagnosed with early-onset dementia after an initial assessment. He was subsequently started taking memantine (10 mg two times per day) and quetiapine (50 mg before bed) for the symptomatic treatment of insomnia. The patient's carbamazepine was discontinued given no evidence for clinical seizures.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of quetiapine in the treatment of bipolar I or II depression [^117ETyJf]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

There is a major unmet need for effective options in the treatment of bipolar depression.

Method

Five hundred forty-two outpatients with bipolar I (N = 360) or II (N = 182) disorder experiencing a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of quetiapine (600 or 300 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. Additional efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression of severity and improvement, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire.

Results

Quetiapine at either dose demonstrated statistically significant improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total scores compared with placebo from week 1 onward. The proportions of patients meeting response criteria (≥ 50% Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score improvement) at the final assessment in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine were 58.2% and 57.6%, respectively, versus 36.1% for placebo. The proportions of patients meeting remission criteria (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ≤ 12) were 52.9% in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine versus 28.4% for placebo. Quetiapine at 600 and 300 mg/day significantly improved 9 of 10 and 8 of 10 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale items, respectively, compared to placebo, including the core symptoms of depression. Treatment-emergent mania rates were low and similar for the quetiapine and placebo groups (3.2% and 3.9%, respectively).

Conclusions

Quetiapine monotherapy is efficacious and well tolerated for the treatment of bipolar depression.

### Orexin receptor antagonists in the treatment of insomnia associated with psychiatric disorders: a systematic review [^113anT9i]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Should insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders be treated as a disorder independent of psychiatric symptoms?

Recently, the term "secondary insomnia" has been eliminated from the DSM-5 and other guidelines as insomnia can persist even after the primary symptoms of psychiatric disorders have been resolved. Insomnia is now regarded as a distinct disorder independent of psychiatric disorders. Based on this concept, treatment with insomnia medications should be considered for insomnia symptoms that are not sufficiently improved by psychiatric medications.

Insomnia associated with psychiatric disorders is often treated with drugs that have a strong sedative effect on the underlying disorder, which can effectively address hyperarousal and sleep disorders that commonly occur in the acute phase of a psychiatric condition. However, they are not approved for insomnia and have not been rigorously studied for insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the use of sedative medications for psychiatric disorders presents several challenges. First, the effects of psychiatric medications on sleep can result in excessive sedation during the day, leading to reduced daytime functioning and quality of life. This is particularly true during the maintenance phase of treatment when symptoms of the primary illness have abated and the sedative effects of medication initiated during the acute phase have become more prominent. Even taking medication before bedtime may impair daytime functioning if the clinical effects persist beyond the desired duration. In addition, sedating psychiatric medications may be associated with specific adverse effects. For example, although quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine can influence sleep by their antihistamine effects, they are associated with weight gain and elevated blood lipids. These safety issues may prevent the administration of sufficient doses of psychiatric medications to improve insomnia symptoms, further preventing the adequate management of insomnia. According to the findings of this review, suvorexant and lemborexant showed no clear adverse effects on psychiatric disorders comorbid with insomnia. In addition, DORAs are expected to have a low dependence due to their differential mechanism of action from older benzodiazepine hypnotics, making them a promising treatment option for insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders.

Antidepressants and first-generation antihistamines are often considered for insomnia due to sedating/drowsiness properties, and diphenhydramine and doxylamine succinate are indicated to help reduce the difficulty in falling asleep, but evidence for using these agents and other antihistamines is not supported by rigorous data. Antipsychotics are used off-label, with quetiapine the most common, often in patients with concomitant psychiatric disorders.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

- Antipsychotic withdrawal: do not discontinue abruptly in any patient.
- Aspiration pneumonia: use caution in elderly patients, particularly with advanced Alzheimer's disease.
- Cataract: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of cataracts.
- Falls: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine may cause somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, motor and sensory instability, leading to falls and injuries.
- Hematologic disorders: use caution in patients with leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia.
- Hyperprolactinemia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of hyperprolactinemia.
- Hypotension: use caution in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, dehydration/hypovolemia, or taking antihypertensive agents.
- Hypothyroidism: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism. Monitor TSH and fT4 levels.
- Mania: use caution in patients with bipolar disorder. Screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder before initiating quetiapine.
- Metabolic changes: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain.
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- Prolonged QT interval: use caution in patients at increased risk of QT prolongation, such as the elderly, patients with CVD, family history of QT prolongation, congestive HF, or cardiac hypertrophy. Avoid using quetiapine with other QT-prolonging agents, including class IA or III antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (such as ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (such as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or other medications known to prolong the QT interval (such as pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

5.16 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment

Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3-day period of initial dose titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 24.7% (235/951) of patients on SEROQUEL XR compared to 10.3% (33/319) of placebo patients. In a bipolar depression clinical trial, somnolence was reported in 51.8% (71/137) of patients on SEROQUEL XR compared to 12.9% (18/140) of placebo patients. In a clinical trial for bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 50.3% (76/151) of patients on SEROQUEL XR compared to 11.9% (19/160) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls.

In short-term adjunctive therapy trials for MDD, somnolence was reported in 40% (252/627) of patients on SEROQUEL XR respectively compared to 9% (27/309) of placebo patients. Somnolence was dose-related in these trials (37% (117/315) and 43% (135/312) for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively).

5.17 Body Temperature Regulation

Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing SEROQUEL XR for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.

5.18 Dysphagia

Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. SEROQUEL XR and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MADRS. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, SEROQUEL was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (Studies 7 and 8 in Table 29). In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the Q-LES-Q(SF).

Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex

The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in patients (n = 1326) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder (studies 9 and 10). The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the open-label phase, patients were required to be stable on SEROQUEL plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either SEROQUEL (administered twice-daily totaling 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or placebo. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the SEROQUEL group by day 280 and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode; YMRS score ≥ 20 or MADRS score ≥ 20 at 2 consecutive assessments; or study discontinuation due to a mood event.

In both studies, SEROQUEL was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of SEROQUEL was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).

Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

Elderly patients should be started on SEROQUEL XR 50 mg/day and the dose can be increased in increments of 50 mg/day depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient.

2.4 Dose Modifications in Hepatically Impaired Patients

Patients with hepatic impairment should be started on SEROQUEL XR 50 mg/day. The dose can be increased daily in increments of 50 mg/day to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient.

2.5 Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inhibitors

SEROQUEL XR dose should be reduced to one‑sixth of original dose when co-medicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of SEROQUEL XR should be increased by 6-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Augmentation with atypical antipsychotics for treatment-resistant depression [^116c1HeX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is considered a common clinical condition often associated with relevant suicidal ideation and characterized by a severe functional impairment lifetime. Among the available drugs for the TRD treatment, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have been reported as effective. In this context, the aim of this study was to review the clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of SGAs as add-on therapy in TRD.

Methods

A comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline and PsychINFO of all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the augmentation with antipsychotics in TRD, published from January 2000 until March 2020, was performed. Sixteen RCTs studies met the inclusion criteria.

Results

The reviewed studies showed that the add-on therapy with aripiprazole could be beneficial in the treatment of TRD. Furthermore, RCTs on quetiapine augmentation support its use in TRD, especially when comorbid anxiety or insomnia are present. The effects of risperidone and olanzapine as add-on in TRD were less studied, but preliminary data indicated an efficacy respect to placebo, making them a possible therapeutic option in TRD.

Limitations

The lack of consistency in the definition of TRD together with the small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of antipsychotics dosages used in the reviewed RCTs may have limited the strength of evidences obtained.

Conclusion

Overall, the available RCTs studies seem to support the hypothesis that the augmentation with SGAs, in particular aripiprazole and quetiapine, is a valid therapeutic option for TRD. However, to improve the therapeutic outcome of patients with TRD, larger and more homogeneous RCTs are needed.

### Effects of quetiapine on sleep in nonpsychiatric and psychiatric conditions [^115pk3ma]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of immediate-release quetiapine for the treatment of insomnia.

Data Sources

Pre-MEDLINE and MEDLINE were searched (1966 to October 2008) using the terms quetiapine, sleep, insomnia, and antipsychotics.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies and case reports evaluating insomnia as a primary endpoint were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The role of quetiapine for improving sleep in various patient populations is uncertain. Quetiapine has moderately sedative properties, and doses used in treatment of insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg. Results of clinical trials and observations in case studies have revealed possible beneficial effects of quetiapine on several subjective and objective sleep parameters. In most studies, significant improvements in sleep were found in areas of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep scores. However, some of these results may not be clinically significant. Also, quetiapine has been found to have adverse effects such as periodic leg movements, akathisia, and metabolic complications. Additionally, changes in rapid eye movement (REM) and percentage of REM sleep have been noted in different populations and need further study. Despite quetiapine's sedative properties, current data do not appear to support its use as first-line treatment for sleep complications. However, it may be useful for treatment of insomnia in patients with psychiatric disorders (eg, bipolar, schizophrenia) who do not respond to primary or secondary treatments.

Conclusions

Further studies are needed to define the placement, dose, and adverse effects of quetiapine for the treatment of sleep problems.

### Maintenance treatment with quetiapine versus discontinuation after one year of treatment in patients with remitted first episode psychosis: randomised controlled trial [^113so5oK]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Table 6
Weight and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and changes during study period*

NA = not applicable.

*Descriptive and initial analyses used t tests for continuous variables and χ 2 tests for categorical variables. Weight data from 178 patients at baseline and 177 patients at end of study.

Figure 1gives reasons for discontinuation. Adverse events that occurred in more than one case were fatigue, sedation, or tiredness (n = 9; 7 in quetiapine group, 2 in placebo group), dizziness (n = 7; all in quetiapine group), nausea (n = 2; both in quetiapine group), limb weakness (n = 2; both in quetiapine group), and insomnia (n = 2; 1 in quetiapine group, 1 in placebo group). Three serious adverse events occurred. One patient taking quetiapine was admitted to hospital after impulsive self-laceration following an argument with a partner, and one assigned to placebo was admitted after a non-fatal overdose of hypnotics during an adjustment reaction to financial difficulties. Both were discontinued. A third patient in the placebo group had transient repetitive imagery for three days and was briefly admitted for observation, but continued. The rate of discontinuation for both adverse events and serious adverse events was higher for the quetiapine group (18%; 16/89) than the placebo group (8%; 7/89) (relative risk 2.29, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 5.28; χ 2 = 3.20, df = 1; P = 0.07).

Other reasons for discontinuation included need for a mood stabiliser (n = 3; 2 in quetiapine group, 1 in placebo group), inability to tolerate the transition protocol (n = 7; 4 in quetiapine group, 3 in placebo group), and unwillingness to attend the study assessments (n = 1; in placebo group). Discontinuation for all causes did not differ significantly between the quetiapine group (31%; 28/89) and the placebo group (20%; 18/89) (relative risk 1.32, 0.98 to 1.77; χ 2 = 2.38, df = 1; P = 0.12).

### Effects of extended-release quetiapine fumarate on long-term functioning and sleep quality in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): data from a randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled maintenance study [^112cRXzZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This analysis evaluated effects of quetiapine XR maintenance treatment on functioning and sleep in patients with GAD.

Methods

Analysis of patient-reported data from a randomized-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine XR monotherapy in GAD. Following open-label run-in (4–8 weeks) and a 12–18-week stabilization phase (quetiapine XR 50, 150, or 300 mg/day), eligible patients were randomized to continue on quetiapine XR or receive placebo for up to 52 weeks. Primary variable was time to an anxiety event. Secondary variables included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

Results

In total, 432 patients were randomized (quetiapine XR, N = 216; placebo, N = 216). The risk of an anxiety event was significantly reduced for quetiapine XR vs. placebo (HR 0.19; 95% CI 0.12, 0.31; p < 0.001). Quetiapine XR was more effective than placebo at maintaining SDS total scores (LSM change: -0.19 vs. 1.01; p = 0.017) and non-work-related SDS domain score 'family life/home responsibilities' (-0.13 vs. 0.32; p = 0.011), but not 'social life' (0.05 vs. 0.34; p = 0.114). Quetiapine XR was more effective than placebo at maintaining the work-related SDS domain score 'days lost' (-0.05 vs. 0.11; p = 0.027), but not 'work/school' (-0.10 vs. 0.29; p = 0.051) or 'days underproductive' (0.06 vs. 0.13; p = 0.619). PSQI global scores were reduced from randomization with quetiapine XR vs. placebo (0.39 vs. 1.60; p < 0.001).

Limitations

Lack of active-comparator arm, exclusion of patients with comorbid depression.

Conclusions

In patients with GAD, long-term treatment with quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/day) monotherapy was effective at maintaining improvements in functioning and sleep quality.

### Addressing barriers to reducing prescribing and implementing deprescribing of sedative-hypnotics in primary care [^115QVEeU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In community practice, sedatives and hypnotics (SH), including certain benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine GABA-receptor agonists, as well as drugs with sedating adverse effects, are frequently prescribed, especially for insomnia. - Systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines for insomnia suggest that these prescriptions should primarily be of short duration because of insufficient evidence to support extended use, evidence of harm, and availability of safe and effective nonpharmacological alternatives (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBTi]). - However, chronic SH utilization in the community is high, with reported rates between 3% and 17%. -,-

SH exposure is associated with serious adverse events, including falls, cognitive impairment, and increased mortality, and extended use of some classes may be associated with drug dependence (eg, benzodiazepines). - Professional societies include SH on their list of potentially inappropriate or high-risk medications for insomnia management for older adults and endorse reduction of SH use to minimize the risk of adverse events. - Recent observational data suggest that prescribing practices have shifted from traditional benzodiazepines to newer Z-drugs and other sedating medication classes (eg, off-label use of quetiapine and trazodone) because these newer medications are falsely perceived as safer alternatives.-

### A pooled analysis of two randomised, placebo-controlled studies of extended release quetiapine fumarate adjunctive to antidepressant therapy in patients with major depressive disorder [^1155sZtQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Two positive studies evaluated adjunctive extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) showing inadequate response to antidepressant treatment. This preplanned, pooled analysis provides an opportunity for subgroup analyses investigating the influence of demographic and disease-related factors on observed responses. Additional post hoc analyses examined the efficacy of quetiapine XR against specific depressive symptoms including sleep.

Methods

Data were analysed from two 6-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies, prospectively designed to be pooled. Patients received once-daily quetiapineXR 150mg/day (n = 309), 300mg/day (n = 307) or placebo (n = 303) adjunctive to ongoing antidepressant therapy. The primary endpoint was change from randomisation to Week 6 in MADRS total score. Other assessments included MADRS response (≥ 50% decrease in total score) and remission (total score ≤ 8), change from randomisation in HAM-D, HAM-A, PSQI global and CGI-S scores.

Results

Quetiapine XR (150 and 300mg/day) reduced MADRS total scores vs placebo at every assessment including Week 6 (-14.5, -14.8, -12.0; p < 0.001 each dose) and Week 1 (-7.8,-7.3,-5.1; p < 0.001 each dose). For quetiapineXR 150 and 300mg/day and placebo, respectively at Week 6: MADRS response 53.7% (p = 0.063), 58.3% (p < 0.01) and 46.2%; MADRS remission 35.6% (p < 0.01), 36.5% (p < 0.001) and 24.1%. QuetiapineXR 150 and 300mg/day significantly improved HAM-D, HAM-A, PSQI and CGI-S scores at Week 6 vs placebo. Quetiapine XR demonstrated broad efficacy, independent of factors including concomitant antidepressant.

Limitations

Fixed dosing; lack of active comparator.

Conclusions

Adjunctive quetiapine XR is effective in patients with MDD and an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy, with improvement in depressive symptoms seen as early as Week 1.

### Quetiapine (Seroquel) [^117Lg1TQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.19 Discontinuation Syndrome

Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with SEROQUEL XR that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1993) for SEROQUEL XR and 6.7% (71/1065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1-week post-discontinuation. Gradual dose reduction is advised [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.20 Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects

Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when SEROQUEL XR is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. SEROQUEL XR should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility.

SEROQUEL XR should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation.

### Efficacy and safety of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex for maintenance of patients with bipolar I disorder (international trial 126) [^1144XuPM]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This study examined the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex compared with placebo with lithium or divalproex in the prevention of recurrent mood events in bipolar I patients, most recent episode mania, depression, or mixed.

Methods

Patients received open-label quetiapine (400–800 mg/day; flexible, divided doses) with lithium or divalproex (target serum concentrations 0.5–1.2 mEq/L and 50–125 microg/mL, respectively) for up to 36 weeks to achieve at least 12 weeks of clinical stability. Patients were subsequently randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (400–800 mg/day) plus lithium/divalproex or placebo plus lithium/divalproex for up to 104 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence of any mood event.

Results

Treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased the time to recurrence of any mood event compared with placebo plus lithium/divalproex. The proportion of patients having a mood event was markedly lower in the quetiapine than in the placebo group (18.5% versus 49.0%). The hazard ratio for time to recurrence of a mood event was 0.28 (P < 0.001), a mania event 0.30 (P < 0.001), and a depression event 0.26 (P < 0.001) corresponding to risk reductions of 72%, 70%, and 74%, respectively. During the randomization phase, the most common adverse events occurring in ≥ 5% in the quetiapine group were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Insomnia was more common in the placebo group. During the randomization phase, there was an increase in weight of 0.5 kg in the quetiapine group and a reduction of 1.9 kg in the placebo group. The incidence and incidence density of a single emergent fasting blood glucose value ≥ 126 mg/dL was higher with quetiapine than with placebo (9.3% versus 4.1%; 17.6 versus 9.5 patients per 100 patient-years).

Limitations

This was an enriched sample of patients with bipolar I disorder responding to treatment with quetiapine plus lithium/divalproex.

Conclusions

Maintenance treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased time to recurrence of any event (mania, depression, or mixed) irrespective of the polarity of the index episode compared with placebo with lithium/divalproex. Long-term treatment with quetiapine was generally well-tolerated. Quetiapine with lithium/divalproex can provide an effective long-term treatment option for bipolar I disorder to prevent recurrences not only of mania but also depression.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

17.1 Information for Patients

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with SEROQUEL XR and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for SEROQUEL XR. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SEROQUEL XR.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. SEROQUEL XR is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^115KJQ4R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine

The risks of using quetiapine extended-release tablets in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine extended-release tablets, caution should be used when they are taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.

Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John's wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

CYP3A4 inhibitors:

Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose should be reduced to one-sixth of the original dose in patients coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A4 inducers:

Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold. Increased doses of quetiapine extended-release tablets up to 5-fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine extended-release tablets should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Anticholinergic Drugs:

Concomitant treatment with quetiapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Seroquel should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20)].

The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^114GWnTV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Some differences in the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine were noted between children/adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) and adults. When adjusted for weight, the AUC and Cmaxof quetiapine were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents compared to adults. The pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite, norquetiapine, were similar between children/adolescents and adults after adjusting for weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Schizophrenia

The efficacy and safety of quetiapine extended-release tablets in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years is supported by one 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with Seroquel [see Indications and Usage (1.1), Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release tablets in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age with schizophrenia have not been established.

### Efficacy and tolerability of extended release quetiapine fumarate monotherapy as maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112vmqm8]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Primary Objective

evaluate the efficacy (time to recurrence of depressive symptoms) of once daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) as maintenance monotherapy treatment to prevent relapse for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Methods

Time-to-event (maximum 52 weeks), double-blind, multicenter, randomized withdrawal, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine XR (50–300mg/day) comprising four treatment phases: enrollment (up to 28 days), open-label run-in (4–8 weeks), open-label stabilization (12–18 weeks), and randomization (up to 52 weeks). Seven hundred and seventy-six patients stabilized on quetiapine XR were eligible for randomization (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≤ 12 and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness [CGI-S] score ≤ 3); 391 received quetiapine XR and 385 received placebo (same dose as last open-label visit). Primary endpoint: time to recurrence of depressive event from randomization. Secondary outcomes included changes from randomization in MADRS total, CGI-S, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global, and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total scores. Adverse events were recorded throughout.

Results

Risk of recurrence of depressive event was significantly (P < .001) reduced by 66% (HR = .34; 95% CI: .25, .46) in patients randomized to continue with quetiapine XR versus patients randomized to switch to placebo. During the randomized phase, quetiapine XR maintained improvements in secondary outcomes (P < .001 for all): MADRS (0.15 versus 2.03), CGI-S (-0.03 versus 0.23); PSQI global (0.06 versus 1.35), and HAM-A total score (0.20 versus 1.58), respectively. The most common AEs (> 10% any group) during the randomized period were headache and insomnia.

Conclusions

Quetiapine XR maintenance therapy significantly reduced the risk of a depressive event in patients with MDD stabilized on quetiapine XR, with a safety and tolerability profile consistent with the known profile of quetiapine.

### Quetiapine (Seroquel) [^114KL8A6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine

The risks of using SEROQUEL XR in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of SEROQUEL XR, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.

Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John's wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

CYP3A4 inhibitors:

Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose should be reduced to one‑sixth of the original dose in patients coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A4 inducers:

Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold. Increased doses of SEROQUEL XR up to 5-fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of SEROQUEL XR should be reduced to the original level within 7–14 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Anticholinergic Drugs:

Concomitant treatment with quetiapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. SEROQUEL should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20)].

The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) [^1176BabX]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

SEROQUEL XR tablets should be swallowed whole and not split, chewed or crushed.

It is recommended that SEROQUEL XR be taken without food or with a light meal (approximately 300 calories) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

SEROQUEL XR should be administered once daily, preferably in the evening.

2.2 Recommended Dosing

The recommended initial dose, titration, dose range and maximum SEROQUEL XR dose for each approved indication is displayed in Table 1 below. After initial dosing, adjustments can be made upwards or downwards, if necessary, depending upon the clinical response and tolerability of the patient [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 and 14.3)].

n/a - not applicable

Maintenance Treatment for Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder

Maintenance Treatment — Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

2.3 Dose Modifications in Elderly Patients

Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

Elderly patients should be started on SEROQUEL XR 50 mg/day and the dose can be increased in increments of 50 mg/day depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient.

2.4 Dose Modifications in Hepatically Impaired Patients

Patients with hepatic impairment should be started on SEROQUEL XR 50 mg/day. The dose can be increased daily in increments of 50 mg/day to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient.

2.5 Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inhibitors

SEROQUEL XR dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when co-medicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of SEROQUEL XR should be increased by 6 fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of quetiapine or lithium as monotherapy for mania in bipolar disorder [^1169jq6L]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine monotherapy versus placebo for the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder.

Method

In an international, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week study, patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder (manic episode) were randomly assigned to treatment with quetiapine (flexibly dosed up to 800 mg/day), placebo, or lithium. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score at day 21. Data were gathered from April 2001 to May 2002.

Results

More patients in the quetiapine (72/107) and lithium (67/98) groups completed the study compared with the placebo group (35/97). Improvement (reduction) in YMRS score was significantly greater for quetiapine than placebo at day 7 (-8.03 vs. -4.89; p < .01), and the difference between groups continued to increase over time to day 21 (-14.6 vs. -6.7; p < .001) and to endpoint at day 84 (-20.3 vs. -9.0; p < .001). Significantly more quetiapine patients compared with placebo patients fulfilled YMRS response criteria at day 21 (53.3% vs. 27.4%; p < .001) and at day 84 (72.0% vs. 41.1%; p < .001). Quetiapine was also superior to placebo in efficacy at day 21 and day 84 by all secondary measures. Lithium-treated patients improved significantly compared with placebo patients and similarly to quetiapine-treated patients on the primary efficacy measure. The most common adverse events for quetiapine were dry mouth, somnolence, and weight gain, while lithium was associated with tremor and insomnia. The quetiapine and placebo groups had similar, low levels of extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse events.

Conclusions

Quetiapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in patients with bipolar mania and was well tolerated.

### Quetiapine for insomnia associated with refractory depression exacerbated by phenelzine [^115qmeC8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the successful treatment of phenelzine-associated insomnia with low-dose quetiapine in a patient with refractory depression.

Case Summary

A 42-year-old white man with severe major depression unresponsive to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, and tricyclic antidepressants improved following treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine. Insomnia, present to a moderate degree prior to antidepressant therapy, worsened markedly following phenelzine treatment and failed to respond to diphenhydramine, temazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, zolpidem, or trazodone given at high therapeutic doses. Sleep disturbance resolved with low-dose (50 mg) adjunctive quetiapine, with no adverse effects.

Discussion

Major depression refractory to standard therapy is a common and serious condition. Some cases respond to MAOIs; however, orthostatic hypotension and insomnia frequently occur. Potentially serious MAOI interactions with psychotropic drugs have raised concerns about combining these agents. In this case, a failure of a number of other medications known to treat MAOI-associated insomnia safely prompted a trial of quetiapine. Despite the possibility that enhanced serotonergic activity might have resulted in serotonin syndrome, no adverse interactions between phenelzine and quetiapine were noted. The use of low-dose, once-daily quetiapine, along with its unique binding properties, may account for its increased safety in combination with phenelzine.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that low-dose quetiapine may be an alternative treatment for phenelzine-associated insomnia. Further case reports are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of combining these agents.

Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents

Children and adolescent patients should have their blood pressure measured at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Leukopenia/Neutropenia

Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should be advised that they should have their CBC monitored while taking SEROQUEL XR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Patients should be advised of the risk of somnolence or sedation (which may lead to falls), especially during the period of initial dose titration. Patients should be cautioned about performing any activity requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating machinery, until they are reasonably certain quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

Heat Exposure and Dehydration

Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)].

Concomitant Medication

As with other medications, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Pregnancy and Nursing

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with SEROQUEL XR [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3)].

Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program

SEROQUEL XR is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that may include other measures (psychological, educational, and social). Effectiveness and safety of SEROQUEL XR have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age for schizophrenia or less than 10 years of age for bipolar mania. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. The decision to prescribe atypical antipsychotic medication will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient's symptoms [see Indications and Usage (1.4) _RefID_567fa960–84b4–47a8–84f3–04a3ac7c2].

Approach and interpretation of recommendations — direction, strength, public comment, and definitions indicate that the task force assigned a direction (for or against) and strength (STRONG or WEAK) for each recommendation statement. Public input was solicited for a two-week period on the AASM website, and based on comments the task force decided to include data from clinicaltrials.gov, which allowed development of a recommendation for the use of suvorexant; due to a conflict of interest, a task force member did not participate in that recommendation. The guideline states it should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other reasonable methods, defines a STRONG recommendation as one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, always be following when pharmacological treatment is indicated, and states that a WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in appropriateness and requires that the clinician use his/her clinical knowledge and experience and refer to the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^117DMi1h]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder — quetiapine risks and monitoring: Evidence on using low-dose quetiapine is limited to a few studies and case series with short duration, small sample sizes, and vague and incomplete details, making efficacy inconclusive. Doses typically used for insomnia are lower than the FDA-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day, and all antipsychotics, including low-dose quetiapine, are known for causing harms; quetiapine has a black box warning indicating a 1.6 to 1.7 fold increase in mortality in elderly populations with dementia-related psychosis. All antipsychotics carry a strong recommendation in the 2023 Beers Criteria to avoid their use in the elderly except in schizophrenia or bipolar disorders due to an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident and a greater rate of cognitive decline and mortality in persons with dementia; anticholinergic effects, including sedating and hypotensive effects, occur with all antipsychotics in varying frequency and severity. It is advised that routine monitoring of metabolic parameters be conducted with all antipsychotics due to the risk of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, and active-duty service member use of an antipsychotic may affect deploy ability.

### Treatment of insomnia associated with clinical depression [^113Yf7CA]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are almost always present in patients with depression. Though sleep disturbances generally abate with the resolution of depression, some patients continue to report poor sleep. Since a number of studies have demonstrated that insomnia increases the risk of new-onset depression and recurrence of depression, optimal management of insomnia associated with depression becomes an important clinical goal. Antidepressant agents have variable effects on sleep and in fact, some antidepressants seem to worsen sleep in patients with depression. This article reviews various treatment options in the management of patients presenting with insomnia and depression, including single agents, combination strategies and behavioral interventions.

### Combined treatment with quetiapine and sertindole in therapy refractory insomnia after clozapine discontinuation [^11746uhC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Insomnia associated with chronic schizophrenia and after clozapine discontinuation represents a common, but mostly not predominant, complaint and often does not respond sufficiently to classical hypnotics. We report the case of a 46-year-old patient with schizophrenia who developed a rebound insomnia confirmed by polysomnography after discontinuation of long-term treatment with clozapine and changing to sertindole therapy. Zolpidem, zolpiclone and chloral hydrate only led to short-term improvement of subjective sleep quality. An add-on therapy with 300 mg quetiapine resulted in improved subjective quality of sleep regarding sleep latency and the number of nocturnal awakenings. The combination of the two neuroleptics did not lead to increased QTc intervals (normal QTc < 450 ms) or metabolic side effects. In conclusion, the combination of sertindole and quetiapine might be a safe and effective combination in therapy-refractory insomnia after clozapine discontinuation in schizophrenia.

### Effects of once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) on quality of life and sleep in elderly patients with major depressive disorder [^111eQwBw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is frequently associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) and sleep disturbance. We investigated the effects of once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) monotherapy on QoL and sleep in elderly patients with MDD.

Methods

Prospectively planned analysis of patient-reported data from an 11-week (9-week randomized; 2-week post-treatment), double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study. Elderly patients (≥ 66 years; DSM-IV MDD; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] total score ≥ 22, HAM-D Item 1 score ≥ 2) were randomized to quetiapine XR (flexible dosing 50–300 mg/day) or placebo.

Primary Outcome

MADRS total score change from randomization at Week 9. Patient-reported outcomes: Quality of Life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) % of maximum total score (Items 1–14), Q-LES-Q-SF Item 15 ('satisfaction with medication'), Q-LES-Q-SF Item 16 ('overall life satisfaction'), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score.

Results

In total, 338 patients were randomized (166 quetiapine XR; 172 placebo). At Week 9, quetiapine XR significantly reduced MADRS total score (-16.33; difference: -7.54; 95% CI: -9.23, -5.85; p < 0.001) versus placebo (-8.79). Quetiapine XR significantly improved Q-LES-Q-SF % of maximum total score (16.86; difference: 7.69; 95% CI: 4.99, 10.39; p < 0.001) versus placebo (9.17), with numerical improvement in Q-LES-Q-SF Item 15 and improvement in Item 16. Improvement in PSQI global score was observed with quetiapine XR (-6.42; difference: -3.52; 95% CI: -4.26, -2.79; p < 0.001) versus placebo (-2.89).

Limitations

Lack of active-comparator arm, flexible-dose design, acute treatment period.

Conclusions

Quetiapine XR monotherapy improved QoL and sleep in elderly patients with MDD.

### A 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, chlorpromazine-controlled non-inferiorityrandomized phase iiitrial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL) extended-release (XR) in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and acute episodes [^112obM9U]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate extended-release (XR) in the treatment of Chinese patients with acute schizophrenia. Multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled non-inferiority randomized study in Chinese patients (n = 388) with schizophrenia randomly assigned to quetiapine XR or chlorpromazine for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was the change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at the end of treatment. Safety objectives included adverse event (AE) monitoring, laboratory test results, and electrocardiograms. Changes in PANSS total score were -33.4 for quetiapine XR and -35.9 for chlorpromazine (P > 0.05). Least squares mean changes were: positive subscale, -9.9 ± 0.53 and -11.1 ± 0.51; negative subscale, -5.9 ± 0.50 and -6.7 ± 0.48; general psychopathology subscale, -12.9 ± 0.74 and -13.9 ± 0.71; aggression and hostility cluster scores, -4.8 ± 0.33 and -5.4 ± 0.32; and depression cluster scores, -1.8 ± 0.18 and -1.7 ± 0.18, for quetiapine XR and chlorpromazine, respectively. For quetiapine XR, AEs were constipation, dizziness, insomnia, and agitation, and nine patients (4.6%) discontinued due to AEs. For chlorpromazine, AEs were extrapyramidal symptoms, constipation, insomnia, dizziness, and agitation, and 17 patients (8.9%) discontinued due to AEs; two patients reported serious AEs. Quetiapine XR monotherapy was not inferior to chlorpromazine for treating acute schizophrenia in Chinese patients and was well tolerated.

5.19 Discontinuation Syndrome

Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with SEROQUEL XR that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1993) for SEROQUEL XR and 6.7% (71/1065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week post-discontinuation. Gradual withdrawal is advised [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]

5.20 Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects

Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]

Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility.

Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation.

To evaluate the safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE (January 1990-November 2011) using the terms quetiapine, insomnia, sleep, low-dose, subtherapeutic, safety, and weight gain.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two prospective trials were identified that evaluated the effect of quetiapine in primary insomnia. In addition, 2 retrospective cohort studies were identified that evaluated the safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia. Several case reports on adverse effects with low doses of the drug were also included.

Data Synthesis

Quetiapine is commonly used off-label for treatment of insomnia. When used for sleep, doses typically seen are less than the Food and Drug Administration-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day; those evaluated in the studies reviewed here were 25–200 mg/day). At recommended doses, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine are associated with metabolic adverse events (diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia). Adverse effects in the prospective trials were patient-reported and were minor, including drowsiness and dry mouth; however, the trials were limited by their small sample size and short duration. The retrospective cohort studies found that quetiapine was associated with significant increases in weight compared to baseline. Serious adverse events identified from case reports included fatal hepatotoxicity, restless legs syndrome, akathisia, and weight gain.

Conclusions

There are potential safety concerns when using low-dose quetiapine for treatment of insomnia. These concerns should be evaluated in further prospective studies. Based on limited data and potential safety concerns, use of low-dose quetiapine for insomnia is not recommended.

Regarding specific circumstances for insomnia, more specifically with respect to patients with periodic limb movements of sleep, AAN 2016 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following agents in patients with periodic leg movements of sleep, specifically when targeting the Periodic Limb Movement Index as measured by polysomnography:

- ropinirole

- pramipexole

- rotigotine

- cabergoline

- pregabalin

- levodopa.

Other agents for primary insomnia — limited or excluded evidence: For oxazepam, a crossover study of oxazepam 25 mg versus placebo in 28 patients with "insomnia" found subjective interval ratings showed a significant reduction in sleep latency (SL) and significant improvement in quality of sleep (QOS). A quetiapine placebo-controlled study included only 13 subjects; numerical increases in subjective total sleep time (TST) and decreases in subjective SL were not statistically significant. A gabapentin open-label investigation with 18 subjects and no placebo control was excluded. For paroxetine, one variable-dosage trial in 15 patients without placebo was excluded, and another randomized study in 27 older adults evaluated paroxetine 10 mg/20 mg versus placebo with doses pooled for analysis.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^112nAEhf]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The observations on the high prevalence of subjective insomnia complaints and objective worsening of sleep architecture in PSG studies in depressed patients are important for the choice of pharmacological treatment. Antidepressant drugs substantially differ in their acute effects on sleep. Some of them alleviate sleep disturbances, but other may disrupt sleep, which is related to poor treatment compliance. Persistent insomnia symptoms may also result in unfavorable clinical outcome, e.g. increased suicide risk. Therefore, it is important to know what is the preferred pharmacological treatment in a depressed patient with clinically relevant insomnia symptoms.
