## Question

Hydralazine for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of hydralazine in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LV outflow tract obstruction, and whether it is contraindicated in this setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hydralazine's hemodynamic profile. Then, I should review the pathophysiology of obstructive HCM and why afterload matters. Next, I will check contemporary guideline recommendations regarding vasodilators in LVOTO. After that, I'll verify guideline-directed medical therapies that are preferred. I should also reconcile potential confusion from heart failure guidelines that endorse hydralazine in HFrEF. Finally, I will consider edge-case clinical scenarios and synthesize a clear conclusion with practical recommendations [^112N9mVq] [^114Y4wtH].

> Let me first confirm hydralazine's pharmacology. At first glance, I might think it is a balanced vasodilator reducing both preload and afterload, but wait, let me verify the label and pharmacology data. Hydralazine is a direct arterial vasodilator with preferential arteriolar dilation that lowers systemic vascular resistance, typically triggering reflex sympathetic activation with increased heart rate and cardiac output, and it does not meaningfully venodilate to reduce preload, which is an important distinction here [^114Y4wtH] [^116kgWrk]. I should also recall its labeled contraindications are unrelated to HCM per se, but include coronary artery disease and rheumatic mitral valvular disease, which does not change the hemodynamic risk it poses in LVOTO [^115CsNbR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before aligning this with obstructive HCM pathophysiology. In obstructive HCM, dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction worsens with decreased afterload, increased contractility, and tachycardia, whereas management generally aims to maintain adequate afterload and preload while reducing heart rate and contractility to mitigate the gradient and SAM-related MR [^11164P2T] [^112PdgTZ]. I need to ensure I keep that mechanistic anchor in mind because it explains why vasodilators and inotropes can be hazardous in LVOTO [^115U3YZM].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations specifically about vasodilators. The 2023 ESC cardiomyopathy guidelines explicitly recommend avoiding arterial and venous dilators, including nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, in patients with resting or provocable LVOTO, and hydralazine, as an arterial vasodilator, falls squarely into that "avoid" category mechanistically and clinically [^112N9mVq]. Let me also double-check acute care guidance: in severe provocable LVOTO with hypotension and pulmonary edema unresponsive to fluids, guidelines favor beta-blockers and vasoconstrictors rather than vasodilators, underscoring the same principle of maintaining afterload in obstruction [^116vQ1U9].

> Now, I will examine what therapies are actually recommended for symptomatic obstructive HCM. First-line agents are beta-blockers to blunt heart rate and contractility, with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem as alternatives when beta-blockers are not tolerated, although I should caution that verapamil's vasodilatory effect can worsen gradients in severe obstruction or hypotension and therefore must be used carefully [^112PdgTZ] [^117DuRyw]. When symptoms persist, disopyramide can be added or used when other agents are not tolerated, leveraging its negative inotropy to reduce gradients and improve symptoms in LVOTO [^1168Q2BR] [^113TWJzN].

> I should confirm the role of disease-specific agents. Cardiac myosin inhibitors now provide targeted therapy that directly reduces hypercontractility and LVOT gradients, with mavacamten supported by randomized data and regulatory approval for symptomatic obstructive HCM, and aficamten showing consistent gradient and symptom benefits in phase 3 as well, with practical titration strategies described to balance efficacy and LVEF safety [^117DximB] [^113Z3Vwv]. Let me verify the labeling because it matters clinically: mavacamten (Camzyos) is FDA-approved for symptomatic obstructive HCM to improve functional capacity and symptoms, and dose-titration schemas have been operationalized in trials and practice recommendations [^112TeqCE] [^1148tuY2].

> But wait, what if someone argues hydralazine is endorsed in heart failure guidelines, so could it help here. I should double-check the scope of those recommendations. ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC heart failure guidelines recommend hydralazine–isosorbide dinitrate for HFrEF in selected populations or when ACEi/ARB/ARNI are not tolerated; these recommendations do not extend to HCM with dynamic LVOTO because the pathophysiology is distinct and vasodilation can exacerbate obstruction, not relieve it [^113we3Hx] [^115LZuZp]. I need to check whether HFpEF studies shed light here, but notably, trials evaluating isosorbide dinitrate, with or without hydralazine, excluded HCM, reflecting concern about using vasodilators in this phenotype and leaving no supportive evidence base for hydralazine in obstructive HCM [^1163riNi] [^116FpHKj].

> I will now examine edge-case clinical scenarios to ensure there isn't a niche for hydralazine. In acute hypotension with severe LVOTO and pulmonary edema, the recommended approach is fluids as needed to augment preload, intravenous or oral beta-blockade to blunt hypercontractility, and a pure vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine to restore afterload and reduce the gradient, which is the mechanistic opposite of what hydralazine would do, so hydralazine should be avoided in this scenario as well [^116vQ1U9] [^1168Q2BR]. In related LVOTO states such as Takotsubo with obstruction, expert practice similarly favors beta-blockade and phenylephrine, again reinforcing that vasodilation worsens the pathophysiology, not improves it [^111yVNg6].

> Let me consider coexisting hypertension in a patient with obstructive HCM, because that often prompts hydralazine use in other settings. Preferred blood pressure control aligns with HCM therapy, using beta-blockers or carefully selected non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, recognizing that verapamil's vasodilation can occasionally aggravate LVOTO in hypotensive patients and should be used judiciously, with low-dose diuretics only cautiously for congestion since over-diuresis can precipitate gradient increases by reducing preload [^112PdgTZ] [^114sQb7B]. I should double-check that low-dose diuretics are permissible in LVOTO when needed, and indeed guidelines suggest cautious use to relieve exertional dyspnea while avoiding excessive preload reduction [^112wepFy].

> Next, I should review whether hydralazine appears in any HCM algorithms or consensus pathways. Hydralazine is absent from guideline-directed treatment algorithms for obstructive HCM, whereas beta-blockers, NDHP-CCBs, disopyramide, and cardiac myosin inhibitors are consistently represented, which further supports the conclusion that hydralazine has no therapeutic role and poses hemodynamic risk in LVOTO [^11164P2T] [^112PdgTZ]. This aligns with the explicit "avoid vasodilators" directive and the mechanistic rationale we verified earlier, strengthening the recommendation against hydralazine in obstructive HCM [^112N9mVq].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should double-check that my reasoning is consistent across mechanism, guidelines, and alternatives. Hydralazine is a direct arteriolar vasodilator that lowers afterload and provokes reflex tachycardia and increased contractility, all of which can worsen dynamic LVOTO, and contemporary ESC guidance recommends avoiding arterial and venous vasodilators in LVOTO while favoring negative inotropy and afterload maintenance, with proven alternatives including beta-blockers, verapamil or diltiazem in selected patients, disopyramide, and disease-specific myosin inhibitors such as mavacamten or aficamten where available and appropriate [^114Y4wtH] [^112N9mVq]. Therefore, hydralazine should be avoided and is effectively contraindicated in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the risk of exacerbating outflow obstruction and destabilizing hemodynamics, and management should instead follow guideline-directed therapy as outlined above, reserving vasoconstrictors such as phenylephrine for hypotensive LVOTO crises and pursuing septal reduction therapy when symptoms remain refractory despite optimal pharmacotherapy [^116vQ1U9] [^112PdgTZ] [^1168Q2BR] [^117DximB] [^113Z3Vwv].

---

Hydralazine should not be used in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) because it **lowers afterload and increases heart rate** [^114Y4wtH], which can **worsen obstruction and symptoms**. Current ESC guidelines explicitly **advise against arterial and venous dilators** [^112N9mVq], including hydralazine, in patients with resting or provocable LVOTO. First-line therapy is beta-blockers [^11164P2T]; if not tolerated, use verapamil or diltiazem [^112PdgTZ], and consider disopyramide [^1168Q2BR] or myosin inhibitors (mavacamten, aficamten) [^116VZ6hR] [^113Z3Vwv] for refractory cases. Hydralazine is only for hypertension [^116kgWrk] or HFrEF when standard therapies are contraindicated [^113we3Hx] [^115LZuZp], and is not recommended for HCM with LVOTO [^112N9mVq].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of hydralazine

Hydralazine is a **direct arteriolar vasodilator** that reduces peripheral resistance and afterload but also triggers **reflex sympathetic activation**, increasing heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output [^114Y4wtH]. This reflex tachycardia and increased contractility can **exacerbate dynamic LVOTO** in HCM [^114sQb7B].

---

## Pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy obstruction

HCM features asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, leading to **dynamic LVOTO** that is exacerbated by reduced afterload, increased contractility, or tachycardia [^11164P2T]. Accordingly, therapies that lower afterload or raise heart rate can **worsen obstruction** and symptoms [^112N9mVq].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding hydralazine use in HCM

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting hydralazine for HCM with LVOTO, and current guidelines **advise against its use**:

- The 2023 ESC guidelines recommend avoiding arterial and venous dilators [^112N9mVq], including hydralazine, in patients with resting or provocable LVOTO.
- Hydralazine is indicated for hypertension [^116kgWrk] and, with isosorbide dinitrate, for HFrEF when standard therapies are contraindicated [^113we3Hx] [^115LZuZp].
- There are no trials or case series supporting hydralazine in HCM with LVOTO.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of hydralazine in HCM

Hydralazine can **worsen LVOTO** and symptoms via:

- Reflex tachycardia and increased contractility, increasing LVOT gradients [^114Y4wtH].
- Lower afterload, increasing obstruction severity [^112N9mVq].
- Hypotension and syncope from worsened obstruction [^11164P2T].
- Drug-induced lupus and other adverse effects.

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments for HCM obstruction

Guideline-recommended therapies for HCM with LVOTO include:

| **Medication class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Negative inotropy and chronotropy | Reduce LVOT gradients and improve symptoms [^11164P2T] | First-line therapy |
| Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) | Negative inotropy and chronotropy | Improve symptoms and reduce gradients [^112PdgTZ] | Alternative to beta-blockers |
| Disopyramide | Negative inotropy | Reduces gradients and improves symptoms [^1168Q2BR] | Second-line therapy |
| Myosin inhibitors (mavacamten, aficamten) | Reduce hypercontractility | Reduce gradients and improve symptoms [^116VZ6hR] [^113Z3Vwv] | Emerging therapy |

---

## Clinical scenarios where hydralazine might be considered

Hydralazine is **not recommended** for HCM with LVOTO, but may be used for hypertension [^116kgWrk] in HCM patients without LVOTO and for HFrEF when standard therapies are contraindicated [^113we3Hx].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **recommend against hydralazine** in HCM with LVOTO due to its potential to worsen obstruction and symptoms [^112N9mVq]. Recommended therapies include beta-blockers [^11164P2T], non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [^112PdgTZ], disopyramide [^1168Q2BR], and myosin inhibitors [^116VZ6hR].

---

Hydralazine is **contraindicated in HCM with LVOTO** because it can worsen obstruction and symptoms; use guideline-recommended therapies instead [^112N9mVq].

### Hydralazine hydrochloride [^114Y4wtH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Although the precise mechanism of action of hydralazine is not fully understood, its major effects are on the cardiovascular system. Hydralazine apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. By altering cellular calcium metabolism, hydralazine interferes with the calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for initiating or maintaining the contractile state.

The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydralazine results in decreased arterial blood pressure (diastolic more than systolic), decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output. Hydralazine usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and consequent sodium reabsorption. Hydralazine also maintains or increases renal and cerebral blood flow.

The average maximal decrease in blood pressure usually occurs 10 to 80 minutes after administration of hydralazine hydrochloride injection. No other pharmacokinetic data on hydralazine hydrochloride injection are available.

### Future role of new negative inotropic agents in the era of established surgical myectomy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115jpUVm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

For 60 years, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has periodically been encumbered by controversy and uncertainty about its management strategies, due largely to heterogeneous clinical presentation and relatively low prevalence in cardiovascular practice. Nevertheless, HCM is now recognized as a contemporary and treatable disease, a stature unanticipated in earlier eras.

Indeed, initially, HCM was a disease for which management was based largely on pharmacotherapy (e.g. beta‐blockers and verapamil), as well as infrequent high‐risk surgical procedures. However, predominantly non-pharmacologic innovations over the last 20 to 25 years have dramatically adjusted patient expectations for longevity and good quality of life, including reversibility of heart failure with surgical myectomy and its selective alternative alcohol septal ablation.

In the present commentary, we discuss the effective treatment modalities currently available for HCM-related heart failure due to left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction, anticipating the emergence of new medications for symptomatic patients, and the role such therapies may have with respect particularly to time-honored surgical myectomy.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy care roadmap illustrates the foundation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy originating from genetics, the consequences of secondary remodeling, and therapeutic options before and after secondary remodeling occurs.

Mutations of the cardiac sarcomere are the underlying cause of HCM. These mutations lead to the excessive cross-bridging of myosin heads with actin and increased cardiac contractility, ultimately generating the HCM phenotypes, from myocardial hypertrophy to impaired relaxation, LVOTO, ischemia, scar formation, and arrhythmias. Inhibiting the myosin ATPase via CMIs has been shown to reduce the number of available myosin heads, resulting in a return to the normal contractile state, relief of LVOTO, decreased myocardial wall stress, and improved relaxation. There are two main CMIs currently in various stages of development: MyoKardia has developed mavacamten (formerly MY461), MYK-224, and MYK-581, while Cytokinetics has developed aficamten (formerly CK-274).

- **Table on clinical trials**: Clinical trials focusing on obstructive and non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, their study design, and brief summaries are noted.

Mavacamten, a first-in-class, allosteric, reversible inhibitor of B-cardiac myosin, is currently FDA approved for treatment of symptomatic oHCM. Mavacamten inhibits cardiac-specific myosin ATPase, which decreases myosin-actin cross-bridging as this is an energy-dependent process. ATPase inhibition has a positive dose-dependent relationship.

### Oral disopyramide for the acute treatment of severe outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the ICU setting [^117PT9nr]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

When severe COPD and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) coexist, management is challenging and complex. Drug contraindications limit pharmacologic options, and patients may not be suitable candidates for surgical septal myectomy due to severe pulmonary disease.

We describe a case of an elderly woman with severe reactive COPD who presented with an infectious exacerbation and dyspnea that progressed to near intubation due to heart failure from coexistent obstructive HCM. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed massive asymmetric septal hypertrophy and a diffusely hyperkinetic left ventricle with a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 92 mm Hg. Two and a half hours after oral administration of disopyramide, the LVOT gradient had decreased to 25 mm Hg, with a corresponding immediate improvement in symptoms.

### 2020 AHA/ACC guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Executive summary: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114mYMvY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

This executive summary of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy clinical practice guideline provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to diagnose and manage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adult and pediatric patients, as well as supporting documentation to encourage their use.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases.

- **Structure**: Many recommendations from the earlier hypertrophic cardiomyopathy guidelines have been updated with new evidence or a better understanding of earlier evidence. This summary operationalizes the recommendations from the full guideline and presents a combination of diagnostic work-up, genetic and family screening, risk stratification approaches, lifestyle modifications, surgical and catheter interventions, and medications that constitute components of guideline-directed medical therapy. For both guideline-directed medical therapy and other recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader is advised to follow dosing, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions based on product insert materials.

### Indications for surgery in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112EUDSu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Will the advent of new pharmacologic agents decrease the number of surgeries performed for obstructive HCM? We are skeptical about that here. Rather, we expect increased diagnostic recognition of HCM because of its higher profile in the medical community and better imaging. HCM is no longer a poor-prognosis disease due to the modern application of lifesaving therapy with the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, alongside quality-of-life-improving therapies. We expect increased referrals to HCM centers, and that a "rising tide will lift all boats", with robust referrals for both medical care and appropriate surgical referral in a stepped manner. Regardless of how the mix of therapies pans out, the future is bright for patients with obstructive HCM.

### Aficamten or metoprolol monotherapy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1114q5Yv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Beta-blockers have traditionally been the initial treatment for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), despite limited evidence supporting their efficacy. Aficamten, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, reduces left ventricular outflow tract gradients, improves exercise capacity, and decreases HCM symptoms when added to standard medications. However, whether aficamten as monotherapy offers greater clinical benefits than beta-blockers remains unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted an international, double-blind, double-dummy trial in which adults with symptomatic obstructive HCM were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive aficamten (at a daily dose of 5 mg to 20 mg) plus placebo or metoprolol (at a daily dose of 50 mg to 200 mg) plus placebo. The primary endpoint was the change in peak oxygen uptake at week 24. Secondary endpoints included improvement at week 24 in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and changes at week 24 in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS), left ventricular outflow tract gradient after the Valsalva maneuver, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, left atrial volume index, and left ventricular mass index.

- **Results**: A total of 88 patients were assigned to the aficamten group, and 87 to the metoprolol group. The mean age of the patients was 58 years, 58.3% were men, and the mean left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 47 mm Hg at rest and 74 mm Hg after the Valsalva maneuver. At 24 weeks, the change in peak oxygen uptake was 1.1 mL per kilogram of body weight per minute.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114Q9XS3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited cardiac diseases, characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, myofiber disarray, and fibrosis. Clinical manifestations include exercise intolerance, heart failure (HF), and cardiac arrhythmias, including sudden death. Approximately two thirds of patients with HCM demonstrate a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient at rest or with provocation. This obstruction is thought to be the primary driver of symptoms. A resting LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mm Hg is a strong independent predictor for progression of HF and death. Conversely, nonobstructive HCM (rest/stress gradient < 30 mm Hg) is generally managed conservatively. Recent guidelines and expert reviews summarized that a "majority of non-obstructive HCM patients experience a relatively stable clinical course without significant symptoms, high-risk profile, or the necessity of major treatment options".

Novel imaging methods have documented that, in addition to LVOT gradients, HCM is associated with myocardial fibrosis, microvascular ischemia, and abnormal cardiac mechanics, which may be important contributors to clinical adverse events. We recently demonstrated that more patients with nonobstructive HCM had a large scar burden (on magnetic resonance imaging) and higher rates of microvascular ischemia (by positron emission tomography). Thus, there is evidence suggesting that nonobstructive HCM may not be pathophysiologically benign.

### Mavacamten for treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (EXPLORER-HCM): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^117DximB]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Cardiac muscle hypercontractility is a key pathophysiological abnormality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a major determinant of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Available pharmacological options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are inadequate or poorly tolerated and are not disease-specific. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mavacamten, a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, in symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXPLORER-HCM) conducted in 68 clinical cardiovascular centres across 13 countries, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an LVOT gradient of 50 mm Hg or greater and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III symptoms were assigned (1:1) to receive mavacamten (starting at 5 mg) or placebo for 30 weeks. Visits for assessment of patient status occurred every 2–4 weeks. Serial evaluations included echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and blood collection for laboratory tests and mavacamten plasma concentration. The primary endpoint was a 1.5 mL/kg per min or greater increase in peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) and at least one NYHA class reduction, or a 3.0 mL/kg per min or greater pVO2 increase without NYHA class worsening. Secondary endpoints assessed changes in post-exercise LVOT gradient, pVO2, NYHA class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS), and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Symptom Questionnaire Shortness-of-Breath subscore (HCMSQ-SoB).

### Isosorbide dinitrate, with or without hydralazine, does not reduce wave reflections, left ventricular hypertrophy, or myocardial fibrosis in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1163riNi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Inclusion criteria included symptomatic heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (LV ejection fraction > 50%) and at least one of the following conditions: (1) prior hospitalization for decompensated heart failure; (2) acute treatment for heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics or hemofiltration; (3) echocardiographic evidence for elevated filling pressures; (4) chronic treatment with a loop diuretic for control of symptoms; (5) or an elevated N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐pro‐BNP) level. Patients were required to be on stable medical therapy for the past month.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Exclusion criteria included any rhythm other than sinus with native conduction, noncardiac conditions significantly limiting exercise (orthopedic or neuromuscular), known hypertrophic, infiltrative, or inflammatory cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, significant pulmonary disease, primary pulmonary arteriopathy, acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization within the past 60 days, clinically significant perfusion defects on stress imaging without subsequent revascularization, significant valvular disease (e.g. moderate or greater mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis), uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg), prior reduced LV ejection fraction < 50%, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, therapy with organic nitrates or hydralazine, and elevations on liver function test results. Additional exclusion criteria for the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) included impaired renal function.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^112wepFy]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically in the context of managing obstructive symptoms, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of low-dose diuretics cautiously. This is suggested to improve exertional dyspnea in symptomatic patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).

### Disopyramide revisited for treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Efficacy and safety in patients treated for at least 5 years [^1129b7mt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

By design, we restricted our analysis to patients who tolerated and desired to continue taking disopyramide continuously for at least 5 years to focus on the long-term outcomes related to this treatment strategy, which had not previously been evaluated. In the present cohort, we cannot ascertain the proportion of patients who discontinued disopyramide over shorter time periods due to lack of efficacy or side effects. However, medium-term results have been previously reported, and our practice patterns did not change during this period. These prior studies demonstrated a variability in this proportion on the basis of indication for use, as well as availability of invasive septal reduction therapy as an alternative treatment option. In addition, similar to the majority of prior analyses in HCM, our patients were predominantly White individuals, and there remains a major unmet need to better define the clinical course and outcomes of HCM in more racially diverse populations.

### Surgical myectomy versus alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Will there ever be a randomized trial [^111xVGeh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is an important pathophysiological feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and a predictor of clinical deterioration and cardiovascular mortality. Patients with marked obstruction and severe limiting symptoms refractory to maximum medical management are considered candidates for invasive septal reduction therapy, which includes surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation (ASA).

Availability of both surgical myectomy and ASA has polarized the cardiovascular community concerning the most appropriate implementation of these two interventions. The ensuing controversy of whether myectomy and ASA are truly equivalent options has resulted in calls for a prospective randomized trial. However, such a myectomy versus ASA trial, adequately powered to compare the key issue of long-term outcome, poses a myriad of practical problems that seem virtually insurmountable.

Therefore, it is appropriate to revisit this evolving debate at this time, identify the unique obstacles to a randomized study design, and achieve some clarity concerning the most realistic clinical strategies for symptomatic patients with HCM and outflow obstruction.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting over one million individuals in Europe. Patients with HCM often require pharmacological intervention to control symptoms, dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, and microvascular ischaemia.

Treatment strategies in HCM are predicated on the empirical use of long-standing drugs, such as beta-adrenergic and calcium blockers, although there is little evidence supporting their clinical benefit in this disease. In the six decades since the original description of the disease, fewer than 50 pharmacological studies have been performed, enrolling just over 2000 HCM patients. The majority of these studies were small, non-randomized cohorts.

As our understanding of the genetic basis and pathophysiology of HCM improves, the availability of transgenic and preclinical models provides clues to novel and promising treatment modalities. Furthermore, the number of patients identified and followed at international referral centres has grown steadily over the decades.

As a result, the opportunity now exists to implement adequately designed pharmacological trials in HCM, using both established and novel drug therapies, to potentially intervene in the complex pathophysiology of the disease and alter its natural course. Therefore, it is timely to review the available evidence for the pharmacological therapy of HCM patients, highlight the most relevant gaps in knowledge, and address some of the most promising areas for future pharmacological research.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1133XPLu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This study was conducted at a single, tertiary referral center, which may introduce a referral bias. However, this cohort is consistent with those reported in most hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) publications. There is a possibility that asymptomatic patients were not referred, but this bias should uniformly affect all groups, minimizing its impact on the results.

As an observational study, we were not equipped to determine why patients with nonobstructive HCM may develop more ventricular arrhythmias or why those with obstructive HCM experience more atrial arrhythmias. Previous research, including our own, speculates on mechanisms underlying these complications in specific HCM subgroups. Genotyping was not included in the analysis, as it is not standard for HCM clinical diagnosis. Literature shows no clear connection between genotype and clinical outcomes in HCM.

Despite a large number of patients having up to 10 years of follow-up, the median follow-up period was approximately 3 years. Replication of our findings with large-scale studies and longer follow-up is warranted. We employed a composite clinical endpoint consistent with other seminal HCM studies, highlighting that low mortality and adverse event rates are well-documented. Additionally, focusing solely on mortality ignores significant nonfatal complications that impact quality of life in HCM patients.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115q8JA3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Given the higher rates of symptoms and complications, it is understandable that clinicians pay most attention to patients with obstructive HCM. However, this focus on high gradients seems to have inexorably led to an underappreciation of the adverse outcomes in patients with nonobstructive HCM. A recent study with 573 patients reported the clinical course was largely favorable in nonobstructive HCM, with low risk of worsening heart failure (HF) and low mortality. Although the annual mortality for nonobstructive HCM was < 1%, the rate of disease-related events, many of them potentially life-threatening, was high. Thus, the data in that study corroborate our data on the high rates of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with nonobstructive HCM.

In a report by Hebl et al, the prevalence of ICD placements preceding the index visit was also up to 11% of the cohort, reflecting the heavy burden of ventricular arrhythmia. Our observation that particular patients with nonobstructive HCM are at high risk is the key message of this article, and hopefully, it stimulates the wider HCM community to examine their own databases to either confirm or validate our observation in this large cohort. Furthermore, our findings suggest that evaluation of nonobstructive HCM should be more nuanced and deliberative. More important, the lack of high gradients should not lull clinicians into reassuring patients with nonobstructive hemodynamics without further investigation.

### Effect of beta-blocker therapy on the response to mavacamten in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115a1HLT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). High credibility.

The EXPLORER-HCM trial demonstrated that mavacamten improves exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Notably, the effects on the primary endpoint, which included a composite of peak oxygen consumption (VO₂) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, were more pronounced in patients who were not on beta-blockers compared to those who were. This study aimed to determine if the influence of background treatment was consistent across other clinically meaningful parameters.

Subgroup analyses by beta-blocker use were conducted on patients with oHCM from the EXPLORER-HCM and mavacamten long-term extension (MAVA-LTE) studies. Within EXPLORER-HCM, 189 patients (75.3%) were taking beta-blockers, while 62 patients (24.7%) were either on non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or no background HCM medication. Among those on beta-blockers, 170 patients (90.4%) exhibited chronotropic incompetence.

Improvements in peak VO₂ at week 30 with mavacamten compared to placebo were less pronounced in patients receiving beta-blockers, with a mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 1.04 [0.12, 1.95] ml/kg/min. In contrast, those without beta-blockers showed greater improvements, with a mean difference [95% CI] of 2.69 [1.29, 4.09] ml/kg/min. However, enhancements in non-heart rate-dependent parameters, like the Vₑ/VCO₂ slope, seemed unaffected by beta-blockers.

The study further observed that improvements in functional capacity parameters at week 30 with mavacamten compared to placebo were independent of beta-blockade. Specifically, there were reductions in the post-exercise left ventricular outflow tract gradient, with beta-blockers showing a mean difference [95% CI] of -37.9 [-48.0, -27.9] mmHg and without beta-blockers a mean difference [95% CI] of -33.5 [-53.6, -13.3] mmHg.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^115LZuZp]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

The 2021 ESC guidelines for heart failure management recommend considering the initiation of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to reduce the risk of death in patients with symptomatic HFrEF who are unable to tolerate or have contraindications to ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARNis.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^117MGvJE]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly for the management of obstructive symptoms, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a cardiac myosin adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor (mavacamten). This should be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose with echocardiographic surveillance of LVEF. It is suggested as monotherapy in symptomatic adult patients with resting or provoked LVOTO (exercise or Valsalva maneuver) who are intolerant of, or have contraindications to, β-blockers, verapamil/diltiazem, or disopyramide.

### Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Takotsubo syndrome: How to deal with left ventricular ballooning [^111yVNg6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with apical ballooning and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are all treated with beta-blockers, either intravenous or oral depending on the clinical urgency, along with phenylephrine for hypotension. Clinical experience has shown that in cases of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OHCM), intravenous metoprolol 15 mg administered over 15 minutes (or intravenous propranolol) is safe. This method has the advantage of not requiring time-delaying drug titration and results in the fall of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient and a rise in blood pressure.

In neurohumoral Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) with LVOTO, short-acting beta-blockers such as esmolol are generally preferred. In the absence of a clinical trial specific for obstructed patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to be contraindicated.

For LVOTO present in both TTS and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), diuretics should be used sparingly to alleviate pulmonary edema only, as overdiuresis can increase intraventricular gradient by reducing preload. In both conditions, intravenous fluid administration increases preload and may aid in resolving intraventricular gradients.

In patients experiencing cardiogenic shock, positive inotrope drugs are usually central to management due to acute pump failure. However, these agents should be avoided in patients with left ventricular ballooning and LVOTO since they increase the pushing force on the mitral valve and worsen systolic anterior motion (SAM) and intraventricular gradients. Notably, the role of catecholamines in neurohumoral TTS complicated by cardiogenic shock remains controversial, even in patients without LVOTO. It has been reported that the application of exogenous catecholamines may exacerbate the acute phase.

### Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Takotsubo syndrome: How to deal with left ventricular ballooning [^115n5MR3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Correct diagnosis is fundamental to orient different treatment strategies. Diagnostic nodes and therapeutic strategies are particularly important in patients with apical ballooning and intraventricular obstruction. This condition involves several key elements: beta-blockers (bb), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), left ventricular (LV) aspects, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), and Takotsubo syndrome (TTS).

Diagnosis of LVOTO in patients with apical ballooning is typically achieved via Doppler echocardiography. In cases of persistent high-degree LVOTO — especially at presentation due to mitral–septal contact, afterload mismatch, and supply–demand ischemia — obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OHCM) should be considered. Conversely, if no LVOT gradient or only a mild LVOT gradient is observed, neurohumoral TTS might be the more likely diagnosis. Ballooning and low-level dynamic LVOTO can also occur in patients with neurohumoral TTS with basal reactive hyperkinesia, particularly when predisposing morphological features such as a small left ventricle are present.

As a practical point, patients with LV ballooning undergoing coronary angiography should have simultaneous pressure measurements taken between the LV body and the aorta or femoral artery, or alternatively, a slow pullback of the pigtail catheter. Too often, these patients only undergo coronary angiography without pressure measurements in the left ventricle, resulting in missed diagnostic opportunities.

### Long-term survival in patients with resting obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy comparison of conservative versus invasive treatment [^116fQS5g]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the survival of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction managed with an invasive versus a conservative strategy. In patients with resting obstructive HCM, clinical benefit can be achieved after invasive septal reduction therapy. However, it remains controversial whether invasive treatment improves long-term survival.

We studied a consecutive cohort of 649 patients with resting obstructive HCM. Total and HCM-related mortality were compared in 246 patients who were conservatively managed with 403 patients who were invasively managed by surgical myectomy, septal ethanol ablation, or dual-chamber pacing. Multivariable analyses (with invasive therapy treated as a time-dependent covariate) showed that an invasive intervention was a significant determinant of overall mortality (hazard ratio: 0.6, 95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 0.97, p = 0.04). Overall survival rates were greater in the invasive cohort (99.2% 1-year, 95.7% 5-year, and 87.8% 10-year survival) than in the conservative cohort (97.3% 1-year, 91.1% 5-year, and 75.8% 10-year survival, p = 0.008). However, invasive therapy was not found to be a significant independent predictor of HCM-related mortality (hazard ratio: 0.7, 95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 1.3, p = 0.3). The HCM-related survival was 99.5% (1 year), 96.3% (5 years), and 90.2% (10 years) in the invasive cohort, and 97.8% (1 year), 94.6% (5 years), and 86.9% (10 years) in the conservative cohort (p = 0.3).

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115zULoS]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

All of the authors took independent responsibility for performing a thorough literature review and selecting landmark clinical trials related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The authors cross-referenced their findings and created a comprehensive list of landmark clinical trials for further analysis as part of this systematic review. Clinical trials of therapies that failed to proceed to the next phase of the study were excluded from this comprehensive list. Thus, the studies referenced in this manuscript include the most up-to-date active clinical trials with the hopes of advancing the field of HCM.

### Indications for surgery in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115goV4e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In the stepped management of symptoms in obstructive HCM, if medical therapy consistently fails to relieve symptoms or is associated with frequent adverse outcomes, surgery is advisable earlier in the patient's treatment course. The combination of disopyramide with either a β-blocker or verapamil is considered by experienced physicians to be the most effective for symptom relief. This combination reduces resting gradients by more than 50% and improves limiting symptoms in 50% to 65% of patients long-term. It holds a class I recommendation by the most published HCM guidelines, namely the European Society in 2014 and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology in 2020.

In recent years, safety concerns about disopyramide have abated. Unlike typical type Ia sodium channel blockers, disopyramide in HCM cardiomyocytes is best characterized as a multichannel blocker. It also blocks the late sodium channel, the calcium channel, stabilizes the ryanodine receptor release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and markedly decreases cytosolic calcium. In vitro, it decreases early and late after depolarizations. Disopyramide, along with other agents like amiodarone and ranolazine that prolong the QT interval, rarely provokes torsade de pointes despite their electrocardiographic effects. Clinical studies from Toronto and New York have demonstrated its safety. Most recently, Adler et al. showed no risk for 168 patients started on disopyramide as outpatients.

### Outcome of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study [^115eks2h]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the prognosis of minimally symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Recent data have suggested that obstruction may be present in the majority of HCM patients, irrespective of cardiac symptoms. The prognosis of minimally symptomatic obstructive HCM remains poorly defined. We examined 544 consecutive adult patients (age 59 ± 16 years; 55% men) with obstructive HCM documented by Doppler echocardiography who were free of severe cardiac symptoms. We performed clinical follow-up with a median duration of 9.3 years.

There was only a slight excess mortality of the cohort in comparison to the expected survival of a similar U.S. general population (10-year observed vs. expected survival, 69.3% vs. 71.9%; p = 0.04), and 46% of the deaths were attributable to noncardiac causes. However, there was a clear relation between increasing severity of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient and outcome. For patients with high resting gradients (Doppler peak velocity > 4 m/s), survival was significantly impaired (53% at 10 years; p = 0.001 vs. expected), and death or severe symptoms occurred in 68% of these patients within 10 years after the initial evaluation. Conversely, there was no impairment of long-term survival for patients with less-severe resting obstruction. Independent predictors of mortality in the entire cohort were age, prior stroke, and LVOT gradient severity.

Patients with obstructive HCM and mild or no symptoms have only slight excess mortality.

### Circulating biomarkers in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113ty9kW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

We performed a comprehensive literature search using the MEDLINE database, Embase, and Google Scholar. The following search terms were used: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, asymmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, biomarker, biological marker, and biochemical marker. All papers were reviewed for content by E.L.M. and E.C.K. The literature search was limited to human studies, English language publications, measurement of circulating blood biomarkers, and works published since the last comprehensive review in 2009. There was no minimum study size for inclusion. Citations of all appropriate articles were screened to find additional relevant studies. For each category of biomarker, we reviewed its source, its correlation with HCM phenotypic features and functional characteristics, and its relationship to therapy and clinical outcomes, if available.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1112P4gW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The study focuses on the clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) over a ten-year follow-up period. Various factors influencing cardiovascular events in these patients were evaluated to understand better the determinants of outcomes associated with different HCM classifications.

- **Composite cardiovascular events**: These events were monitored during the decade-long follow-up, analyzing hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) corresponding to different HCM types.

- **Determinants of cardiovascular events**: A univariate Cox regression analysis identified factors contributing to cardiovascular events over the ten-year follow-up. This analysis aimed to reveal meaningful predictors and actionable factors in patient management.

This comprehensive examination sheds light on the varying risks and outcomes based on HCM classification and seeks to improve clinical strategies for patient care.

### Invasive therapies for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112d8eTE]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic condition with multiple different genetic and clinical phenotypes. As awareness for HCM increases, it is important to also be familiar with potential treatment options for the disease. Treatment of HCM can be divided into two different categories: medical and interventional.

Typically for obstructive forms of the disease, where increased septal hypertrophy, abnormally placed papillary muscles, and abnormalities in the mitral valve or subvalvular apparatus lead to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, treatment is targeted at decreasing obstructive gradients and therefore symptoms. Medications like beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide can often accomplish this. However, in patients with severe obstruction or symptoms refractory to medical therapy, either surgical correction of the LVOT obstruction or percutaneous intervention via alcohol septal ablation are treatment options.

In this review, we will focus on the invasive treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114sQb7B]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have also alleviated symptoms in a subset of patients. The 2020 AHA/ACC HCM guidelines recommend CCB and BB for first-line use in patients with obstructive and non-obstructive HCM. The beneficial effects of CCBs are likely mediated through their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, leading to prolonged LV filling time and improved flow towards the LV's subendocardial layers, resulting in reduced myocardial oxygen demand. Verapamil should be used cautiously in patients with severe obstruction, given vasodilatory properties that may contribute to the worsening of the intracavitary gradient. Diltiazem is less studied but has been shown to improve measures of diastolic performance and myocardial ischemia.

In patients unable to tolerate BB, CCB can be considered but should be used cautiously in those with severe LVOTO, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and low systemic blood pressure, as their hypotensive effects can trigger worsening obstruction and precipitate pulmonary edema.

### Efficacy of ranolazine in patients with symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The RESTYLE-HCM randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112JER6y]. Circulation. Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

The late sodium inhibitor ranolazine reverses the main electrophysiological and mechanical abnormalities of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cardiomyocytes in vitro, suggesting potential clinical benefit. We aimed to assess the effect of ranolazine on functional capacity, symptomatic status, diastolic function, and arrhythmias in HCM.

- **Methods and results**: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 study, 80 adult patients with nonobstructive HCM (age 53 ± 14 years, 34 women) were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 40) or ranolazine 1000 mg bid (n = 40) for 5 months. The primary endpoint was the change in peak VO₂ compared with baseline using cardiopulmonary exercise test. Echocardiographic lateral and septal E/E' ratio, prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, 24-hour Holter arrhythmic profile, and quality of life were assessed. Ranolazine was safe and well tolerated. Overall, there was no significant difference in VO₂ peak change at 5 months in the ranolazine versus placebo group (delta 0.15 ± 3.96 versus -0.02 ± 4.25 mL/kg per minute; P = 0.832). Ranolazine treatment was associated with a reduction in the 24-hour burden of premature ventricular complexes compared with placebo (> 50% reduction versus baseline in 61% versus 31%, respectively; P = 0.042). However, changes in prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels did not differ in the ranolazine compared with the placebo group (geometric mean median [interquartile range], -3 pg/mL [-107, 142 pg/mL] versus 78 pg/mL [-71, 242 pg/mL]; P = 0.251). Furthermore, E/E' ratio and quality of life scores showed no significant differences.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112ek1EZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiac disease characterized by varying degrees of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In a large cohort, we compare the outcomes among three different hemodynamic groups.

- **Methods and results**: We prospectively enrolled patients fulfilling standard diagnostic criteria for HCM from January 2005 to June 2015. Detailed phenotypic characterization, including peak left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradients at rest and after provocation, was measured by echocardiography. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular endpoint, which included new-onset atrial fibrillation, new sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, new or worsening heart failure, and death. The mean follow-up was 3.4 ± 2.8 years. Among the 705 patients with HCM (mean age, 52 ± 15 years; 62% men), 230 with obstructive HCM were older and had a higher body mass index and New York Heart Association class.

The 214 patients with nonobstructive HCM were more likely to have a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. During follow-up, 121 patients experienced a composite cardiovascular endpoint. Atrial fibrillation occurred most frequently in the obstructive group. Patients with nonobstructive HCM had more frequent sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation events. In multivariate analysis, obstructive (hazard ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.64–4.80) and nonobstructive (hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval…

### Mavacamten: A first-in-class myosin inhibitor for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112zz8Cv]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disorder caused by dysfunction of the cardiac sarcomere, resulting in excessive cardiac myosin-actin cross-bridging and increased sensitivity to calcium. Core pathophysiological features of HCM include left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), often involving the subaortic region of the interventricular septum, microvascular ischaemia, myocardial fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Sixty years ago, when the first detailed clinical reports of the disease were published, HCM was considered an uncommon condition with high mortality and limited treatment options. Today, it is estimated that 1 in 500 persons in the general population has an HCM phenotype.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is frequently inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Pathogenic variations most frequently occur in genes coding for the sarcomeric proteins beta-myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) and myosin-binding protein C3 (MYBPC3). These pathogenic variants of myosin encoding genes alter the relaxed state of sarcomeric proteins, causing increased cardiomyocyte contractility and energy requirements, and impair left ventricular (LV) relaxation and filling. About 60% of all HCM patients have negative tests for sarcomeric variants; some may present with a family history of the disease but may have a polygenic aetiology. Other patients are sporadic, without detectable genetic variants or a family history. The molecular basis for ventricular hypertrophy has not been established.

Approximately two-thirds of the patients with HCM have obstructive forms of the disease.

### Efficacy and safety of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the INHERIT randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111gzRS6]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

No medical treatment has been reliably shown to halt or reverse disease progression in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the results of several pilot studies have suggested beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, which are predictive of an adverse outcome. We aimed to assess the effect of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan on left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- **Methods**: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with obstructive or non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were randomly assigned via a computer-based system to losartan (100 mg per day) or placebo for 12 months. Patients and investigators were masked to the assigned treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in left ventricular mass as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or CT. Efficacy analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population (all patients with data available at the 12-month follow-up). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01447654.

- **Findings**: Between Dec 1, 2011, and May 1, 2013, 318 patients were screened. A total of 133 patients (mean age 52 years [SD 13], 35% women) consented and were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 69) or losartan (n = 64). Among them, 124 (93%) patients completed the study and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis for the primary endpoint. After 12 months, we noted no significant difference in the change in left ventricular mass.

### Disopyramide revisited for treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Efficacy and safety in patients treated for at least 5 years [^111LAeiL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The study evaluated 92 patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were treated with disopyramide for five or more years. At the start of treatment, patients were aged 62 ± 15 years, with 54% being women and 91% identifying as White. The average left ventricular (LV) wall thickness was 18 ± 4 mm, and LV outflow gradients of ≥ 30 mm Hg were present at rest in 62% of patients and during exercise or Valsalva provocation in 38%. Initially, 43 (47%) of the patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II symptoms, while 49 (53%) were severely symptomatic in class III. Common symptoms included exertional dyspnea in 84 (91% of patients), chest pain in 31 (34%), and recent syncope in 12 (13%). A total of 44 (48%) patients met the criteria for septal reduction therapy, indicated by a peak gradient > 50 mm Hg and a baseline NYHA class of ≥ III.

- **Follow-up on disopyramide**: Patients were monitored from the initiation of disopyramide therapy for a median of 7.2 years (interquartile range, 5.5–9.0), including 49 patients for seven or more years, 17 for ten or more years, and up to 17 years. At the most recent follow-up, the mean disopyramide dose was 439 ± 126 mg, with 42 (46%) patients taking short-acting and 50 (54%) on long-acting formulations. Notably, 62 (67%) patients reported significant symptom relief, evidenced by an improvement in NYHA class by one or more stages in 57 (62%), without requiring alternative treatments, such as septal reduction interventions or myosin inhibitors. Of these 62 patients, 19 (30%) were in NYHA class I, 37 (60%) in class II, and 6 (10%) remained in class III at the last follow-up. Before the treatment started, 29 (47%) of the 62 patients were eligible for septal reduction therapy.

### 2020 AHA/ACC guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Executive summary: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^1121vsyK]. Circulation (2020). High credibility.

This executive summary of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy clinical practice guideline provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to diagnose and manage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adult and pediatric patients, along with supporting documentation to encourage their use.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2020. This search encompassed studies, reviews, and other evidence involving human subjects, published in English, and sourced from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases.

- **Structure**: Many recommendations from earlier hypertrophic cardiomyopathy guidelines have been updated with new evidence or a better understanding of earlier evidence. This summary operationalizes the recommendations from the full guideline, presenting a combination of diagnostic work-up, genetic and family screening, risk stratification approaches, lifestyle modifications, surgical and catheter interventions, and medications that form components of guideline-directed medical therapy. For both guideline-directed medical therapy and other recommended drug treatments, readers are advised to follow dosing, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions as per product insert materials.

### Future role of new negative inotropic agents in the era of established surgical myectomy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115tqrjX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment of heart failure involves various strategies, including established invasive procedures.

- **Established invasive strategies**: Surgical septal myectomy, and its percutaneous alternative, alcohol septal ablation, have proven to be the most effective and definitive strategies for reversing progressive symptoms of exertional dyspnea due to LV outflow tract obstruction in disabled drug‐refractory patients, usually categorized as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV.

Earlier myectomy is now considered at experienced HCM centers for patients with more mild heart failure symptoms, consistent with NYHA class II, to avoid prolonged LV overload and wall stress. Myectomy has stood the test of time, based on data assembled over more than 50 years from highly experienced centers worldwide. This data demonstrates the capability of permanently abolishing outflow gradients at rest or with provocation, as well as mitral regurgitation, resulting in normalization of LV pressures, and usually with preservation of systolic function.

Surgical myectomy has become a low-risk, high-benefit option, with postoperative (30 day) in-hospital mortality of about 0.5% when performed in high-volume, multidisciplinary, and dedicated HCM centers of excellence. Long-term amelioration of functional symptoms by one or more NYHA classes is consistently reported in over 90% of patients, including a substantial number improved from advanced limitation in class III to class I, restored to full lifestyle activity.

Additionally, myectomy is associated with a long-term survival benefit, although this is based on non-randomized data. At 1, 5, and 10 years after surgery, there is 98%, 96%, and 83% freedom from all-cause mortality, respectively.

### Can pharmacologic gradient reduction decrease mortality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113G3aAc]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy is the first-line approach to relieve symptoms in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There are no randomized trials to evaluate their effect on prognosis. Gradient reduction by surgical septal myectomy is associated with an excellent prognosis, but not all patients have symptoms severe enough to require surgery; guidelines recommend operation only for patients with high gradients and symptoms unresponsive to pharmacologic therapy. The combination of disopyramide and beta-blockade is effective in reducing resting gradients, though not to the extent of surgery. This review examines the question of whether pharmacologic reduction of gradient in asymptomatic patients or those with milder symptoms might decrease HCM-related mortality.

### Controversies in cardiovascular medicine. Benefits of surgery in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Bring septal myectomy back for European patients [^114dxgro]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a heterogeneous genetic heart disease with global distribution, is an important cause of heart failure disability at any age. For 50 years, surgical septal myectomy has been the preferred and primary treatment strategy for most HCM patients with progressive, drug-refractory functional limitation due to left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction. With very low surgical mortality at experienced centers, septal myectomy reliably abolishes impedance to LV outflow and heart failure-related symptoms, restores quality of life, and importantly is associated with long-term survival similar to that in the general population.

Nevertheless, alternatives to surgical management are necessary for selected HCM patients. For example, following a brief flirtation with dual-chamber pacing 20 years ago, percutaneous alcohol septal ablation has garnered a large measure of enthusiasm and a dedicated following in the interventional cardiology community, achieving benefits for patients by virtue of producing a transmural myocardial infarct. However, an unintended consequence has been the virtual obliteration of the surgical option for HCM patients in Europe, where several robust myectomy programs once existed.

Clear differences are now evident internationally regarding management strategies for symptomatic obstructive HCM. The surgical option is now unavailable to many patients based solely on geography, including some who would likely benefit more substantially from surgical myectomy than from catheter-based alcohol ablation.

### Outcomes in guideline-based class I indication versus earlier referral for surgical myectomy in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^114PdAsf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a commonly inherited cardiomyopathy with varied phenotypic expressions, ranging from asymptomatic to congestive heart failure or sudden death, which occurs in less than 1% per year. A characteristic finding in HCM is dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, which often results in symptomatic congestive heart failure, reduced exercise capacity, and exertional syncope. LVOT obstruction, which is independently associated with adverse HCM-related outcomes such as congestive heart failure and death, is observed in approximately 70% of patients with HCM when observed carefully.

Surgical myectomy provides excellent long-term survival and freedom from re-symptoms in patients with obstructive HCM, based on prior nonrandomized observational studies. On the other hand, there are no large-scale studies demonstrating a clear survival benefit using medical therapy to relieve LVOT obstruction. As a result, it is currently a class I indication (level of evidence C) to offer invasive therapies (surgical myectomy plus/minus mitral valve surgery or alcohol septal ablation) to patients who have severe LVOT obstruction and are intractably symptomatic (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III–IV) despite maximally tolerated medical therapy. However, the perception of patients about their symptoms is often misleading and, in many instances, symptoms are equivocal. In such scenarios, exercise stress testing can unmask latent symptoms.

### Aficamten for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113Z3Vwv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

One of the major determinants of exercise intolerance and limiting symptoms among patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an elevated intracardiac pressure resulting from left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Aficamten is an oral selective cardiac myosin inhibitor that reduces left ventricular outflow tract gradients by mitigating cardiac hypercontractility.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with symptomatic obstructive HCM to receive aficamten (starting dose, 5 mg; maximum dose, 20 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks, with dose adjustment based on echocardiography results. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the peak oxygen uptake as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The 10 prespecified secondary endpoints (tested hierarchically) were: change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS), improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, change in the pressure gradient after the Valsalva maneuver, occurrence of a gradient of less than 30 mm Hg after the Valsalva maneuver, and duration of eligibility for septal reduction therapy (all assessed at week 24); change in the KCCQ-CSS, improvement in the NYHA functional class, change in the pressure gradient after the Valsalva maneuver, and occurrence of a gradient of less than 30 mm Hg after the Valsalva maneuver (all assessed at week 12); and change in the total workload as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing at week 24.

- **Results**: A total of 282 patients were involved in the study.

### Mavacamten for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Rationale for clinically guided dose titration to optimize individual response [^1148tuY2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

In the pivotal phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXPLORER-HCM trial (Clinical Study to Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; NCT03470545), mavacamten dose was titrated to 1 of 4 strengths (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg) based on each patient's clinical status over 30 weeks of treatment, with administration of a 5 mg oral capsule once daily (QD) as the uniform starting dosage. Mavacamten plasma concentration was maintained at ≥ 1000 ng/mL or LVEF 50% while adjusting the mavacamten dose when the drug exposure was outside the range of 350 to 700 ng/mL (with the expectation that the regimen would maintain exposures between 350 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL). Mavacamten was shown to be superior to placebo in achieving the composite functional primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, including changes from baseline in peak oxygen consumption, New York Heart Association class, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score after 30 weeks of treatment. These changes were concomitant with a sustained improvement in resting, Valsalva, and postexercise LVOT gradient. Consistent with its mechanism of action, mavacamten treatment resulted in a mean LVEF decrease of 3.9% compared with 0.01% with placebo.

### Cardiac myosin inhibitors as a novel treatment option for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Addressing the core of the matter [^114RSRez]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HCM guidelines have placed significant emphasis on shared decision-making in HCM across multiple domains, including treatment approaches. Diversifying treatment strategies is the best way of empowering patients and promoting personalized care.

In the standard-of-care approach, it is assumed that all oHCM patients are willing to undergo SRT, have insurance plans that cover them in seeking care at an experienced center, and are able to afford the cost of travel for themselves and their family members, as well as the time off required for recovery from SRT. Such prerequisites to getting excellent care at the few expert centers promote healthcare inequality by inadvertently excluding patients with lower socioeconomic status and lower education levels, those who cannot advocate for themselves, and patients living with disabilities.

Over the past two decades, the need for more effective and less invasive therapies combined with advances in our understanding of HCM pathophysiology have set the stage for developing new agents targeting the molecular basis of the disease. HCM-associated mutations affecting sarcomere protein genes have been shown to cause myocardial hyper-contractility due to excessive availability of myosin heads ready to form cross-bridges with actin, with a reduced proportion remaining in the energy-sparing super-relaxed state not available for engagement. This is thought to represent the core pathophysiological abnormality ultimately generating the HCM phenotypes.

### Future role of new negative inotropic agents in the era of established surgical myectomy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1122BjQy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

This commentary reviews management strategies for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and heart failure that have been effective over the last two decades in reducing HCM morbidity and mortality, including septal reduction with surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation (Figure – Panel C). In addition, we are approaching an era for reinvigorated pharmacotherapy in HCM with novel myosin‐inhibitors/negative inotrope drugs. A measured perspective is justified until more extensive data and experience can be scrutinized over longer periods to avoid unrealistic expectations and resolve remaining fundamental questions about the role, efficacy, and safety of these new drugs for obstructive HCM.

While additions to the HCM treatment armamentarium are enthusiastically welcomed (if affordable), there is concern that initial over‐exuberance for myosin‐inhibitors could potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as the under‐utilization of septal reduction therapies for symptomatic outflow obstruction.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111FJPLj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite low annual mortality rates, patients with nonobstructive HCM have high rates of adverse clinical events, which are almost equivalent to those with obstructive HCM. Patients with nonobstructive HCM warrant thorough vetting, with a focus on the need for defibrillator therapy. Patients with obstructive HCM have the worst symptoms and high rates of adverse events, necessitating aggressive treatment. In contrast, patients with labile HCM have the best prognosis and may require less aggressive management, although it is essential to recognize that all patients with HCM should be objectively risk stratified. Further large‐scale studies with longer follow‐up are needed to support our results.

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115U3YZM]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Anatomic phenotypes and clinical presentation**: Obstruction predicts worse symptoms, adverse outcomes, and becomes a therapeutic target. HCM can be defined as LV hypertrophy (LVH) at any site with maximum LV thickness ≥ 15 mm in the absence of abnormal loading conditions. Milder hypertrophy may be diagnostic if associated with a family history of HCM, typical outflow obstruction, or abnormal ECG patterns. Various patterns of LVH have been described, such as diffuse hypertrophy and asymmetric involvement of the ventricular septum, anterior wall, or apical chamber.

Two-thirds of patients diagnosed with HCM have LVOTO at rest or with provocation. LVOTO is defined as dynamic LV outflow pressure ≥ 30 mmHg, while pressures ≥ 50 mmHg are considered hemodynamically significant. LVOTO strongly predicts future HF progression. In patients with a hemodynamically significant obstruction (i.e. left ventricular outflow tract gradient [LVOTG] ≥ 50 mmHg) and pharmacologic refractory HF-related symptoms, subsequent therapeutic options are septal reduction therapies (SRTs), such as surgical myectomy (SM) and alcohol septal ablation (ASA). However, cardiac transplant may be the only option for HCM patients without LVOTO (non-obstructive HCM [nHCM]) and those with end-stage disease, characterized by advanced HF and restrictive ventricular filling. Hence, delineating ventricular anatomy and hemodynamics is essential to guide management.

### Treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy symptoms and gradient resistant to first-line therapy with β-blockade or verapamil [^116LCA7B]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

There is controversy about preferred methods to relieve obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients who are still symptomatic after β-blockade or verapamil.

- **Methods and results**: Of 737 patients prospectively registered at our institution, 299 (41%) required further therapy for obstruction due to limiting symptoms, with a rest gradient of 61 ± 45 mmHg and a provoked gradient of 115 ± 49 mmHg, followed up for 4.8 years. Disopyramide was added in 221 (74%) patients, achieving pharmacological control of symptoms in 141 (64%) individuals. Overall, 138 (46%) patients underwent surgical relief of obstruction (91% myectomy), while 6 (2%) received alcohol septal ablation. At follow-up, resting gradients in the 299 patients decreased from 61 ± 44 to 10 ± 25 mmHg (P < 0.0001); New York Heart Association class decreased from 2.7 ± 0.7 to 1.8 ± 0.5 (P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival at 10 years in the 299 advanced-care patients was 88% and did not differ from nonobstructed patients (P = 0.28). Only 1 patient experienced sudden death, indicating a low annual rate of 0.06%/year. Kaplan-Meier survival at 10 years in the advanced-care patients did not differ from that expected in a matched cohort of the US population (P = 0.90).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with obstruction and symptoms resistant to initial pharmacological therapy with β-blockade or verapamil may realize meaningful symptom relief and low mortality through stepped management, adding disopyramide in appropriately selected patients, and when needed, by surgical myectomy.

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^117DuRyw]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Conventional pharmacological therapies for symptomatic HCM can help improve symptoms, but are often inadequate, poorly tolerated, and do not alter the natural disease course. Beta-blockers have been a cornerstone of HCM therapy since their introduction for this purpose in 1964. They are currently recommended as first-line agents in symptomatic patients both with and without resting obstruction. The beneficial effects of beta-blockers (BB) in HCM are thought to be mediated by several different mechanisms, including sympathetic modulation of heart rate, improved ventricular relaxation with increased time for diastolic filling, and reduced electrical excitability.

Once it was recognized that the severity of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) may be influenced by the degree of myocardial contractility, Harrison et al. were the first to study beta-blockers in 10 patients with HCM in 1964. They found that nethalide (an adrenergic beta-blocker) had little effect on the degree of obstruction at rest but prevented the increase in LVOTO observed during exercise. Subsequently, Cohen and Braunwald discovered that propranolol decreased myocardial oxygen requirements and improved anginal symptoms. The only prospective randomized, placebo-controlled beta-blocker trial was conducted by Dybro et al. In 29 patients with obstructive HCM (oHCM), metoprolol reduced the left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOTG) at rest by 33 ± 25 mmHg. Similarly, metoprolol reduced the LVOTG with Valsalva provocation by 66 ± 48 mmHg and reduced the LVOTG with exercise by 47 ± 36 mmHg. This occurred in addition to concomitant symptom relief and improvements in quality of life scores. It is currently unknown if any specific beta-blocker is superior.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114Y79du]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In this large single-center HCM cohort, we present several novel and clinically important insights into the most common inherited cardiac disease. To our knowledge, there are no clinical outcome data using the modern hemodynamic classification of HCM into nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive HCM.

A recent study in 2016 described HCM-related mortality among patients with nonobstructive HCM as low (0.5% per year), with a 10-year survival rate of 97%, which was similar to expected all-cause mortality in an age- and sex-matched US population. However, focusing on mortality rate alone may underestimate the substantial morbidity burden in a subset of patients with nonobstructive HCM. In contrast with most literature at the time of writing, we find that patients with nonobstructive HCM are at significantly higher risk than previously suspected. Conversely, despite the obstructive hemodynamics, patients with labile-obstructive HCM experience a generally benign clinical course.

Concordant with previous studies, resting LVOT obstruction (LVOTO) is associated with the highest risk of developing our composite endpoint. Specifically, we found an increased risk of arrhythmia, HF, and death. Our findings may stimulate a critical rethinking of how best to manage nonobstructive and labile-obstructive HCM. In addition, our study provides some granularity on the nature of specific clinical outcomes across the three HCM groups. Patients with obstructive HCM with significant LVOT pressure gradients predominantly experienced AF, HF, and death. Patients with nonobstructive HCM had more ventricul…

### Phase 2 study of aficamten in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113baoh6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a major determinant of heart failure symptoms in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, may lower gradients and improve symptoms in these patients.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aficamten in patients with oHCM.

- **Methods**: Patients with oHCM and LVOT gradients ≥ 30 mm Hg at rest or ≥ 50 mm Hg with Valsalva were randomized 2:1 to receive aficamten (n = 28) or placebo (n = 13) in two dose-finding cohorts. Doses were titrated based on gradients and ejection fraction (EF). Safety and changes in gradient, EF, New York Heart Association functional class, and cardiac biomarkers were assessed over a 10-week treatment period and following a 2-week washout.

- **Results**: From baseline to 10 weeks, aficamten reduced gradients at rest (mean difference: -40 ± 27 mm Hg, and -43 ± 37 mm Hg in Cohorts 1 and 2, P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0004 vs. placebo, respectively) and with Valsalva (-36 ± 27 mm Hg and -53 ± 44 mm Hg, P = 0.001 and < 0.0001 vs. placebo, respectively). There were modest reductions in EF (-6% ± 7.5% and -12% ± 5.9%, P = 0.007 and P < 0.0001 vs. placebo, respectively). Symptomatic improvement in ≥ 1 New York Heart Association functional class was observed in 31% on placebo and 43% and 64% on aficamten in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively (nonsignificant). With aficamten, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was reduced (62% relative to placebo, P = 0.0002). There were no treatment interruptions and adverse events were similar between groups.

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113RvGxq]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

While medical therapies are ubiquitous, they are limited by a lack of solid evidence, are often inadequate, poorly tolerated, and do not alter the natural disease course. As such, there has long been a need for effective, evidence-based, and targeted disease-modifying therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this review, we redefine HCM as a treatable condition, evaluate strategies for therapeutic intervention, and discuss novel myosin inhibitors.
