## Question

Positive HPV on pap

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a positive HPV test on Pap, including risk stratification, triage, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact result details. Then, I should verify the risk-based management framework and the key thresholds. Next, I will consider HPV genotyping and reflex cytology to triage. After that, I will map management pathways by risk tier, including when to defer colposcopy, when to refer to colposcopy, and when to consider expedited treatment. Finally, I should confirm special populations, post-treatment surveillance, and documentation needs, and close with a concise decision algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and result details, because management hinges on them. I need to check whether this is primary HPV screening or cotesting, the exact cytology result, whether HPV 16/18 are identified, and any documented prior HPV-based screening history within the past 5 years, as these factors materially change risk and recommendations [^163fe2c9] [^b3fc1f43].

> Next, I should review the risk-based management framework. The 2019 ASCCP guidelines moved from result-based to risk-based care using immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risks to assign one of six actions: treatment, optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy, colposcopy/biopsy, 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, or 5-year routine screening, with the colposcopy threshold at an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 4.0% or greater [^163fe2c9] [^2477c19b] [^085e226c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the triage steps after a positive HPV screen. For any positive HPV result, reflex cytology should be performed on the same specimen when feasible, and if genotyping is available, HPV 16/18 results should be acted upon even if cytology is NILM because of their higher CIN 3+ risk and association with adenocarcinoma, particularly HPV 18 [^c606251f] [^29431eb1] [^bad5db9f].

> I will now examine low-risk scenarios where colposcopy can be deferred. If cytology is NILM and HPV is not 16/18, and especially if there was a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, repeating HPV-based testing in 1 year is appropriate because the immediate CIN 3+ risk is below 4% and the 5-year risk is modest, though I should confirm that this applies to patients 25 years and older and not to those with high-grade cytology or special populations [^d34eca65] [^b3fc1f43] [^1503ac56].

> Wait, let me verify the intermediate-risk pathway. If cytology is ASC-US or LSIL with HPV positive, or if HPV 16/18 are detected with any cytology, the immediate CIN 3+ risk meets or exceeds 4% and colposcopy is recommended, with endocervical sampling considered particularly when HPV 18 is present due to adenocarcinoma risk, even if the colposcopy is otherwise satisfactory [^085e226c] [^bad5db9f] [^1503ac56].

> I need to ensure I identify high-risk scenarios where expedited treatment is preferred. For nonpregnant patients aged 25 years or older, if the immediate CIN 3+ risk is 60% or higher, excisional treatment without prior biopsy is preferred. This most commonly occurs with HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology or in never/rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL, where shared decision-making about fertility and pregnancy implications is essential [^9def7cf4] [^17f34928] [^1503ac56].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions. For patients younger than 25 years, management is more conservative with observation rather than immediate colposcopy for low-grade abnormalities, and for patients older than 65, surveillance should continue if indicated by prior abnormalities or treatment, often extending beyond age 65 when life expectancy and feasibility allow, with attention to sampling adequacy [^028ee28a] [^aa12225d]. For immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, thresholds for colposcopy and treatment are generally lower and aligned with infectious disease guidance, so I should confirm that context before deferring care [^59efc688] [^dcd31a70].

> Next, I should review post-colposcopy and post-treatment pathways. If colposcopy and biopsy show less than CIN 2, 1-year HPV-based surveillance is appropriate because risk remains elevated but below the colposcopy threshold, and if three consecutive negative HPV tests or cotests are achieved after treatment for CIN 2/3, patients can return to 3-year intervals, though surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after treatment for CIN 2+ [^526ee550] [^8233f1e8] [^1503ac56].

> I should double-check documentation and communication needs. I need to record the exact HPV result, cytology, genotyping if available, prior screening history, and the rationale for deferring colposcopy or proceeding to treatment, and I should counsel that most HPV infections clear, explain the meaning of persistence, and discuss fertility considerations if treatment is contemplated, using shared decision-making for high-risk scenarios [^d55aed96] [^1503ac56].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway without oversimplifying. If HPV is positive, I first confirm reflex cytology and whether HPV 16/18 are present. If cytology is HSIL, ASC-H, or AGC, I refer to colposcopy and consider expedited treatment if risk is 60% or higher. If cytology is ASC-US or LSIL, I refer to colposcopy. If cytology is NILM and HPV is not 16/18, I defer colposcopy and repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year, especially if there was a recent negative HPV screen, whereas if HPV 16/18 are present, I refer to colposcopy despite NILM cytology. If cytology is unsatisfactory, I repeat cytology within 4 months and add HPV testing if not already done, escalating based on results [^085e226c] [^d34eca65] [^f92071b4].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has other complicating factors? I should confirm that expedited treatment is avoided in pregnancy and that management is individualized for those with limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities, aligning with guideline exceptions and patient preferences [^1503ac56] [^aa12225d].

> In summary, I need to ensure my plan matches risk: use HPV genotyping and reflex cytology to triage, apply the 4% immediate CIN 3+ risk threshold to decide on colposcopy, consider expedited treatment when risk is 60% or higher, incorporate prior HPV screening history to safely defer colposcopy in low-risk combinations, and maintain vigilance for special populations and long-term surveillance needs after treatment [^163fe2c9] [^085e226c] [^b3fc1f43] [^1503ac56].

A positive HPV Pap means **high-risk HPV is detected** on cervical screening, which increases the risk of cervical precancer and cancer [^b7f0b8e5]. Most HPV infections clear spontaneously, but persistent high-risk HPV — especially types 16 or 18 — warrants closer follow-up [^7415dbf1]. Management is **risk-based**: if cytology is normal or ASC-US, repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is typical; if HPV 16/18 is present or cytology is LSIL or higher, colposcopy is recommended [^17462b9e] [^1503ac56]. Persistent HPV positivity or high-grade cytology may lead to biopsy and treatment of precancerous lesions to prevent cancer [^b7f0b8e5]. Patients should be reassured that HPV is common and that structured follow-up is effective for risk reduction [^d55aed96].

---

## Clinical significance of a positive HPV Pap

- **HPV detection**: Indicates active infection with high-risk HPV types linked to cervical dysplasia and cancer [^b7f0b8e5].
- **Risk stratification**: Risk varies by HPV type (16/18 highest), cytology, and persistence [^7415dbf1] [^b7f0b8e5].
- **Persistence**: Persistent high-risk HPV is the key risk factor for progression to CIN2+ and cancer [^notfound].

---

## Recommended management based on cytology results

| **Cytology result** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Normal (NILM) | Repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year; if HPV 16/18 is present, proceed to colposcopy [^17462b9e] [^1503ac56] |
| ASC-US | Repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year; if HPV 16/18 is present or HPV persists, colposcopy is recommended [^17462b9e] [^1503ac56] |
| LSIL | Colposcopy is recommended, especially if HPV 16/18 is present [^17462b9e] [^1503ac56] |
| HSIL, ASC-H, AGC | Immediate colposcopy; consider expedited treatment if risk is high (e.g. HPV 16-positive HSIL) [^17462b9e] [^9def7cf4] |

---

## Follow-up protocols and surveillance

- **Initial follow-up**: HPV-positive NILM or ASC-US typically warrants repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year [^d34eca65].
- **Persistent HPV**: If HPV remains positive at 1 year, colposcopy is recommended [^17462b9e].
- **Post-colposcopy**: If < CIN2 is found, continue HPV-based surveillance at 1–3 year intervals based on risk [^526ee550].
- **Post-treatment**: After CIN2+ treatment, continue HPV-based surveillance for at least 25 years [^1503ac56].

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Progression**: Persistent high-risk HPV can progress to CIN2+ and cervical cancer if untreated [^b7f0b8e5].
- **Anxiety**: Positive results can cause stress; counseling is important [^d55aed96].
- **Overtreatment**: Some low-grade lesions may be overtreated; risk-based management aims to minimize this [^e6373783].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Counseling should emphasize that **HPV is common and usually clears** [^d55aed96], and that persistent infection is the concern, not a single positive result [^b7f0b8e5]. Patients should also be advised to attend scheduled follow-up, as structured surveillance reduces cancer risk [^b7f0b8e5]. Lifestyle measures such as smoking cessation, safe sex, and HPV vaccination can reduce risk and support clearance [^notfound].

---

## Impact of HPV vaccination

Vaccination **reduces incidence** of HPV 16/18 infections and related cervical abnormalities [^notfound]. It also modifies screening by lowering positivity rates and may allow longer intervals in vaccinated populations, though guidelines still apply [^937bb2dc].

---

A positive HPV Pap reflects high-risk HPV infection and signals a need for **risk-based follow-up** [^b7f0b8e5]. Most infections resolve, but persistent high-risk HPV — especially 16/18 — requires colposcopy and possible treatment to prevent progression [^17462b9e]. Clear counseling and adherence to guidelines ensure safe, effective care [^d55aed96].

### Cytology versus high-risk HPV testing for follow-up of HPV-positive women without CIN [^b8ba0f43]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Screening for cervical cancer is often considered the success story for cancer screening in the United States. However, much room for improvement still exists. For example, experts have yet to establish the best follow-up strategy for women with an abnormal Papanicolaou test and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) followed by a normal colposcopy or biopsy that is negative for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The incorporation of HPV testing has allowed the development of a more sensitive and cost-efficient strategy. This article presents a brief overview of related guidelines and current modalities, and reviews selected studies. Finally, future directions and a possible schema for clinical management of these patients are included.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^b39476cb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of “How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?”

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of “Equal Management of Equal Risk,” the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—colposcopy referral threshold and equal-risk principle specify that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy when this risk follows HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16-positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or other equally high-risk results. If a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral, the management of a positive result would be upgraded to referral to colposcopy, with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high, consistent with the guiding principle of “Equal Management of Equal Risk.”

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^34d51296]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2 
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

Clinical Question 5

What is the recommended surveillance after treatment of AIS?

Recommendation 5.1

For patients who undergo definitive management with hysterectomy, surveillance per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus guidelines is recommended for at least 25 years after diagnosis, even if that extends the testing period beyond the age of 65 years (CIII).

Recommendation 5.2

i) For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with Pap plus HPV co-testing and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for the first 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years or until hysterectomy is performed (BII).
ii) For patients who have consistently negative co-testing results in the first 5 years of surveillance, extending surveillance to every 3 years indefinitely is acceptable (CIII).

Literature Review

Owing to an increased risk of developing vaginal dysplasia after a history of cervical dysplasia, it is recommended that definitive surgical management should be followed by at least 25 years of surveillance per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines, with vaginal colposcopy performed to evaluate high-grade cytology results, persistent low-grade cytology results, or persistent positive HPV test results (two or more); although the HPV test is not currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved for vaginal screening or surveillance, the high negative predictive value of the test can identify those individuals who are at low risk for developing vaginal cancer.Management of abnormal vaginal cytology and positive HPV test results in this setting is beyond the scope of these management guidelines and is well-defined in the review article by Khan et al.

### Updated guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities [^deaaf2d6]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Box 1—essential changes from prior management guidelines emphasize that recommendations are based on risk, not results, with recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance based on a patient’s risk of CIN 3+ determined by current results and past history; colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients, with repeat human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (eg, HPV-positive, low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest); and guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (ie, treatment without colposcopic biopsy), noting expedited treatment was an option for patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology in the 2012 guidelines and that this guidance is now better defined. Additionally, the new consensus guidelines follow a risk-based approach and recommend consideration of a patient’s screening history along with current test results to guide decision making.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^9def7cf4]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—expedited treatment criteria: For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%; it is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 and for never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL cytology regardless of HPV genotype, and shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment.

### Clinical and economic implications of adding HPV tests to the routine cytology follow-up and management of patients with histologically defined cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [^79d6c334]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic implications of adding human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to the follow-up and management protocol of women with a histological diagnosis of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1).

Methods

The study cohort consisted of 314 women with histological diagnosis of CIN1 and who met the inclusion criteria. They were followed-up by pap smears and samples for HPV tests that were obtained and analyzed on the first visit after referral. HPV assessment was carried out later. Colposcopy and biopsies were performed when there were two consecutive abnormal pap results or positive HPV tests. Women with any degree of CIN underwent cone biopsies.

Results

The positive predictive value (PPV) of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous epithelial lesion to identify high-grade lesions (CIN2-3) were 48.9 and 95%, respectively. The PPV of low-risk HPV type for CIN1 and that of high-risk HPV type for CIN2-3 were both 97%. Of the 314 study participants, 68 (21.6%) patients were positive for HPV analysis, and 67 of these (98.5%) had either CIN1 or CIN2-3 on the cone biopsy, with an overall PPV of 95%. The cost effectiveness ratio was $1457 per additional case detected by the "HPV approach."

Conclusions

Testing for the presence of high-risk HPV types is both clinically and economically more beneficial than cytology in the follow-up and management of patients with a diagnosis of CIN 1 because of its better sensitivity, specificity, and PPV reports.

### Summary of current guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management of abnormal test results: 2016-2020 [^e35c68ac]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer can be prevented through routine screening and follow-up of abnormal results. Several guidelines have been published in the last 4 years from various medical societies and organizations. These guidelines aim to personalize screening and management, reducing unnecessary testing in low-risk patients and managing high-risk patients with more intensive follow-up. However, the resulting complexity can lead to confusion among providers. The CDC, NCI, and obstetrician-gynecologists involved in guideline development summarized current screening and management guidelines. For screening, guidelines for average-risk and high-risk populations are summarized and presented. For management, differences between the 2012 and 2019 consensus guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors are summarized. Current screening guidelines for average-risk individuals have minor differences, but are evolving toward an HPV-based strategy. For management, HPV testing is preferred to cytology because it is a more sensitive test for cancer precursor detection and also allows for precise risk stratification. Current risk-based screening and management strategies can improve care by reducing unnecessary tests and procedures in low-risk patients and focusing resources on high-risk patients. Knowledge of screening and management guidelines is important to improve adherence and avoid both over- and under-use of screening and colposcopy.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^9bcef28a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^28b17a11]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). High credibility.

HPV-positive ASC-US management after colposcopy with less than CIN 2—The corrected Figure 2 legend states that a patient with this minimally abnormal screening result “would be managed based on risk estimates.” “The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.5%).” If colposcopy shows “less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return),” and at the 1-year return a second HPV-positive ASC-US “has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return).” For the second postcolposcopy surveillance test, “if the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended.” If results are “either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended,” and “Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results.” Similar management “would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H).”

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1503ac56]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

§ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.

¶ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥25 years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:

Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk. º If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e. negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk). º Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients. º If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e. HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e. rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management. º Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. º HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. º HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy. º If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result. º Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years. º Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. º After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone. º Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^e97d050a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Validation of Risk-Based Guidelines

A previous validation effort in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry found risks there to be largely similar to that of KPNC.However, we further validated risk-based management for the initial screen using 3 cohorts: (1) the CDC NBCCEDP, (2) the Onclarity Human Papillomavirus Trial, and (3) the ATHENA study.

The CDC's NBCCEDP was established to provide low-income patients (defined as family income at or less than 250% of the federal poverty level) access to screening and diagnostic examinations for breast and cervical cancer.The NBCCEDP analysis cohort consisted of 363,544 patients 30 years and older with nonmissing HPV and cytology test results and no history of CIN 2+ histology. This population includes both patients undergoing screening with cotesting and patients undergoing primary cytology screening who had an HPV test to triage an ASC-US result. Patients also reported whether they had previously been screened. Using estimated risks from the CDC NBCCEDP,we conducted separate validation studies for patients who reported having a prior cytology test in the past 5 years (well-screened) versus those who reported that their prior cytology test occurred more than 5 years ago, that they were never screened, or that they did not know when they were last screened (screened rarely/never/unknown). Because most patients in the cohort had only a single screen, only the immediate risk of positive test results (i.e. HPV positive/NILM, HPV positive/ASC-US, or LSIL+) was available.

### Benchmarking CIN 3 + risk as the basis for incorporating HPV and pap cotesting into cervical screening and management guidelines [^7b6cb3c6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and a consensus of 25 organizations endorsed concurrent cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing ("cotesting") for cervical cancer screening. Past screening and management guidelines were implicitly based on risks defined by Pap-alone, without consideration of HPV test results. To promote management that is consistent with accepted practice, new guidelines incorporating cotesting should aim to achieve equal management of women at equal risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cancer (CIN 3+).

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for 965,360 women aged 30 to 64 years undergoing cotesting at Kaiser Permanente Northern California over 2003 to 2010. We calculated the implicit risk thresholds for Pap-alone and applied them for new management guidance on HPV and Pap cotesting, citing 2 examples: HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and HPV-negative/Pap-negative. We call this guidance process "benchmarking."

Results

A low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion result, for which immediate colposcopy is prescribed, carries a 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 5.2%, suggesting that test results with similar risks should be managed with colposcopy. Similarly, ASC-US (2.6% risk) is managed with a 6- to 12-month follow-up visit and Pap-negative (0.26% risk) is managed with a 3-year follow-up visit. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-positive/ASC-US was 6.8% (95% confidence interval = 6.2%-7.6%). This is greater than the 5.2% risk implicitly leading to referral to colposcopy, consistent with current management recommendations that HPV-positive/ASC-US should be referred for immediate colposcopy. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-negative/Pap-negative was 0.08% (95% confidence interval = 0.07%-0.09%), far below the 0.26% implicitly required for a 3-year return and justifying a longer (e.g., 5-year) return.

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks," benchmarking to implicit risk thresholds based on Pap-alone can be used to achieve safe and consistent incorporation of cotesting.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^31cf0ea8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Presentation: Current Results and History

Two central questions underlie risk estimations: (a) What are the current results? (b) What past results affect the risk estimate for the current results? The “current results” are those for which the clinician is seeking guidance, either an HPV test or cotest result (see Tables 1A – 2C 4A – 5B) or a colposcopy/biopsy result (see Table 3). The past results that impact risk estimates are noted under “history.” Table 1A refers to patients without a recent documented HPV test or cotest result, so the history is simply “unknown.” In Table 1B, “history” refers to recent documented negative HPV test (management after a prior negative cotest is so similar that we do not show them, interested readers can consult the full tables online). However, documented negative cytology provides relatively less reduction in risk compared with a negative HPV or cotest as history. Therefore, patients with a negative cytology history will still be managed by Table 1A. In Tables 2A B C, “history” refers to the abnormal screening test result preceding the current result: HPV-negative ASC-US (Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C). In Table 3, “history” refers to the precolposcopy test results. In Table 4A, “history” refers to both the colposcopy result (<CIN 2) and a low-grade test result preceding colposcopy. In Table 4B, “history” again refers to both the colposcopy result (<CIN 2) and preceding test result but addresses when a high-grade test result preceded the colposcopy.

In Tables 5A and 5B, “history” refers to treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, and “current results” are HPV test results or cotest results after treatment. For Tables 5A and 5B, the risk estimation in this scenario (i.e. posttreatment) derives specifically from treated CIN 3 and the test result at the follow-up visit after treatment. The risk remains higher for treated CIN 3 compared with CIN 2 scenarios. However, to maximize safety after treatment of precancer, management is recommended based on the risks of patients treated for CIN 3. Thus, the management recommendations apply to both treated CIN 2 and CIN 3.

### Common abnormal results of pap and human papillomavirus cotesting: what physicians are recommending for management [^3ff702b1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between physician and practice characteristics and adherence to management guidelines to better understand the factors associated with different screening recommendations by primary care physicians.

Methods

We used a cross-sectional nationally representative survey of 950 primary care physicians familiar with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to assess adherence to management guidelines by analyzing responses to two clinical vignettes of a 35-year-old woman who had Pap and HPV tests results: 1) discordant (normal Pap and positive HPV) or 2) mildly abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Pap and negative HPV). Analyses included multivariable logistic regression.

Results

For the discordant test results, 54.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51-57.6%) of physicians recommended both Pap and HPV testing in 6-12 months, adhering to management guidelines. For the mildly abnormal results, only 12.2% (95% CI 10-14.7%) had a guideline-adherent recommendation of Pap testing in 12 months with no HPV test. In multivariable analyses, no significant difference among physicians' specialties was observed for the discordant results. For the mildly abnormal results, physician specialty was associated with guideline adherence in which obstetrician-gynecologists had the highest percent of adherence (19.8%) compared with family and general practitioners (9.3%) and internists (11%) (P<.001).

Conclusion

Even for the most common abnormal results, many physicians reported recommendations that did not adhere to current management guidelines. Evidence-based interventions are needed to improve adherence to management guidelines for the newer HPV DNA test.

### Human papillomavirus reporting: minimizing patient and laboratory risk [^31b38261]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Risk management efforts in the cytology laboratory must address the gap between what can be achieved with medical history's most effective cancer screening test, the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, and even higher entrenched public expectations. Data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS) now provide level I clinical evidence from a large, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of ASCUS cases is generally the preferred method for initial assessment of the most prevalent category of abnormal Pap interpretation. The proposed combination of HPV DNA testing with cytologic Pap testing, the DNA Pap test, further shows the potential to nearly eliminate false-negative screening results, based on sensitivity and negative predictive values reported in available studies. Human papillomavirus DNA testing also appears to represent a significant enhancement for detection of endocervical adenocarcinomas, which are difficult to detect and prevent. Human papillomavirus DNA testing, when used in conjunction with cervical cytology, can significantly reduce risk to both the patient and the laboratory.

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published.To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^a5586e3c]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

New 2019 principles—testing and risk foundation—HPV-based testing is the basis for risk estimation and refers to use of either primary HPV testing alone or HPV testing in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting). Characteristics of HPV infections, including HPV type and the duration of infection, determine a patient's risk of CIN 3+. Although cytology has high specificity, it has lower sensitivity and lower negative predictive value than HPV testing and reduced utility for long-term risk prediction, and risk estimates underlying the 2019 management guidelines are based on HPV DNA testing.

ASCCP risk-based cervical screening management—framework and thresholds: The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine management, representing an evolution from prior result-based approaches that benchmarked 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ after HPV–cytology cotesting. The 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g., “colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology”) to risk-based management, exemplified by “colposcopic referral when immediate risks of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater.” For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, risk profiles of CIN 2+, CIN 3+, and cancer are produced from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test to link estimated risk to clinical action thresholds.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^67918a88]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management—risk-stratified actions for cervical screening abnormalities are outlined as follows: at the highest risk, expedited treatment can be performed without need for colposcopic biopsy; at somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopy is recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment; at lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed and surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent with 1 and 3 years maintained as 2 levels of concern/attention; and women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^e3116af8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination,the introduction of new screening technology,, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. “colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology”) to risk-based management (e.g. “colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater”).

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

### European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening. second edition – summary document [^2f82694d]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

guidelines for management of screen-positive women

A woman with a high-grade cytological lesion, a repeated low-grade lesion or an equivocal cytology result and a positive HPV test should be referred for colposcopy. The role of colposcopy is to identify the location of the abnormal cells, to target taking of biopsies and to decide whether any treatment is required. Colposcopy should only be carried out by adequately trained health professionals.
Guidelines are provided for the management of ASC-US and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Guidelines for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are difficult to delineate because current evidence does not indicate that any method of management is optimal. Repeat cytology or colposcopy are acceptable options, but HPV testing as an initial management option is not sufficiently selective for all women with LSIL. However, HPV testing in older women with LSIL can be considered.
Quality assurance and collection of data on patient management are important elements of the management and follow-up of women referred with an abnormal cervical smear.
Colposcopy is sometimes proposed as an alternative screening method, but its specificity (and probably also its sensitivity) in primary screening is too low for this purpose.

The following additional management considerations are associated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:

Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be considered screening tests for STIs.
All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer screening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity (i.e. those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual, or transgender).
A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is smeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for 10–20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based cytology can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle.
If specific infections other than HPV (e.g. chlamydia or gonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test after appropriate treatment for those infections might be indicated. However, in most instances (even in the presence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology tests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and reliable final reports can be produced without the need to repeat the cytology test after treatment.
The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not postpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after removal of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.
HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or by using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.
In the absence of other indications, the presence of external genital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical cancer screening.
The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection of other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test results or their interpretation. Typically, vaginal specimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical specimens for STI testing can be collected first.
Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal of the cervix do not require screening unless cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years. If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical hysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be performed as indicated (–).
Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test collection and use simple quality assurance measures are more likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined by the laboratory).
The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical transformation zone (e.g. cytobrushes) improves the accuracy of cytology tests.
Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable because they have similar test-performance characteristics.
At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their recent cytology test and HPV results and any history of evaluation and treatment (e.g. loop electrosurgical excision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with management; effort should be made to obtain copies of recent results. The importance and frequency of screening should be reinforced.

### Delivering guideline-concordant care for patients with high-risk HPV and normal cytologic findings [^642e1d7e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Do clinicians and systems maintain contact with and deliver services to patients to complete recommended surveillance? We addressed this question for patients with positive high-risk (non-16/18 or pooled genotypes) HPV test results and negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) cytologic findings. This group is of particular concern because US health care systems are shifting to primary HPV screening and cotesting,making HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding a common screening abnormality (range, 6.7%-14.9%)., Furthermore, most studies in the literature to date have monitored colposcopy receipt after a high-grade result,,, ; few have studied follow-up after an HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding.

Guideline-concordant practice for an HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding should include annual surveillance cotesting to monitor for HPV persistence and potential progression of cervical dysplasia.If findings are negative over 2 subsequent evaluations, then a patient can exit management and return to average-risk screening (ie, cytologic test alone every 3 years; primary HPV or cotesting every 5 years). Evidence supporting these recommendations is based on data from a limited number of settings. To describe how well practice aligns with guidelines, we used longitudinal cohort data from the National Cancer Institute Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR) II Cervical Consortium. In 3 diverse health care settings, we aimed to quantify patterns of surveillance testing and associated outcomes for patients after an HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding.

INTRODUCTION

The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines describe 6 clinical actions that providers can use when managing patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening test results: treatment; optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy; colposcopy/biopsy; 1-year surveillance; 3-year surveillance; and return to 5-year regular screening.These clinical actions are recommended based on a patient's risk of either currently having or subsequently developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3), adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS), or cancer (defined subsequently as CIN 3+). Exploration of numerous potential risk factors led to the determination that a patient's CIN 3+ risk can be estimated based on current human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology test results and recent history of test results, colposcopic evaluation and biopsy results, and treatments.

The 2019 guidelines comprehensively use and expand upon the principle of “equal management for equal risks” that was introduced in the 2012 guidelines.Specifically, management is based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+, regardless of what combination of test results yields that risk level. The guidelines make recommendations based on immediate CIN 3+ risk, which is the probability of patient currently having CIN 3+, and 5-year CIN 3+ risk, which gives the probability of developing CIN 3+ over the ensuing 5 years. We conducted an extensive data analysis effort to produce risk estimates for all combinations of tests and recent screening history, considering 5 clinical scenarios: (a) current abnormal screening results, (b) surveillance of past screening results not requiring immediate colposcopic referral, (c) management based on colposcopy/biopsy results, (d) postcolposcopy surveillance after less than CIN 2 histology, and (e) posttreatment follow-up. This article navigates the most relevant risk-based management tables that inform the new guidelines for clinicians. The comprehensive risk database is stored at the National Institutes of Health, publicly accessible through this link:. A user-friendly, electronic presentation of these risk estimates and their related recommendations is available via a smartphone app, and a web version (available via).

Cytology-negative, HPV-positive women 30 years and older—risk and follow-up: Women negative by both tests have a “less than 1 in 1,000 risk of having CIN 2+” and “should not be rescreened before 3 years.” In screened populations, the prevalence data showed “6.5%, and 58% of the HPV-positive women had a concurrent negative cytology,” and the risk of undetected CIN 2+ in cytology-negative, HPV-positive women ranged “from 2.4% to 5.1%.” For comparison, “CIN 2+ was detected at enrollment colposcopy in 10.2% of women of unknown HPV status with ASC-US in ALTS.” Natural history data indicate “60% of HPV-positive women became HPV negative after a median follow-up of 6 months.” Accordingly, “repeat cytology and HPV testing at 12 months seems to be the best management approach,” with persistently HPV-positive women on repeat testing who “should undergo colposcopy, even if cytology negative,” while those negative on both tests “can be rescreened in 3 years.”

ASCCP risk-based management—limitations and special-case cytology handling: The risks for some rare combinations could not be estimated with confidence, and for rare high-grade cytology such as ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL+, risk estimation after diagnoses of CIN 1 or less was less reliable and results are managed cautiously. Anticipated vaccine-era effects are noted: HPV vaccination is expected to decrease prevalence in patients between ages 25–29 years, and once enough data accrue on the vaccinated population, risk scores will be re-evaluated to determine recommended management for the vaccinated population.

Highlights include that colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk; if a patient has a minimally abnormal test result that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended; referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit; and treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true.In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### WHO should adjust its global strategy for cervical cancer prevention [^b630a5d8]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Because of quality management challenges inherent to visual screening, and because of uncertainties regarding the affordability and desirability of HPV screening and HPV vaccination in LMICs, Pap smear screening in LMICs is the strategy most likely to achieve the goal of saving as many lives as quickly as possible. Iatrogenic delays to Pap screening in LMICs contribute to preventable cervical cancer deaths. From 1997 to 2015, US NCI funded a pointless study in Mumbai that contributed to at least 500 000 preventable cervical cancer deaths by delaying Pap screening throughout India for 18 years.

In 1999, with an initial gift of US$50 million, the BMGF established the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention on the central assumption that novel technologies, rather than Pap screening, are the most likely solution to the problem of cervical cancer in LMICs.In 2000, the Head of Cancer Screening at WHO/IARC, an Alliance member organisation, stated he would be ‘loath’ to recommend establishment of Pap screening services in high-risk communities with no cervical screening programmes in place.Current WHO guidelines endorse Pap screening only for communities with Pap screening already in place.

WHO should adjust its Global Strategy for cervical cancer prevention. WHO should accept the WHO/IARC determination that ‘good-quality Pap smear screening can be implemented even in a rural setting of a developing country with reasonable investment’and advocate for rapid, immediate expansions of good-quality Pap smear screening in LMICs. Quality management practices that assure good disease-detection rates and good rates of follow-up care for Pap screening in LMICs should be detailed and disseminated.

HPV screening may be integrated into pre-existing Pap screening infrastructure if locality-specific measurements indicate that HPV screening will increase disease-detection rates and increase coverage rates of at-risk demographic groups. After transitions to HPV screening, Pap smears will remain useful for primary screening of younger women and for management of women with positive HPV primary screening tests.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^526ee550]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—postcolposcopy surveillance after referral for low-grade results with no CIN 2+ found: Current test results provide CIN 3+ immediate and 5-year risks with linked management. For HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL, immediate CIN 3+ risk is 3.1% with 5-year risk 6.0%, and recommended management is 1-y follow-up (recommendation confidence score 100). For HPV-positive NILM, immediate risk is 2.1% with 5-year risk 5.2%, and recommended management is 1-y follow-up (recommendation confidence score 100). For HPV-positive high-grade cytology, immediate risk is 23% with 5-year risk 31%, and recommended management is Colposcopy (recommendation confidence score 94). For HPV-negative NILM, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.42% and recommended management is 3-y follow-up (recommendation confidence score 99). Totals for this table are n=58,936 with 1,067 CIN 3+ cases. The risk determining the recommended management is bolded, and 100% recommendation confidence score is not exact but rounds to 100%.

Box 1—summary of updates to 2019 Guidelines highlights endorsement and management changes. Endorsement of the 2021 Opportunistic Infections guidelines for screening and management of HIV+ or immunosuppressed patients is noted. Guidelines were clarified around cytology-only screening; for patients 25 and older who are still receiving cytology-only screening, 2012 guidelines should be followed. Guidelines were revised for repeating an unsatisfactory cytology; cytology should be repeated as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months. After treatment for CIN2+, 3 negative HPV tests or cotests at 6, 18, and 30 months are recommended before the patient can return to a 3-year testing interval. Guidelines were clarified for use of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (primary HPV) for patients undergoing observation for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^7b3a4615]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management—after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing : this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

ASCCP 2019 unsatisfactory cytology—management recommendations state: “For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII).” “Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII).” “Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII).” “For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII).” “If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII).” Figure 5 operationalizes this via “No HPV or unknown result (any age),” “HPV Negative (age ≥25 years),” and “HPV Positive (unknown genotype) (age ≥25 years)” leading to “Repeat Age-based Screening after 2 to 4 months,” while “HPV 16 or 18 Positive” goes to colposcopy; the caption clarifies that “unknown genotype” includes both scenarios described.

Clinical action thresholds—management recommendations are based on Clinical Action Thresholds and correspond to risk strata. The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold “approximates the risk after a negative human papillomavirus (HPV)–based screening test” and such patients are “recommended to receive screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing.” The 3-year return threshold “approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen,” and patients with risks at or below it but above the 5-year threshold are “recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years.” “One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy.” The colposcopy threshold “approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result,” and these patients are “recommended to receive colposcopy.” The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable threshold “approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)” and such patients are “recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment,” with “Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy.” The expedited treatment preferred threshold “approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16– positive HSIL cytology” and “It is preferred that patients with risk at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes.”

ASCCP risk-based management—initial HPV-based screening risks and intervals: At the initial HPV-based screen for patients new to HPV testing in KPNC aged 25–65 years, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is 0.45%. At the first visit, 1,546,262 people were screened and 92% had a primary HPV-negative result; for those with a negative screen, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.14%, and a 5-year screening interval is recommended. Among the 8% initially HPV-positive, immediate CIN 3+ risk was 2.1% for HPV-positive NILM, 4.3% for HPV-positive ASC-US, 4.9% for HPV-positive LSIL, and 49% for HPV-positive HSIL.

### Primary high-risk human papillomavirus testing for cervical cancer screening in the United States: is It time? [^a9816062]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context

- The most recent update to cervical cancer screening guidelines offers interim guidance on the use of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening, with algorithms for management of results. After decades of screening with pure cytology and a shorter time with adjunctive HPV or cotesting with Papanicolaou (Pap) test and HPV, this is a significant change to our screening methods.

Objective

- To briefly review the history of cervical cancer screening, the evidence upon which these interim guidelines were based, the arguments for and against primary HPV testing, and the current state of the field.

Data Sources

- Primary studies, review articles, and commentaries were reviewed.

Conclusions

- While there is evidence both for and against primary HPV testing, there are a growing number of countries adopting the practice. It would be worthwhile to be informed and prepared for such a change in the United States as well.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors: erratum [^112ce832]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum—Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

Human papillomavirus genotyping conducted on residual aliquots was available for almost 19,000 patients at KPNC who were also at NCI-KPNC Persistence and Progression (PaP) study conducted from 2006 to 2013.Selection occurred through a 2-phase stratified sampling design. In the first phase of sampling, patients at KPNC with a cotest within the PaP enrollment window (2006–2011) were selected for storage of residual HPV testing specimens; the collection included approximately 45,000 HPV-positive patients (representing >3/4 of all HPV positive patients in that period) and a random group of approximately 10,000 HPV-negative patients. Approximately 8% of patients opted out, leaving 44,340 patients enrolled in the study. In the second phase of sampling, residual aliquots of patients in the PaP cohort were selected for genotyping using a complex stratified sampling design based on HPV results and histopathology outcomes (as of 2014) to maximize information yield. Typing focused primarily on HPV-positive patients, which included a random draw plus all unselected patients who were diagnosed with cancer or AIS, 500 unselected patients with CIN 3, and 500 unselected patients with CIN 2. Retesting by research typing assays of HPV-negative patients was restricted to a random group of 500 plus all unselected patients with rare outcomes suggesting elevated cancer risks (i.e. CIN 2+ histopathology or high-grade cytology). Both the KPNC and NCI-KPNC PaP studies have been reapproved yearly by both KPNC and NCI institutional review board committees.

Screening Tests and Clinical Management in the KPNC

Since 2001, patients at the KPNC have been tested with HPV to triage cytology results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Beginning in 2003, patients 30 years or older underwent screening with concurrent HPV and cytology cotests. In 2013, cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years.

The clinical HPV testing was conducted using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer's instructions. It reports HPV status as negative versus positive for infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and also inadvertently detects through cross-reaction a percentage of closely related low-risk HPV types (e.g. 53, 66, 67, 70, 82, and 82).

Validation—CDC NBCCEDP rarely/never/unknown screened population indicates persistently higher risks and an expedited-treatment exception: stratified risks “remained significantly higher than that of the KPNC cohort (O/Es from 1.09–6.36),” and for those “who tested HPV positive/HSIL+” the “estimated immediate CIN 3+ risk of 61.4% exceeded the risk range of 25% to 60% for recommended management based on expedited treatment,” therefore “the guidelines recommend expedited treatment for patients testing HPV positive/HSIL+ with rarely/never screened.”

### 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities [^ab8d4aae]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer precursors.

Participants

A panel of 121 experts in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, were invited to participate in a consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).

Evidence and Consensus Process

Guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities were developed through a multistep process. Starting 6 months before the conference, working groups developed draft management guidelines based on formal literature reviews of English-language articles published in 1988-2001, as well as input from the professional community at large, obtained using interactive Internet-based bulletin boards. On September 6-8, 2001, the ASCCP Consensus Conference was held in Bethesda, Md. Guidelines with supporting evidence were presented and underwent discussion, revision, and voting.

Conclusions

Management of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) depends on whether the Papanicolaou test is subcategorized as of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or as cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H). Women with ASC-US should be managed using a program of 2 repeat cytology tests, immediate colposcopy, or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for HPV DNA is the preferred approach when liquid-based cytology is used for screening. In most instances, women with ASC-H, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL, and atypical glandular cells should be referred for immediate colposcopic evaluation.

TABLE 3 
Projected Outcomes From Different Treatment or Colposcopy Referral Thresholds Per 1 Million Patients Screened

To inform the 0.55% 5-year CIN 3+ risk threshold for a 3-year return, the surveillance group used the 5-year CIN 3+ risk of NILM as a benchmark (because 2012 guidelines recommended a 3-year return for NILM). We projected the 5-year CIN 3+ risks after an NILM result for different percentages of HPV positivity. If the proportion of HPV positive among NILM is 4.5% (KPNC is 4.4%), the risk of NILM would be 0.33%. If the proportion of HPV positive among NILM is 7% (CDC is 6.9% and 7.1% for well screened and screened rarely/never/unknown populations, respectively), the risk of NILM would be 0.45%. The 0.55% 5-year CIN 3+ risk corresponds to an HPV positivity of 9% among NILM cytology results and is close to the 0.52% risk estimated in the New Mexico Pap Registry. Similarly, to inform the 0.15% clinical action thresholds for a 5-year return, the surveillance group used the 5-year CIN 3+ risk of HPV negative at the KPNC as a benchmark, which is 0.14% with a 95% upper confidence limit of 0.15%.

ASCCP risk-based management—exceptions to colposcopy threshold: For patients with ASC-H cytology, colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV result (AII). In the KPNC data, HPV-positive ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 26% and a cancer risk of 0.92%, whereas HPV-negative ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 3.4%, but an immediate cancer risk of 0.69%, and the working group recommended colposcopy for all patients with ASC-H, regardless of HPV test results. For patients with HPV 18–positive NILM, colposcopy is recommended (AII) (note colposcopy is also recommended for HPV 16–positive NILM), as HPV 18–positive NILM had a 3.0% prevalent CIN 3+ risk with cancer risk 0.2% immediately and 0.56% at 5 years; given the elevated cancer risk, referral to colposcopy is recommended.

TABLE 1 
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.

For HPV-positive cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), colposcopy is recommended. If genotyping is positive for HPV 16, HPV 18, or both with ASC-US or LSIL, colposcopy is recommended. For HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL with negative screening results within the previous 5 yrs, repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology that is HPV 16 positive, expedited treatment is recommended; if HPV is untyped, positive for a genotype other than HPV 16, or negative with HSIL, colposcopy or expedited treatment is acceptable. Footnotes specify that negative HPV test or cotest results only defer colposcopy if from screening within the last 5 years and that expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥25 years.

Precolposcopy Scenario

We restricted analyses in the precolposcopy scenario to 1,546,462 patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy who were not missing HPV or cytology results at the initial screen (insufficient and noncervical cytology results were also excluded). Risks were estimated for 4 testing rounds. Risk estimated from the initial HPV-based screen was used to inform precolposcopic management for patients whose histories of HPV status were unknown. Beginning with the second testing round, patients in a precolposcopy scenario had an important biomarker for risk stratification—their HPV-based test result from the previous round of testing. We estimated risks using the second round to inform precolposcopic management after immediately prior test results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL. We did not provide risk estimates for other prior abnormal test results (e.g. HPV positive/ASC-US, HPV positive/LSIL) that typically lead to colposcopy referral. The third and fourth testing rounds were primarily used to determine whether patients with multiple negative HPV or cotest results after an HPV-positive/NILM, HPV-negative/ASC-US, or HPV-negative/LSIL test result had sufficiently low subsequent risks to permit extension of their testing intervals. Management after more complicated screening histories were not included in these guidelines as we could not precisely estimate risks for some combinations of past/current test results because of the smaller sample sizes.

Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology—guidance states that for patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, co-test, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months (BIII). Supporting evidence includes a study in which the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women, with approximate cellularity slightly better at 8 to 30 days (P = 0.04). Higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results, and waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology result could lead to harm; for this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^ea753b66]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We detail how risk estimates are used for clinical management according to the principles laid out by the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Guidelines. We also lay out basic principles underlying risk-based management: (a) HPV-negative test results reduce risk; (b) colposcopic examinations at which CIN 2+ is not found reduce risk; (c) HPV-positive test results increase risk; and (d) prior treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 increases risk. Although these principles are intuitive, their ramifications are far-reaching. At a population level, the risk of CIN 3+ for screening participants at any given age is highest at the time of the initial HPV-based screen (0.45% immediate CIN 3+ risk for patients new to HPV testing in KPNC aged 25–65 years). The first screening round will detect most prevalent CIN 3+ and reduce the risk of CIN 3+ in future screening rounds. This situation is exemplified by patients entering an HPV-based screening program for the first time.

Among 1,546,462 people at the first visit, 92% had a primary HPV-negative test result. Individuals with a negative HPV screening results are at very low risk of developing CIN 3+ within the next 5 years (0.14%); thus, a 5-year screening interval is recommended. As populations begin screening with HPV testing, most individuals will test negative, reducing their need for colposcopy in subsequent screening rounds.

Among the 8% of the population that initially tested HPV positive, immediate CIN 3+ risks ranged from 2.1% for HPV-positive NILM (below the colposcopy threshold), to 4.3% and 4.4% for HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, respectively (defining the colposcopy threshold), to 25% and 26% for HPV-negative HSIL+ and HPV-positive ASC-H, respectively (defining the treatment or colposcopy threshold), to 49% for HPV-positive HSIL+. Reaching the 60% threshold for preferring treatment requires an additional risk factor, such as HPV-16 infectionor a history of not having been screened.

Abstract

This Research Letter summarizes all updates to the 2019 Guidelines through September 2023, including: endorsement of the 2021 Opportunistic Infections guidelines for HIV+ or immunosuppressed patients; clarification of use of human papillomavirus testing alone for patients undergoing observation for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2; revision of unsatisfactory cytology management; clarification that 2012 guidelines should be followed for patients aged 25 years and older screened with cytology only; management of patients for whom colposcopy was recommended but not completed; clarification that after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+, 3 negative human papillomavirus tests or cotests at 6, 18, and 30 months are recommended before the patient can return to a 3-year testing interval; and clarification of postcolposcopy management of minimally abnormal results.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^c5772f3c]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells—cannot exclude high-grade (ASC-H) management—The recommended management of women with ASC-H is referral for colposcopic evaluation (AII). In women in whom cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2,3) is not identified, follow-up with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 12 months or cytological testing at 6 months and 12 months is acceptable (CIII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for HPV DNA or who are found to have ASC-US or greater on their repeat cytological tests (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are “negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy,” return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AI). If CIN 2,3 is identified, manage per ASCCP Guideline.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^aa12225d]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

K.3 Managing patients older than 65 years with a history of prior abnormalities—If patients over age 65 years undergo human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, cotesting, or cytology, management according to guidelines for patients aged 25 to 65 years is recommended (CII). If surveillance is indicated for prior abnormal screening or treatment for precancer, discontinuing surveillance is unacceptable if the patient is in reasonably good health and testing is feasible (DII), whereas discontinuation of surveillance is recommended for patients with a limited life expectancy (EIII). As context, approximately 20% of cervical cancers occur in patients older than 65 years, and patients with previous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) seem to have an elevated lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer and thus may require surveillance testing beyond the age of 65 years. For sampling challenges, vaginal estrogen use for a limited time (3 weeks) can be considered to obtain adequate sampling.

### Cervical cancer screening: a review [^b7f0b8e5]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Each year in the US, approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer, 14 000 people are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 4000 die of cervical cancer.

Observations

Essentially all cervical cancers worldwide are caused by persistent infections with one of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. HPV vaccination at ages 9 through 12 years will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers. In people with a cervix aged 21 through 65 years, cervical cancer is prevented by screening for and treating cervical precancer, defined as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. High-grade lesions can progress to cervical cancer if not treated. Cervicovaginal HPV testing is 90% sensitive for detecting precancer. In the general population, the risk of precancer is less than 0.15% over 5 years following a negative HPV test result. Among people with a positive HPV test result, a combination of HPV genotyping and cervical cytology (Papanicolaou testing) can identify the risk of precancer. For people with current precancer risks of less than 4%, repeat HPV testing is recommended in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on 5-year precancer risk. For people with current precancer risks of 4% through 24%, such as those with low-grade cytology test results (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]) and a positive HPV test of unknown duration, colposcopy is recommended. For patients with precancer risks of less than 25% (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [CIN1] or histologic LSIL), treatment-related adverse effects, including possible association with preterm labor, can be reduced by repeating colposcopy to monitor for precancer and avoiding excisional treatment. For patients with current precancer risks of 25% through 59% (eg, high-grade cytology results of ASC cannot exclude high-grade lesion [ASC-H] or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] with positive HPV test results), management consists of colposcopy with biopsy or excisional treatment. For those with current precancer risks of 60% or more, such as patients with HPV-16-positive HSIL, proceeding directly to excisional treatment is preferred, but performing a colposcopy first to confirm the need for excisional treatment is acceptable. Clinical decision support tools can facilitate correct management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer each year in the US to prevent cervical cancer. People with a cervix should be screened with HPV testing, and if HPV-positive, genotyping and cytology testing should be performed to assess the risk of cervical precancer and determine the need for colposcopy or treatment. HPV vaccination in adolescence will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers.

FIGUR'E 1 
This figure demonstrates how patient risk is evaluated. For a given current results and history combination, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is examined. If this risk is 4% or greater, immediate management via colposcopy or treatment is indicated. If the immediate risk is less than 4%, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is examined to determine whether patients should return in 1, 3, or 5 years.

The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative screening test using HPV testing or cotesting in the general population, for whom retesting in 5 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold are recommended to receive routine screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing (Section E.1).
The 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen in the general population, for whom retesting in 3 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold but above the 5-year threshold are recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years (Section E.1).
One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy (Section E.1).
The colposcopy Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result in the general population, for whom colposcopy is recommended in the 2012 guidelines.Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment threshold are recommended to receive colposcopy (Section E.2).
The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) cytology screening result in the general population. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment preferred threshold are recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment (Section E.3). Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy.
The expedited treatment preferred Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology screening result in the general population. It is preferred that patients with risks at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the potential effects of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes that outweigh concerns about cancer (Section E.3).
Of note, patients with histologic HSIL (CIN 2) who have chosen observation are recommended to receive colposcopy and HPV-based testing at 6-month intervals (Section I.3).

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^17f34928]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with an estimated immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 60% or greater based on history and current results, treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation is preferred but colposcopy with biopsy is acceptable (BII).

Rationale: In the 2012 guidelines, expedited treatment (i.e. without biopsy confirmation) was an acceptable management option for HSIL cytology.Patients with HSIL cytology undergoing expedited treatment are diagnosed with CIN 3+ in 49% to 75% of cases. – The KPNC data show similar risks: HPV-positive HSIL cytology has immediate risks of CIN 3+ and CIN 2+ of 49% and 77%, respectively.Two clinical situations currently exceed the 60% threshold where expedited treatment is preferred. HSIL cytology that is HPV 16–positive has an immediate CIN 3+ of 60%, CIN 2+ risks of 77%, and immediate cancer risks of 8.1%.In the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, women with HPV-positive HSIL cytology (regardless of genotype) who were underscreened (generally defined as no screening in >5 years) had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 64% and CIN 2+ risks of 82% (cancer risk not available). Based on the KPNC data, for clinical situations that exceed the 60% threshold, 1.7 patients will receive diagnostic excisional procedures for every CIN 3+ treated, a low rate of overtreatment.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening triage: When primary HPV screening is used, performance of an additional reflex triage test for all positive HPV tests regardless of genotype is preferred (CIII). If genotyping results are HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive and reflex triage testing from the same laboratory specimen is not feasible, referral for colposcopy before obtaining additional testing is acceptable (CIII), and if triage is not performed before colposcopy, collection of an additional triage test at the colposcopy visit is recommended (CIII). The US FDA approved the cobas HPV test in March 2014 and the Onclarity HPV test in April 2018 for primary HPV testing for screening for patients 25 years and older, and both these tests offer and are approved for partial HPV genotyping.

### ASCCP patient management guidelines: pap test specimen adequacy and quality indicators [^3591d54f]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide management guidelines according to Pap test specimen adequacy based on literature review and expert opinion.

Methods

A task force named by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology conducted a literature review and discussed appropriate management. The steering committee of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology and other experts reviewed the guidelines.

Results

The guidelines recommend a repeat Pap test in 12 months for most women who are undergoing routine annual/biennial screening if the current Pap test is negative but either lacks an endocervical/transformation zone component or is partially obscured. Indications for considering an earlier repeat are also provided. The preferred management for unsatisfactory Pap tests is a repeat Pap test within a short interval of 2 to 4 months.

Conclusions

The management guidelines will help promote optimal and uniform follow-up of women's Pap tests, according to Pap test specimen adequacy.

### Is the human papillomavirus test in combination with the Papanicolaou test useful for management of patients with diagnoses of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance / low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions? [^493f8430]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is useful in the evaluation of patients diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and whether the HPV test is appropriate as an alternative screening method.

Design

The results of Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and subsequent hybrid capture tube (HCT) II tests for high-risk-type HPV were analyzed for 457 patients. Among these tests, 208 histologic diagnoses were made and correlated with the results of Pap and HPV tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the Pap test, HPV test, and the combined method of Pap and HPV tests to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 and all CIN were also measured.

Results

Sixty (63.8%) of 94 women with LSIL and 31 (26.3%) of 118 women with ASCUS tested positive for high-risk HPV. The sensitivity values for Pap tests in detecting all cases of CIN and CIN 2/3 were 91.4% and 92.9%, respectively. The sensitivity values of HCT II tests using the high-risk probe for detecting all cases of CIN and CIN 2/3 were 62.6% and 88.1%, respectively. Biopsies confirmed that 10 (22.7%) of 44 LSIL patients with high-risk HPV had CIN 2/3, but only 1 (4.5%) of 22 LSIL patients without high-risk HPV had CIN 2/3.

Conclusion

Testing for high-risk HPV with the HCT II test is useful in the detection of CIN 2/3 in LSIL groups and in the selection of patients for colposcopy in ASCUS groups, but it is not suitable for cervical cancer screening tests.

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection-STI treatment (...) [^d55aed96]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

An abnormal cytology test or a positive HPV test can cause short-term anxiety, stress, fear, and confusion, possibly decreasing the patient’s ability to absorb and retain information and acting as a barrier to follow-up care.
- Positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical precancerous lesions, which often do not cause symptoms until they become invasive. Appropriate follow-up is essential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop.
- HPV is a common infection and is often controlled by the body without any medical interventions. A positive HPV test does not mean that a person has cancer.
- Providers should emphasize that HPV infections often are shared between partners, and it is often not possible to know the origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections in both male and female partners.
- Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
- Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.
- If a patient has a high-grade cytology result and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.
- When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management.
- Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone.
- HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal.
- HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^24f50746]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for abnormal screening results when there are no known prior HPV test results are presented with recommended actions. For Unknown HPV-positive HSIL+, CIN 3+ immediate risk is 49 and CIN 3+ 5-year risk is 53 with Colposcopy/treatment. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-H, risks are 26 immediate and 35 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive LSIL, risks are 4.3 immediate and 6.9 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-US, risks are 4.8 immediate and 7.3 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive NILM, risks are 2.1 immediate and 4.8 at 5 years with 1-y follow-up. For Unknown HPV-negative NILM, risks are 0.04 immediate and 0.12 at 5 years with 5-y follow-up. Notes specify that HPV-negative ASC-H and AGC are referred to colposcopy although they do not exceed the 4% immediate colposcopy threshold, and that HPV-negative HSIL+ is seen in only 0.01% of the population with an immediate risk of 25%; HPV-positive “ALL” are excluded from the table to avoid duplication.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^e6784a40]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommended management of women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) states that colposcopy is recommended for managing women with LSIL, except in special populations (AII). Endocervical sampling is preferred for nonpregnant women in whom no lesions are identified (BII) and for those with an unsatisfactory colposcopy (AII), but is acceptable for those with a satisfactory colposcopy and a lesion identified in the transformation zone (CII). After colposcopy when cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is not identified, acceptable options are testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) at 12 months or repeat cervical cytology at 6 and 12 months (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are “negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy,” return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AII). If the HPV DNA test is positive or repeat cytology is ASC-US or greater, colposcopy is recommended (AII). Women with CIN should be managed according to the 2006 Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and in the absence of histologically confirmed CIN, neither excisional nor ablative procedures are acceptable for the initial management of LSIL (EII).

Validation—ATHENA study comparisons similarly show higher baseline risks but mostly aligned management, with a noted HPV-positive/NILM exception: ATHENA had “greater overall immediate CIN 3+ risks (0.79% vs 0.46%, p < .001) and greater proportions of patients who tested HPV positive/NILM (7.7% vs 4.1%, p < .001) at the initial screen,” and for HPV-positive NILM, risks “remained significantly higher than that of KPNC (O/Es from 1.3–2.2).” Management “largely agreed, with the exception of HPV positive/NILM (immediate CIN 3+ risk: 4.6%; O/E: 2.2 [95% CI 1.8–2.6]),” and with genotyping, examples included “colposcopy referral for types 16 and 18 and a 1-year return for non-16/18 HPV-positive NILM results.”

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^028ee28a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—patients younger than 25 years, initial management after an abnormal screening test result: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], atypical squamous cells—cannot exclude HSIL [ASC-H], atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e., histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL; CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g., repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher).

### Response to letter to the editor regarding: 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^28181bb2]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management—revised Figure 2 legend for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) outlines risk-based actions. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk = 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV test or cotest performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion results. Note similar management would be recommended for any minimally abnormal test result less severe than atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^d2c81d5e]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

HOW THE NEW APPROACH WILL WORK IN PRACTICE

Clinicians are likely to consult guidelines in 5 different clinical situations: consideration of a new abnormal screening result; management of a follow-up test result at a 1- or 3-year surveillance return visit; interpretation of colposcopic biopsy diagnosis; follow-up of postcolposcopy surveillance of patients not initially found to need treatment (e.g. a biopsy <CIN 2); and posttreatment follow-up. An individual patient under management would likely attend more than one of these visits.

It is important to realize that most clinical visits devoted to management of abnormal cervical cancer screening results will involve common and ultimately benign HPV infections and minor cytologic abnormalities. For example, roughly 20% of individuals participating in cotesting for 7 years at KPNC had at least 1 abnormal result (HPV and/or cytology). The 2019 guidelines address as many abnormal result combinations as possible, using 2 different approaches. The common initial visits that are mainly minor abnormalities are handled in the 2019 guidelines by use of risk tables and clinical action thresholds.At the KPNC, colposcopy referrals leading to postcolposcopy management decisions are about half as frequent as initial management visits; these are addressed by both risk tablesand, for uncommon or especially high-risk situations, management algorithm figures.Treatment and posttreatment visits are uncommon (approximately 1/10th as frequent as initial management visits in the KPNC data set), but are especially important to preventing cancer, and are addressed using a series of management algorithm figures.

History of HPV-positive results—follow-up after HPV-positive NILM with a subsequent negative cotest should be shorter because risk remains elevated; specifically, after HPV-positive NILM a negative cotest is recommended to be followed up in 1 year rather than 3 years because the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.9% compared with the 0.55% 3-year surveillance threshold, and after only 2 negative cotests the interval can be extended to 3 years when the 5-year CIN 3+ risk drops to 0.29%.

### For HPV-positive women, test can guide screening (...) [^113bf55a]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

Doctors usually use a Pap test, also called a Pap smear, to determine whether an HPV infection is likely to cause precancer and help decide whether a woman should get a biopsy. But, according to the NCI study, the dual-stain test was better than the Pap test at predicting whether HPV-positive women developed cervical precancer within 5 years. The findings suggest that HPV-positive women with a positive dual-stain test result should get a biopsy to check for cervical precancer or cancer, the study authors concluded, whereas those with a negative result can safely wait 3 years before getting screened again. Results from the prospective study were reported October 11 in JAMA Oncology. For example, some women who test positive for HPV and who have minor abnormalities on a Pap test are referred for colposcopy, a procedure in which biopsies are taken of abnormal areas in the cervix.

But only a small percentage of Pap test abnormalities turn out to be cervical precancer or cancer, meaning most of these women had an unnecessary colposcopy, Dr. Wentzensen explained. Because of these limitations, “there is a big effort to find better markers that allow us to triage HPV-positive women more efficiently, ” he said. Overall, 46% of women in the study had a positive dual-stain test result and 51% had an abnormal Pap test result. More women with severely abnormal Pap test results than women with normal Pap results had a positive dual-stain test result. Over the 5-year study period, 77% of women found to have a high-grade precancer and 91% found to have cancer had a positive dual-stain test result. Compared with Pap test results, dual-stain test results were far more indicative of the 5-year risk of cervical precancer, the team found.

For example, women with a positive dual-stain test result had a higher risk of developing cervical precancer over the next 5 years than women with a positive Pap test result. Conversely, women with a negative dual-stain test result had a lower risk of developing cervical precancer within 5 years, compared with women with a normal Pap test result. This means that a negative dual-stain test result gives greater reassurance than a normal Pap test result that precancer won’t develop during the ensuing 5 years, Dr. Wentzensen explained.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^0ada84f5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management—clinical actions and data source: The 2019 consensus guidelines recommend 1 of 6 clinical actions based on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+), explicitly including 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, and 5-year return to regular screening, with treatment and colposcopy/biopsy options. Using screening data from 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years underwent human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology co-testing scheduled every 3 years, and the study estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current results with past screening and colposcopy/biopsy history; risk tables are presented for scenarios common in clinical practice.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^d34eca65]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management—one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities—HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively)—and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

### Cervical cancer: precursors and prevention [^8a90abeb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer, caused due to oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV), is a leading preventable cause of cancer morbidity and mortality globally. Chronic, persistent HPV infection-induced cervical precursor lesions, if left undetected and untreated, can progress to invasive cancer. Cervical cancer screening approaches have evolved from cytology (Papanicolaou test) to highly sensitive HPV-based molecular methods and personalized, risk-stratified, management guidelines. Innovations like self-collection of samples to increase screening access, innovative triage methods to optimize management of screen positives, and scalable and efficacious precancer treatment approaches will be key to further enhance the utility of prevention interventions.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^19adf86b]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Validation of risk-based guidelines—external cohorts and portability metric: Validation for the initial screen used 3 cohorts (the CDC NBCCEDP, the Onclarity Human Papillomavirus Trial, and the ATHENA study), with the NBCCEDP analysis cohort consisting of 363,544 patients 20 years and older with nonmissing HPV and cytology results and no history of CIN 2+ histology; separate validation analyses were conducted for those with prior cytology in the past 5 years versus more than 5 years/never/unknown, and because only a single screen was available, only the immediate risk of positive test results (HPV positive/NILM, HPV positive/ASC-US, or LSIL+) was available; portability of KPNC-derived estimated risk and recommended management was assessed by calculating the ratio of observed to expected CIN 3+ risk (O/E) for each test result, using the KPNC-estimated risk as expected and the study-specific estimated risk as observed.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^79b03ea0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)—initial follow-up, HPV triage, and post-colposcopy care are specified with graded recommendations. Cytological testing should be performed at 6-month intervals until 2 consecutive “negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy” results are obtained (AII), and colposcopy is recommended for women with ASC-US or greater cytological abnormality on a repeat test (AII); after 2 repeat negatives, women can return to routine cytological screening (AII). HPV DNA testing is presented as “Preferred if liquid-based cytology or co-collection available,” with “HPV Positive* (managed in same manner as women with LSIL).” When colposcopy is used, “Endocervical sampling [is] preferred in women with no lesions, and those with unsatisfactory colposcopy,” and if CIN is not identified, repeat cytology at 12 months is recommended (BIII); the algorithm lists “Cytology @ 6 to 12 mos OR HPV DNA Testing @ 12 mos,” proceeding to “Repeat Colposcopy” for “≥ ASC or HPV (+)” and to “Routine Screening” if “Negative,” while cases with “CIN” are to “Manage per ASCCP Guideline.” Because of overtreatment concerns, “the routine use of diagnostic excisional procedures such as the loop electrosurgical excision is unacceptable for women with an initial ASC-US in the absence of histologically diagnosed CIN 2,3. (EII).”

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^fa7b6a97]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions (“precancer”) that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of “interval cancers” occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

### Role of screening history in clinical meaning and optimal management of positive cervical screening results [^b3fc1f43]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. US consensus management guidelines for a positive cervical screening result typically focus on the current screening result only. A negative testing history may alter risk of the following positive screening results, caused by a new HPV infection, and therefore its optimal management.

Methods

Women ages 30years and older were screened with triennial HPV and cytology co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2003 to 2014. We estimated the subsequent 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more severe diagnoses (CIN3+) in a cohort of 1 156 387 women following abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or worse) cytology and/or positive HPV testing, when the test result followed 0 (n=990 013), 1 (n=543 986), 2 (n=245 974), or 3 (n=79 946) consecutive negative co-test(s). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Following 0-3 successive negative co-tests, 5-year CIN3+ risks following a positive HPV test decreased progressively from 7.2% (95% CI =7.0% to 7.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI=0.7% to 3.4%) (Ptrend<.001). Similarly, risks following an abnormal (ASC-US or worse) cytology result decreased from 6.6% (95% CI=6.4% to 6.9%) to 1.1% (95% CI=0.5% to 2.3%) (Ptrend<.001). Risks following low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the risk threshold for referral to colposcopy in the United States, decreased from 5.2% (95% CI=4.7% to 5.7%) to 0.9% (95% CI=0.2% to 4.3%). Risks following high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or more severe, a specific marker for the presence of precancerous lesions, decreased from 50.0% (95% CI=47.5% to 52.5%) to 10.0% (95% CI=2.6% to 34.4%).

Conclusions

Following one or more sequential antecedent, documented negative co-tests or HPV tests, women with HPV-positive ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion might have sufficiently low CIN3+ risk that they do not need colposcopy referral and might instead undergo 6-12-month surveillance for evidence of higher risk before being referred to colposcopy.

### Incorporating stakeholder feedback in guidelines development for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests [^8cdcaa29]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP meeting key provider responses—among respondents, for women 30 y and older the screening test used was cytology (Pap test)/HPV co-testing in 124 (91.85%), cytology (Pap test) alone in 5 (3.70%), HPV testing alone in 3 (2.22%), and N/A in 3 (2.22). For HPV testing, provision of partial genotyping results was yes in 101 (79.53%). HPV-based screening started 0–5 y ago in 28 (22.40%), 5–10 y ago in 64 (51.20%), and >10 y ago in 33 (26.40%). Following the current (2012) ASCCP consensus guidelines was always/almost always in 126 (93.33%), sometimes in 5 (3.70%), and N/A in 4 (2.96%). Use of the current ASCCP app was yes in 98 (72.59%). Among those who do not use the app, willingness to use it if incorporated into the electronic medical record was yes in 25 (75.76%), and if incorporated as a risk score and/or recommendation attached to the patient’s laboratory result was yes in 29 (85.29%). When managing a current abnormal result, reviewing past cytology/HPV/colposcopy results was yes in 131 (98.50%), and believing that incorporating patients’ history into the current management recommendation will be an improvement was yes in 119 (88.15%).

### Updated guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities [^4d89c905]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Cervical screening test selection—HPV assay regulatory status: Human papillomavirus (HPV) assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States, and all HPV testing in the guidelines refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only. For management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, rigorous data are available to support use of these particular tests in management.

### A study of partial human papillomavirus genotyping in support of the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^7415dbf1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening strategies are shifting from cytology to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV testing is more sensitive and, when negative, offers greater reassurance against cancer. However, most infections are typically benign, clearing within 2 years of acquisition, and in most cases do not require invasive diagnostic procedures or treatment.

Secondary “triage” testing of HPV-positive women is an important step in clinical management. Cytology is currently recommended as a triage strategy, with most nonnormal cytologic results among HPV-positive women leading to immediate colposcopy.Among HPV-positive women, HPV genotyping can be used in addition to cytology to effectively stratify the risk of precancer.In the 2012 guidelines and 2015 clinical guidance,, partial genotyping was incorporated into management; women with HPV-positive, cytology of Negative for Intraepithelial Lesions or Malignancy (NILM) were referred to colposcopy if the highest-risk HPV types (HPV 16 or HPV 18) were detected.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved several HPV tests that provide genotyping information. Commercially available clinical tests vary in the degree to which they can identify specific HPV types,from no individual typing to extended genotyping. Regardless of typing capability, the number of types actually reported by screening assays in the United States is currently restricted (as of the beginning of 2020) to the highest-risk types: HPV 16, HPV 18, and sometimes HPV 45.

The large National Cancer Institute/ Kaiser Permanente Northern California Persistence and Progression (PaP) study was initiated in 2006 partially to help guide the use of typing as a triage after positive HPV testing. This analysis uses data from the PaP study to fit risk estimates for partial HPV genotyping into the clinical action thresholds for the new 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines.

### Adjunctive human papillomavirus testing in the 2-year follow-up of women with low-grade cervical cytologic abnormalities: a randomized trial and economic evaluation [^6c24fd6e]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Context

Although human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may aid in managing low-grade abnormality on screening cervical cytology, patient compliance with repeat testing programs requires consideration.

Objectives

To determine effectiveness and costs of repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) test and oncogenic HPV testing for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3.

Design

We conducted a randomized controlled trial of combined Pap test and cervical HPV testing by Hybrid Capture 1 test compared with Pap test alone; tests were performed every 6 months for up to 2 years. The study end point was colposcopic examination performed on all women at 2 years, or earlier if an HPV test was positive or if a Pap test showed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

Setting

Sixty-six community family practices.

Participants

Two hundred fifty-seven women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on screening cervical cytology.

Main Outcome Measures

Detection of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3, fully allocated costs, and loss to follow-up.

Results

Combined Pap test and HPV testing detected 11 (100%) of 11 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, whereas Pap test alone detected 7 (63.6%) of these 11 cases (P =.14); corresponding specificities were 39 (46.4%) of 84 and 45 (71.4%) of 63 (P =.005). The cost-effectiveness ratio was Can $4456 per additional case of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Sixty-nine (26.8%) of the 257 women (24.6% combined group vs 29.1% Pap test only group, P =.41) defaulted from testing or from colposcopy when referred with an abnormal result.

Conclusions

Combined testing was more costly but may detect more cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 than Pap test alone. However, poor adherence limits usefulness of a management strategy that requires repeated follow-up.

Data Presentation: Clinical Scenarios

Risk-based management tables are organized under the 5 clinical scenarios. It is important to emphasize that for a given patient over time, a clinician is likely to consult various tables as the management scenarios are encountered, from initial abnormality to resolution. Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results. Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result. To qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g. a normal screening interval).

TABLE 1A 
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Abnormal Screening Results, When There Are No Known Prior HPV Test Results

TABLE 1B 
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ After a Prior HPV-Negative Screen Documented in the Medical Record

Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopic referral. Management of current cotest results is described after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US (see Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C).

TABLE 2A 
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative ASC-US

TABLE 2B 
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative LSIL

Table 2C 
Immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for results obtained in follow-up of HPV-positive NILM

Scenario 3, management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results, describes subsequent management based on the colposcopy/biopsy diagnosis (see Table 3). Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found (i.e. colposcopy/biopsy results were CIN 1 or normal). Table 4A describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was low grade (i.e. LSIL, ASC-US, or HPV-positive NILM). Table 4B describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was high grade (i.e. ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+). Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, either short term (see Table 5A) or longer term (see Table 5B).

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^065e8706]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical endocervical, endometrial, or glandular cells not otherwise specified (NOS)—postcolposcopy follow-up when HPV status is known: For women without CIN 2,3 or glandular neoplasia identified histologically, the recommended management is to repeat cytological testing combined with HPV DNA testing at 6 months if HPV DNA positive and at 12 months if HPV DNA negative (CII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for high-risk (oncogenic) HPV DNA or who are found to have atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater on repeat cytology; if both tests are negative, women can return to routine cytological testing (BII).
