## Question

What is side effect of sculptra and how to treat it

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of Sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid) and how to treat them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action to anticipate expected and delayed effects. Then, I should categorize side effects by timing and mechanism. Next, I will quantify frequencies where available and flag high-consequence complications. After that, I will map prevention strategies, including reconstitution, technique, and patient selection. Finally, I will detail treatment algorithms for early, late, and granulomatous complications and close with counseling points and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because side effects often mirror the biology. Sculptra is a biostimulatory filler composed of poly-L-lactic acid microspheres suspended in mannitol and carboxymethylcellulose; it induces a subclinical inflammatory response that stimulates fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, yielding gradual volume restoration over weeks to months, which explains both delayed nodules and the need for multiple sessions to reach optimal correction [^abf7d172] [^3b8a5347].

> I will now examine the side-effect taxonomy by timing and mechanism, since this guides both counseling and management. Early-onset effects within hours to days include injection-site bruising, swelling, erythema, and tenderness, which are typically transient and technique-related. Late-onset effects from weeks to months include papules and nodules, often from superficial placement or inadequate massage. Delayed-onset effects from months to years include granulomas and inflammatory nodules, reflecting foreign-body immune responses that can appear long after treatment and may mimic infection or malignancy [^d049da60] [^b7b40568] [^abf7d172].

> Wait, let me verify the frequency data so I don't overstate risks. In a large 2-year series of 106 patients, nodule formation occurred in 4.7% with meticulous technique, which aligns with contemporary practice emphasizing dilution and depth. In a randomized split-face trial, bruising with Sculptra was reported at 3.6% in one analysis, correcting a misreported figure of 52.7% elsewhere, which underscores the importance of verifying numbers before citing them. Broader filler literature suggests most adverse events are mild and transient when best practices are followed, though underreporting remains a concern [^3b8a5347] [^a0e8323b] [^b7b40568].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without distinguishing high-consequence complications. Although rare, vascular compromise, necrosis, and blindness have been reported with injectable fillers in general and warrant emergency protocols; PLLA-specific delayed granulomas can present years later and require biopsy to exclude infection or malignancy; these are the scenarios where early recognition and escalation are critical [^3eb7cad9] [^65b3731a] [^abf7d172].

> Next, I should review prevention, because most PLLA complications are preventable with technique. Higher-volume reconstitution, typically 8–12 mL sterile water with or without lidocaine, reduces clumping and nodule risk; immediate use after reconstitution is acceptable in modern protocols; injections should be placed in the subcutaneous plane, avoiding the dermis; fewer vials per session with adequate intervals of at least 6 weeks between treatments allows collagen remodeling; and rigorous 5-minute massage five times daily for 5 days is essential to distribute product and minimize papule formation [^41e9cad8] [^8d5848cc] [^fa5dd392].

> Let me think about patient selection and special populations, because this modifies risk. Patients with thin skin, autoimmune disease, or a history of keloids may have higher complication rates; people with skin of color may require longer intervals between sessions and careful attention to technique to avoid dyspigmentation or scarring; and patients with unrealistic expectations or poor compliance with massage are less suitable candidates [^ecfaa50a] [^0a001156].

> I will now examine management of early complications. For bruising, swelling, and erythema, conservative measures such as cold compresses, arnica, and time are appropriate; for persistent edema beyond 2 weeks, consider a short course of low-dose oral corticosteroids if not contraindicated; for pain control, acetaminophen is preferred, and NSAIDs can be used judiciously if no bleeding risk; importantly, early nodules under 6 weeks often respond to aggressive massage and observation before escalating therapy [^b855c061] [^41e9cad8].

> For late-onset papules and nodules, I should confirm the approach. Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, typically 10–20 mg/mL, is first-line and may require serial injections every 4–6 weeks until flattening; if inflammation is prominent, add 5-fluorouracil to the steroid to target fibroblast activity; for refractory or cosmetically significant lesions, surgical excision is reasonable; throughout, counsel that multiple sessions are often needed and that recurrence is possible [^38f2dad2] [^431f0e92] [^1fdabb12].

> But wait, what if the lesion is a delayed granuloma rather than a simple nodule. I need to ensure we do not miss infection or malignancy: obtain a biopsy with histopathology, culture, and special stains; if a foreign-body granuloma is confirmed, treat with intralesional steroids, consider systemic steroids for widespread disease, and add minocycline or doxycycline for possible biofilm; for recalcitrant cases, surgical excision remains the definitive option, and patients should be warned that granulomas can recur years later [^abf7d172] [^1fdabb12] [^b855c061].

> I should double-check emergency protocols for vascular compromise, even though PLLA is less often implicated than hyaluronic acid fillers. Immediate measures include stopping injection, vigorous massage, warm compresses, nitroglycerin paste, and hyperbaric oxygen when available; for HA fillers, hyaluronidase is standard, but for PLLA, there is no enzymatic reversal, so supportive and vasodilatory strategies are key while arranging urgent specialty input [^3eb7cad9] [^65b3731a].

> Next, I should review counseling and follow-up to set expectations and catch complications early. Patients should be informed that results are gradual and typically require 2–4 sessions spaced 6 weeks apart, with effects lasting up to 2 years; they must commit to massage and report any new nodules or erythema promptly; scheduled check-ins at 6–8 week intervals allow early detection and simpler management of papules before they evolve into granulomas [^b635db76] [^41e9cad8] [^3b8a5347].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is balanced: Sculptra has a favorable safety profile when reconstituted adequately, injected deeply, and massaged diligently, with early adverse effects usually mild and self-limited, while late nodules and rare granulomas are manageable with intralesional therapy and, when necessary, excision; vigilance for delayed presentations and adherence to best practices are the cornerstones of minimizing risk and maximizing outcomes [^b7b40568] [^41e9cad8] [^b855c061].

Sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid) is generally well tolerated, but **nodules and papules** are the most common side effects, typically arising weeks to months after injection and often linked to superficial placement or inadequate massage [^41e9cad8] [^b635db76]. Early, transient effects include bruising, swelling, and erythema [^d049da60]. Rare complications include infection, granulomas, and vascular occlusion [^3eb7cad9] [^65b3731a]. Management is tailored: **massage and observation** for early nodules, **intralesional steroids** for persistent or inflammatory nodules, and surgical excision for refractory cases [^38f2dad2] [^431f0e92]. Prevention relies on **proper reconstitution, deep subcutaneous placement, and rigorous post-injection massage** [^41e9cad8] [^fa5dd392].

## Common side effects and their management

### Early side effects (within days to weeks)

Early effects are usually **transient and self-limited**:

| **Side effect** | **Description** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Bruising | Common at injection sites | - Cold compresses <br/> - Arnica <br/> - Time [^notfound] |
| Swelling | Mild, localized | - Cold compresses <br/> - Head elevation <br/> - Time [^notfound] |
| Erythema | Mild redness at injection sites | - Observation <br/> - Topical corticosteroids if persistent [^notfound] |
| Pain/tenderness | Mild discomfort | - Acetaminophen <br/> - NSAIDs if no contraindications [^notfound] |

---

### Delayed side effects (weeks to months)

Delayed effects are more **clinically significant** and often technique-related:

| **Side effect** | **Description** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Nodules/papules | Small, firm subcutaneous lumps | - Massage <br/> - Observation <br/> - Intralesional steroids (triamcinolone 10–20 mg/mL) <br/> - Surgical excision if refractory [^38f2dad2] [^431f0e92] |
| Granulomas | Rare, immune-mediated foreign-body reactions | - Intralesional steroids <br/> - Surgical excision if refractory [^38f2dad2] [^431f0e92] |
| Infection | Rare bacterial infection | - Antibiotics <br/> - Drainage if abscess [^25097dd9] |
| Vascular occlusion | Extremely rare, vision-threatening | - Immediate hyaluronidase (if HA mixed) <br/> - Warm compresses <br/> - Nitroglycerin paste <br/> - Hyperbaric oxygen <br/> - Emergency ophthalmology [^notfound] |

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing complications centers on **technique and patient education**:

- **Proper reconstitution**: Dilute to 8–12 mL with sterile water; add 1 mL lidocaine for comfort [^41e9cad8] [^8d5848cc].
- **Deep injection**: Place in the subcutaneous plane, avoiding the dermis [^41e9cad8].
- **Post-injection massage**: Firm massage for 5 minutes, five times daily, for 5 days [^41e9cad8].
- **Patient selection**: Avoid patients with keloid history, active infection, or unrealistic expectations [^0a001156].

---

## Long-term safety considerations

Long-term data show sustained benefit with **low complication rates** when best practices are followed; nodules can appear months to years later but are manageable with intralesional steroids or excision [^3b8a5347] [^abf7d172]. No significant systemic toxicity has been reported [^notfound].

---

## Patient counseling and follow-up

Counsel patients on expected swelling/bruising, the importance of massage, and signs of complications; schedule follow-up at 2–4 weeks to assess for nodules and reinforce massage [^41e9cad8].

---

Sculptra's most common side effects are **nodules and papules**, which are preventable with proper technique and treatable with massage or intralesional steroids; rare complications like infection or vascular occlusion require prompt recognition and specific management [^41e9cad8] [^3eb7cad9].

### Sculptra (injectable poly-L-lactic acid) [^b635db76]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

As contemporary antiviral therapy provides patients who have HIV effective long-term management of their disease, the prevalence of facial HIV-associated lipoatrophy is increasing. Sculptra (Dermik Laboratories, Berwyn, Pennsylvania) (injectable poly-L-lactic acid) is US Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of HIV-associated lipoatrophy and has been shown to increase skin thickness for up to 2 years. The number of treatment sessions depends on the volume of deficiency to be treated. As is true for any cosmetic treatment, expectations must be carefully managed, especially considering the frequent need for multiple Sculptra treatments. The few adverse events resulting from poly-L-lactic acid injections consist mainly of subcutaneous nodule formation and local bruising.

### Facial enhancement and the European experience with sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid) [^e7e50728]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The primary reason patients seek aesthetic treatments is to combat the signs of aging. However, the majority of facial treatments and procedures fill specific wrinkles or pull-taught sagging skin, without returning the volume and contours of a youthful face. Injectable poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra) is a synthetic, biodegradable polymer, popular in Europe for the correction of lipoatrophy. The novel technique and mechanism of action of this product require physicians to adjust their practice of treating a specific line to returning volume to a facial area. Sculptra has been used successfully for the correction of nasolabial folds, mid and lower facial volume loss, jaw line laxity, and other signs of facial aging. Sculptra treatment provides a minimally invasive, effective, and prolonged (18–24 months) facial enhancement correction with a low frequency of side effects and no need for allergy testing.

### Injectable poly-L-lactic acid (sculptra): technical considerations in soft-tissue contouring [^41e9cad8]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Poly-L-lactic acid gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in human immunodeficiency virus-related facial lipoatrophy in August of 2004. Since that time, it has become available for use in the United States for human immunodeficiency virus facial lipoatrophy patients and for off-label uses in other areas for soft-tissue contouring. This article is intended to enumerate reconstitution, injection techniques, management, and avoidance of complications.

Methods

The authors have pooled their experiences to arrive at a consensus opinion for recommendations on treatment protocols for injectable poly-L-lactic acid use.

Results

This article prescribes techniques to achieve safer, consistent results while minimizing risks of complications with injectable poly-L-lactic acid. Although the product has been used widely in Europe since 1999, physicians in the United States have only recently begun to explore the uses of Sculptra as a volumizing agent in the face and the body. U.S. physicians have benefited from the European experience with this product, including early problems secondary to overaggressive use, low-volume reconstitution, higher volume injection of product at one session, and inadequate time between injection sessions.

Conclusions

The authors therefore have opted for a more conservative approach in their treatment recommendations. Higher volume dilution (8 to 12 cc), fewer vials used at each session, injections placed in the subcutaneous plane without any product being placed in the dermis, adequate time between injection sessions (at least 6 weeks), and postinjection patient massage should decrease the risks and avoid the potential complications associated with poly-L-lactic acid soft-tissue augmentation.

### The "skinny"on sculptra: a practical primer to volumization with poly-L-lactic acid [^89b0fee8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) is a biostimulatory agent that can correct bony and soft tissue facial deficiencies by producing gradual volume restoration. Proper patient selection and clear expectations are important to treatment success. Correct product preparation, injection technique, and patient follow-up correlates with increased patient safety, outcomes, and satisfaction. Alone, or in combination with other rejuvenative procedures, Sculptra® provides longer-lasting improvement to signs of facial aging.

### Injectable poly-L-lactic acid for body aesthetic treatments: an international consensus on evidence assessment and practical recommendations [^719fbd44]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-facial (body) rejuvenation is a treatment of increasing demand, with patients seeking to harmonize the benefits of rejuvenated facial appearance with other areas of the body. Poly — lactic acid (PLLA)-SCA (Sculptra®) has been approved for facial aesthetic uses since 1999 in Europe and since 2009 in the USA and more recently evaluated for the treatment of cellulite of the buttocks and thighs and other body indications. The current evidence base consists largely of prospective observational analyses and case series although systematic evaluations for a number of body areas are underway. Current data support a potential benefit for the use of PLLA-SCA for the aesthetic treatment of the neck, knees, abdomen, hands and upper arms. Improvements in aesthetic appearance (e.g. sagging, wrinkling, dimpling, cellulite) that are sustained over time with minimal side effects can be achieved. Standardization of injection protocols for different body areas is now needed along with the validation of clinical tools that can be used to agree on treatment goals and to evaluate aesthetic improvements over time. A group of international experts in the fields of facial and body aesthetics, plastic surgery and dermatology were selected based on their educational, scientific and publication merits together with clinical experience using PLLA-SCA for body rejuvenation. Here, we provide an evidence-based and expert-led consensus (14 years of off-face treatment experience) on recommendations for appropriate injection protocols for different body sites and evaluation tools when using the biostimulator PLLA-SCA for body aesthetic and rejuvenation procedures.

### Understanding, avoiding, and managing severe filler complications [^3eb7cad9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Any injectable filler may elicit moderate-to-severe adverse events, ranging from nodules to abscesses to vascular occlusion. Fortunately, severe adverse events are uncommon for the majority of fillers currently on the market. Because these are rare events, it is difficult to identify the relevant risk factors and to design the most efficacious treatment strategies. Poor aesthetic outcomes are far more common than severe adverse events. These in contrast should be easily avoidable by ensuring that colleagues receive proper training and follow best practices.

### Letter to the editor on: "Safety and efficacy of poly-L-lactic acid filler (gana V vs. sculptra) injection for correction of the nasolabial fold: a double-blind, non-inferiority, randomized, split-face controlled trial" [^a0e8323b]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety and Efficacy are corner stones to evaluate a risk–benefit profile of any investigational drug or medical device and of great importance for practitioners and patients. Han et al. report that Gana V and Sculptra have "similar safety profile patterns" and "in terms of local adverse reactions, we found no difference between Gana V and Sculptra". The safety profile of Gana V treatment arm is consistently worse than the safety profile reported for the Sculptra treatment arm with the exception of bruising. Han et al. report approximately ≈19% (18.7%) more injection-related adverse events for Gana V than Sculptra in the article's full analysis set, beside adverse reactions captured in the supplementary material, but treatment arm not disclosed (e.g. one nodule and two skin thickening/induration). The safety profile of the full analysis set also reveals a > twofold higher incidence rate of lumps/bumps and a > fourfold higher incidence rate of induration/firmness-related Gana V injections. Also, note that Han et al. in table 4 list two injection sites bruising related to Sculptra injections converted to 52.7% which is incorrect and the correct percentage is 3.6%.

Overall, Han et al. present a trial design more suggesting an experimental and exploratory study design rather than a non-inferiority trial, describing and reporting on differences between two 1mL poly-L-lactic acids in humans.

Besides the limitations and errors, Han et al. are not reporting on the CI difference for changes from baseline on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) to describe non-inferiority between Gana V and Sculptra. Furthermore, the non-inferiority calculations are based on a test and p-value that is not significant and report on very small changes in WSRS considered as not clinically relevant.

A published work which includes several incorrect and unsupported statements and reporting on a trial design with multiple flaws, limitations and caveats with a non-inferiority calculation not per guidelines, not significant and findings not clinically relevant disqualify the study as a classical non-inferiority trial and from concluding non-inferiority between Gana V and Sculptra PLLA.

### Adverse reactions to dermal fillers: review [^6b6c3bcc]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

For many patients, injectable filling agents offer the promise of facial rejuvenation while offering reduced risks compared with more invasive surgery. With the increase in products available and the rise in the number of patients seeking this type of intervention, it is crucial that both the physician and the patient are fully cognizant of the risks involved with each product.

Objective

To review the incidences and types of reaction to various commonly used injectable products.

Methods

A literature review and personal experiences (gained largely in Europe over the past 8 years) of dermal fillers from 1996 to the present, including illustrative case reviews.

Results

Reactions can be attributed to the procedure itself, the procedural technique, and the agent injected. Some of these reactions are preventable, whereas others are inevitable; most are mild and transient. Improving product formulations, altering the concentration of product injected, or changing the injection technique can dramatically reduce the incidence of adverse reactions. Since its reformulation in mid-1999, the biologically engineered hyaluronic acid filler Restylane (Medicis Pharmaceuticals, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) elicits less than one allergic reaction in 1600 treatments. Skin reactions with poly-L-lactic acid (New-Fill/Sculptra, Dermik Laboratories, Berwyn, PA, USA) are considerably less likely if a greater dilution and deeper injection technique are employed.

Conclusion

Different injectable products have highly divergent properties, associated risks, and injection requirements. The dermasurgeon should be suitably experienced to select and use these products correctly.

### NewFill for skin augmentation: a new filler or failure? [^e67f5fe8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

New injectable materials for skin augmentation that promise to be the ideal filling material are introduced every year. Recently, we treated three patients with adverse reactions to a new substance for skin augmentation: polylactic acid (NewFill, Ashford Aesthetics Inc, Belgium).

Objective

To present three cases in which serious adverse reactions had occurred after skin augmentation with a new filling substance, polylactic acid (NewFill). Because an identical substance (Sculptra, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) was recently introduced in the United States, we want to alert future users of these substances to possible adverse events.

Materials and Methods

We report three cases with serious adverse events more than 12 months after skin augmentation with polylactic acid (NewFill). They were treated with intralesional steroid therapy and topical imiquimod application.

Results

Both intralesional steroid therapy and topical imiquimod application lead to moderate results. If feasible, surgical excision is the best available option.

Conclusions

Great care should be taken when polylactic acid is used for intradermal injection because giant cell granulomatous reactions may be the result. Other than surgical excision, effective treatment options are lacking.

### Potential climate engineering effectiveness and side effects during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario [^37759e28]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The realization that mitigation efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have, until now, been relatively ineffective has led to an increasing interest in climate engineering as a possible means of preventing the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. While many studies have addressed the potential effectiveness of individual methods there have been few attempts to compare them. Here we use an Earth system model to compare the effectiveness and side effects of afforestation, artificial ocean upwelling, ocean iron fertilization, ocean alkalinization and solar radiation management during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario. We find that even when applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, all methods are, individually, either relatively ineffective with limited (< 8%) warming reductions, or they have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change. Our simulations suggest that the potential for these types of climate engineering to make up for failed mitigation may be very limited.

### Dermatologic laser side effects and complications: prevention and management [^082d2532]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The evolution of modern laser and light-based systems has mirrored the demand for clinically effective treatments and the need for safer technologies with reduced postoperative recovery, side effects, and complications. With each new generation of lasers, more selective tissue destruction can be achieved with reduced unwanted sequelae. Patient selection and preparation, operator technique, and expeditious recognition and management of post-treatment side effects are paramount in avoiding complications and patient dissatisfaction. An overview of important variables to consider for dermatologic laser treatments are presented in order to provide a framework to reduce the severity and duration of possible post-treatment side effects and complications.

### Late-onset granuloma formation after poly-L-lactic acid injection [^abf7d172]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Poly — lactic acid (Sculptra, Sanofi Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) is a gel polymer made of poly — lactic acid microspheres and water suspended in a mannitol and carboxymethyl cellulose suspension. This injectable tissue filler has been used for correction of lipoatrophy in HIV patients as well as for cosmetic purposes since its US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2004. The mechanism of action involves induction of a subclinical inflammatory response that stimulates fibroblast proliferation and collagen formation, ultimately leading to a progressive increase in volume of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Late-onset immune-mediated adverse effects associated with the use of poly — lactic acid can appear years after the initial injection with reported range of 6 to 60 months. These effects include inflammatory nodules, papules, and edema. Previous reports of adverse effects associated with poly — lactic acid identify a maximum of 60 months before development of a subcutaneous nodule. These adverse effects can cause significant distress for patients, as the erythema, edema or nodules that can result may cause cosmetic disfigurement and mimic an infectious process, necessitating, at times, extensive workup including biopsy. Here, we present a case of granuloma formation that appeared more than 70 months after treatment, surpassing the previously reported maximum latency of 60 months for poly — lactic acid and long surpassing the 2-year duration that the product is purported to last in the tissues. To our knowledge, this is the longest reported latency period for development of a subcutaneous nodule with foreign body reaction observed with poly — lactic acid. Practitioners should be aware of the extent of adverse events associated with procedural complications to adequately inform their patients, provide the highest standard of care, and maintain awareness of this etiology in their differential diagnosis for patients presenting with facial nodules of unknown etiology, even if poly — lactic acid exposure was several years prior.

### Physician-reported facilitators and barriers for side effect management of heart failure medications [^c427d575]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current approach to managing side effects related to medications is suboptimal. First, we discuss facilitators and barriers to eliciting side effects. Failure to elicit potential side effects puts patients at risk for persistent impairments in quality of life, serious side effects, and unwillingness to take medications, even if it can prevent future health care utilization. Second, we discuss attributing side effects to medications. When side effects are effectively elicited, they may not be easy to attribute to a specific medication. If a side effect is incorrectly attributed to a medication, this can lead to inappropriate discontinuation of an agent that may provide long‐term benefit; and, if a side effect is not attributed to a medication that is causing a side effect, this can lead to inappropriate continuation of that medication. Finally, we discuss taking action after attribution. Clinicians may not be taking action when a side effect is elicited and accurately attributed to a given medication, increasing the risk for short‐ and long‐term harm. While the cardiology community has largely focused on the consequences of omission as it relates to not initiating or uptitrating HF medications, the lack of action when a side effect is present could be just as harmful. Overall, this supports an urgent need to develop and implement improved strategies for eliciting and attributing side effects, and taking action when side effects are effectively elicited and attributed to a specific medication. In our work, framed by the Donabedian model, we reported on physician‐based facilitators and barriers to the process of eliciting and attributing medication side effects, and the subsequent actions when a side effect occurs and is attributed to a specific medication. In addition, we report on physicians' suggestions for addressing ongoing challenges, many of which are structural changes. Findings from our study provide a foundation for such future work, and should be leveraged to develop potential innovative approaches towards the outcome of ultimately improving care for adults with HF.

### Preventing the complications associated with the use of dermal fillers in facial aesthetic procedures: an expert group consensus report [^0a001156]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Aesthetic medical procedures with dermal fillers are becoming increasingly popular. For this reason, aesthetic clinicians must become aware of how to prevent and how to manage any potential complications. The panel agrees that the adequate selection of the patient, technique and filler will help to ensure a desirable outcome. Moreover, to prevent future undesirable outcomes and serious adverse events, it will be important to carefully document the procedure, technique and the filler administered. A diagnostic/treatment code tool may be suitable to achieve this. This consensus highlights key elements that will help clinicians who are just starting to use dermal filler procedures, and it could serve as a basis to standardize the process and to establish how to prevent potential complications of this treatment.

### Facial filler complications [^65b3731a]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The use of facial fillers has greatly expanded over the past several years. Along with increased use comes a rise in documented complications, ranging from poor cosmetic result to nodules, granulomas, necrosis, and blindness. Awareness of the potential types of complications and options for management, in addition to the underlying facial anatomy, are imperative to delivering the best patient care. This article defines the complications and how to treat them and provides suggestions to avoid serious adverse outcomes.

### Side effects of anti-TNF therapy: current knowledge [^1157a14d]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

The development of the anti-TNF therapies is a milestone in the therapy of rheumatic diseases. As in all new treatment opportunities it is of concern whether all potential undesired side effects have been evaluated within the clinical trials which have lead to approval of the drugs. Postmarketing experience and pharmacovigilance programs are necessary to determine the overall safety profile of the new agents. From the clinical trials and the practical experience of the first years we know that side effects have occurred in patients treated with anti-TNF agents. Sufficient knowledge about these partly specific side effects is critical for rheumatologists who treat their patients with these very effective biologic drugs.

### Complications from toxins and fillers in the dermatology clinic: recognition, prevention, and treatment [^2c14e404]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions and unintended effects can occasionally occur with toxins for cosmetic use, even although they generally have an outstanding safety profile. As the use of fillers becomes increasingly more common, adverse events can be expected to increase as well. This article discusses complication avoidance, addressing appropriate training and proper injection techniques, along with patient selection and patient considerations. In addition to complications, avoidance or amelioration of common adverse events is discussed.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^cbd5739f]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

The vast majority of patients, even those destined for a successful attempt at TFR, will take TKI for many years. With more TKI available and improved knowledge regarding potential side effects, much of patient management is focused on preventing and/or minimizing the toxicities and optimizing quality of life.

Adverse events, as opposed to direct drug toxicity, may also occur as a result of pre-existing co-morbidities, interactions with other medications, or simply a result of the aging process. It is beyond the scope of this publication to describe in detail all known side-effects of the individual TKI (Table 8) and the potential impact of other disease processes and their treatment. Members of this panel have contributed to extensive reviews of these issues, together with recommendations for baseline and periodic monitoring of co-morbidities and we will not attempt to repeat their advice.

### Complications in the cosmetic dermatology patient: a review and our experience (part 2) [^4c735514]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Over recent decades, the options available to patients for cosmetic rejuvenation have expanded dramatically. The range of options commonly available to patients now includes neuromodulators, fillers, sclerotherapy, chemical peels, lasers, lights and other energy devices, and liposculpture and continues to grow. Like all therapeutic interventions, these cosmetic dermatologic procedures are not without risk. Timely recognition of complications and intervention are paramount for optimal patient outcomes.

Objective

Part 1 of this review focused on the common complications that may result from injectable cosmetic procedures. The second part will discuss the complications of chemical peels, lasers, light and energy devices, and fat removal/sculpture procedures.

Materials and Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed on cosmetic dermatology complications from 1989 to 2015, and results are summarized. Practical considerations of these complications are also provided.

Results

Reports of complications after neuromodulator, injectable hyaluronic acid, calcium hydroxylapatite, poly-L-lactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, sclerotherapy, fat transfer, liposuction, cryolipolysis, chemical peels, lasers, and light sources, such as Q-switched laser, intense pulsed light, and nonablative and ablative resurfacing lasers, were found.

Conclusion

Review of the literature revealed multiple management options for potential complications of the multitude of cosmetic dermatology procedures now available to patients.

### Reducing the burden of side effects during long-term antipsychotic therapy: the role of "switching" medications [^fa16ae16]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

One of the great challenges of long-term treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders is minimizing the medical or psychological burden from persistent side effects. Because of the differences in side effect profiles between the newer and older antipsychotic medications, and distinct differences among the newer agents themselves, the spectrum of side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy has changed tremendously. The authors review changing from one antipsychotic to another ("switching") as a potential treatment strategy for reducing the overall side effect burden of antipsychotic therapy. This review identifies 6 steps to the evaluation of switching antipsychotics because of side effects: (1) Establish a causal attribution that the clinical problem is an adverse effect of the antipsychotic medication; (2) Understand the course of the side effect, especially regarding present and future risks for the individual patient receiving the antipsychotic treatment; (3) Understand the potential risks and benefits of other side effect interventions that do not require switching the antipsychotic; (4) Be aware of the side effect profiles of other possible antipsychotics, with an understanding of the potential effectiveness of changing (switching) to another antipsychotic for this side effect; (5) Calculate the side effect risks of switching antipsychotics; (6) Calculate the efficacy risks of switching antipsychotics. The authors explain how to evaluate the specific side effect in the context of the current medication and the overall management of the patient.

### Considerations for the use of injectable poly-L-lactic acid in people of color [^ecfaa50a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

With demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures rising in patients of color, it is becoming increasingly important for clinical dermatologists to be aware of specific needs of these patients. This article therefore reviews considerations for using cosmetic procedures on skin of color, and reports the authors' clinical experience with the use of injectable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA, Sculptra, Dermik Laboratories, a business of sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC) in this patient population. The authors' experience indicates that patients with skin of color may require an increased interval between treatments; however, with proper attention to patient selection and administration technique, injectable PLLA can be used effectively in this patient group. Controlled clinical studies that include more patients of color are needed to fully assess the benefits and risks of cosmetic products, such as injectable PLLA, in these populations.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^ec7df3ff]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Because of their efficacy and safety, esthetic procedures with dermal fillers have become increasingly popular. However, although the incidence of complications is relatively low and the majority of adverse events are mild, the increase in the number of procedures has been accompanied by a concurrent increase in the number of complications. As optimal complication management remains an unmet need in the field of esthetic medicine, minimizing their incidence by means of appropriate patient, product, and injection technique selection, as well as a sound understanding of facial anatomy, is probably the best approach.

Clinicians should be fully aware of the signs and symptoms related to complications and be prepared to confidently treat them. Establishing action protocols for emergencies, with agents readily available in the office, would reduce the severity of adverse outcomes associated with injection of hyaluronic acid fillers in the cosmetic setting.

It is our hope that this article will help clinicians, who are just starting to use dermal filler procedures, to effectively manage their potential complications.

### Managing severe pain and abuse potential: the potential impact of a new abuse-deterrent formulation oxycodone / naltrexone extended-release product [^60e7142f]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Opioids should be started at a low dose under close supervision; not all patients tolerate them well. Pain should be evaluated and discussed frequently, as not all patients find effective pain control with opioids. In some cases, pain control may improve with changes in dose or opioid rotation, but in other cases, patients may decide that opioids are not effective. It should be noted that opioids are not necessarily appropriate for all pain syndromes, including the severe pain associated with migraine and fibromyalgia.

Before starting opioid therapy, universal precautions should be exercised, so that the patients at risk for potential opioid misuse and abuse can be identified. Clinicians should talk frankly with their patients about the nature of opioid therapy. A variety of validated screening tools exist to assess opioid abuse risk in individual patients.–The most prominent risk factor for opioid abuse is a history of active substance abuse, but there are multiple risk factors. In fact, long-term opioid therapy itself may be a risk for abuse. For patients at risk of opioid abuse, ADF formulations can be an important option.

Opioids should be considered only when their potential analgesic benefits outweigh their associate side effects. Opioid-associated side effects are well documented in the literature and can be treatment limiting. Many AEs can be managed, which is important because side effects can increase discomfort in patients already at great distress due to pain.

### Complications of injectable fillers and neurotoxins [^d049da60]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

All cosmetic injectable products are associated with the risk of both early and delayed complications. Early and expected side effects include swelling, bruising, and erythema at the injection. It is of utmost importance that patients are educated on the treatment they are consenting to receive and the potential risk of these therapies. Side effects of the various cosmetic injectable products, including both injectable neurotoxins and soft tissue fillers, are often technique associated, such as placing the filler too superficial or unintentional paralysis of facial muscles. Other complications, such as necrosis, intravascular injections, and infection may not be entirely technique-dependent, and must be managed swiftly and effectively. Finally, immunologic phenomena, such as delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and foreign body granulomas, are complications that have no relationship to technique, and thus proper counseling and knowledge of management is required.

### Side effects of perioperative intravesical treatment and treatment strategies for these side effects [^769f10a3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Perioperative intravesical chemotherapy has a well-established role in the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. There are multiple agents that can be used in this fashion with varying properties. Although chemical cystitis is the most common side effect and is usually self-limiting, significant toxicity can occur with intravesical chemotherapy. It is imperative that the urologist is aware of the acute and delayed side effects of intravesical chemotherapy and how to manage potential complications. Both local and systemic toxicities are discussed, as well as strategies to minimize and manage them.

### Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease [^4a16b0b3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Side effects of DBS

DBS in any brain target is not without risk of inducing side effects. These are partly different for different brain targets, and are due to diffusion of the electric current beyond the area aimed at, especially in cases where the electrodes are not perfectly placed. Table 1 provides a summary of effects and potential side effects according to the brain target. Also, most stimulation‐induced side effects can be partly reversible and managed by alteration of the stimulation strength, including its amplitude, pulse width, frequency and/or polarity. A common potential side effect to bilateral DBS to any brain target, albeit to different degrees, is stimulation‐induced dysarthria. In VIM thalamic DBS, especially when bilateral, there is a risk for dysarthria and disturbance of balance, mainly due to diffusion of the current to the adjacent motor internal capsule. In GPi DBS, dysarthria may also worsen but less than with bilateral VIM DBS. In the STN, asides from the risk for dysarthria, there is potential risk for eyelid opening dyspraxia (that can be treated with botulium toxin injections), as well as risk for behavioural disturbances if the electrode is too ventral–anterior–medial because that area of the STN is connected to limbic cortical structures. Additionally, if doses of dopaminergic medications, especially dopamine agonists are not decreased after surgery, STN DBS will potentiate their effect, leading to increased impulsivity and mania. On the other hand, if dopa medication is decreased too much because STN DBS per se can provide a very good motor improvement for the patient, patients will suffer from apathy and even depression, leading, rarely, to suicide. All this explains why this most potent surgical procedure, that is, STN DBS, needs expert management by a movement disorders neurologist who is specialised in the management of PD. This also explains why GPi DBS, although not as efficient on motor symptoms as STN DBS, is considered more lenient for older patients and preferred by some clinicians even for younger patients, because it is less laborious, less time demanding and easier to manage than STN DBS and, in GPi DBS, doses of medications do not need to be adjusted. However, if patients with advanced PD suffer from relevant dopaminergic medication‐induced impulse control disorders, then it may be wise to avoid GPi DBS and offer STN DBS, because it is only the latter that would allow a decrease in doses of dopaminergic medication, contributing thus to treat the medication‐induced impulse‐control disorder. Tables 1 and 2 provide a summary of indications, potential side effects and symptomatic impact profile of the three established brain targets for DBS procedures, based on the present authors' own 30‐year‐long experience of DBS for PD, and based on the literature.

### Efficacy and safety of tapencarium (RZL-012) in submental fat reduction [^76f7d2d2]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This clinical trial met both primary and secondary endpoints, and results demonstrated the robust, significant, dose-related efficacy of RZL-012 as a minimally invasive treatment to reduce subdermal fat after a single dosing session. No serious AEs were associated with either of the 2 tested doses. Based on available safety and efficacy data, RZL-012 may provide a safe and effective nonsurgical alternative, dosed in a single treatment session, for focal fat reduction and sculpting of the chin and jawline. Phase 3 clinical trials are under way to further characterize the mechanism of action and provide longer follow-up.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: international expert consensus [^aeb50740]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While there is increasing appreciation of the widespread nature of skin toxicities with anticancer treatment, many persons involved in cancer care relegate discussions about dermatologic adverse events to a secondary priority. In addition to often being a visible reminder of cancer, skin toxicities can also cause significant emotional and physical discomfort. Treatment interruptions occur in as many as 50% of cancer treated patients — depending on the type of treatment and the severity of the side effect. In many areas, access to dermatologists can be difficult in a timely fashion. Yet the advances in cancer treatments mean that there will be an expanding population of cancer patients with skin toxicities. Dermatologists have a vital role in working with the cancer care team on how to manage skin toxicities with a goal of optimizing outcomes. Creation of proactive and preemptive strategies to mitigate skin toxicities can be an effective way to minimize the likelihood and severity of skin problems for cancer patients. Daily skin care routines should be used for prevention and treatment. They should be discussed with the patient, to help them avoid skin-care products that could exacerbate problems. Active cosmetics can be used to manage skin toxicities of different types; these products have good efficacy but better tolerance and may allow use of alternative treatments or dosages. Severity of a skin toxicity should be assessed by checking for lesions affecting 10% or more skin surface area, fever, pain, involvement of the mucosa, and blood abnormalities. A photographic glossary with key features identifying specific skin toxicities may help support prompt and effective management.

### Monitoring the effects and managing the side effects of anticoagulation during pregnancy [^320b33c1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

LMWHs are the major anticoagulant/antithrombotic treatment given to pregnant women to prevent and treat venous thromboembolism despite the absence of specific clinical trials. An emerging indication, the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes, is under investigation. During pregnancy, LMWHs seem to be safe and efficient. Some uncertainties remain about the management of rare potential side effects, particularly in the event of heparin intolerance and with cross-reactivity to danaparoid sodium.

### Self-reported medication side effects in an older cohort living independently in the community – the melbourne longitudinal study on healthy ageing (MELSHA): cross-sectional analysis of prevalence and risk factors [^3fd8f490]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Greater awareness and knowledge of health professionals including doctors and pharmacists as well as patients is also important. Further education during medical training and scaffolding in the workplace may support doctors in developing safe rational prescribing practices that minimize medication side effects. Specific education strategies for health professionals in particular doctors and pharmacists may include integration into undergraduate curriculae as well as post graduate/professional ongoing continuing medical education programs; supportive systems such as provision of information through professional colleges, support software, and emphasis on continuity of care over fragmentation; and quality control through participation in audits. In particular areas needing highlighting include the need for increased awareness and follow up and review in relation to the timing of medication side effects such as when introducing new medications and in particular for newly licensed medications as well as over the counter medications; similarly with the cessation and changing of medications; increased awareness of the range of presentations of medication side effects and the need to consider as a differential diagnosis; importance of participation in national surveillance and reporting systems for adverse drug reactions to increase the shared information available and the ability to detect a signal earlier. Improved health education of patients may enable early recognition and prevention of potential medication side effects.

Communication between health professionals including between GPs and specialist as well as pharmacists and other health professionals and with patients may facilitate management as well as surveillance and detection. Given the pivotal role of treating doctors and pharmacists in providing patient education and monitoring/surveillance of medication side effects, factors such as continuity or systems for information sharing may facilitate this role for doctors and pharmacists as well as other health professionals. As suggested by the NPS e-health may be one way in which such communication and information sharing may occur.

Finally in recognising and better managing medication side effects, it is important that medication side effects are not simply attributed to increased age. This requires increased awareness and consideration of other potential risk factors in older people, to better prevent and manage medication side effects. Prevention may require greater use of strategies by patients and health professionals to address potential sensory, physical and cognitive deficits with aging that may be associated with compliance problems: ongoing supervision and use of dosette boxes; regular medication reviews; provision of readily understood written instructions on medications including how to take and potential side effects in large readily read print; establishment of hotlines for patients to obtain additional information this would offer the potential to provide for those with hearing or language difficulties.

### The basic science of dermal fillers: past and present part II: adverse effects [^57f6d31d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The ideal dermal filler should offer long-lasting aesthetic improvement with a minimal side-effect profile. It should be biocompatible and stable within the injection site, with the risk of only transient undesirable effects from injection alone. However, all dermal fillers can induce serious and potentially long-lasting adverse effects. In Part II of this paper, we review the most common adverse effects related to dermal filler use.

### Age-related differences in recall of information and handling of chemotherapy-related side effects in cancer patients: the reCap study [^6230fd34]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional survey investigating satisfaction with and recall of information and ability to handle side effects, we found age and age-related factors negatively associated with the recall of information of some side effects and management of potential adverse events. Furthermore, we found significant differences between patients with PC, PRC, and CRC in median age, PS, comorbidity, and frailty, all of which were expected to have a possible impact on outcomes. Therefore, analyses were performed with and without adjustments for cancer diagnosis. Patients with PRC were older, had higher comorbidity, all were treated with palliative chemotherapy, their cognitive screening scores were slightly better, and they were more satisfied and had a more positive evaluation of given information than the other patients.

Recall of Information and Handling of Side Effects

In the present study, hypothetic scenarios were created to evaluate the most important questions: can we as health care professionals deliver information enabling patients to recall information and manage potential side effects at home (or after discharge)? And can we identify patients for whom the current type of information (oral and written) should be improved?

More than a third of all patients failed to handle scenarios with potential side effects adequately. Older patients and patients with poor cognitive function were more likely to handle potential side effects incorrectly than younger patients and patients with higher cognitive scores.

In agreement with prior studies, poor recall of information about some of the side effects was found to be associated with higher age. Jansen et alinvestigated recall of information among newly referred cancer patients compared with actual communication from audio-recordings and found that recall of information decreased with age and information load. Their findings suggest an adverse effect of cognitive overload among older patients with cancer, which is also in line with the results of Lehmann et al who found that patients who prefer limited information recall even less if provided with extensive information.

### Understanding, avoiding, and managing dermal filler complications [^25097dd9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND Dermal fillers are increasingly being utilized for multiple cosmetic dermatology indications. The appeal of these products can be partly attributed to their strong safety profiles. Nevertheless, complications can sometimes occur. OBJECTIVE To summarize the complications associated with each available dermal filling agent, strategies to avoid them, and management options if they do arise. METHODS AND MATERIALS Complications with dermal fillers reported in peer-reviewed publications, prescribing information, and recent presentations at professional meetings were reviewed. Recommendations for avoiding and managing complications are provided, based on the literature review and the author's experience. RESULTS Inappropriate placement or superficial placement is one of the most frequent reasons for patient dissatisfaction. Due to the reversibility of hyaluronic acid, complications from these fillers can be easily corrected. Sensitivity to any of the currently approved FDA products is quite rare and can usually be managed with anti-inflammatory agents. Infection is quite uncommon as well and can usually be managed with either antibiotics or antivirals depending on the clinical features. The most concerning complication is cutaneous necrosis, and a protocol to treat the full spectrum of this process is reviewed. CONCLUSIONS Complications with dermal fillers are infrequent, and strategies to minimize their incidence and impact are easily deployed. Familiarity with each family of soft-tissue augmentation products, potential complications, and their management will optimize the use of these agents.

### Midface projection using biostimulatory poly-L-lactic acid injectable implant: a subgroup analysis of the cheek wrinkle trial [^2860871f]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blinded, no-treatment controlled study to assess the effectiveness and safety of treatment with PLLA-SCA for correction of cheek wrinkles (NCT04124692). Across 13 sites in the United States, adults over 21 years of age seeking correction of cheek wrinkles and with an at-rest GCWS score of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) on each side of the face were randomized (2:1) to either treatment with PLLA-SCA (Sculptra) or no treatment (control group).

Eligible subjects underwent a screening and a baseline visit (these visits could be combined, if appropriate). All subjects randomized to receive treatment were injected by the Treating Investigator on Day 1. Subjects received PLLA-SCA injections in both cheeks during the treatment session or were left untreated as controls (Figure 1). A sufficient amount of PLLA-SCA, as determined by the Treating Investigator, was injected to achieve optimal correction, which was defined as ≥ 1-grade improvement on the at-rest GCWS and best correction that could have been achieved as agreed by the Treating Investigator and the subject. If needed, 3 additional treatment sessions, each 1 month apart, could be performed to achieve optimal correction, as determined by the Treating Investigator and subject (Figure 1). Treatment stopped when optimal correction was achieved, and subsequent visits became follow-up visits. All subjects in both the treatment and control groups returned to the clinic at Months 7, 9, and 12. Effectiveness and safety data were collected for up to 12 months after the first treatment.

Figure 1.
Treatment and visit schedule. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive PLLA-SCA or no treatment (control). A maximum of 9 mL of PLLA-SCA was administered by subdermal injection in each cheek on Day 1. Up to 3 additional treatments were allowed at monthly intervals until Month 3. Follow-up visits were conducted at Months 7, 9, and 12. PLLA-SCA, poly — lactic acid-Sculptra.

### A randomized study on PLLA using higher dilution volume and immediate use following reconstitution [^8d5848cc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The reconstitution volume of a PLLA-containing injectable device has gradually increased in clinical practice, often in combination with adding lidocaine to the solution.

Objective

This study, SCRIPT (Sculptra Contemporary Reconstitution & Injection Procedure Trial) evaluated PLLA for correction of nasolabial folds after changes in reconstitution and injection procedures. Primary endpoint for effectiveness was change from baseline of nasolabial folds, assessed by blinded evaluation using a validated wrinkle assessment scale (WAS), at week 48.

Methods

Subjects were treated to optimal correction of nasolabial folds at a single treatment regimen consisting of ≤ 4 injection sessions, with PLLA reconstituted with 8 mL or 5 mL sterile water for injection (SWFI), randomized 2:1. The 8 mL product included an additional 1 mL 2%-lidocaine and was injected immediately following reconstitution. Assessments included wrinkle severity, aesthetic improvement and safety.

Results

A total of 80 subjects were included in the study. Most subjects were female (95%), mean age was 51.5 years. Primary endpoint was met and subjects from both study groups demonstrated high WAS responder rates (≥ 1-grade improvement from baseline) at week 24 (≥ 75%) and week 48 (≥ 67%). Aesthetic improvement was high (≥ 86%) throughout the study. Adverse events related to study product or injection procedure were mostly mild and transient.

Conclusion

PLLA reconstituted with 8 mL SWFI demonstrated a comparable treatment effect to that of the reference group in reducing wrinkle severity of nasolabial folds. Safety was not compromised using a higher reconstitution volume including lidocaine, injected immediately after reconstitution.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^dd1b69c5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — recommendations for acne vulgaris: Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne, and oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress. Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects; intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended. Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended, whereas routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended. All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program, and females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms. Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin.

The use of neuromodulators for therapeutic and cosmetic indications has proven to be remarkably safe. While aesthetic and functional adverse events are uncommon, each anatomic region has its own set of risks of which the physician and patient must be aware before treatment. The therapeutic usages of botulinum toxins now include multiple specialties and multiple indications. New aesthetic indications have also developed, and there has been an increased utilization of combination therapies to combat the effects of global aging. In the second article in this continuing medical education series, we review the prevention and treatment of adverse events, therapeutic and novel aesthetic indications, controversies, and a brief overview of combination therapies.

### Adverse effects of fillers [^b7b40568]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Filler injections belong to the most frequently performed noninvasive beautifying procedures. When done correctly they are generally well tolerated. However, a number of factors, such as poor filler quality, and particularly host as well as user dependent filler reactions may lead to unwanted effects. These may be early, late, or delayed events with characteristics for each of them. Temporary fillers almost invariably cause temporary side effects whereas those of permanent fillers may last forever. Some fillers are notorious for their poor safety profile; for example, silicone is banned in the European Union and the United States but nevertheless used by many practitioners and beauticians. Many fillers can be identified in histopathologic sections allowing specific measures to be instituted.

Adapalene prescribing information — topical treatment of acne vulgaris is indicated in patients ≥ 12 years of age. Apply a thin film of adapalene to the entire face and any other affected areas of the skin once daily in the evening, after washing gently with a nonmedicated soap. Should not be administered to individuals who are hypersensitive to adapalene or any of the components in the vehicle. Clinical studies show that 16% of patients applying 0.1% topical adapalene and 21% of patients applying 0.3% topical adapalene had successful treatments after 12 weeks (using Investigator's Global Assessment). Reported adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, dry skin, burning/stinging, skin discomfort, pruritus, desquamation, sunburn, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, face/eyelid edema, lip swelling, and angioedema. Has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients; concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products should be approached with caution, and use with caution is advised especially when using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use, and weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; it is not known whether adapalene is excreted in human milk, and safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients < 12 years of age.

### Treated well but feeling poorly: examining supportive care devices in oncology practice [^634c4d37]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

As the array of cancer therapeutics has increased, so too has the range of potential adverse effects from treatment. Although symptoms vary greatly among different types of cancers and treatment regimens, most patients undergoing systemic therapy experience some form of acute or chronic side effects. Supportive care is a growing field that addresses these side effects. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) defines supportive care to include prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. Multimodal management should incorporate resources such as supportive devices, procedures, or services. In this article, we discuss the role of supportive care devices in oncologic care, barriers to appropriate uptake and evidence generation for these devices, and potential solutions that may help structure future improvements. We begin with a focus on supportive care device-related developments that target treatment side effects.

### Avoiding and treating dermal filler complications [^38f2dad2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

All fillers are associated with the risk of both early and late complications. Early side effects such as swelling, redness, and bruising occur after intradermal or subdermal injections. The patient has to be aware of and accept these risks. Adverse events that last longer than 2 weeks can be attributable to technical shortcomings (e.g., too superficial an implantation of a long-lasting filler substance). Such adverse events can be treated with intradermal 5-fluorouracil, steroid injections, vascular lasers, or intense pulsed light, and later with dermabrasion or shaving. Late adverse events also include immunologic phenomena such as late-onset allergy and nonallergic foreign body granuloma. Both react well to intralesional steroid injections, which often have to be repeated to establish the right dose. Surgical excisions shall remain the last option and are indicated for hard lumps in the lips and visible hard nodules or hard granuloma in the subcutaneous fat.

### Nonsurgical rejuvenation of the aging face with injectable poly-L-lactic acid for restoration of soft tissue volume [^3b8a5347]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Characteristics of the aging face include soft tissue atrophy, loss of skin elasticity resulting in excess facial skin, and gravitational descent or ptosis of facial soft tissues. Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) is a synthetic biodegradable polymer that provides soft tissue augmentation through stimulation of an inflammatory tissue response with subsequent collagen deposition.

Objective

The authors discuss the special considerations inherent in facial aging, describe the mechanism of action and indications for a new PLLA filler under consideration for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Sculptra Aesthetic, sanofi-aventis US, Bridgewater, New Jersey), and detail the results of a two-year off-label pilot study with the product.

Methods

The senior author (LAC) treated 106 patients with PLLA in an off-label indication, as part of a pilot study while Sculptra Aesthetic was being evaluated for FDA approval for cosmetic indications. All patients were followed up for two years to help develop a protocol for injection technique.

Results

The age range of patients in this series was 40 to 78 years. Three patients were male and 103 were female. Patients received an average injection of 1.6 vials per session, over an average of 2.3 sessions, to achieve volume restoration in the tear trough, midface, malar region, nasolabial folds, prejowl area, mandibular border, and mandibular angle. The authors we achieved 100% follow-up with 99.1% patient satisfaction. The rate of nodule formation was 4.7% at a minimum follow-up of two years.

Conclusions

Because of its unique mechanism of action, PLLA for nonsurgical facial rejuvenation requires meticulous injection technique with special considerations for optimizing outcomes and minimizing adverse events.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^eab968fe]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dermal fillers have been injected with increasing frequency over the past three decades for soft tissue augmentation by volume expansion in the management of the aging face. Over the past several years, the number of procedures involving soft tissue fillers has increased from 1.6 million per year in 2011 to more than 2.4 million in 2015.

The growing use of dermal fillers, specifically the use of hyaluronic acid (HA), can be explained by their effectiveness and versatility as well as their favorable safety profiles.

Although the incidence of complications is low and the majority of adverse events are mild, the increase in the number of procedures has produced the concurrent increase in the number of complications. Among these, serious occurrences are fortunately rare, although probably underreported.

It is noteworthy that proper selection and placement of product can help avoid some complications.

The classification of filler complications can be divided according to severity (mild, moderate, or severe); nature (ischemic complications and non-ischemic); or by the time of the onset (early or late). A classical classification proposed by Rohrich et al. suggested that complications should be classified as early, late, and delayed, roughly defined as less than 14, 14 days to 1 year, and more than 1 year, respectively, as these time frames correlate well with the potential underlying etiology. Although the panel proposes to classify filler complications as immediate onset (up to 24 h after procedure); early onset (24 h to 4 weeks); and delayed onset (more than 4 weeks), to facilitate the understanding and follow-up of the manuscript, the immediate- and the early-onset complications have been listed together.

Although different papers about the management of dermal filler complications have emerged in the last years, optimal complication management remains an unmet need in the field of esthetic medicine.

This paper aims to describe potential adverse events associated with dermal fillers and to provide guidance on their treatment and avoidance.

### Improving modulator management and side effect screening: a CF learning network innovation lab [^f6ea13f0]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite eligibility of over 90% of people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) for CFTR modulators, 12% of eligible PwCF are not prescribed these therapies. The CF Foundation CF Learning Network (CFLN) convened a quality improvement (QI) innovation lab (iLab) to investigate gaps in modulator use and identify best practices for modulator initiation, management, and side effect screening.

Methods

Thirty-one CF centers used the Model for Improvement to adapt interventions to local context by Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles and approach aims in two phases: (1) increase documented elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or ivacaftor (ETI/I) use or co-produced deferral by 4% by 5/2023 and (2) increase side effect screening rates for PwCF taking ETI to 80% by 8/2024. Interventions included processes to track eligibility and facilitate safety assessments and tools like screener forms. Centers submitted weekly measures. We used control charts and run charts to analyze progress.

Results

Of 4649 PwCF evaluated from 12/2022 to 5/2023, 98.5% on average had documentation of either ETI/I use (89.3%) or deferral (9.2%). The most common reason for deferral was previous side effects (39.0%). Across 3236 visits from 3/2024 to 8/2024, ETI side effect screening rates improved, with the centerline shifting from 67.1% to 80.8%. Potential side effects were identified in 24.5% of screenings, most commonly mood changes, inattention/brain fog, and weight gain.

Conclusions

Application of QI methods resulted in processes and tools for enhancing modulator management and improving side effect screening across multiple CFLN centers. Potential side effects, including those not listed in the prescribing information, were commonly reported, highlighting the importance of side effect screening and management by care teams. Interventions can be reproduced by other centers and applied to novel CF therapies.

### Naturalistic psychedelic therapy: the role of relaxation and subjective drug effects in antidepressant response [^d0898ab2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects on patients

A summary table of potentially treatment-related side effects in the patient group is shown in Table 2, and side effects for each treatment session are shown in. Most (93.5%) patients experienced at least one side effect on the scale, the most common being mild headache (32.3% of patients), fatigue (29%), and nausea (29%). The frequency of side effects in the patient sample was similar to those previously reported in healthy subjects using the List of Complaints. Headaches and trouble sleeping were treated with over-the-counter medication as needed. Most side effects on the scale were reported to be unpleasant, with a few exceptions, and most patients stated that their side effects did not substantially impact them after the treatment. In all but one case, described below, side effects resolved within 48 h of treatment.

Table 2.
Frequency and duration of potentially treatment-related adverse effects after psychedelic therapy. Patients were asked whether they had experienced each symptom on the Swiss Psychedelic Side Effects Inventory, as well as how long it lasted, how positive or negative it felt, whether it had a positive or negative impact on their lives, and whether it seemed related to treatment. Ratings of valence and impact were done using a 5-point Likert scale. Data for valence and impact are shown as mean (SD).

One patient experienced an unusually high number of psychological adverse effects in the first week after his second treatment with 15 mg psilocybin for OCD. The acute experience was challenging, and the patient endorsed relatively high levels of negative drug effects. After the psilocybin effects had dissipated, he reported experiencing anxiety, derealization, non-psychotic hallucinations, and cognitive problems that were likely related to treatment. He also reported passive suicidal thoughts. The patient was treated with intensive outpatient psychotherapy by the treating psychiatrist (GH) with the involvement of the referring physician. All psilocybin-related adverse effects were completely resolved after 6 days, and no changes in medication were necessary. After symptom resolution, the patient continued regular psychotherapy with the treating psychiatrist and without psychedelics, stating that the psychotherapy as a whole had been helpful, though not necessarily because of psilocybin. As of this writing 18 months post-PAT, no long-term adverse effects from the psilocybin episode have manifested.

### Treatment of facial asymmetry with poly-L-lactic acid: a case study [^0ad181f9]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) (Sculptra, Dermik Laboratories, Bridgewater, NJ, a business of sanofi-aventis US, LLC) is a novel biocompatible and biodegradable injectable device currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration for a cosmetic indication. When implanted into soft tissues, PLLA is thought to elicit a foreign body reaction, resulting in fibroplasia and subsequent collagen formation. This process leads to a gradual thickening of the dermis and long-lasting augmentation of facial contours. In the reported case, PLLA was used to treat a 69-year-old African-American woman who had undergone numerous unsuccessful procedures for correction of prominent facial asymmetry. One vial of PLLA (5-ml dilution) was injected into the dermal-subcutaneous plane using a lattice distribution in the right upper cheek and malar regions, followed by massage. The procedure was repeated 6 weeks later. Several months after the two separate PLLA treatment sessions, the contours of the right upper cheek and malar regions were visibly and cumulatively enhanced, and facial symmetry was gradually restored, to the patient's full satisfaction. The treatment was well tolerated on both occasions, and the benefits of treatment have been sustained 18 months after the last procedure. The author concludes that injectable PLLA is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for facial contour defects.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^b855c061]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dermal fillers have been increasingly used in minimally invasive facial esthetic procedures. This widespread use has led to a rise in reports of associated complications. The aim of this expert consensus report is to describe potential adverse events associated with dermal fillers and to provide guidance on their treatment and avoidance.

Methods

A multidisciplinary group of experts in esthetic treatments convened to discuss the management of the complications associated with dermal fillers use. A search was performed for English, French, and Spanish language articles in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar using the search terms "complications" OR "soft filler complications" OR "injectable complications" AND "dermal fillers" AND "Therapy". An initial document was drafted by the Coordinating Committee, and it was reviewed and modified by the experts, until a final text was agreed upon and validated.

Results

The panel addressed consensus recommendations about the classification of filler complications according to the time of onset and about the clinical management of different complications including bruising, swelling, edema, infections, lumps and bumps, skin discoloration, and biofilm formation. Special attention was paid to vascular compromise and retinal artery occlusion.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be fully aware of the signs and symptoms related to complications and be prepared to confidently treat them. Establishing action protocols for emergencies, with agents readily available in the office, would reduce the severity of adverse outcomes associated with injection of hyaluronic acid fillers in the cosmetic setting. This document seeks to lay down a set of recommendations and to identify key issues that may be useful for clinicians who are starting to use dermal fillers. Additionally, this document provides a better understanding about the diagnoses and management of complications if they do occur.

### Spectrum and prevalence of side effects and complications with guideline-directed therapies for congenital long QT syndrome [^d971ca04]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

β-Blockers (BBs), sodium channel blockers (SCBs), left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are used to prevent or counter long QT syndrome (LQTS)-triggered syncope, seizures, and sudden cardiac death. The spectrum and extent of side effects/complications associated with these guideline-directed therapies (GDTs) remain unknown.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify the types/prevalence of treatment-associated side effects/complications for patients with the most common LQTS subtypes after GDT.

Methods

Retrospective analysis was performed on 1310 patients with type 1, 2, or 3 LQTS evaluated in Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic (average age at the time of diagnosis 22 ± 18 years; average length of follow-up 5 ± 5 years) and treated with ≥ 1 of the common GDTs for LQTS.

Results

BBs were used in 1102 (84%), SCBs in 104 (8%), LCSD in 197 (15%), and an ICD was used in 251 (19%) patients. Overall, 727 (55%) patients reported at least 1 treatment-associated side effect/complication. A total of 490 of 1102 patients treated with BBs (44%) reported side effects, with fatigue (381 [35%]) being the most common; 28 of 104 SCB-treated patients (27%) reported side effects, most common being gastrointestinal distress/vomiting (18 [17%]); 80 of 197 patients (41%) reported side effects after LCSD, most reporting neuropathic pain (57 [29%]); and 129 of 251 patients (51%) experienced ≥ 1 complication after ICD implantation, including inappropriate shocks (46 [18%]).

Conclusion

Although LQTS-triggered sudden cardiac death is uncommon in the properly treated patient, this study demonstrates that contemporary GDTs for LQTS are not innocuous. Their treatment-related side effects are not trivial and should compel an ongoing quest for new LQTS therapies.

### Differentiating nonpermanent injectable fillers: prevention and treatment of filler complications [^1fdabb12]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Though the incidence of complications and adverse events with dermatological fillers is inherently low, practitioners should be well versed in both prevention of filler complications and the treatment algorithms for addressing "granulomas", nodules, infection, and vascular compromise. Appropriate preventative measures, coupled with timely and effective treatment, are critically important for patient safety and satisfaction. In addition to the preventive measures and treatment algorithms outlined here, the authors emphasize that the broad classification and treatment of nodules as "granulomas" is likely to lead to ineffective treatment, or worse, unnecessary exposure to incorrect treatment. In practice, nodules are classified and treated based on clinical manifestation (eg, late vs early or noninflammatory vs inflammatory) rather than on histology. Indeed, classification of a nodule as a granuloma requires a histological examination, rarely available (or necessary) in clinical practice to guide treatment. Thus, the apparent inflammatory nature of the nodule and the time of onset should drive treatment approach. The treatment algorithms presented here are based on these clinically meaningful parameters.

### Prevalence and predictive testing preferences for breast cancer treatment side effects [^0725592c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Utilizing precision health care to identify women at risk for side effects would enable clinicians to select the most appropriate treatments while avoiding suboptimal treatment adherence and provide early interventions for symptom management when side effects are likely. Developing biomarker tests to predict side effects may also assist with shared decision making among oncologists and patients as well as provide direction for targeted interventions to mitigate potential side effects. However, there is limited knowledge about patient preferences regarding biomarker testing and how such preferences may vary by self-reported race, as side effects themselves do. A systematic review spanning 20 years of research on attitudes and beliefs towards genetic testing indicated that Black participants are generally more wary of genetic testing compared with their White counterparts. These concerns and beliefs were further demonstrated when targeted racial testing such as APOL1 for Black kidney donors was implemented, enabling a potentially discriminatory decision. These differences are, in part, thought to be associated with lower awareness levels and factual knowledge about genetic tests among racial and ethnic minorities. Given the precision healthcare focus in BC and the known racial disparities in BC outcomes, information regarding racial preferences for potential biomarker risk factor testing, as well as barriers to its use, would be valuable to patients and clinicians, and potentially address disparities in treatment adherence and outcomes.

The main objectives of this study are to describe (1) women's self-report of common BC treatment side effects (e.g. JMSP, hot flashes) and (2) the impact of side effects on quality of life, as well as (3) preferences for potential biomarker testing to help predict side effects and potential barriers to using biomarker testing among Black and White women.

### Alphabet soup: clinical pearls for the retina specialist-ocular toxicity of advanced antineoplastic agents in systemic cancer care [^e59bff95]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Targeted antineoplastic agents and immunotherapies have revolutionized management strategies available for previously refractory cancer. Despite the growing list of pharmacologic agents and indications, many of the currently Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies are associated with ocular adverse effects. Retina specialists and oncologists should be aware of potential side effects because some may be severe and permanent. Although most ocular side effects require conservative treatment without discontinuation of life-preserving therapies, rare severe adverse reactions can be potentially blinding and may warrant an extensive discussion regarding different management strategies, including cessation of life-preserving therapy.

Orlistat: Understanding the pharmacokinetic efficacy and potential side effects

Orlistat is a well-researched pancreatic lipase inhibitor recognized for its weight reduction capabilities and positive impact on cardiovascular risk markers in patients with obesity. Despite its effectiveness, the drug's gastrointestinal side effects, stemming from its action of blocking fat absorption, can affect adherence. Orlistat works by hindering the absorption of dietary fats, leading to weight loss, and also shows potential in enhancing metabolic markers like adiponectin and leptin levels. Beyond its weight loss benefits, scientists have suggested that orlistat might have anti-tumor.

In the context of understanding the pharmacokinetic efficacy of Orlistat, along with its potential side effects, can be influenced by obesity through changes in drug absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. The way a drug is administered plays a crucial role in its systemic availability, with routes like intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular bypassing the liver initially, thus affecting systemic bioavailability. Numerous pharmaceuticals are formulated as ionized salts, incorporating elements like sodium or potassium, to enhance their pharmacokinetic profiles. This includes facilitating dissolution in the gastrointestinal tract to improve absorption, extending the product's shelf life, and streamlining the manufacturing process. Medications such as phentermine hydrochloride (HCl), naltrexone HCl, and bupropion HCl are examples where the salt form significantly influences their pharmacokinetic behaviors.

When compared to other medications for obesity management, orlistat stands out primarily due to its gastrointestinal side effects which are typically manageable. Its distinctive mechanism of action reduces the absorption of fats, potentially benefiting insulin sensitivity and reducing levels of circulating fatty acids. However, concerns about its impact on gastrointestinal health and the potential for decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins persist. Despite these challenges, orlistat is acknowledged for its effectiveness in weight management and its potential for anti-cancer research, mainly attributed to its role as a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that limits dietary fat absorption.

Thus, orlistat is effective in weight management and poses cardiovascular benefits, yet its gastrointestinal side effects and impact on vitamin absorption necessitate careful consideration. Ongoing research into its various pharmacological effects and potential beyond obesity treatment is encouraged.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^e44504b2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and they remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy, and oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While the guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others, and safe use includes appropriate patient selection with regular monitoring for potential adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects and potential drug interactions; doses should be as low as possible, and NSAID treatment should be continued for as short a time as possible.

### Injectable poly-L:-lactic acid: a novel sculpting agent for the treatment of dermal fat atrophy after severe acne [^52f7f0f3]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris affects up to 80% of people 11 to 30 years of age, and scarring can occur for up to 95% of these patients. Scarring may be pitted or hypertrophic in nature, although in most cases it is atrophic. Atrophic acne scarring follows dermal collagen and fat loss after moderate to severe acne infection. Injectable poly-L-acid (PLLA) is a biocompatible, biodegradable, synthetic polymer device that is hypothesized to enhance dermal volume via the endogenous production of fibroblasts and, subsequently, collagen. The gradual improvements in cutaneous volume observed after treatment with injectable PLLA have been noted to last up to 2 years. The case studies presented describe the use of injectable PLLA to correct dermal fat loss in macular atrophic acne scarring of the cheeks. Two female patients underwent three treatment sessions with injectable PLLA over a 12-week period. At each treatment session, the reconstituted product was injected into the deep dermis under the depressed portion of the scar. Both patients were extremely pleased with their results at, respectively, 1- and 4-year follow-up evaluations. Patients experienced minimal swelling and redness after injection and no product-related adverse events such as papule and/or nodule formation. The author believes these data suggest that injectable PLLA is a good treatment option for the correction of macular atropic scarring with thin dermis (off-label use), particularly compared with other injectable fillers currently used for this indication that have shorter durations of effect.
