## Question

How should chlamydia be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chlamydia should be managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who to screen and how to assess risk. Then, I should verify the best diagnostic tests and specimen types. Next, I will review first‑line and alternative treatments for uncomplicated urogenital infection, including special populations such as pregnant or breastfeeding patients. After that, I need to consider extragenital and ocular disease, partner management including EPT, and follow‑up strategies like test‑of‑cure and retesting. Finally, I should address antimicrobial stewardship, prevention counseling, and reporting requirements, cross‑checking each step against major guidelines and evidence syntheses to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm who needs screening and how to frame the initial assessment, because missing asymptomatic cases is common and drives morbidity and transmission; the USPSTF recommends screening all sexually active women 24 years or younger and older women at increased risk, with evidence insufficient for men, while CDC endorses screening in pregnancy and the WHO suggests broader programmatic screening in high‑prevalence settings for adolescents and key populations such as MSM and sex workers, so I should collect a focused sexual history, assess partner number/new partner, condom use, prior STIs, and pregnancy status before proceeding [^1148rAQg] [^116Zb7JK] [^1114RL75] [^115xvj86].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal diagnostic approach; NAATs remain the reference standard with superior sensitivity and specificity, and I should use first‑void urine for men and self‑ or clinician‑collected vaginal swabs for women, adding rectal and pharyngeal NAATs when exposure occurred at those sites, while point‑of‑care tests have improving performance but are not yet preferred over lab‑based NAATs in most settings [^112XdQk4] [^1165mEsB] [^116Zb7JK] [^117UiPzo].

> I will now examine first‑line treatment for uncomplicated urogenital infection in non‑pregnant adolescents and adults; I need to ensure I reflect the guideline shift favoring doxycycline given higher effectiveness and lower rectal persistence, so the preferred regimen is doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, with azithromycin 1 g single dose or levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 7 days as alternatives when adherence or tolerance is a concern, and I should counsel on photosensitivity, divalent cation interactions, and adherence to complete the course [^115msv8Y] [^112rxawj] [^116JhKDN] [^116rpnxv] [^116DM3VU].

> Hold on, I should verify management in pregnancy and during breastfeeding because tetracyclines are contraindicated; CDC and WHO recommend azithromycin 1 g orally once as first‑line in pregnancy, with amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days as an acceptable alternative if macrolides cannot be used or are unavailable, and given higher rates of persistent or recurrent infection after azithromycin in observational data, test‑of‑cure is essential after treatment in pregnancy [^116Zb7JK] [^114mpxNY] [^115v2MZD] [^113m6END] [^117Uta99].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I noted amoxicillin as an option "acceptable in penicillin‑allergic patients", but let me double‑check that because it sounds contradictory; amoxicillin is a penicillin, so it is not appropriate for penicillin‑allergic patients and that statement was incorrect, and the correct approach is to use azithromycin first‑line in pregnancy and consider erythromycin if macrolide selection requires an alternative, while avoiding amoxicillin in those with true penicillin allergy [^116Zb7JK] [^115v2MZD].

> Next, I should review extragenital disease where regimen choice matters; for rectal and oropharyngeal chlamydia, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days is preferred because of superior tissue penetration and cure rates, reserving azithromycin 1 g single dose only if doxycycline is unavailable or adherence to multidose therapy is a serious concern, and considering second‑line options only when first‑line agents are not feasible [^116mijhP] [^112rxawj] [^1176tfnV].

> I need to check ocular disease management; in non‑pregnant adults with chlamydial conjunctivitis, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days is first‑line with azithromycin 1 g single dose as an alternative, whereas neonates require systemic therapy to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage, typically erythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses for 14 days, and I should coordinate ophthalmology follow‑up and evaluate the birthing parent and partners for urogenital infection [^113gcANy] [^115vttte] [^113stEEJ].

> Let me consider partner services because reinfection risk is substantial; I should recommend partner notification and testing of partners within the exposure window, offer expedited partner therapy where legal and appropriate to improve partner treatment rates, advise abstinence from sexual activity for 7 days after completion of therapy and until partners are treated, and integrate partner services into a comprehensive prevention package [^116Zb7JK] [^115UqoKv] [^113Hysc3].

> I should double‑check follow‑up strategy; test‑of‑cure is recommended in pregnancy, and I initially wrote "3–5 weeks", which aligns reasonably with practice, but let me verify the CDC language — CDC advises TOC around 4 weeks post‑treatment in pregnancy, so planning NAAT at approximately 3–4 weeks is appropriate, whereas TOC is not routinely required for non‑pregnant patients unless adherence is in doubt or symptoms persist [^116Zb7JK] [^115msv8Y].

> Now for retesting to detect reinfection, I previously stated "8–16 weeks after treatment in all patients", but hold on, I should verify exact timing; CDC recommends retesting at approximately 3 months after treatment, and while many programs operationalize this as 8–12 weeks, some reports describe an 8–16 week window for scheduling, so I will correct this to "about 3 months", noting that if 3‑month retesting is not feasible, retesting at the next healthcare encounter within 12 months is advised, with particular emphasis on adolescents, MSM, and those with ongoing risk [^115msv8Y] [^112fDSLp] [^112rxawj].

> Let me review antimicrobial stewardship and alternatives; given rising macrolide resistance pressures in other STIs and the microbiome impact, I should default to doxycycline when feasible, reserve single‑dose azithromycin for pregnancy or when adherence barriers are high, and consider second‑line options such as levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 7 days or, where first‑line agents are unavailable, erythromycin or ofloxacin per WHO, while recognizing dual‑agent pressures in gonorrhea stewardship updates that caution against unnecessary azithromycin use [^116JhKDN] [^112rxawj] [^114HFyqz] [^116iURSx].

> Next, I should review prevention counseling and co‑infection screening; I will provide brief, targeted behavioral counseling on condom use and partner reduction for those at increased STI risk, test for gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV at the same visit, assess need for hepatitis B vaccination, and discuss contraception and pregnancy plans, providing both verbal and written education to the index patient and partners [^111XHP6s] [^112kAmHX] [^113eJj3S] [^1114RL75].

> I need to ensure documentation and reporting are not overlooked; chlamydia is reportable in many jurisdictions, so I should report to local health authorities per regulations, document partner management efforts, and integrate partner services within clinic workflows to support public health surveillance and prevention [^116Zb7JK] [^115UqoKv].

> But wait, to consolidate this into a practical summary I should outline the core algorithm in prose; for non‑pregnant adolescents and adults with uncomplicated urogenital infection, use doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days with azithromycin 1 g once or levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 7 days as alternatives when needed; for pregnancy and breastfeeding, use azithromycin 1 g once with amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 7 days as an alternative if macrolides are not suitable, and perform a test‑of‑cure at around 4 weeks; for rectal or pharyngeal infection, prefer doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days and consider azithromycin 1 g once only if adherence to multidose therapy is a serious concern; for adult ocular disease, use doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days or azithromycin 1 g once, and for neonatal conjunctivitis use systemic erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses for 14 days; for all patients, arrange retesting at about 3 months to detect reinfection, ensure partner notification and EPT where legal, counsel to abstain from sex for 7 days after treatment and until partners complete therapy, and report the case per jurisdictional requirements [^115msv8Y] [^116Zb7JK] [^116mijhP] [^113stEEJ] [^115UqoKv].

---

The management of chlamydia centers on **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days** as first-line therapy for uncomplicated urogenital and rectal infections [^115msv8Y], with **azithromycin 1 g PO once** as an alternative when adherence is a concern or doxycycline is unavailable [^112rxawj]. Pregnant patients should receive **azithromycin 1 g PO once** [^116Zb7JK], with **amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID for 7 days** as an alternative [^117Ub6aT].

All sexual partners from the past **60 days** should be **notified, tested, and treated**, and patients must **abstain from sex for 7 days** [^115msv8Y] after treatment and until partners are treated. Test-of-cure is required in pregnancy 3–4 weeks after treatment, and all patients should be retested at 3 months to detect reinfection [^115msv8Y]. Screening is recommended for sexually active women ≤ 24 years [^1148rAQg], older women at risk, and MSM, with annual retesting for those at continued risk [^115xvj86].

---

## Diagnostic methods

**NAATs** are highly sensitive and specific [^112XdQk4]; first-void urine for men and self-collected vaginal swabs for women are preferred [^1165mEsB]. **POCTs** [^114rLhe3] are useful when NAATs are unavailable, but their lower sensitivity limits their use [^111BE3YA].

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line treatment** | **Alternative treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated urogenital infection | Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^115msv8Y] | Azithromycin 1 g PO once [^116JhKDN] |
| Rectal infection | Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^112rxawj] | Azithromycin 1 g PO once [^116mijhP] |
| Pharyngeal infection | Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^116mijhP] | Azithromycin 1 g PO once [^111Bmg9H] |
| Pregnancy | Azithromycin 1 g PO once [^116Zb7JK] | Amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID for 7 days [^117Ub6aT] |
| Neonatal conjunctivitis | Erythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg/day PO divided QID for 14 days [^113stEEJ] | Azithromycin suspension 20 mg/kg/day PO once daily for 3 days |

---

## Management of sexual partners

Partner notification requires that all partners within **60 days** [^115msv8Y] be **notified, tested, and treated**. EPT is **recommended where legal**, to **reduce reinfection** [^114CpNXj].

---

## Follow-up and test-of-cure

Test-of-cure is required **3–4 weeks after treatment in pregnancy** and is not routine for non-pregnant patients unless adherence is uncertain or symptoms persist. Retesting at **3 months** is recommended for all patients to detect reinfection [^115msv8Y].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Screening**: Sexually active women ≤ 24 years, older women at risk, and MSM; annual retesting for those at continued risk [^1148rAQg] [^112VTdKq].

- **Education**: Counseling on safe sex, condom use [^111XHP6s], and partner notification.

- **Vaccines**: None currently available [^112yo6FN].

---

## Complications of untreated infection

- **Women**: PID, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain [^1174Fzn6].

- **Men**: Epididymitis, prostatitis, infertility.

- **Both sexes**: Increased HIV risk, reactive arthritis [^1148rAQg].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Azithromycin 1 g PO once; amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID for 7 days if needed [^116Zb7JK] [^117Ub6aT].

- **Neonates**: Erythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg/day PO divided QID for 14 days [^113stEEJ].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Remains low; monitor for emerging resistance.

---

Effective management of chlamydia requires **accurate diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, partner management, and prevention strategies** to reduce transmission and complications [^112rxawj].

### Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1148rAQg]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are among the most common sexually transmitted infections in the US. Infection rates are highest among adolescents and young adults of both sexes. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are usually asymptomatic and may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and its associated complications. Newborns of pregnant persons with untreated infections may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection in men may lead to urethritis and epididymitis. Both types of infection can increase the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.

The objective of this recommendation is to update the 2014 recommendation. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons.

- **Population**: Asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. Similarly, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.

### Screening for chlamydial infection: U.S. preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116RtDFN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This paper provides an update on the 2001 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations regarding the screening of sexually active adolescents and adults for chlamydial infection.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF assessed the benefits, such as improved fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and reduced infection transmission; and harms, including anxiety, relationship problems, and the unnecessary treatment of false-positive results, associated with chlamydial screening. This assessment was based on their 2001 recommendations and a systematic review of English-language articles published between July 2000 and July 2005.

- **Recommendations**: Screen for chlamydial infection in all sexually active nonpregnant young women aged 24 years or younger and in older nonpregnant women who are at increased risk (A recommendation). Screen for chlamydial infection in all pregnant women aged 24 years or younger and in older pregnant women who are at increased risk (B recommendation). Do not routinely screen for chlamydial infection in women aged 25 years or older, regardless of pregnancy status, if they are not at increased risk (C recommendation). Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydial infection in men (I statement).

1 Introduction

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 127.2million new cases of CT occur globally every year and most of them come from the resource-limited countries. Untreated CT infection in women can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Among men CT infection is associated with non-gonococcal urethritis and epididymitis. CT infection in pregnant women can contribute to the incidence of adverse obstetric outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight. In addition, genital CT infection significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma development. Because over 70% of CT infections in women and 50% in men are asymptomatic, effective control of the infections often relies on screening for CT followed by treatment of the infected cases. Benefits of CT screening in women have been demonstrated a reduction in rates of PID, and prevention of adverse obstetric outcomes among pregnant women. Screening for CT is largely subject to the tests available and accessible to the target populations. Laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provide a highly accurate diagnosis but are usually neither affordable nor accessible in the developing countries because they require laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel and have a high cost. In addition, delay in report of the tes

### Interventions for treating genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy [^113m6END]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Genital Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection may lead to pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm labor, low birth weight, preterm rupture of membranes, increased perinatal mortality, postpartum endometritis, chlamydial conjunctivitis, and C. trachomatis pneumonia. This review supersedes a previous review on this topic.

- **Objectives**: To establish the most efficacious and best-tolerated therapy for the treatment of genital chlamydial infection in preventing maternal infection and adverse neonatal outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; 26 June 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as studies published in abstract form, assessed interventions for treating genital C. trachomatis infection in pregnancy. Cluster-RCTs were also eligible for inclusion, but none were identified. Quasi-randomized trials and trials using cross-over design are not eligible for inclusion in this review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data using the agreed form. Data were checked for accuracy. Evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 15 trials (involving 1754 women), although our meta-analyses were based on fewer numbers of studies/women. All of the included studies were undertaken in North America from 1982 to 2001.

### Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116m2b3q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This document provides an update on the previous U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations concerning screening for chlamydia (2007) and gonorrhea (2005).

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed evidence regarding the screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections in asymptomatic patients based on studies published since its last reviews. It also considered evidence from its previous recommendations and reviews.

- **Population**: This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.

- **Recommendations**:
	- The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection (B recommendation).
	- The USPSTF also recommends screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection (B recommendation).
	- The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men (I statement).

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^116iURSx]. MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Combination therapy, using a highly effective gonococcal therapeutic agent with cotreatment for chlamydia, has been recommended since 1985. In 2007, based on data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) indicating widely disseminated quinolone-resistant gonococcal strains in the United States, CDC no longer recommended fluoroquinolones for treatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining recommended antimicrobial class.

Availability of sensitive C. trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests was widespread by 2010, but CDC recommended gonococcal dual therapy with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 250 mg IM or cefixime 400 mg orally) and either azithromycin or doxycycline to reflect concerns regarding emerging gonococcal resistance. By 2011, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefixime necessary to inhibit N. gonorrhoeae growth in vitro were increasing. In 2012, cefixime was no longer a recommended gonococcal regimen, with ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination therapy the only recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea.

Since the publication of the 2015 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, concerns regarding antimicrobial stewardship have increased, especially the impact of antimicrobial use on the microbiome and data indicating azithromycin resistance (elevated MICs) for gonorrhea and other organisms. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling has also affected the understanding of optimal antimicrobial dosing for N. gonorrhoeae treatment. This update provides the rationale for the change in gonorrhea treatment.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis: an update [^116KSji4]. The Indian Journal of Medical Research (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Chlamydia trachomatis infection:

- **Definition**: C. trachomatis infection is a common bacterial STI characterized primarily by urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females.

- **Pathophysiology**: The obligate intracellular bacteria C. trachomatis are responsible for the disease and may be transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

- **Disease course**: The most common manifestations include urethritis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis, urethritis, and endometritis in women. Disease progression may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which in pregnancy results in premature delivery and puerperal and neonatal infections.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15–2.94).

### Management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: Evidence reviewed for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^114CpNXj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

In April 2005, in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted diseases (STD) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults. Key questions were posed and answered on the basis of the quality of evidence and expert opinion. Clinical trials continue to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and tolerability of azithromycin and doxycycline regimens, and both remain recommended as first-line therapy in nonpregnant individuals.

More data and clinical experience are available to support the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of azithromycin in pregnant women, and, in the upcoming guidelines, azithromycin will be recommended as first-line therapy for such patients. Evidence is building that expedited partner therapy (EPT), with the provision of treatment or a prescription, may be just as effective as or more effective than standard partner referral in ensuring partner treatment and preventing chlamydia recurrence in women. Although more studies are needed and barriers must be addressed before its widespread use, EPT will be recommended as an option for partner management.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117XnsGu]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed/Medline and Embase for studies published from January 2004 — the year in which WHO published its pivotal report on POCTs for sexually transmitted infections — to May 2021. No language restrictions were applied. The following combinations of search terms were used: (Chlamydia trachomatis OR chlamydia* OR (C. trachomatis)) AND ((point-of-care test*) OR POC* OR assay* OR diagnostic* OR RDT*) AND (performance OR accuracy OR sensitivit* OR specificit*). We also manually searched the relevant references to identify potential articles.

### Temporal patterns in chlamydia repeat testing in Massachusetts [^112fDSLp]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

National guidelines recommend a test-of-cure for pregnant women and a test-of-reinfection for all patients with chlamydia infections to interrupt transmission and prevent adverse sequelae for patients, partners, and newborns. Little is known about retesting and positivity rates and whether they are changing over time, particularly in private sector practices.

- **Methods**: Electronic health record data on patients with chlamydia tests were extracted from three independent clinical practice groups serving approximately 20% of the Massachusetts population. Records were extracted using the Electronic Medical Record Support for Public Health platform (esphealth.org). These data were analyzed for temporal trends in annual repeat testing rates by using generalized estimating equations after index positive chlamydia tests between 2010 and 2015 and for differences in intervals to first repeat tests among pregnant females, non-pregnant females, and males. Data extraction and analysis were performed during calendar years 2017 and 2018.

- **Results**: An index positive C. trachomatis result was identified for 972 pregnant female cases, 10,309 non-pregnant female cases, and 4,973 male cases. Test-of-cure 3–5 weeks after an index positive test occurred in 37% of pregnant females. Test-of-reinfection 8–16 weeks after an index positive test occurred in 39% of pregnant females, 18% of non-pregnant females, and 9% of males. There were no significant increases in test-of-cure or test-of-reinfection rates from 2010 to 2015. Among cases with repeat tests, 16% of pregnant females, 15% of non-pregnant females, and…

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^117Q6o29]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

During 2018, CDC staff members and subject matter experts identified essential questions regarding gonorrhea treatment to update the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases conducted for January 2013–May 2019 using the parameters (gonorrhea[MeSH]) OR (gonococcal[all fields] OR gonorrhea[all fields] OR "Neisseria gonorrhoeae"[all fields]) AND (treatment[MeSH] OR antibiotic[MeSH] OR therapy) generated over 2,200 abstracts. Titles and abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were reviewed. Abstracts from STD conferences held during 2015–2018 and on the National Institutes of Health clinical trials website were also reviewed.

GISP susceptibility data from January 2013 to May 2019 were reviewed. GISP monitors gonorrhea antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the United States through monthly testing of urethral isolates from 25 symptomatic men in each of 25–30 STD specialty care clinics. Regional laboratories conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution to determine MICs for selected antimicrobials. Although the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has not established N. gonorrhoeae resistance breakpoints for ceftriaxone, cefixime, or azithromycin, CLSI categorizes isolates with MICs of ≤ 0.25 μg/mL as susceptible for ceftriaxone and cefixime, and those with MICs of ≤ 1.00 μg/mL as susceptible for azithromycin. To identify isolates with elevated MICs, GISP uses the following "alert values" to identify potential emerging resistance: MIC ≥ 0.125 μg/mL for ceftriaxone, ≥ 0.25 μg/mL for cefixime, and ≥ 1.00 μg/mL for azithromycin.

### Screening for chlamydial infection: An evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114Jac4n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007).

Chlamydial infection is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the United States, with an estimated 3 million new cases annually. In 2001, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that clinicians screen all sexually active women at increased risk for infection for *Chlamydia trachomatis*.

- **Purpose**: To summarize a systematic evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF in preparation for an update of its 2001 recommendation.

- **Data sources**: English-language articles identified in PubMed between July 2000 and July 2005. Additional articles were identified through bibliographic reviews and discussions with experts. A total of 452 articles were identified.

- **Study selection**: Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for each of three key questions. For studies of screening in nonpregnant women at increased risk, the review was limited to randomized, controlled trials. For other groups, both randomized, controlled studies and nonrandomized, prospective, controlled studies were included.

- **Data abstraction**: Using standardized forms, staff of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality abstracted data on study design, setting, sample, randomization, blinding, results, and harms.

- **Data synthesis**: Only one new study met inclusion criteria. This poor-quality study of the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial infection among nonpregnant women at increased risk found that screening was associated with a lower prevalence of chlamydial infection and fewer reported cases of pelvic inflammatory disease at one-year follow-up.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rLhe3]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally but has been inadequately detected for intervention. The introduction of point-of-care tests (POCTs) for CT is critical for filling the intervention gaps. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic performance of POCTs for CT to assist in guiding the application of these assays in CT screening and detection.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed/Medline and Embase databases from January 2004 to May 2021 for studies reporting the performance of POCTs for identifying CT using specimens collected from urethral, vaginal, cervical, anorectal, or pharyngeal sites or urine. Two investigators independently screened and extracted data to control the quality of data extraction. Any discrepancies in study selection and data extraction were resolved through consensus. We only included studies with sufficient data to estimate sensitivity and specificity and used laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) as the reference standard. The main outcomes were pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Summary estimates were calculated using a random-effects model, and summary receiver operator curves (SROCs) were generated using the Moses-Littenberg method. STATA 14.0 and Meta-DiSc 1.4 were used for statistical analysis. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019140544.

- **Findings**: Of 3,038 records identified, 39 studies (42,336 specimens) were included.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^115CT6N9]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States and Europe, with over three million new infections diagnosed each year. However, most chlamydial infections remain asymptomatic and undiagnosed. Untreated chlamydial infection in women can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, causing scarring of the fallopian tubes, which can result in tubal infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy. The annual cost of chlamydial infection and its sequelae in the United States has been estimated to exceed $2 billion.

In many developed countries, screening programs for chlamydia have been set up to reduce transmission and reproductive tract morbidity. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual screening of all sexually active women aged 25 or less. In England, the recommendation applies to women aged 24 or less. However, controversy remains about the evidence base. The results of the landmark trial by Scholes et al. have been questioned, and the continuing search for supporting evidence from other randomised controlled trials and epidemiological studies has not always been fruitful. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended improvements in the quality of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding of assessment of outcomes in any future trials of chlamydia screening. A more accurate estimate of the rate of progression of genital chlamydial infection to pelvic inflammatory disease is also urgently needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening.

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with chlamydia: A before-and-after study [^113Hysc3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are increasing in many regions around the world, highlighting their continued significance as a global public health challenge. Each year, there are 374 million new cases of STIs, with an estimated 128.5 million cases of *Chlamydia trachomatis*, making it the most common bacterial STI globally. International guidelines on managing chlamydia contacts vary. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment for sexual partners within 60 days of symptom onset or chlamydia diagnosis, and even beyond 60 days for the most recent partner. British guidelines recommend empirical treatment for male cases with urethral symptoms and for contacts within 4 weeks; for all other cases, contacts within the last 6 months should be treated. Although many international guidelines emphasize the importance of testing and confirmatory diagnostics for chlamydia contacts, they continue to recommend presumptive treatment.

Concerns over antimicrobial resistance in STIs have been increasing. Although antibiotic resistance in chlamydia is relatively uncommon, the overprescription and misuse of antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin may foster resistance in other pathogens, such as *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Mycoplasma genitalium*, as well as non-STI bacteria. Recent studies have shown that *N. gonorrhoeae* has developed significant resistance to azithromycin, leading to treatment challenges. Similarly, *M. genitalium* demonstrates increasing resistance to azithromycin, complicating treatment options.

### Azithromycin versus doxycycline for urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection [^116DM3VU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection remains prevalent and causes substantial reproductive morbidity. Recent studies have raised concern about the efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of chlamydia infection.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized trial comparing oral azithromycin with doxycycline for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia infection among adolescents in youth correctional facilities, to evaluate the noninferiority of azithromycin (1 g in one dose) to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days). The treatment was directly observed. The primary end point was treatment failure 28 days after treatment initiation, determined on the basis of nucleic acid amplification testing, sexual history, and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) genotyping of C. trachomatis strains.

- **Results**: Among the 567 participants enrolled, 284 were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin, and 283 were randomly assigned to receive doxycycline. A total of 155 participants in each treatment group (65% male) made up the per-protocol population. There were no treatment failures in the doxycycline group. In the azithromycin group, treatment failure occurred in 5 participants (3.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 7.4%). The observed difference in failure rates between the treatment groups was 3.2 percentage points, with an upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval of 5.9 percentage points, which exceeded the prespecified absolute 5-percentage-point cutoff for establishing the noninferiority of azithromycin.

Conclusions: In the context of a closed setting, azithromycin did not demonstrate noninferiority to doxycycline for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia infection.

### Screening for genital chlamydia infection [^111KQp9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Genital infections caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis* are the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Screening of sexually active young adults to detect and treat asymptomatic infections might reduce chlamydia transmission and prevent reproductive tract morbidity, particularly pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, which can cause tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects and safety of chlamydia screening versus standard care on chlamydia transmission and infection complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in men.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, DARE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science electronic databases up to 14 February 2016. Additionally, searches were conducted in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors, and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adult women (non-pregnant and pregnant) and men comparing a chlamydia screening intervention with usual care and reporting on a primary outcome (C. trachomatis prevalence, PID in women, epididymitis in men, or incidence of preterm delivery). Non-randomized controlled clinical trials were included if there were no RCTs for a primary outcome.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials.

### Immunology of chlamydia infection: Implications for a Chlamydia trachomatis vaccine [^112yo6FN]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infections are a serious public-health problem. With more than 90 million new cases occurring annually, C. trachomatis is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Recent progress in elucidating the immunobiology of Chlamydia muridarum infection in mice has helped to guide the interpretation of immunological findings in studies of human C. trachomatis infection and has led to the development of a common model of immunity. In this review, we describe our understanding of the immune response to infection with Chlamydia spp. and how this information is improving the prospects for development of a vaccine against infection with C. trachomatis.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

To prepare for the development of the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, the CDC convened a committee of expert consultants in June 2019 to discuss recent abstracts and published literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of sexually transmitted infections. This paper summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections in adolescents and adults that were reviewed and discussed for consideration in developing the guidelines. The evidence reviewed mostly focused on efficacy of doxycycline and azithromycin for urogenital, rectal, and oropharyngeal CT infection, CT risk factors in women, performance of CT nucleic acid amplification tests on self-collected meatal specimens in men, and performance of newer CT point-of-care tests.

### Effectiveness of Chlamydia trachomatis expedited partner therapy in pregnancy [^1151U5MR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Expedited partner therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis has shown mixed efficacy in different populations, with limited data available on its effectiveness in pregnant populations.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of establishing a prenatal expedited partner therapy program in eradicating chlamydia before delivery. It also examined maternal and neonatal outcomes between women who received expedited partner therapy for chlamydia and those who received standard partner referral testing and treatment during pregnancy.

- **Study design**: An expedited partner therapy program was implemented on August 21, 2019, at a public hospital in a county with high chlamydia prevalence. Pregnant women were provided with single-dose packets of azithromycin to treat partners following a diagnosis of chlamydia infection. We prospectively observed pregnant women treated in the expedited partner therapy program who delivered at our institution in the same year and compared the outcomes with a historic cohort from the previous year that had traditional partner referral testing and treatment. Women with concurrent gonorrhea, HIV, syphilis, or intimate partner violence were excluded. The primary outcome was chlamydia reinfection or no-cure rates at repeat testing 4 to 6 weeks following treatment or at the 36-week prenatal care screening. Secondary outcomes included obstetrical, maternal, and neonatal outcomes such as premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal sepsis.

### Prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease by the control of C. trachomatis infection [^114kmg6v]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this research was to determine if there is evidence indicating that screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is an effective intervention in preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic young women for lower genital tract infection with C. trachomatis in preventing PID and its major sequelae, including tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

- **Results**: Considerable literature exists on screening for lower genital tract infection with C. trachomatis; however, only two randomized controlled trials, two ecological studies, and one case-controlled trial were identified. These studies were graded, and the evidence pooled. The suggestion that screening for chlamydia is an effective intervention in the prevention of PID is supported by Grade 2 evidence (level B recommendation). Nevertheless, significant gaps exist in the literature. Only small numbers of women have been studied, and the follow-up periods are short. The studies predominantly used culture of cervical swabs to diagnose chlamydial infection, as opposed to more recent nucleic acid-based tests. The risk of a woman developing PID following detection of lower tract infection with C. trachomatis remains uncertain.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence supports a level B recommendation that screening for chlamydia using culture is effective in preventing PID in the short term. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to assess screening using nucleic acid-based tests and involve longer follow-up periods.

- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days**:

	- Doxycycline is recommended as a first-line treatment option due to its efficacy in treating uncomplicated infections.

- **Azithromycin 1 g PO immediately for one dose**:

	- Azithromycin offers the convenience of a single-dose treatment and is particularly effective in certain patient populations.

### Chlamydia trachomatis among patients infected with and treated for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States [^1122Envq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

For two decades, treatment guidelines for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have recommended empirical co-treatment for chlamydia when patients are treated for gonorrhea. Because the epidemiology of and diagnostic testing for STDs have changed over time, co-treatment may no longer be needed as a clinical or public health strategy.

- **Objective**: To assess the prevalence of chlamydia among patients at STD clinics who are infected with and treated for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and to determine whether co-treatment recommendations are still justified.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional analysis of data from a multisite study.

- **Setting**: Five public STD clinics (Baltimore, Maryland; Denver, Colorado; Long Beach, California; Newark, New Jersey; and San Francisco, California), July 1993 through October 1995.

- **Patients**: 3885 heterosexual patients (2184 men and 1701 women) who agreed to participate in a trial of counseling interventions and had conclusive results from diagnostic tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia performed routinely as part of the trial.

- **Measurements**: Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis as determined by polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 20% (95% CI, 16% to 24%) of 411 men and 42% (CI, 35% to 50%) of 151 women with laboratory-confirmed N. gonorrhoeae. Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 19% (CI, 15% to 22%) of 410 men and 35% (CI, 28% to 43%) of 154 women with treatment indications for gonorrhea who would not otherwise have been treated for chlamydia. The chlamydia prevalence among these patients was significantly higher than among others.

### Cervicitis in adolescents: Do clinicians understand diagnosis and treatment [^1135pU9X]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Cervicitis is widespread, yet no studies have examined it in accordance with established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The objectives of this study were to describe adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to these guidelines in both primary care settings and the Emergency Department.

- **Methods**: Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of STIs in adolescent women within an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were between 12–21 years of age and had been given an ICD-9 and chart diagnosis of cervicitis. Two primary outcome variables were utilized: adherence to cervicitis guidelines and correct treatment among those meeting cervicitis guidelines (no/yes). The study controlled for factors such as age, race, venue, and past infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea.

- **Results**: A total of 365 subjects were examined for the primary outcome variables. Of these, 75.1% (274/365) met at least one criterion for cervicitis. Among those, 60.9% (166/274) met criteria for cervicitis alone, while 39.4% (108/274) met criteria for both cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The majority of the subjects, 89.3% (326/365), were treated for both chlamydia and gonorrhea; however, only 64.7% (211/326) received correct treatment for both infections.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that knowledge deficits exist in the diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis in adolescent patients and in.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^112FTa3c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We used a mixture-of-exponentials model for the duration of untreated chlamydia infection in men. The model allows for any new infection to take one of several courses, each with a different clearance rate. Each infection thus belongs to one category, or "class". Within each class, durations of infection are exponentially distributed with a mean equal to the reciprocal of the clearance rate for that class.

To determine the appropriate number of classes, we compared the fit to the data of models comprised of 1, 2, and 3 classes. We also investigated a model in which clearance rates had a continuous Gamma distribution, rather than falling into discrete classes. The model also recognizes different study types: clinic-based studies recruit individuals who present for testing, perhaps because symptoms have recently developed or because of contact with an infected person, representing recent exposures and incident infections. Screening studies recruit members of the general population, more representative of prevalent infections. The proportion of detected infections belonging to faster-clearing infection classes is lower in screening studies than in patients seeking care after exposure to infection because these short infections clear quickly and, thus, are less common in the pool of prevalent infections.

We used 3 published literature reviews to identify relevant studies in which chlamydia-infected men were retested at a later date, having received no treatment in the interim. We updated these searches to cover the period since the original review but found…

### Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women [^116rpnxv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women, thus it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men, the infection is mainly symptomatic but can evolve to prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not give any specific recommendation about which antibiotic to use as the first option.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS), and trial registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of men and sexually active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated to 2013 CT Guidelines.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same effect.

### Chlamydia trachomatis seroassays used in epidemiologic research: A narrative review and practical considerations [^116m8fsp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to adverse reproductive health outcomes. CT prevalence estimates are primarily derived from screening using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). However, screening guidelines in the United States only include particular subpopulations, and NAATs only detect infections. In contrast, seroassays identify past CT infections, which is important for understanding the public health impacts of CT, including pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility.

Older seroassays have been plagued by low sensitivity and specificity and have not been validated using a consistent reference measure. This inconsistency makes it challenging to compare studies, define the epidemiology of CT, and determine the effectiveness of control programs. Newer seroassays have better performance characteristics.

This narrative review summarizes the "state of the science" for CT seroassays that have been applied in epidemiologic studies. It also provides practical considerations for interpreting the literature and employing seroassays in future research.

### Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in infants and children [^113XfHNL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The recommendations for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines regarding the diagnosis and treatment of gonococcal and Chlamydia trachomatis infections in infants and children remain essentially the same as the 2006 guidelines. There are no new data on the diagnosis or treatment of neonatal chlamydial or gonococcal infections. New data on the efficacy of neonatal ocular prophylaxis are limited. Two recent studies from Iran and Brazil suggest that povidone-iodine may not be effective for the prevention of chlamydial or gonococcal ophthalmia. Prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women, which have been demonstrated to be very effective for the prevention of neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia, are the most effective strategies for preventing neonatal chlamydial infection.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^117Uta99]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common bacterial sexually transmitted infection that can persist or recur after antibiotic treatment. Universal screening for chlamydia in pregnancy is recommended to prevent adverse birth outcomes. Single-dose oral azithromycin has been the first-line therapy for chlamydia in pregnancy since 2006.

- **Objective**: In the setting of limited data and rising sexually transmitted infection rates in the United States, our goal was to document rates and risk factors for persistent or recurrent chlamydia after azithromycin treatment in pregnancy.

- **Study design**: This retrospective cohort study included pregnancies with urogenital chlamydia and follow-up testing in women who delivered at an Alabama facility between November 2012 and December 2017. Pregnancies with prescribed azithromycin therapy and repeat chlamydia testing ≥ 21 days later were included. Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification testing was performed on genital swab or urine samples. Descriptive characteristics and birth outcomes were compared for categories stratified by repeat test results: persistence (+ +), recurrence (+ − +), or clearance (+ −). Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for persistent or recurrent chlamydia in pregnancy.

- **Results**: Among 810 women with 840 pregnancies with repeat chlamydia testing after azithromycin treatment, 114 (14%) had persistence and an additional 72 (9%) had recurrence later in pregnancy. The median time to repeat testing was 30 days (interquartile range, 24–49 days).

### Screening for chlamydial infection [^112wSFff]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To examine data on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial infection by a physician or other healthcare professional, we examine the evidence that early treatment of chlamydial infection improves health outcomes. We also explore the effectiveness of screening strategies in nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and men, as well as the accuracy of tests used for screening. This review updates the literature since the last recommendation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published in 1996.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the topic of chlamydia in the MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and Cochrane Library databases from January 1994 to July 2000. This was supplemented by reference lists of relevant articles and consultations with experts in the field. Articles published prior to 1994 and research abstracts were cited if they were particularly important to the key questions or to the interpretation of included articles.

- **Selection criteria**: A single reader reviewed all English abstracts. Articles were selected for full review if they addressed Chlamydia trachomatis genitourinary infections in nonpregnant women, pregnant women, or men and were relevant to key questions in the analytic framework. Investigators read the full-text versions of the retrieved articles and applied additional eligibility criteria. We excluded articles if they did not provide sufficient information to determine the methods for selecting subjects and analyzing data.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We systematically reviewed three types of studies about screening in nonpregnant women that relate to effectiveness and accuracy.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^114sDsya]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Rigorous estimates for clearance rates of untreated chlamydia infections are important for understanding chlamydia epidemiology and designing control interventions, but were previously only available for women.

- **Methods**: We used data from published studies of chlamydia-infected men who were retested at a later date without having received treatment. Our analysis allowed new infections to take one of 1, 2, or 3 courses, each clearing at a different rate. We determined which of these 3 models had the most empirical support.

- **Results**: The best-fitting model had 2 courses of infection in men, as was previously found for women: "slow-clearing" and "fast-clearing". Only 68% (57%-78%) (posterior median and 95% credible interval [CrI]) of incident infections in men were slow-clearing, vs 77% (69%-84%) in women. The slow clearance rate in men (based on 6 months' follow-up) was 0.35 (0.05–1.15) year-1 (posterior median and 95% CrI), corresponding to mean infection duration of 2.84 (0.87–18.79) years. This compares to 1.35 (1.13–1.63) years in women.

- **Conclusions**: Our estimated clearance rate is slower than previously assumed. Fewer infections become established in men than women but once established, they clear more slowly. This study provides an improved description of chlamydia's natural history to inform public health decision-making. We describe how further data collection could reduce uncertainty in estimates.

### Update on the epidemiology, screening, and management of Chlamydia trachomatis infection [^1174Fzn6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). High credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection ("chlamydia") is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmitted infection globally, occurring in the genitals (urethra or vagina/cervix), rectum, or pharynx. If left untreated in women, genital chlamydia can ascend into the upper genital tract, causing pelvic inflammatory disease, and increasing their risk for ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis and proctitis. However, chlamydia is asymptomatic in over 80% of cases. This article provides an update on the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of chlamydia in adults and discusses the approaches to its management and control policy.

### Standard treatment regimens for nongonococcal urethritis have similar but declining cure rates: a randomized controlled trial [^114RE7kW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Azithromycin or doxycycline is recommended for nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); recent evidence suggests their efficacy has declined. We compared azithromycin and doxycycline in men with NGU, hypothesizing that azithromycin was more effective than doxycycline.

- **Methods**: From January 2007 to July 2011, English-speaking males aged 16 years or older, attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (visible urethral discharge or ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field [PMNs/HPF]) were eligible for this double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1 g) plus placebo doxycycline, or active doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) plus placebo azithromycin. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical cure (< 5 PMNs/HPF with or without urethral symptoms and absence of discharge) and microbiologic cure (negative tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after 3 weeks.

- **Results**: Of 606 men, 304 were randomized to azithromycin and 302 to doxycycline; CT, MG, TV, and UU-2 were detected in 24%, 13%, 2%, and 23%, respectively. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, 172 of 216 (80%; 95% confidence interval, 74%-85%) receiving azithromycin and 157 of 206 (76%; 95% CI, 70%-82%) receiving doxycycline experienced clinical cure (P = 0.40). In pathogen-specific analyses, clinical cure did not differ by arm, nor did microbiologic cure differ for CT or other pathogens.

### U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: An opportunity to unify clinical and public health practice [^113RENQk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) constitute an epidemic of tremendous magnitude, with an estimated 15 million persons in the United States acquiring a new STD each year. Effective clinical management of STDs is a strategic common element in efforts to prevent HIV infection and improve reproductive and sexual health. Sexually transmitted diseases may result in severe, long-term, and costly complications, including facilitation of HIV infection, tubal infertility, adverse outcomes of pregnancy, and cervical and other types of anogenital cancer.

The publication of national guidelines for the management of STDs by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been a key component of federal initiatives to improve the health of the U.S. population by preventing and controlling STDs and their sequelae. This paper presents new recommendations from the 2002 CDC guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases in the context of disease trends and public health.

### Chlamydia trachomatis infections: Screening, diagnosis, and management [^114J5FVY]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the columnar epithelium of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, as well as nongenital sites such as the lungs and eyes. The bacterium is the cause of the most frequently reported sexually transmitted disease in the United States, responsible for more than 1 million infections annually. Most individuals with this infection are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can result in serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis and orchitis in men. Both men and women can experience chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis.

Treatment of uncomplicated cases should include azithromycin or doxycycline. Screening is recommended for all women younger than 25 years, all pregnant women, and women who are at increased risk of infection. Screening is not currently recommended for men. In neonates and infants, the bacterium can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia, and adults may also experience conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia. Trachoma is an ocular infection caused by chlamydia and is endemic in the developing world.

### Impact of doxycycline discharge kits on appropriate treatment of sexually transmitted infections among patients in the ED [^115XrXZ7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent, reportable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated treatment recommendations from a single azithromycin 1000 mg dose to doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for seven days for the treatment of chlamydia infections. In response to changes in treatment recommendations and addressing patient barriers to treatment, pharmacists at an urban, academic medical center collaborated with the state health department to create doxycycline kits dispensed upon emergency department (ED) discharge.

- **Objective**: To evaluate if ED doxycycline discharge kits improve appropriate and timely treatment of chlamydia.

- **Methods**: This was a single center, retrospective chart review study of adult patients with a positive chlamydia test while seen in the ED between September 1, 2021, and September 30, 2023. Patients with a listed allergy to doxycycline and those who were incarcerated and/or pregnant were excluded. The primary outcome was appropriate, guideline-recommended chlamydia treatment before and after doxycycline discharge kit implementation. Secondary outcomes included rate of ED return visits within 90 days for STI-related complaints, time to treatment in those who received a prescription for doxycycline versus doxycycline kit, and rate of doxycycline initiation via emergency medicine (EM) pharmacist culture call-back list.

- **Results**: A total of 170 patients were enrolled in the study, 72 patients in the pre-kit group and 98 patients in the post-kit group.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection [^1166ZV3i]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection most commonly affects the urogenital tract. In men, the infection is usually symptomatic, presenting with dysuria and a discharge from the penis. Untreated chlamydial infection in men can spread to the epididymis. Most women with chlamydial infection have minimal or no symptoms, although some develop pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydial infection in newborns can cause ophthalmia neonatorum. Chlamydial pneumonia can occur at one to three months of age, manifesting as a protracted onset of a staccato cough, usually without wheezing or fever. Treatment options for uncomplicated urogenital infections include a single 1-g dose of azithromycin orally, or doxycycline at a dosage of 100 mg orally twice per day for seven days. The recommended treatment during pregnancy is erythromycin base or amoxicillin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening for chlamydial infection in women at increased risk of infection and in all women younger than 25 years.

### Screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^117UiPzo]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The 2014 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement supported the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic, sexually active women aged 24 years or younger and in older women at increased risk for infection, although evidence for screening in men was insufficient.

- **Objective**: To update the 2014 USPSTF review on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant.

- **Data sources**: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE were searched from January 1, 2014, through May 28, 2020, with surveillance through May 21, 2021.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, accuracy of risk stratification and alternative screening methods, accuracy of tests, and screening harms were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data, while a second checked for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Complications of infection, infection transmission or acquisition, diagnostic accuracy of anatomical site-specific testing and collection methods, and screening harms were the main outcomes measured.

Twenty-seven studies were included (N = 179,515). Chlamydia screening, compared with no screening, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 2 of 4 trials and with reduced hospital-diagnosed PID (0.24% vs 0.38%; relative risk, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4–1.0]), but not clinic-diagnosed PID or epididymitis, in the largest trial.

### Duration of untreated, uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection and factors associated with chlamydia resolution: A review of human studies [^114WMwSV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections in humans are asymptomatic and without clinical evidence of complications at the time of diagnosis. The natural history of chlamydial infection in humans, including the duration of infection and factors influencing resolution of infection, is not yet completely understood. This is in part attributable to the inherent challenges and ethical considerations in studying untreated chlamydia in humans. An improved understanding of the natural history of chlamydia in humans has implications for chlamydia screening and treatment recommendations.

In April 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened an advisory group for the Chlamydia Immunology and Control Expert Advisory Meeting, where studies related to chlamydia natural history, pathogenesis, and immunobiology were reviewed. Gaps in our knowledge that would have implications for prevention and control of C. trachomatis infection were identified. This article summarizes the key questions posed and the evidence reviewed on the duration of untreated, uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection in humans and the factors associated with chlamydia resolution.

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with chlamydia: A before-and-after study [^116BBdNP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the impact of changing the clinical management for chlamydia contacts, shifting from routine treatment to a selective treatment approach. Our results showed that the selective treatment approach led to a significant 39% reduction in the number of contacts receiving treatment compared to the routine treatment approach. Given that only one-third of contacts tested positive for chlamydia, a selective treatment approach may be more appropriate to optimize antibiotic use and support antimicrobial stewardship.

Our results indicated that 56% of chlamydia contacts were treated before the test result during the selective treatment period. We could only identify one study evaluating the impact of switching from routine treatment to selective treatment for chlamydia contacts. Rasul et al. conducted a similar study at the Sydney Sexual Health Centre, evaluating the change from empirical antibiotic treatment to nonempirical antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic chlamydia and/or gonorrhea contacts. Rasul et al. found that among asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhea contacts, there was an 85% reduction (from 86% to 13%) in the proportion of chlamydia contacts who received empirical treatment. We also observed a 39% reduction (from 91% to 56%) in chlamydia contacts who received treatment before the test results after switching from routine treatment to selective treatment.

There are several reasons why the reduction in our study was lower compared with Rasul and colleagues' study. First, their study included only asymptomatic contacts for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.
