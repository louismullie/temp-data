## Question

Cannabinoid hyperemesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining CHS and its core clinical features. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and how to distinguish CHS from cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to examine pathophysiology. Then, I should appraise acute and long-term management, including guideline-backed therapies. Finally, I will consider special populations, prognosis, and knowledge gaps, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core features. CHS is a disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by recurrent, stereotyped episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in the setting of chronic, heavy cannabis use, with temporary relief from hot showers or baths and resolution with sustained cannabis cessation; it is classified under Rome IV as a CVS-like functional vomiting disorder, though some experts debate whether it is a distinct entity or a subset of CVS triggered by cannabis exposure [^188b25a0] [^463c31a1] [^9b4288fc].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before proceeding. The AGA clinical practice update proposes three descriptive criteria: stereotypical episodic vomiting (≥ 3/year, resembling CVS), cannabis use patterns (> 1 year, > 4 times/week), and resolution with abstinence (≥ 6 months or ≥ 3 typical cycles), with the caveat that no confirmatory test exists and clinicians should exclude mimics such as gastroparesis, rumination, pregnancy, migraine, and functional chronic nausea/vomiting; Rome IV CVS criteria inform the episodic framework but do not specify cannabis-related features, so applying AGA elements plus exclusion of alternatives is prudent [^fa97b760] [^c3c6d862] [^9b4288fc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about CHS versus CVS. I initially thought compulsive hot bathing was pathognomonic for CHS, but wait, I should double-check that. Hot bathing is common in CHS yet also occurs in about half of CVS patients, so it is supportive but not specific; distinguishing features include older age at onset, heavier/frequent cannabis use, and, in pediatrics, higher rates of positive drug screens and more pronounced electrolyte derangements in CHS compared with CVS, which can aid early recognition and reduce unnecessary imaging [^70106e0c] [^44aa5c65].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. CHS presentations have risen sharply in ED data, with national estimates suggesting CHS may account for a growing share of emesis-related visits, particularly among young adults; risk correlates with heavy (> 4 times/week), prolonged (> 1 year) cannabis use, early initiation (< 16 years), high-potency products, and co-use of tobacco or other substances, and ED-coded CHS increased from roughly 4 to 22 per 100,000 visits from 2016 to 2022, with a peak during 2020–2021 that likely reflects both increased exposure and diagnostic recognition [^faaeda2f] [^d85511ee] [^430212f0] [^be7dec46].

> I will now examine pathophysiology, but I need to be cautious because much of the evidence is hypothesis-generating. Proposed mechanisms include downregulation of CB1 receptors with chronic THC exposure, dysregulation of TRPV1 signaling that may explain hot-water relief, and hypothalamic involvement affecting thermoregulation and emesis; a biphasic effect of cannabinoids (antiemetic at low doses, pro-emetic at high/chronic doses) is frequently cited, though definitive causal data remain limited and warrant further study [^38ff63d4] [^5adb2204] [^8948f80c].

> Let me think about acute management and make sure I align with guidelines. Supportive care with IV fluids and electrolytes is foundational; standard antiemetics like ondansetron are often ineffective as monotherapy, so adjuncts with dopamine antagonists are recommended: SAEM GRACE-4 suggests haloperidol or droperidol in addition to usual care, and European UEG/ESNM guidance supports benzodiazepines, haloperidol, and/or topical capsaicin for acute episodes; topical capsaicin 0.1% applied to the upper abdomen is a reasonable adjunct with a favorable risk–benefit profile despite low-quality evidence, and opioids should be avoided due to poor efficacy and addiction risk [^ff49e776] [^927570af] [^c1715444] [^f45f7797] [^0792b013].

> I should confirm long-term management and the role of abstinence. Cannabis cessation is the only disease-modifying therapy; symptom resolution typically requires sustained abstinence for at least 6 months or three typical vomiting cycles, and relapse upon resumption is common, underscoring the need for structured cessation support; tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline 75–100 mg at bedtime are effective prophylaxis in about 70% of patients and should be offered even when diagnostic certainty is pending, with co-management for cannabis use disorder and psychiatric comorbidity to reduce recidivism [^fa97b760] [^0792b013] [^9d7a9441].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant, adolescent, or has atypical features. In pregnancy, CHS should be considered for intractable hyperemesis with hot bathing, with counseling on cessation and avoidance of teratogenic testing; in pediatrics and adolescents, CHS is increasingly recognized and often misclassified as CVS, so careful substance use screening and application of adult-informed criteria with age-appropriate counseling are essential; coexisting conditions like superior mesenteric artery syndrome can complicate the picture and mandate coordinated care and nutrition rehabilitation [^4e9bb595] [^ad03993d] [^43713446].

> I should double-check prognosis and recurrence patterns. Most patients improve with sustained abstinence, but recidivism is high and symptoms often recur with resumed use; longitudinal ED cohorts show persistent symptoms and repeated ED use within 3 months, highlighting the importance of linkage to addiction treatment and follow-up; with cessation and appropriate prophylaxis, many remain symptom-free, though long-term controlled data are sparse [^7b8c6fee] [^0792b013].

> Let me reconsider knowledge gaps so I don't overstate certainty. The literature remains heterogeneous, with many studies relying on case series and retrospective designs; standardized diagnostic criteria, prospective cohorts with biochemical confirmation of abstinence, and randomized trials of acute and prophylactic therapies are needed; the relationship between CHS and CVS remains debated, and genetic or endocannabinoid susceptibility markers have yet to be identified, limiting precision prevention and treatment [^9290a946] [^9b4288fc] [^38ff63d4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is clear and actionable. CHS is a cyclical vomiting syndrome linked to chronic, heavy cannabis use, with episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain temporarily relieved by hot bathing and definitively responsive to sustained cannabis cessation; diagnosis is clinical and requires exclusion of mimics, with AGA criteria guiding cannabis use patterns and abstinence confirmation; acute care prioritizes fluids, dopamine antagonists, and capsaicin while avoiding opioids, and long-term management hinges on cessation support and TCA prophylaxis; recognition is improving but underdiagnosis persists, so routine, nonjudgmental screening for cannabis use in patients with cyclical vomiting is essential to reduce morbidity and healthcare utilization [^fa97b760] [^ff49e776] [^0792b013] [^faaeda2f].

---

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a **cyclical vomiting disorder** linked to chronic, heavy cannabis use, with episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that are often relieved temporarily by hot showers or baths [^188b25a0]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on chronic cannabis use, recurrent vomiting, and resolution with cessation; exclude mimics such as gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and pregnancy [^fa97b760]. Acute management includes IV fluids, benzodiazepines, dopamine antagonists (haloperidol, droperidol), and topical capsaicin; long-term treatment requires **cannabis cessation**, with tricyclic antidepressants for prophylaxis [^0792b013] [^5256f507]. CHS is underrecognized and often misdiagnosed, leading to repeated ED visits and unnecessary testing; **education and cessation counseling are essential** to prevent recurrence [^99593f06] [^c1c7586b].

---

## Clinical presentation

CHS presents in **three phases**:

| **Phase** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Prodromal | - Early morning nausea <br/> - Abdominal discomfort <br/> - Fear of vomiting <br/> - Continued cannabis use [^1fc849e7] |
| Hyperemetic | - Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Compulsive hot showers/baths for relief [^188b25a0] |
| Recovery | - Symptom resolution with cannabis cessation <br/> - Normal eating returns <br/> - Weight regain [^1fc849e7] |

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact mechanism is unclear; proposed mechanisms include **CB1 receptor downregulation**, **TRPV1 activation** (explaining hot-water relief), and **hypothalamic dysregulation** of thermoregulation and emesis [^38ff63d4] [^5adb2204]. Chronic, high-dose THC may overwhelm the endocannabinoid system, causing a paradoxical hyperemetic response [^8948f80c].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis is **clinical** and requires:

- **Chronic cannabis use**: Typically > 4 times/week for > 1 year [^fa97b760].
- **Cyclical vomiting**: Stereotyped episodes resembling CVS [^188b25a0].
- **Resolution with cessation**: Symptoms resolve with sustained abstinence (≥ 6 months or ≥ 3 typical cycles) [^fa97b760].
- **Exclusion of mimics**: Gastroparesis, CVS, pregnancy, rumination, functional disorders [^fa97b760].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key mimics include **cyclic vomiting syndrome** (similar episodes, less compulsive bathing), **gastroparesis** (delayed gastric emptying), **pregnancy-related hyperemesis**, and **rumination syndrome** [^fa97b760]. Compulsive hot bathing is supportive but not specific to CHS [^449bb9ac].

---

## Management

### Acute management

- **Supportive care**: IV fluids, electrolyte correction, antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide) [^c1c7586b].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Lorazepam or diazepam for anxiety and emesis control [^c1c7586b].
- **Dopamine antagonists**: Haloperidol or droperidol are first-line adjuncts [^ff49e776] [^53da3979].
- **Topical capsaicin**: 0.1% cream to the abdomen; activates TRPV1 and reduces symptoms [^f45f7797] [^3be83220].

---

### Long-term management

Long-term management centers on **cannabis cessation** — the only definitive cure — with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline 75–100 mg nightly) for prophylaxis and relapse prevention [^0792b013] [^5256f507]. Behavioral support and addiction services improve adherence and outcomes [^9d7a9441].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent with sustained cessation**; symptoms typically resolve within weeks to months. Recurrence is common with resumed use, and repeated episodes can cause dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and renal injury [^430212f0].

---

## Epidemiology

CHS is increasingly recognized with rising cannabis use and potency; ED visits have surged, especially among young adults and heavy users [^99593f06] [^be7dec46]. Prevalence is likely underestimated due to underreporting and misdiagnosis [^38ff63d4].

---

## Prevention

Prevention relies on **patient education** about CHS, counseling on risks of heavy/prolonged cannabis use, and early recognition of symptoms to avoid delays in diagnosis and unnecessary testing [^c1c7586b].

---

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a **preventable and treatable** cause of cyclical vomiting in chronic cannabis users. Early recognition, supportive care, and **cannabis cessation** are the cornerstones of management, with dopamine antagonists and capsaicin providing acute relief.

### Rare but relevant: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^502023ed]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a (probably) rare syndrome that occurs in frequent and chronic cannabis users. It is characterised by cyclical vomiting and gastrointestinal symptoms. CHS is frequently misdiagnosed resulting in extensive investigations and delayed diagnosis and treatment. Standard anti-emetic treatments are typically not effective, and no standardised treatment protocol exists for CHS. Bathing or showering in hot water is often reported to relieve symptoms. Little is known of the aetiology of CHS as the literature is predominantly informed by case reports and chart reviews. Similarly, little is known of the demographics and cannabis use patterns of those who develop CHS. The number of CHS cases globally appears to have risen following liberalisation of cannabis regulation and access in some countries, underscoring the need for wider recognition of CHS in emergency care and by the wider public.

### Proper counseling for diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: a case report [^ca9ba340]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is an increasingly recognized condition linked to chronic cannabis use, yet it remains frequently overlooked in clinical practice. The syndrome is characterized by cyclic episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, often relieved temporarily by hot showers or baths. With the rising prevalence of cannabis use following its legalization, the incidence of CHS has surged, presenting a significant challenge in both diagnosis and management within primary healthcare settings. Understanding the epidemiology, risk factors, and potential long-term sequelae of CHS is crucial for timely identification and intervention. This case report highlights the challenge of diagnosis and management of CHS in primary healthcare.

Objective(S)

To emphasize the importance of proper counseling and the use of Rome IV criteria in diagnosing CHS. To illustrate how this may reduce patient suffering and unnecessary investigation.

Case

A 22-year-old female with chronic, daily cannabis use presented with recurrent episodes of intense nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain over a 2-year period. Extensive diagnostic evaluations were inconclusive. A tentative diagnosis of CHS was made by a medical student and family doctor based on published criteria. The Rome IV criteria were then applied for confirmation of diagnosis and management. In so doing, the patient was advised to cease cannabis use for a minimum of 3 months. Initially, symptom improvement was reported with cannabis cessation. However, symptoms recurred following a relapse in cannabis use.

Conclusion

To confirm the diagnosis of CHS, counseling should specify the need for a minimum of 3 months of cannabis cessation to achieve symptom relief. Increased physician and patient awareness of this minimal time period for drug cessation can help to avoid unnecessary investigations, and prolonged patient suffering. This case emphasizes the need for vigilance in recognizing CHS and consideration of cannabis as a potential cause of cyclic vomiting.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: commentary [^fa97b760]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) — diagnostic features and evaluation include three descriptive criteria and targeted exclusion of mimics. Clinical features are "stereotypical episodic vomiting resembling CVS in terms of onset, with frequency 3 or more times annually"; cannabis use patterns specify "duration of cannabis use more than 1 year before symptom onset; frequency more than 4 times per week, on average"; and cannabis cessation requires "resolution of symptoms after a period of abstinence from cannabis use for at least 6 months, or at least equal to the total duration of 3 typical vomiting cycles in that patient". In the absence of a confirmatory test, "limited individualized evaluation in the outpatient setting is advised to exclude disorders that can mimic CHS", and "There is no consensus about minimum testing in patients with suspicion of CHS; however, the approach to the diagnosis for chronic nausea and vomiting requires a good clinical history… may include anatomic evaluations… and other tests, as indicated". Emergency department (ED) assessment "requires immediate evaluation for life-threatening disorders", and differential exclusion of structural and functional mimics "includes rumination syndrome, gastroparesis, CVS, pregnancy, migraine, and functional chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome".

Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world. The medicinal value of cannabis as an antiemetic is well known by the medical fraternity. A less well-recognised entity is the potential for certain chronic users to develop hyperemesis. We describe the case of a young man who presented to us with features of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. We review the current literature on this condition, its pathogenesis and management.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment-a systematic review [^9bf02515]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a syndrome of cyclic vomiting associated with cannabis use. Our objective is to summarize the available evidence on CHS diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. We performed a systematic review using MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from January 2000 through September 24, 2015. Articles eligible for inclusion were evaluated using the Grading and Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Data were abstracted from the articles and case reports and were combined in a cumulative synthesis. The frequency of identified diagnostic characteristics was calculated from the cumulative synthesis and evidence for pathophysiologic hypothesis as well as treatment options were evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The systematic search returned 2178 articles. After duplicates were removed, 1253 abstracts were reviewed and 183 were included. Fourteen diagnostic characteristics were identified, and the frequency of major characteristics was as follows: history of regular cannabis for any duration of time (100%), cyclic nausea and vomiting (100%), resolution of symptoms after stopping cannabis (96.8%), compulsive hot baths with symptom relief (92.3%), male predominance (72.9%), abdominal pain (85.1%), and at least weekly cannabis use (97.4%). The pathophysiology of CHS remains unclear with a dearth of research dedicated to investigating its underlying mechanism. Supportive care with intravenous fluids, dopamine antagonists, topical capsaicin cream, and avoidance of narcotic medications has shown some benefit in the acute setting. Cannabis cessation appears to be the best treatment. CHS is a cyclic vomiting syndrome, preceded by daily to weekly cannabis use, usually accompanied by symptom improvement with hot bathing, and resolution with cessation of cannabis. The pathophysiology underlying CHS is unclear. Cannabis cessation appears to be the best treatment.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: clinical trajectories and patterns of use three months following a visit to the emergency department [^7b8c6fee]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a clinical condition of cyclic vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain associated with chronic cannabis use. Despite increased recognition of CHS, there are limited details on cannabis use practices and symptoms over time. Understanding what happens in the period surrounding the emergency department (ED) visit, including any changes in symptoms and cannabis use practices following the visit, can help inform the development of patient-centered interventions around cannabis use disorder for patients with CHS.

Methods

A prospective observational cohort (n = 39) of patients with suspected CHS recruited from the ED at the time of a symptomatic cyclic vomiting episode was followed for 3months. Disease progression, cannabis use practices, and health care utilization were monitored.

Results

Participants reported high rates of persistent CHS symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, or cyclic vomiting) in the 2-week period immediately following an ED visit with a median duration of 7days. Cannabis use frequency and quantity were reduced immediately after the ED visit, but most participants returned to pre-ED visit cannabis use patterns within a few days. Recurrent ED visits for cyclic vomiting were reported by 25% of participants who completed follow-up during the 3-month follow-up period.

Conclusions

Participants continued to have ongoing symptoms after the ED visit, but most managed symptoms on their own and did not return to the ED. Longitudinal studies beyond 3months are needed to better understand the clinical course of patients with suspected CHS.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^99593f06]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Despite these limitations, this cross-sectional study found that nationally representative ED data indicated a sustained rise in CHS-related visits from 2016 to 2022, especially among young adults. CHS now accounts for a growing share of emesis-related ED presentations. Given frequent misdiagnosis and costly, unnecessary testing, greater clinical awareness is needed. Targeted screening for cannabis use and recognition of symptom patterns could improve diagnostic accuracy. Although the new ICD-10 code might facilitate surveillance, its utility depends on clinician recognition. Validation studies to distinguish true incidence from coding shifts and misdiagnosis are also needed.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^faaeda2f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How did cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) present and change in US emergency departments (EDs) from 2016 to 2022?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, with more than 188 million ED visits, CHS visits clustered among adults aged 18 to 35 years, rose during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021, then plateaued. Among ED visits with primary cyclic vomiting syndrome, the conditional probability of CHS remained elevated in 2022.

Meaning

These findings suggest that CHS represents a growing share of emesis-related ED visits, especially among younger adults; greater awareness, standardized diagnostic practices, and use of the recently added International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes (F12.188) may improve recognition and management as cannabis use expands postlegalization.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and the onset of a manic episode [^0d139ff1]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a rare, recently described, clinically diagnosed condition that is characterised by a chronic history of cannabis use, cyclic nausea and vomiting, symptomatic relief with hot water bathing, and resolution with cessation of use. We present a case of this syndrome concurrent in a patient with bipolar mania. We suggest that a 3-week period of vomiting in the context of this syndrome contributed to the precipitation of a manic episode by lowering mood stabiliser serum levels, and that this syndrome will have significant consequences for the patient's mental health.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^37d52de2]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The antiemetic properties of marijuana are well known, but there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical hyperemetic effects on the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, known as 'cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome' (CHS). We report a case of CHS encountered in our outpatient clinic. We also completed a review of the literature using PubMed in patients over 18years of age with CHS. Understanding the diagnostic criteria and risk factors associated with CHS may reduce the ordering of unnecessary and expensive investigations, and pursuing inappropriate medical and surgical treatments. Ultimately, abstaining from cannabis use leads to resolution of symptoms in the majority of patients.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis: a case series [^bd6b60b7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid use is prevalent in the United States, with recent reports of increased usage among younger Americans. Traditionally, cannabinoids have been used recreationally or as antiemetics; however, recent reports suggest that chronic abuse can result in the paradoxical effect of a cyclic vomiting syndrome, termed cannabinoid hyperemesis.

Objective

We report on this recently described clinical syndrome characterized by severe nausea and hyperemesis in the setting of chronic cannabinoid use.

Case Reports

We report the cases of 3 patients who presented to two academic emergency departments (EDs) on multiple occasions with nausea and vomiting in the setting of chronic cannabinoid use. There were extensive medical evaluations and frequent inpatient hospital admissions before the diagnosis of cannabinoid hyperemesis was considered.

Conclusion

With the relatively high prevalence of cannabinoid use in the United States and increasing interest in the applications of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, this entity may be encountered in the ED. Cannabinoid hyperemesis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with similar symptoms.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^8948f80c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a form of functional gut-brain axis disorder characterized by bouts of episodic nausea and vomiting worsened by cannabis intake. It is considered as a variant of cyclical vomiting syndrome seen in cannabis users especially characterized by compulsive hot bathing/showers to relieve the symptoms. CHS was reported for the first time in 2004, and since then, an increasing number of cases have been reported. With cannabis use increasing throughout the world as the threshold for legalization becomes lower, its user numbers are expected to rise over time. Despite this trend, a strict criterion for the diagnosis of CHS is lacking. Early recognition of CHS is essential to prevent complications related to severe volume depletion. The recent body of research recognizes that patients with CHS impose a burden on the healthcare systems. Understanding the pathophysiology of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) remains central in explaining the clinical features and potential drug targets for the treatment of CHS. The frequency and prevalence of CHS change in accordance with the doses of tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids in various formulations of cannabis. CHS is unique in presentation, because of the cannabis's biphasic effect as anti-emetic at low doses and pro-emetic at higher doses, and the association with pathological hot water bathing. In this narrative review, we elaborate on the role of the ECS, its management, and the identification of gaps in our current knowledge of CHS to further enhance its understanding in the future.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: their intersection and joint existence [^24e05c5e]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) are 2 disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting that are stereotypical in nature with intervening periods of baseline health. While they share overlapping clinical features, their underlying pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management strategies differ. CVS is primarily a disorder of gut-brain interaction with a strong association with migraine and autonomic dysfunction, whereas CHS is directly linked to chronic and heavy use of cannabis. The prodromal, emetic, recovery, and interepisodic baseline health phases define their severity and dictate the prescribed therapeutic approach.

### Increasing prevalence of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in young adults and minority populations [^b0017ef2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prevalence rates for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) across demographic groups remain unclear.

Methods

We used data from the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis to estimate the rates of CHS from 2012–2021, across > 15 million emergency department (ED) visits and demographic groups.

Results

CHS cases per 10,000 ED visits increased from 0.729 to 10.6 in Massachusetts (2012–2021). Individuals aged 18–34 experienced the fastest rise in CHS prevalence, with young adults, Hispanic individuals, Black individuals, and males having the overall highest 10-year prevalence.

Discussion

Younger adults, Hispanic individuals and Black individuals may be at higher risk for presenting with CHS.

### Pediatric cannabinoid hyperemesis: two cases [^c88023a5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis has recently been described in the literature. It is a syndrome characterized by severe nausea and hyperemesis in the setting of chronic marijuana abuse and, to date, has been described only in adults. We describe the syndrome in 2 pediatric patients, for whom extensive gastrointestinal workups failed to identify a clear cause and cessation of marijuana use resulted in the alleviation of their symptoms. As in most published adult cases, compulsive bathing was present in both of these cases.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^f8d09ec1]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

The first description of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) was in 2004. It is characterised by cyclical nausea and vomiting, accompanied by abdominal pain after a prolonged high dose of cannabis use. Patients generally have a history of multiple emergency department visits and hospitalisations followed by extensive workups, including diagnostic imaging and invasive procedures. The recent legalisation on cannabis in many countries raises a concern about increased use.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^08b89491]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) presents with cyclical emetic episodes mimicking cyclic vomiting syndrome after long‐standing cannabis use, often with associated pathologic bathing behaviors and is currently diagnosed with Rome IV criteria.
A systematic review of the literature on CHS shows significant limitations due to incompletely characterized case series and individual cases, especially with regard to follow‐up, and variable diagnostic criteria which preceded development of Rome IV criteria.
The limitations of the Rome IV criteria are discussed with proposed revisions to optimize future diagnosis of CHS.
Future research in CHS focused on pathophysiology, clinical presentation and natural history is needed to ascertain whether CHS is a distinct entity or a subset of CVS.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: commentary [^9290a946]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) — CHS is a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by episodic nausea and vomiting associated with long-term use of cannabis. Because CHS and CVS share similar features and are linked to cannabis use, clinical distinction can be challenging. The prevalence of CHS is increasing in the United States, but overall prevalence remains unknown, and underdiagnosis is a challenge. Diagnostic criteria are based on clinical features, cannabis use patterns, and resolution of symptoms after cannabis cessation. Unfortunately, current management is based on limited evidence, and the frequency of recidivism is high. Further understanding of CHS pathophysiology and evidence-based therapies are urgently needed.

### RCEM best practice guideline: suspected cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in emergency departments [^11dc2959]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is an episodic syndrome of cyclic vomiting in the context of the prolonged use of cannabis. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine Toxicology Special Interest Group has produced guidance to support emergency medicine clinicians with the recognition and treatment of people experiencing CHS. Considerations regarding recognition, investigation and communication are discussed, and recommendations regarding treatment options (which include haloperidol and capsaicin) are made. There is a focus on making recommendations on the best available evidence.

Cannabis use has been increasing in the United States and throughout the world. It is derived from one of the earliest plants cultivated by humans - Cannabis sativa. Cannabis (also called marijuana) is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide. The cannabis plant has more than 400 chemicals, of which more than 100 cannabinoids (such as cannabigerol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol) have been identified. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an essential role in the effects of cannabis on end organs. Although cannabis use has been reported for many decades, some of its unique adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, termed as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), were noted recently. The legal status of cannabis in the United States has been rapidly changing from state to state. The incidence of CHS is expected to rise with rising access to cannabis in the United States. Furthermore, CHS is frequently underdiagnosed due to a lack of uniform criteria, subjective nature of symptoms, and overlap with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS). Understanding the ECS and its role in biphasic response (proemetic and antiemetic) of CHS is critical to explain its pathophysiology. As the use of cannabis increases globally, awareness of CHS is warranted for early recognition and prompt treatment to avoid complications. We describe the putative mechanism of CHS with an overview of the clinical features in these patients. Furthermore, we highlight the differences between CHS and CVS with important differentials to consider. We provide a narrative update on the current evidence on CHS pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and identifying research gaps.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: pathophysiology and treatment in the emergency department [^26c0e08a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a challenging clinical disorder. CHS patients frequently present to the emergency department and may require treatment for intractable emesis, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. Thought to be a variant of cyclic vomiting syndrome, CHS has become more prevalent with increasing cannabis potency and use, as enabled by various states having legalized the recreational use of cannabis.

Objective

This aim of this review is to investigate the pathophysiology of CHS and evaluate the published literature on pharmacologic treatment in the emergency department. This information may be helpful in providing evidence-based, efficacious antiemetic treatment grounded in knowledge of antiemetic medications' mechanisms of action, potentially precluding unnecessary tests, and reducing duration of stay.

Discussion

The endocannabinoid system is a complex and important regulator of stress response and allostasis, and it is occasionally overwhelmed from excessive cannabis use. Acute episodes of CHS may be precipitated by stress or fasting in chronic cannabis users who may have pre-existing abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feedback and sympathetic nervous system response. The reasons for this may lie in the physiology of the endocannabinoid system, the pathophysiology of CHS, and the pharmacologic properties of specific classes of antiemetics and sedatives. Treatment failure with standard antiemetics is common, necessitating the use of mechanistically logical sedating agents such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics.

Conclusion

Despite the increasing prevalence of CHS, there is a limited body of high-quality research. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics represent logical choices for treatment of CHS because of their powerful sedating effects. Topical capsaicin holds promise based on a totally different pharmacologic mechanism. Discontinuation of cannabis use is the only assured cure for CHS.

### Is haloperidol the wonder drug for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome? [^8c7ba46a]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a rare clinical syndrome characterised by nausea, cyclic vomiting and severe abdominal pain in association with chronic cannabis use. It is often under-recognised or misdiagnosed, resulting in the unnecessary workup and frequent hospitalisations. Long-term treatment of CHS is abstinence from cannabis, but acute symptomatic management has been a struggle for many clinicians. The present report highlights the use of haloperidol as an agent that successfully and safely treats the unrelenting symptoms of CHS.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE-4): alcohol use disorder and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome management in the emergency department [^ff49e776]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The fourth Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Guidelines for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-4) is on the topic of the emergency department (ED) management of nonopioid use disorders and focuses on alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). The SAEM GRACE-4 Writing Team, composed of emergency physicians and experts in addiction medicine and patients with lived experience, applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding six priority questions for adult ED patients with AWS, AUD, and CHS. The SAEM GRACE-4 Writing Team reached the following recommendations: (1) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with moderate to severe AWS who are being admitted to hospital, we suggest using phenobarbital in addition to benzodiazepines compared to using benzodiazepines alone [low to very low certainty of evidence]; (2) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD who desire alcohol cessation, we suggest a prescription for one anticraving medication [very low certainty of evidence]; (2a) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD, we suggest naltrexone (compared to no prescription) to prevent return to heavy drinking [low certainty of evidence]; (2b) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD and contraindications to naltrexone, we suggest acamprosate (compared to no prescription) to prevent return to heavy drinking and/or to reduce heavy drinking [low certainty of evidence]; (2c) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD, we suggest gabapentin (compared to no prescription) for the management of AUD to reduce heavy drinking days and improve alcohol withdrawal symptoms [very low certainty of evidence]; (3a) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) presenting to the ED with CHS we suggest the use of haloperidol or droperidol (in addition to usual care/serotonin antagonists, e.g., ondansetron) to help with symptom management [very low certainty of evidence]; and (3b) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) presenting to the ED with CHS, we also suggest offering the use of topical capsaicin (in addition to usual care/serotonin antagonists, e.g., ondansetron) to help with symptom management [very low certainty of evidence].

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^6011a1d7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

9 CONCLUSIONS

In summary, when the literature is taken as an aggregate, while there are some differences in the demographic profile (males vs female predominance) there is considerable overlap in the acute presentations of CHS and CVS. Our review of the literature reinforces our proposal that CHS is a subset of CVS in which chronic cannabis use triggers symptoms in patients who are genetically predisposed to develop CVS. Future studies should focus on standardized collection of data including cannabis‐use patterns and accurate phenotyping and genotyping of patients with CVS and CHS. Specifically, the potency of cannabis used, and antecedent duration and frequency of use should be characterized to assess its impact. Patients with presumed CHS should be advised to abstain from cannabis and should receive ongoing care from a multidisciplinary team including mental‐health and substance‐use experts. These patients should concomitantly be offered standard care with prophylactic and abortive therapy similar to patients with CVS. This is critical given the gaps in our knowledge about the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of CHS and the stigma that is associated with such a disorder. Future studies should also focus on elucidating the underlying pathophysiology such as the role of the ECS and the HPA axis in both CVS and CHS. This should advance our knowledge in this area and help in the development of novel and targeted therapies. Government and industry‐sponsored funding along with participation from patient advocacy groups such as the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA) are vital to achieve our goals of better understanding and treating this debilitating disorder.

Cannabis use patterns in CVS — experts have proposed that cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a subset of CVS when prolonged (> 1 year) and heavy cannabis use (ie, > 4 times weekly, but often daily) precedes symptom onset; in CVS, cannabis use is more occasional and often postdates onset, and expert consensus states that cannabis cessation required to retrospectively diagnose CHS should be 6 months or at least 3 typical cycle lengths for the patient, after which persistent vomiting rules out CHS; all patients, including those with ongoing cannabis use and diagnostic uncertainty, should be offered abortive and/or prophylactic therapy, which can still be effective despite ongoing cannabis use.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: commentary [^469d0f85]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Epidemiology of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) — Cannabis use has been increasing in the United States and throughout the world, and CHS is a subtype of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) associated with chronic (typically years) and heavy (typically daily or near-daily) cannabis use and is observed predominantly in males. In U.S. policy and use, California was the first state to permit the legal use of cannabis (medical marijuana) in 1996; since then, 37 states have legalized medical marijuana, and at least 21 states have legalized recreational marijuana, and marijuana is the most used federally illegal drug in the United States; an estimated 48.2 million people used it in 2019. Emergency department (ED) presentations have increased, with a Rhode Island cohort showing daily or multiple times per day use (median, 3 times per day), most (72%) reported having used cannabis before age 16 years, and almost all reporting high cannabis withdrawal scores; the prevalence of treatment for CHS in the ED doubled between 2017 and 2021 in North America, with the highest treatment prevalence among the 16–34 years age group. An internet-based study inclusive of CHS assessed 2100 people across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom and found the prevalence of CVS was higher in the United States (2%) than in Canada (0.7%) or the United Kingdom (1%) (P = 0.03); the proportion of subjects with CVS taking cannabis did not differ significantly among countries (P = 0.31), the 7 cases of CHS were in the United States, and hot water bathing to alleviate emetic symptoms was more common in CVS than in chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome (44% vs 19%; P = 0.03).

SAEM GRACE-4 — scope, populations, and burden in the emergency department are outlined as follows: Globally, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most prevalent substance use disorder (SUD) with over 100 million estimated cases in 2016, and cannabis use disorder (CUD) is the third most prevalent with an estimated 22 million cases worldwide, following opioid use disorder at 26 million cases. The objective is to provide an evidence-based, patient-centric approach for evaluation and management of three conditions commonly encountered in the adult emergency department (ED) — alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), AUD, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) — and the GRACE-4 panel applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRACE) approach to assess certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding three questions for adult ED patients with AWS, AUD, or CHS.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome masquerading as an eating disorder [^4723711c]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The case of a 22 year old woman with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) presenting as an eating disorder is described. The importance of recognizing chronic cannabis use as a cause of episodic vomiting is emphasized, given that CHS can be confused with self-induced purging and cyclic vomiting. This case was further complicated by the well-defined history of anorexia nervosa (binge-purge type), major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, migraine headache, and the initial denial of cannabis use. However, collateral history and a positive drug screen confirmed the diagnosis. The signs, symptoms and pathophysiological mechanisms of CHS are reviewed in light of clinical presentations that mimic eating disorder phenomenology complicated by addiction. Given the trend for increasing legalization of recreational marijuana as well as medical marijuana, CHS is an important and potentially complicating disorder that eating disorder clinicians need to be aware of. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in pediatrics: an emerging problem [^d785bf64]. Pediatrics in Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use has been evolving in both recreational drug use and medicinal uses, in part due to the recent introduction of various strains and components. With increasing use, we have seen emergence of a hyperemesis syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome characterized as intractable vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain in the context of prolonged cannabinoid use. Although the antiemetic properties of cannabis have been known for years, the paradoxical effect of hyperemesis has yet to be elucidated. Herein we discuss the current research, epidemiology, and diagnosis and treatment of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Without timely diagnosis and treatment, patients may experience significant physical and emotional distress, as well as place unnecessary financial burden on the medical system.

### Cannabis use patterns and association with hyperemesis: a comprehensive review [^70106e0c]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis use in the general population is prevalent and is rising because of increased acceptance of its use, legalization in most US states, and perceived health benefits. Cannabis product potency has dramatically increased with higher delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol content. Cannabis has documented antiemetic properties and cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are used in disorders like chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Purpose

Forty to eighty percent of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) patients use cannabis products, which reportedly reduce stress as well as nausea and vomiting. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) has a presentation similar to CVS, but is associated with longstanding, high dose cannabis use, and is thought to be relieved by sustained cannabis abstinence. Most CHS patients have used cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis for more than 2years. Compulsive hot-water bathing behaviors are reported by most CHS patients, but are not specific for this disorder as they are also noted by about half of CVS patients. Episodic vomiting associated with cannabis use contributes to extensive health resource use, including emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations, and impacts patients and their families negatively. Treatment for CHS overlaps with CVS although cannabis abstinence remains the cornerstone of its management. Challenges associated with cannabis use cessation in CHS include patient skepticism of the role of cannabis as a cause of symptoms, perceived benefits of cannabis, and a lack of other effective therapies. In this review, we highlight cannabis use patterns in the US and discuss diagnosis and management of CHS and gaps in knowledge about this disorder.

### Increasing trends of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in youth: the grass is not always greener [^73180e96]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

This study investigated trends in suspected cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)-related emergency department visits among youth (15–24 years old) in the United States between 2006 and 2020. Using data from the Nationwide Emergency Room Sample, over 55,000 suspected CHS-related visits were identified, with an average annual increase of 28.1% per year. This aligns with rising cannabis use and potency across the nation. Subjects in the western region, males, and those with public insurance were more likely to present with suspected CHS. These findings highlight the growing public health concern of CHS and emphasize the need for increased awareness among healthcare providers, particularly regarding the potential link between CHS and chronic cannabis use in youth. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and risk factors associated with CHS as well as the impact of cannabis public policy on health outcomes.

7 DIAGNOSIS OF CHS

The diagnostic criteria used for CHS have been heterogenous leading to significant confusion about what constitutes CHS and even whether it a separate entity. While the Rome IV criteria lay a framework for making a diagnosis of CHS, it has limitations and thus warrants iterative revision. The CVS Guidelines Committee proposes a revised set of criteria to optimize the diagnostic accuracy of CHS. Our proposed revised criteria are shown below in Table 3. There was consensus among the majority of committee members regarding the proposed revised criteria. These criteria provide more specific details regarding patterns of cannabis use and in particular the duration of follow‐up required for establishing the diagnosis, which are not adequately specified in the Rome IV criteria. Our proposed criteria were developed following a review of the available literature, properties of cannabis and our cumulative knowledge of purported CHS. Both the case series and individual case reports support our proposed revised criteria.

Table 3
Proposed new diagnostic criteria for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)

Note

Cyclic vomiting episodes following chronic cannabis use are required for a diagnosis of CHS. In contrast to Rome IV, we have specified that at minimum, cannabis use of > 4 times/week for at least a year preceding the onset of cyclic vomiting is necessary for the development of CHS. This is supported by current literature showing that prolonged, high‐dose cannabis use precedes development of CHS in the majority of described cases. Most patients in both the case series and case reports reported daily cannabis use for more than a year. Patients using < 4 times/week are "occasional cannabis users" and should not be considered to have CHS. Data describing amounts, potency, and routes of cannabis used were less complete, and we propose that future data collection be standardized and comprehensive with details regarding cannabis use (Table 4). This will be important as there may exist thresholds for cannabis use (ie, by duration, route, frequency of use, and/or dosing), which can lead to hyperemesis in individual patients.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^c1c7586b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Management

The following expert consensus treatment guideline is available to assist with the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of CHS:

Cessation of cannabis use, which is the only standard treatment reported in the current literature. CHS can recur on the resumption of cannabis use if the patient is in the recovery phase. Generally, it is thought that cannabinoid receptors return to normal levels after 4 weeks of cessation.
Avoiding opioids to avoid addiction.
These actions should be aided by supportive therapy, which includes: IV fluids for dehydration. Antiemetic medication such as ondansetron 4–8 mg IV or orally, promethazine 12.5 mg IV and metoclopramide 10 mg IV. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam 1 mg IV, diazepam 5–10 mg IV and diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV have also been found to be helpful.

A hot shower may alleviate symptoms and be beneficial to the patient.

The application of capsaicin cream to the abdomen may provide some symptomatic relief for patients.

Education, reassurance and referral to cessation programmes are important factors in management.
For refractory and severe nausea or vomiting in CHS, haloperidol should be considered.

Awareness of this condition can prevent unnecessary investigations, save costs, and reduce hospital admissions in selected patients.

Learning points

The following are essential points of in-patient care:

Good history taking, including illicit cannabis use, may reduce health costs.
Cessation of cannabis use is the only known successful cure for this recurrent condition, as demonstrated in this patient.
Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is not a common condition, so whenever it is diagnosed it needs to be reported so that new manifestations can be recorded and patients can be appropriately managed.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) management — Combining evidence-based psychosocial interventions and pharmacology may be necessary for successful long-term management of CHS. Preliminary evidence from 2 small placebo-controlled, randomized studies in adults with cannabinoid use disorder suggests that both fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors and CBD can reduce cannabis use, but larger studies are necessary. Other frequently suggested strategies lack scientific validation, such as switching to a lower Δ9THC/higher CBD formulation, use of edible forms, and avoiding Δ9THC concentrates. A single-center experience reported that > 40% of patients could stop oral treatments for CHS over time, but recidivism was high. Co-management with a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful for patients who have a lack of response to standard therapies or extensive psychiatric comorbidity. Anxiety and depression are very common associated conditions.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^38ff63d4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

As of June 2025, nearly half of all US residents lived in states with legalized recreational cannabis. The rapid and broad-scale changes in cannabis legality have been closely monitored by public health researchers, epidemiologists, and addiction researchers to evaluate whether legalization has produced adverse health outcomes. Evidence to date remains modest and mixed.

Among cannabis-related harms, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) has emerged as a growing public health concern. First identified in 2004 in Australia, the syndrome has uncertain etiology but several neurophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, including downregulation of high cannabinoid 1 receptors, altered transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 signaling, and disrupted hypothalamic thermoregulation. Genetic susceptibility has also been suggested, but evidence remains limited. In contrast, explanations attributing CHS to nonspecific gastrointestinal syndromes or environmental contaminants are not supported by scientific evidence.

CHS presents with recurrent severe nausea and emesis, often with abdominal pain and compulsive hot bathing. Risk increases with prolonged use (> 6 months), use of high potency products (eg, vapes), and daily or near-daily use. Patients with CHS often present repeatedly to emergency departments (EDs) but are frequently misdiagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) or other nonspecific gastrointestinal conditions; some clinicians believe that these patients are exaggerating their symptoms for another purpose. When diagnosed, CHS has typically been inferred from a CVS diagnosis (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] code R11.15) or nonspecific emesis (ICD-10 code R11) accompanied by a cannabis-related diagnosis such as cannabis abuse (ICD-10 code F12.1) or poisoning (ICD-10 code T40.711). A dedicated CHS code (F12.188) only became available with the 2025 ICD-10 update. Cannabis use is frequently underreported in survey contexts and likely in clinical settings such as the ED. Limited studies comparing verified substance use with ED diagnoses suggest underreporting, leading to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.

Case presentation

A patient in his mid-40s presented to the emergency department, where he complained of a 48-hour history of nausea and uncontrollable bilious vomiting with no blood. The patient also reported burning abdominal pain but no diarrhoea or fever. There was a history of similar episodes, the most recent being a year ago, when extensive tests were done with no specific positive findings. The patient was admitted, treated symptomatically, and discharged with a diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain. The patient had an over 10-year history of smoking cannabis and cigarettes and alcohol consumption of 4–5 units a week. The patient had stopped drinking and smoking cigarettes 2 years earlier because of the suspicion that these might be the cause of the symptoms, but continued to smoke cannabis.

Examination revealed an ill-looking patient who also appeared to be anxious. His temperature, heart rate and blood pressure were 36.6°C, 60 beats per minute and 139/82 mmHg, respectively. His respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness and normal bowel sounds with no succussion splash and no masses. Examination of other systems was unremarkable. Several differential diagnoses were considered. Pancreatitis was one possibility because of the history of chronic alcohol use; however, his presentation and the reported character of pain were not typical of pancreatitis. Peptic ulcer disease, because of alcohol intake and smoking, was also considered; however, he had been treated for this condition previously without any improvement in symptoms. Lastly, acute hepatitis was considered unlikely as there was no jaundice and no typical right upper quadrant pain.

1.3 Emergency department issues inand: The patient experience

Despite the best attempts to abort episodes at home, most CVS and CHS patients will seek ED treatment at some point. Repeated ED visits can be frustrating for patients and providers. Stigmatization and the perceived patient‐blaming of those in a vulnerable state can amplify an already frustrating and complex patient experience. It is worth considering the treatment environment and the processes of care that occur in the ED. There are certainly some Emergency or Urgent Care Centers that offer a calm, reassuring environment in which staff acknowledge a CVS/CHS diagnosis and initiate effective treatments. However, this is not always what the patient or families experience. Despite the best efforts of staff, Emergency Departments are the last resort for many of the ills of the healthcare system. The typical ED may be harshly lit, noisy, frightening, unresponsive, or impersonal. Care may not occur for many hours after an initial assessment. Patients who are judged to have non‐life‐threatening status simply are given a lower priority than those with active bleeding, trauma, or other more dramatic presentations due to the nature of limited resources and the need for triage. The consequence is that patients and families often find the ED experience frustrating, and this may delay presentation to the ED well into the course of their episode when symptoms may have become more refractory to simpler interventions. Lastly, patients with CVS may use cannabis intermittently, many times even specifically to abort an episode, whereas CHS patients have patterns of more chronic and/or heavy use of cannabis. Unfortunately, in many cases, patients suspected of CHS (often in error, based on the patient's admission of occasional cannabis use) do not receive appropriate care and are informed that "nothing can be done" other than to quit cannabis. Current efforts are underway to educate physicians about CVS and CHS. All patients, whether CVS or CHS, deserve to be treated with abortive therapy in the ED.

### ED visits for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome following cannabis legalization and commercialization… [^be7dec46]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cross-sectional study including 12 866 ED visits for CHS from 8140 individuals, rates of CHS ED visits increased by 13-fold over 7. 5 years. Legalization was not associated with increased CHS visits, but market commercialization, which overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, was. Objectives To examine changes in the number and characteristics of CHS emergency department visits from before to after legalization of cannabis in Ontario, Canada. Design, Setting, and Participants. various health concerns, including psychosis, anxiety, depression, altered brain functioning, and dependence. 3–6 Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome is a lesser-known complication associated with persistent use of high potency cannabis, involving repeated episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 7, 8 To date, several studies have found increases in emergency department visits owing to vomiting or CHS after the legalization of medical or recreational cannabis.

9–12 However, the characteristics of individuals with CHS have only previously been described in small studies or case series, limiting our understanding of who is at risk of this condition. Our findings have important policy implications within Canada and for other jurisdictions that have already or are considered legalizing recreational cannabis. While prior studies have broadly found that legalization is associated with increases in CHS presentations, our results suggest that regulatory approaches may influence these changes. 9–12 We found that legalization with strict controls over retail store access and product type was not associated with large changes in CHS. In contrast, allowing the commercialization of recreational cannabis may be associated with substantial increases in heavy and regular cannabis use, leading to CHS.

Collectively, these findings suggest that policies that restrict product variety and strength and place limits on retail store access may reduce increases in CHS after legalization. In addition, our observation that CHS ED visits increased for individuals older than but not younger than the legal age of purchase suggests that setting a higher legal age of purchase could reduce harms from legalization in youth and young adults. This is the largest study to our knowledge to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes of individuals with CHS. We found that CHS ED visits were highest in young adults and individuals living in low-income neighborhoods and occurred equally in men and women, which is consistent with patterns of self-reported daily cannabis use. 2, 29 We observed that women and young adults experienced the largest increases in CHS ED visits after legalization.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^4a00c6dd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe nausea and vomiting and is currently defined by Rome IV criteria. 1 Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) shares many clinical features with CVS except for its association with chronic, heavy cannabis use. CHS was first described in 2004 by Allen et al 2 in nine patients. This report was followed by several case series and individual case reports describing a similar pattern of episodic nausea and severe vomiting referred to as "hyperemesis". 3, 4 Heavy cannabis use preceded the onset of symptoms in these patients, suggesting that chronic cannabis use leads to hyperemesis. A diagnostic framework for CHS was proposed, although there has been considerable variation in the diagnostic criteria used in the literature to define cases. This heterogeneity has led to significant controversy and uncertainty about CHS as a distinct entity.

8 IS CHS A SEPARATE ENTITY?

8.1 Epidemiology and clinical features

The striking similarities between CVS and CHS suggest that CHS may in fact represent a subset of CVS rather than being a distinct disease. To be considered separate conditions, CHS and CVS must affect different patient populations or exhibit differentiating clinical features, longitudinal courses, and/or responses to disease‐specific therapies which would benefit one but not the other condition. The pathogenic importance of cannabis as a cause or trigger of nausea and vomiting syndromes is supported by recent epidemiologic findings showing 8% yearly increases in hospital discharges for persistent vomiting after cannabis legalization compared to the prelegalization era. 175 However, this may be due to a recognition bias, as the pattern of cyclic vomiting was not recognized by > 80% of the time by (ED) physicians. 176 Of note, the same study indicated that a treatment protocol for CVS was available to ED physicians only in a minority of cases. This underscores the importance of having a specific protocol for management of CVS in an acute care setting, which can aid ED physicians streamline management of CVS in the future. It is possible that the liberalization and legalization of cannabis, with the concomitant media exposure, has inadvertently highlighted this previously unrecognized pattern of cyclic vomiting, leading to increased recognition of this pattern diagnosed as CHS over the last decade.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: an important differential diagnosis of persistent unexplained vomiting [^eae16107]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic nausea and vomiting have a detrimental impact on quality of life. When standard diagnostic investigations fail to provide a definitive diagnosis, patients are often attributed as having a functional gastrointestinal disorder such as cyclic vomiting syndrome. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a relatively recently described entity presenting with symptoms similar to cyclic vomiting syndrome.

Methods

We carried out a retrospective cohort study of all patients attending a tertiary neurogastroenterology and secondary care gastroenterology clinic from 2013 to 2015. Data were obtained by review of clinical notes, letters and electronic patient records.

Results

We identified 10 cases of CHS (five men, mean age 27 years, range 19–51), who hitherto had been labelled with a variety of alternative diagnoses. All patients had symptoms that were episodic and refractory to medical therapy. Patients had experienced symptoms for a mean of 19.3 ± 11.09 months before diagnosis. The median length of cannabinoid use was 42 months (interquartile range: 15–81.8). Eight patients (80%) had a history of compulsive hot water bathing (hydrophilia). The patients had a median follow-up of 9.5 months (range 1–20), during which symptoms recurred in three patients who returned to regular cannabis use.

Conclusion

CHS is an underappreciated cause of recurrent nausea and vomiting and is frequently misdiagnosed. Healthcare providers should have a low index of suspicion for diagnosing CHS and the clinical history in such patients should routinely include direct questioning on cannabis use. The prognosis is very good upon cessation of cannabis intake.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: a cause of refractory nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^4e9bb595]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a condition present among chronic cannabis users resulting in abdominal pain, intractable nausea and vomiting, and compulsive bathing behaviors. Given the recent legalization of marijuana in certain areas of the United States, the incidence of this condition may increase among pregnant women.

Case

We report the case of a pregnant 28-year-old woman with multiple admissions for episodic nausea and vomiting resulting in Mallory-Weiss esophageal tears, dehydration, and abdominal pain who was noted to be showering compulsively during her hospitalizations. After an extensive workup for the etiology of her intractable nausea and pain, she was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which is treated simply with abstinence from marijuana use.

Conclusion

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome should be considered in pregnant women with intractable nausea relieved by frequent hot bathing. By considering this diagnosis, extensive diagnostic testing can be avoided and the correct therapy, abstaining from cannabis use, can be recommended.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis is a syndrome characterized by severe nausea and hyperemesis associated with chronic marijuana abuse and marked by compulsive bathing habits, which temporarily alleviate symptoms. We describe the syndrome in 4 adult patients for whom extensive gastrointestinal evaluations failed to identify another clear cause. Cessation of marijuana use resulted in the alleviation of their symptoms. Because recreational and medical use of marijuana is increasing in the United States, this condition should be considered in many patients who present with cyclical vomiting.

Diagnosis

CHS is traditionally diagnosed as the presence of hyperemesis in the setting of chronic cannabis use associated with pathological hot bathing behaviors. However, there has been considerable heterogeneity in previous literature with respect to categorizing patients with this diagnosis. CHS involves 3 phases: prodromal, hyperemetic and recovery. The prodromal phase is characterized by nausea, abdominal discomfort and fear of vomiting. The hyperemetic phase includes intense and multiple episodes of vomiting, which bring the patient to medical attention. After symptoms improve, the recovery phase starts with the establishment of normal eating behaviors. Episodic nausea and vomiting occur with a history of chronic use of cannabis. Under-recognition of this disorder can lead to multiple investigations with increased healthcare expenses. Sometimes, patients may also report a recent increase in cannabis use or a change in their source of cannabis purchase, which could indicate a change in the potency of cannabis. Some patients report relief of their symptoms with compulsive use of hot showers. Other disorders, such as Addison's disease, migraine headaches, hyperemesis of pregnancy, bulimia, and psychogenic vomiting, can also mimic these symptoms. However, these diagnoses can also coexist with CHS.

A thorough history, physical examination and directed testing of differential diagnoses may assist in ruling out these diagnoses. The Rome IV criteria provide some objectivity to help with the diagnosis by placing CHS under the heading of functional gut-brain disorders, and consider it as a variant of CVS (Table 2). Venkatesan et al have proposed a new criterion for CHS with the use of clinical features, cannabis use patterns including duration and frequency, and symptoms resolution after at least 6 months of cessation. However, questions remain about the dosage of cannabis, individual and genetic susceptibility, abstinence period and the inclusion of abdominal pain as a criterion. The clinical effects of volume depletion dominate complications related to CHS. Reports of severe volume depletion resulting in acute kidney injury and severe electrolyte disturbances with rhabdomyolysis have been reported in the literature. Severe and persistent vomiting can also lead to Mallory-Weiss tear.

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^e44c86a5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Beyond being miserable to experience, protracted bouts of repetitive retching and vomiting put those with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) at risk for immediate complications such as acute kidney injury from dehydration, arrhythmia from electrolyte disturbances, or hematemesis from Mallory‐Weiss tears. The disruption and impact of CVS and CHS on patients' and their families' lives and livelihoods cannot be overstated. CVS and CHS episodes are typically unpredictable, and thus often interfere with work, education, and family activities. Furthermore, the intense nausea and vomiting during a CVS/CHS attack and the frequent need for ED‐based care precludes any other activity. CVS and CHS are associated with significant healthcare utilization and both direct and indirect costs on society. In the long term, the cycle of repeated attacks can have devasting consequences with loss of work, education opportunities, and strains on relationships, and about a third of CVS patients become disabled by their condition.

Although CVS may be more easily diagnosed by expert clinicians, the more common experience is that the condition is poorly recognized by most physicians. Consequently, it may take years for patients to be given a correct diagnosis. Patients often develop immense frustration and even despondency in failing to gain a clear diagnosis or effective management plan, and patients may seek out multiple EDs in hopes of accessing optimal care. A definitive diagnosis of CVS or CHS is often viewed by patients as a relief and validates the patient's suffering.

There is wide variation in the clinical presentations of CVS and CHS, which may reflect distinct mechanisms that drive the episodes, and there is no one‐size‐fits‐all treatment. Nonetheless, it is imperative that patients with CVS and CHS have access to effective treatments that can potentially abort or significantly mitigate attacks at home. Abortive therapies are more effective when taken at the earliest detected onset of an episode. However, even with the best home management, many patients will still require acute medical care in a hospital emergency department (ED). This article summarizes best practices and the current paradigm for abortive therapy in patients with CVS and CHS.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is associated with high disease burden: an internet-based survey [^a8fb9118]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is an underrecognized condition associated with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain in individuals with prolonged cannabis use. This study used an internet-based survey targeting individuals with self-reported cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome to assess the burden of disease and to examine associations between heavy cannabis use, early initiation of cannabis use, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome episode frequency. A total of 1,052 participants were included, with the majority reporting frequent cannabis use and significant health care utilization, including emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This study highlights the substantial disease burden associated with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in an online support group cohort and underscores the possible risks of heavy daily cannabis use and of use starting in adolescence. Future studies on heavy cannabis users are necessary to further elucidate cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and its link to daily cannabis use and the dangers of heavy use in adolescence.

6 RESULTS

Our review of the literature identified a total of 25 case series (n = 271) and 105 individual case reports of patients identified with CHS (Table 2). Most of the reported case series and case studies predated the publication of Rome IV criteria for CHS. Not surprisingly, these earlier reports had significant heterogeneity in the criteria used to define CHS cases. Some authors diagnosed CHS when patients presented with cyclic vomiting in the context of chronic cannabis use. Others used cyclic vomiting with hot shower bathing patterns as pathognomonic features of CHS.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: commentary [^0792b013]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) — management focuses on symptomatic relief, avoidance of harmful agents, and cannabis cessation with tricyclic antidepressant support. "Evidence to support treatment for CHS is limited to case series and small clinical trials supporting the use of topical capsaicin, benzodiazepines, haloperidol, promethazine, olanzapine, and ondansetron for acute and short-term care". "Topical capsaicin may improve symptoms by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 receptors", and "Opioids should be avoided due to worsening of nausea and high risk of addiction". For long-term therapy, "counseling to achieve marijuana cessation and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are the mainstay of therapy, with the minimal effective dose being 75–100 mg at bedtime, starting at 25 mg and titrating the dose with increments each week to reach minimal effective dose with a close monitoring of efficacy and adverse effects". Dosing details include "Topical capsaicin (0.1%) cream is applied to the upper abdomen and may reduce the need for antiemetics". Although "Cannabis cessation is considered necessary for successful treatment of CHS", abrupt cessation "may be associated with significant withdrawal symptoms and high frequency of recidivism", and "a tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline… maintained at a dose of 75–100 mg at bedtime, is efficacious in approximately 70% of patients".

Summary

Cannabis use is legalised in many countries. We present a patient in their 40s who complained of recurrent abdominal pain and associated nausea and vomiting. The patient was previously seen in various hospitals, treated symptomatically, and discharged with a diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain. The patient had a chronic history of smoking cannabis and nicotine and drinking alcohol. Abdominal examination revealed no masses, and abdominal X-ray was normal. Blood tests and gastroduodenoscopy revealed no obvious aetiology. Intravenous fluids, together with antiemetics and proton pump inhibitors, were administered. The patient also received counselling and was advised to stop cannabis use. At discharge, the patient was well and asked to come back for review in 2 weeks, and, thereafter monthly for a period of 6 months after stopping cannabis use. The patient reported no recurrent symptoms despite continued cigarette and alcohol use. A suspected cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) became a consideration. Awareness of cannabis-related disorders such as CHS may assist in avoiding costly hospital workups.

### Distinguishing clinical features of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and cyclic vomiting syndrome: a retrospective cohort study [^44aa5c65]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify clinical characteristics that distinguish cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) from cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), 2 conditions marked by episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to a large children's health care system from 2015 through 2022. Patients with CHS and CVS were identified by the electronic medical record using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes.

Results

Of 201 patients screened, 125 were included. Patients with CHS were older than those with CVS (mean [SD] 18.06 [1.41] vs 14.50 [2.91] years, P < .001). There were no significant differences in sex, race, ethnicity, or hospital length of stay between groups. Patients with CHS were more likely to have a positive urine drug screen (86% vs 2.9%, P < .001), lower mean (SD) serum potassium (3.62 [0.77] vs 3.88 [0.49], P < .001), and greater mean (SD) serum creatinine (0.83 (0.41) vs 0.63 (0.17), P < .001). The average (SD) systolic blood pressure was significantly greater in patients with CHS (systolic blood pressure 124.46 [10.66] vs 118.55 [10.99], P = 0.032) compared with children of comparable age range with CVS. Imaging was obtained in 36% of all patients, and only 2.4% had abnormalities.

Conclusions

Clinical features including older age, greater systolic blood pressure, positive urine drug screen, and select electrolyte findings might distinguish CHS from CVS. Abdominal imaging in both conditions is of low yield. These findings may allow for early recognition and appropriate therapy in CHS patients.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^8348a4c4]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Cannabis is commonly used in cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) due to its antiemetic and anxiolytic properties. Paradoxically, chronic cannabis use in the context of cyclic vomiting has led to the recognition of a putative new disorder called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Since its first description in 2004, numerous case series and case reports have emerged describing this phenomenon. Although not pathognomonic, a patient behavior called "compulsive hot water bathing" has been associated with CHS. There is considerable controversy about how CHS is defined. Most of the data remain heterogenous with limited follow-up, making it difficult to ascertain whether chronic cannabis use is causal, merely a clinical association with CVS, or unmasks or triggers symptoms in patients inherently predisposed to develop CVS. This article will discuss the role of cannabis in the regulation of nausea and vomiting, specifically focusing on both CVS and CHS, in order to address controversies in this context. To this objective, we have collated and analyzed published case series and case reports on CHS in order to determine the number of reported cases that meet current Rome IV criteria for CHS. We have also identified limitations in the existing diagnostic framework and propose revised criteria to diagnose CHS. Future research in this area should improve our understanding of the role of cannabis use in cyclic vomiting and help us better understand and manage this disorder.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition characterized by cyclical vomiting without other identifiable cause in patients with chronic cannabis use. Patients with CHS report that compulsive bathing and hot showers are the only reliable treatments to improve symptoms. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is usually unresponsive to conventional pharmacologic antiemetics, and patients often require hospital admission. We report a case of CHS that improved significantly after treatment with haloperidol in the emergency department.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^ce661535]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Both CHS and CVS are characterized by episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and often abdominal pain that are relentless and can often be debilitating. They are typically self‐limited in nature with or without supportive therapy. These and other similar clinical features support our hypothesis that CHS is a subset of CVS where chronic cannabis use either unmasks or propagates symptoms in individuals who are predisposed to develop CVS. However, many reports of CHS include patients presenting for the first time with vomiting (often associated with other potential causes of emesis like pregnancy). 45, 170 Given the limited details provided, these observations reflect primarily the inadequacies of the published reports. However, they also raise the possibility that chronic cannabis use can cause symptoms of nausea and vomiting that are not episodic in pattern, and thus would clearly be distinct from CVS. This possibility would need to be confirmed or refuted in future series, perhaps best addressed in a matched cohort study.

8.2 Treatment options for CHS

It has been contended that patients with CHS do not respond to standard therapies used for CVS. 183 One report determined that chronic cannabis users with CVS respond less often to prophylactic treatment with tricyclic antidepressants compared to those not on cannabis. 184 However, no multivariate comparisons were performed, and other known confounding factors (use of opioids and associated psychiatric comorbidities) that are associated with poor responses to TCAs were not considered. Conversely, another case series of patients with CVS with high proportions of cannabis users reported > 80% response rates to tricyclic medications. 185 Moreover, Venkatesan et al in another series which applied multivariate regression analysis did not observe differences in response rates to standard prophylactic agents like TCAs in patients with CVS based on cannabis use. 181 Very little rigorous study has been devoted to use of prophylactic treatment of CHS, with no definitive indication that CHS requires a specific pharmacological approach distinct from that used for CVS prophylaxis. Based on these observations, we recommend that patients with moderate‐to‐severe cyclic vomiting that use cannabis be offered the same prophylactic medical therapies offered to patients with CVS.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^51ae48b0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This cross-sectional study documents a marked increase in ED visits consistent with CHS from 2016 to 2022, with the most pronounced rise occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidence was stable through 2019, rose sharply during 2020 to 2021, then declined modestly. Whereas cannabis-related diagnoses and CHS both exhibited sharp increases during 2020 and 2021, the rate of CVS diagnoses remained relatively stable. This divergence suggests that the increase in CHS may not reflect a general rise in emesis-related conditions, but rather a shift in the proportion of emesis cases attributable to cannabis use. Notably, the probability of receiving a CHS diagnosis among patients with a primary CVS diagnosis mirrored the broader rise in cannabis-related diagnoses, supporting the idea that increased cannabis exposure may be driving a growing subset of emesis cases. These results also align with evidence that legalization has facilitated access to high-potency cannabis, which is associated with acute harms, including CHS.

The COVID-19 pandemic likely catalyzed the rise in CHS through stress, isolation, and increased cannabis use. After peaking in 2021, CHS incidence declined but plateaued above prepandemic levels, suggesting sustained structural or clinical drivers. The absence of a clear rise in CHS prior to 2020, despite expanding cannabis legalization and increasingly available high-potency products, presents a paradox. One possibility is underdiagnosis or misclassification before the syndrome gained broader clinical recognition. The post-2020 surge may thus reflect both increased exposure as well as increased diagnostic vigilance.

These findings underscore the importance of preparing ED clinicians and public health systems for the downstream consequences of increasing cannabis use, particularly with expanded access to high-potency consumables and in states where legalization is recent. CHS may be underrecognized in such environments, with failure to identify the condition leading to unnecessary testing and ineffective treatment as noted. Clinical guidelines and decision-support tools could aid clinicians in distinguishing CHS from other gastrointestinal conditions, especially in younger adults with chronic cannabis exposure.

5 CHS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

5.1 Methods

We conducted a review of all cases diagnosed with CHS from January 2000 to March 2018. The objective of our study was to identify all articles relevant to the diagnosis of CHS and to determine what proportion of previously reported CHS patients would meet current Rome IV criteria for CHS. We obtained articles used in the original literature search by Monte et al using MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from January 2000 through September 24, 2015. 43 Search terms included cannabinoids, cannabis, marijuana abuse, medical marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, hyperemesis, emesis, vomiting, cannabis addiction, medical cannabis and hyperemesis. This search had identified a total of 2178 articles, of which 183 articles were available for inclusion.

A second literature search was then repeated using the same search terms in the time frame of September 25, 2015‐March 2018 in order to capture additional articles that were published after the original search by Monte et al. A total of 864 abstracts were reviewed, and articles relevant to the diagnosis of CHS were included. Those that primarily addressed treatment with capsaicin, duplicate articles, studies published in non‐English journals, and those that were not relevant to CHS were excluded from analysis. Many patients in both the case series and individual reports had comorbid diagnoses that may have contributed to refractory nausea and vomiting, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, and these cases were also excluded. Patients presenting with only a single emetic episode or with attacks which could have been explained by other pathogenic factors were also excluded. The quality of the data was heterogenous with variations in diagnostic criteria, the reporting of cannabis use, and a specific follow‐up period.

Results

The analytic sample included 188 610 906 unweighted ED visits, representing an estimated 806 million visits nationwide; 433 251 323 (54.4%) involved female patients, 85 515 094 (19.9%) involved patients who idetified as Black, 65 117 040 (15.1%) involved patients who identified as Hispanic, 252 810 185 (58.7%) involved patients who identified as White, and the median age was 48.0 years (95% CI, 47.8–48.1 years). Descriptive analyses revealed significant demographic and visit outcome differences across diagnostic groups (Table 1). Patients with CHS had a significantly younger mean (SD) age (30.6 [11.6] years) than those with CUD only (36.7 [15.0] years), CVS only (37.6 [19.7] years), or neither diagnosis (48.1 [21.2] years) (P < .001). Age categorization further confirmed that CHS patients were disproportionately represented in the 18 to 25 years (35.7%) and 26 to 35 years (31.5%) age groups compared with additional diagnostic groups (design-adjusted Wald-test, P < .001).

Table 1.
Descriptive Statistics for Emergency Department Visits by Diagnostic Group (2016–2022)

Abbreviations: CHS, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome; CUD, cannabis use disorder; CVS, cyclic vomiting syndrome; ED, emergency department.

Among CHS visits (age ≥ 12 years), cannabis-specific diagnoses (F12.x or T40.7Xx) appeared high in the diagnosis array: the first cannabis code occurred as the second diagnosis in 52 534 (46.2%) of visits, the third in 23 744 (20.9%), and fourth in 14 261 (12.5%) of visits. Overall, CUD appeared in the second through fourth position in the diagnostic array in the 90 538 visits (79.7%) and in the second through sixth position in 103 635 (91.1%). Co-occurring noncannabis substance codes were uncommon: alcohol, 4094 (3.57%); opioids, 1879 (1.58%); cocaine, 2017 (1.77%); stimulants, 1254 (1.10%) (any of these, 7.21%), supporting the specificity of the CHS classification.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^463c31a1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The term CHS was first used more than a decade ago in 2004. Since then, several CHS cases have been reported in the literature with clear recognition and association with cannabis. However, given the degree of heterogeneity among these case reports and a need for strict criteria, the Rome IV diagnostic criteria were introduced in the category of functional gut disorders. The Rome IV committee defines functional gastrointestinal disorders as disturbances in the gut-brain axis without an organic pathology to explain those symptoms. This functional nausea and vomiting symptom complex may be cyclical or chronic in nature. A strict definition of CHS is lacking; therefore, it is also sometimes considered as a variant of cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS). Rome IV categorizes CHS as an extension of CVS, with symptom onset associated with heavy cannabis use. It defines CHS as episodic nausea and vomiting episodes resembling CVS, associated with prolonged and excessive use of cannabis and with the relief of symptoms after sustained cessation of its use. The symptoms may or may not improve with compulsive hot showers. However, details about the chronicity of use and duration of sustained cessation remain unclear. It is challenging to estimate the exact prevalence of CHS because most of the case reports have not used these strict criteria.

Proposed data collection sheet for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

Other important considerations included length of follow‐up after abstinence from cannabis. Ongoing evaluation in an outpatient setting to assess response to abstinence from cannabis, prior to making a diagnosis of CHS is critical given the episodic nature of the illness. For example, a patient who experienced 3 cycles/year while regularly using cannabis would need to be followed for at least one year after abstinence from cannabis to establish a diagnosis of CHS. Similarly, a patient with an episode every 6 weeks would need to be followed for ~4‐5 months after cannabis cessation. Because CHS and CVS both consist of self‐limiting episodes of emesis, it is crucial that the clinician who encounters a patient with possible CHS recognizes the need to establish causality prior to ascribing this diagnosis. The exact length of time that one would need to abstain from cannabis before resolution/reduction of CVS episodes occurs is not known as this will likely depend on the duration, quantity, and potency of cannabis use and genetic factors that could influence the response to cannabis use in individual patients. 172, 173

We acknowledge that maintaining complete abstinence from cannabis can be a challenge given patient perceptions and beliefs about cannabis use and its potential therapeutic benefits. A limitation of both the Rome IV criteria and our proposed criteria is the challenge with patients who cannot or are reluctant to stop cannabis due to perceived benefits. In this instance, careful consideration of the quantity of cannabis used (daily vs occasional use) and screening for cannabis‐use disorder should be undertaken. A presumptive diagnosis of CHS may be considered when chronic (> 1 year), daily use is encountered in the context of cyclic vomiting, and a failure to respond to standard prophylactic agents. Treatment for CVS with TCAs and ongoing care by an experienced team with counseling to reduce and ultimately stop cannabis use is recommended. Avoiding a confrontational and judgmental approach and establishing a rapport with the care team is crucial to achieving good patient care outcomes.

Background

An increasing number of studies have explored the clinical features, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). CVS is common in adults and children and negatively impacts patients, families, and the healthcare system. A related condition, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), has been a focus of interest in the lay press and published literature.

Purpose

Clinical presentations of CVS have been defined by small series and expert opinion, but recent prospective studies are refining our understanding of the spectrum of emetic episodes and the breadth of comorbid conditions. Large cross-sectional population analyses are clarifying CVS prevalence and factors related to age, ethnicity, and geographic region. CVS pathophysiology is multifactorial with contributions from migraines, dysautonomia, endogenous cannabinoids, mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic abnormalities, and rapid gastric emptying. CVS treatment relies on antiemetics and antimigraine therapies to abort acute episodes coupled with prophylactic regimens employing neuromodulators and antiepileptics. CHS represents a challenge partly because of difficulties in achieving sustained cannabis abstinence. Benefits of other therapies in CHS remain poorly defined. Several areas warrant further scrutiny including better identification of CVS triggers and characterization of different CVS subsets including those with frequent severe episodes, refined description of epidemiology to allow targeting of populations predisposed to CVS development, rigorous definition of pathogenic factors to provide a foundation for exploratory studies of novel therapies, and conduct of controlled trials by multicenter collaborations to confirm benefits of existing and new therapies in development. Progress in these areas will be facilitated by generous governmental and industry support.

Cannabis remains one of the most frequently misused substances among adolescents. As recreational cannabis has proliferated across the United States, cannabis-related emergency department visits have increased. Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, a variant of cyclic vomiting syndrome, has emerged as a recognized but poorly understood complication of chronic cannabis use among a subset of individuals. Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome is characterized by repeated cycles of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting refractory to standard antiemetics, with users reporting the compulsive use of hot showers to mitigate symptoms. Treatment modalities include intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion, topical application of capsaicin, and the use of antidopaminergics (eg, droperidol, haloperidol).

Introduction

Cannabis is the most commonly abused drug in the United States (US). Its use dates back to 3900 BC. However, our understanding of its effects has unfolded significantly over the last 3 decades. The extract of the plant cannabis sativa has been reported to be used for decades in the control of pain and cramps, according to the Chinese literature. Recognition of the function of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) was a breakthrough in explaining the effects of cannabis on different organs, at least in part. The primary psychoactive component of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These advances enhanced the understanding of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, which led to a better appreciation of the role of cannabis in inflammation, seizures, emesis, and as an appetite stimulant. There is a growing body of research showing the benefit of cannabis in the aforementioned disorders, and its legalization will further augment research on understanding its critical role in new drug developments. However, these changes also come with substantial risks regarding its adverse effects, such as paradoxical hyperemesis, intoxication and behavioral changes (anxiety, panic attacks, and psychoactive changes). Prolonged cannabis use can also result in dependency. Approximately 9% of individuals who use cannabis report dependence at some point in their use. Cannabis can paradoxically act as an antiemetic during acute ingestion at low doses, whereas persistent high-dose ingestion could result in vomiting, a behavior similar to cyclical vomiting. It appears from the current literature that the prevalence of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is higher in the US compared to Canada and the United Kingdom, although the prevalence of cannabis use is similar in these countries. It is unclear whether the increased legalization of cannabis has also contributed to these findings, but this certainly could be a possibility. Hence, raising the awareness of CHS with an understanding of its pathophysiology and the potential role of therapeutic agents is paramount.

### Patient information: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome… [^430212f0]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a gastrointestinal condition associated with frequent and long-term use of cannabis. CHS causes acute onset of recurrent episodes of severe nausea, bouts of vomiting, and intense abdominal pain that last less than 1 week. The symptoms typically start abruptly within 24 hours of the last cannabis use. People with CHS often report temporary relief of symptoms when taking hot showers or baths, which may lead to compulsive bathing. 1, 2. How Common Is CHS and What Are the Risk Factors. Although the exact number of people with CHS is unknown, based on emergency department surveys, CHS is estimated to affect about 2. 75 million people in the US yearly. From 2017 to 2021, emergency department visits for CHS doubled in the US and Canada and were most common among males aged 16 to 34 years.

The rise in CHS coincides with legalization of recreational cannabis and increases in delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration in cannabis products. Risk factors for CHS include heavy cannabis use for more than 1 year. Higher rates of CHS are reported in people who use cannabis before age 16 years, have other substance use disorders, and/or smoke cigarettes. How Is CHS Diagnosed. The diagnosis of CHS can be made in people who have had 3 or more yearly episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that last less than 1 week, who have used cannabis more than 4 days per week for more than 1 year, and whose symptoms disappear with cannabis cessation for at least 6 months. What Are the Complications of CHS. Frequent vomiting due to CHS can cause erosion of teeth enamel and may result in tooth loss.

CHS may also cause dehydration, acute kidney injury, and low blood levels of chloride, potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, which may require emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Rare severe complications of CHS include heart rhythm abnormalities, kidney failure, seizures, and death.

### Efficacy of capsaicin for the treatment of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: a systematic review [^f45f7797]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is characterized by cyclic vomiting, abdominal pain, and alleviation of symptoms via hot showers in chronic cannabinoid users. Capsaicin is recommended as a reasonable first-line treatment approach for CHS despite limited clinical evidence regarding its use. The objective of this study is to systematically review the efficacy data for capsaicin in CHS. Data Sources: A literature search using keywords related to cannabinoids, emesis, and capsaicin was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE from inception through March 31, 2019. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies and published abstracts in which capsaicin was used for CHS and clinical outcomes were reported were eligible for inclusion. Data Synthesis: A total of 241 articles were screened, of which 5 full-text articles and 6 conference abstracts were included. Full-text case reports (n = 3) and case series (n = 2) found capsaicin to be effective in a total of 18 patients. Published abstracts were in the form of case reports (n = 1), case series (n = 3), and retrospective cohort studies (n = 2). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Capsaicin use was described as beneficial in all case series and case reports; however, both retrospective cohort studies were unable to find a significant benefit for capsaicin on primary outcomes (emergency department length of stay). Conclusion: Current data for capsaicin efficacy in CHS is of low methodological quality. However, the limited data on alternative antiemetic therapies and capsaicin's favorable risk-benefit profile make it a reasonable adjunctive treatment option.

Limitations

This study had some limitations. Because CHS was not directly coded in ICD-10 during the study period, we used proxy definitions, raising misclassification risk. Some cases may have been missed due to cannabis use underreporting, while others may have been misclassified due to overlapping symptoms. Requiring CVS as the primary diagnosis may also have underestimated case counts. To reduce diagnostic ambiguity, we excluded emesis visits potentially linked to pregnancy, migraines, or chemotherapy, possibly shifting CVS counts if coding of these alternative causes changed over time. NEDS captures visits, not patients, so repeat visits could inflate counts. Coding practices likely evolved with clinician familiarity and pandemic disruptions, affecting observed trends. Early 2020 coincided with widespread disruptions in ED care due to COVID-19, which likely reduced non–COVID-19 presentations and may have affected observed diagnostic patterns. Finally, race and ethnicity data were only available from 2019 to 2022, limiting trend analyses for this variable as well as the multinomial analyses to this truncated period.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) in relation to CVS — Based on evidence and guidelines recommendations in adult patients, CHS is considered a probable subtype of CVS that presents after prolonged and excessive cannabis use; legalization of cannabis across the United States has caused a rise in CHS cases, including in adolescents, and the nearly identical symptom presentation can result in misclassification of CVS as CHS and underutilization of standard therapies; topical capsaicin, benzodiazepines, and droperidol or haloperidol have also been proposed as possible treatments for acute CHS episodes, but it remains unclear whether standard CVS therapies are effective for CHS or whether agents used in CHS are equally effective in CVS; although there is no pediatric data, adult guidelines recommend that CHS patients are offered the same therapies as CVS patients, and current consensus suggests cannabis cessation for at least 6 months or a period equivalent to three emetic cycles (whichever is longer) along with strict avoidance of cannabis re-exposure to confirm a diagnosis of CHS, while complete cannabis cessation is the long-term treatment for CHS.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^be4fca65]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Limited responses to abortive antiemetic medications are often mentioned in articles on CHS, while others report excellent responses to parenteral benzodiazepines (GABA A agonists) such as lorazepam, the neuromodulator olanzapine, or the potent D 2 antagonist haloperidol — an agent with overlapping pharmacology to many commonly used antiemetic including prochlorperazine and metoclopramide. 164, 183, 186 Prior studies have proposed selective benefits of topical capsaicin treatments for acute CHS attacks, potentially acting in similar fashion as hot baths. 162, 187 182, 188 However, similar treatments have not been employed for patients with CVS without cannabis exposure, so the specificity of these benefits for CHS is uncertain. Because of the paucity of investigations supporting or refuting the use of other CHS therapies, it is imperative that patients with possible CHS are not denied prescription of prophylactic or abortive treatments which benefit patients with CVS.

The treatment of CHS has focused on cannabis cessation leading to resolution of symptoms. The most comprehensive series to date by Allen et al followed patients for more than 2 years and given that duration we surmise that cannabis cessation did indeed result in resolution of vomiting episodes. However, many articles describe brief periods of abstinence from cannabis as short as a few days of hospitalization, which are not meaningful and challenge their validity in support of a diagnosis of CHS. When more stringent criteria have been applied, very few patients with purported CHS report symptom reduction lasting more than 3 months and almost no publications describe improvements for at least two typical cycles of episodic emesis. This highlights the limitation of the current CHS literature as there is an ascertainment bias and potential overattribution which could call into question the CHS diagnosis in some who have been told they have the condition. On the other hand, application of the Rome IV criteria could lead to an underestimate if follow‐up is inadequate or if patients are unwilling to stop cannabis. Furthermore, symptom resolution following cessation of cannabis could be confounded by unrelated spontaneous resolution of symptoms which would muddy the apparent causal interpretation. In children with CVS, after 4 years of illness, spontaneous resolution (ie, off medication) occurs in 50%. 189 Although continued remission off medications has been described in adults, how often this occurs remains unknown due to the limited long‐term follow‐up data and persistent use of medication in adults with CVS. 190 Future reports describing CHS should include greater rigor in characterizing symptom improvement with prolonged cannabis abstinence to avoid inappropriately making this diagnosis.

Temporal Trends in Cannabinoid-Related and Vomiting Syndromes

Temporal trends in ED visit diagnoses revealed distinct patterns across the three conditions (Figure 1). Between 2016 and 2022, CUD-only increased from 1008 to 1465 per 100 000 ED visits; CHS rose from 4.36 to 22.33 per 100 000 (peaking at 33.06 in Q2 2020); whereas CVS-only declined (300 to 186 per 100 000). This divergence suggests that the observed increase in CHS may be attributable to a growing subset of patients with CUD presenting with vomiting symptoms, rather than an overall rise in CVS diagnoses unrelated to exposure.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome co-occurring with superior mesenteric artery syndrome in adolescents [^43713446]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Both superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) may present with abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis - making them difficult to differentiate or determine when they co-occur in adolescents who regularly use cannabis. Here, we present nine cases of CHS co-occurring with SMAS and characterize their clinical courses.

Methods

Patients admitted at Children's Hospital of Colorado between January 1, 2015, and March 23, 2023, who had both cannabis use (F12.1-F12.99) and chronic vascular disorders of the intestine (K55.1) on their problem lists were identified from the electronic medical record using ICD 10 codes. Nine met criteria for SMAS and chronic cannabis use.

Results

Six of nine patients were female. The most common presenting symptoms were nausea (9), vomiting (9), and weight loss (9). Four patients received cannabis cessation support. Patients lost a mean of 6.0kg, had an average body mass index (BMI) of 15.61 percentile (17.7kg/m 2) and BMI Z-scores of -1.5. Symptoms were present for a mean of 19.6 weeks before diagnosis.

Conclusions

Adolescents who experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight loss in association with chronic cannabis use and/or SMAS can present with confusing and overlapping symptoms. Our cohort was described as having CHS with co-occurring SMAS on imaging. Although the etiology of weight loss cannot be definitively ascertained, we postulate that the recurring emetic attacks from CHS led to weight loss resulting in SMAS. Improvement in diagnostic criteria for this population as well as cannabis cessation programming may aid in deceasing morbidity from these co-occurring conditions.

### The utility of droperidol in the treatment of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^a64f449a]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) can be characterized by recurrent paroxysmal episodes of intractable nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and compulsive hot showers/baths with symptom relief, on the background of chronic cannabis use. We reported the use of droperidol in the management of CHS. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of electronic medical records of Emergency Department presentations to a single tertiary level metropolitan hospital between January 2006 and December 2016 using search keywords: "cannabis", "cannabinoid", "cannabis", "hyperemesis", and "droperidol". A secondary search of pharmacy droperidol dispensing records was cross matched with electronic medical record data. We reviewed each record to determine if the presentation met previously published diagnostic criteria for CHS. Data were dichotomised into presentations with droperidol administered or not administered. The primary outcome was defined as the total length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes measures included time until discharge following last drug administration, and the total number of antiemetic dosages administered. Results: Six-hundred and eighty-nine records were identified and 76 met CHS diagnostic criteria. Thirty-seven presentations were treated with droperidol and 39 were not. Droperidol treatment group median length of stay was significantly lower compared to the no droperidol treatment group (6.7 vs. 13.9hours, p = .014). Median time to discharge after final drug administration in the droperidol treatment group was 137minutes (IQR 65, 203) vs. the no droperidol treatment group of 185minutes (IQR 149, 403). The most frequent dosage of droperidol used was 0.625mg intravenously. The frequency of ondansetron (n = 100) and metoclopramide (n = 27) in the no droperidol treatment group was double that of the droperidol group. Conclusions: Use of droperidol to treat CHS associated nausea and vomiting resulted in less overall use of antiemetics and reduced length of stay.

### Use of capsaicin cream in cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in patients presenting to the emergency department [^3be83220]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is characterized by cyclical nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain often relieved with hot showers. Patients with CHS are usually long-term cannabis smokers whose symptoms are not relieved by antiemetics. The use of topical capsaicin has been recently reported as an adjunctive therapy in the emergency department (ED).

Objective

To describe the use of capsaicin cream in patients presenting to the ED with suspected CHS.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients with suspected CHS receiving capsaicin in an ED from July 2014 to October 2018. We report data on demographics, cannabis consumption, hot showers use, length of stay, concurrent treatments, pain scores, and adverse events.

Results

There were 57 patients who received capsaicin cream for suspected CHS. Nearly all patients received antiemetics (98%), whereas 47% of patients received an opioid. Antiemetics were typically administered first (median, 1.6 hours; interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–2.4]), followed by an opioid (median, 1.8 hours [IQR, 1–3.75]), followed by capsaicin cream (median 4 hours [IQR, 2.7–5.2]). The overall precapsaicin pain score was 8 (IQR, 2–9), decreasing to 5.5 (IQR, 0–8). Around 42% of patients received no further symptomatic therapy after capsaicin. No adverse drug events to capsaicin were reported.

Conclusion and Relevance

This is the largest retrospective study describing capsaicin cream use in suspected CHS patients with a focus on abdominal pain relief. Capsaicin treatment was associated with a modest pain score reduction. Application of these findings may help providers in identifying more effective therapies to provide symptomatic relief for CHS patients.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^449bb9ac]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

CHS is an important manifestation of long-term cannabis use associated with episodic nausea and vomiting, similar to CVS. Rome IV criteria provide objectivity to CHS diagnosis as significant heterogeneity was noted in the previous cases for its diagnosis. Despite this, Rome IV may underestimate CHS cases because of the lack of details about the definition of chronic use and the duration of cannabis abstinence. Pathological hot water bathing is seen in CHS patients more often than in functional nausea and vomiting, but it is neither sensitive nor specific for CHS. The ECS and ratio of THC to CBs provide important insights about cannabis's biphasic effect on emesis, and its role in affecting brain stem and HPA axis signaling. The management of CHS is mainly conservative, with aggressive volume repletion, use of antiemetics, and cannabis cessation with rehabilitation. The prevalence of cannabis use disorder is poised to increase with the decrease in its legal thresholds for recreational use. Raising awareness and availability of further CHS data in the future will pave the way for targeted novel therapeutic interventions for CHS.
