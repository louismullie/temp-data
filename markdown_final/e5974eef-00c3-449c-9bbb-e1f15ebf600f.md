## Question

pancreatitis third spacing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about third spacing in acute pancreatitis, with clear pathophysiology, clinical consequences, diagnostic/monitoring strategies, fluid management recommendations, risk balancing, and evidence synthesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining third spacing and its inflammatory microvascular basis. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic and organ-level consequences. Next, I will examine how we assess and monitor third-space losses at the bedside. After that, I need to review guideline-concordant fluid strategies and the aggressive versus moderate hydration evidence. Finally, I should balance benefits against risks, outline a practical protocol, acknowledge remaining uncertainties, and synthesize an actionable framework.

> Let me first confirm what "third spacing" means in acute pancreatitis and why it occurs. Third spacing refers to pathologic sequestration of fluid into the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, bowel wall, and peripancreatic tissues due to inflammatory endothelial activation and capillary leak, rendering that volume effectively unavailable to the circulation despite total body fluid excess, which is a hallmark of early severe disease physiology in pancreatitis [^112qqP9N] [^112rNnhp].

> I need to check the clinical consequences of this redistribution because it drives initial management priorities. Third spacing produces relative intravascular hypovolemia with hemoconcentration, hypotension, and shock, worsens pancreatic microcirculatory failure and necrosis risk, and amplifies systemic inflammatory response that precipitates organ dysfunction, although hematocrit alone is an imprecise surrogate for severity or resuscitation adequacy and must be interpreted cautiously [^112qqP9N] [^1139JBPT] [^111Xt9PS].

> But wait, what about compartment physiology, since large third-space fluid shifts can raise intra-abdominal pressure. I should confirm that intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome may complicate severe pancreatitis through edema, ileus, and ascites; when IAP rises to pathologic ranges, organ perfusion deteriorates, so early recognition and staged decompressive measures become essential alongside careful fluid titration [^114jcV2z].

> Next, I should review how we actually assess and monitor third-space losses at the bedside, knowing direct quantification is not feasible. Let me verify that practical markers include trends in BUN and creatinine for perfusion, urine output targets, serial clinical hemodynamics, and imaging signs such as free abdominal fluid on CT that correlate with necrosis risk, while acknowledging the limitations of static measures like hematocrit and central venous pressure as resuscitation endpoints [^114jcV2z] [^1139JBPT].

> Hold on, I should verify what current high-quality guidelines recommend for fluid resuscitation in this context. The 2024 ACG guidance favors moderately aggressive resuscitation with lactated Ringer's rather than normal saline, coupled with frequent reassessment approximately every 6 hours across the first 24–48 hours targeting a downward BUN trend, and with explicit vigilance for volume overload in patients with cardiac or renal comorbidity [^114EjzNE] [^116kTEqx] [^114kcCwV] [^115kccSY].

> Now I will examine the aggressive versus moderate hydration evidence, because my management hinges on this balance. The WATERFALL RCT showed no improvement in progression to moderately severe or severe pancreatitis with aggressive early hydration but did demonstrate substantially higher fluid overload, and meta-analytic syntheses similarly report no mortality benefit and potential harm with aggressive strategies, while a small RCT suggests lactated Ringer's attenuates systemic inflammation relative to saline, supporting fluid type selection even as volume targets remain conservative [^115n3A9i] [^1119KAhp] [^112enMJf] [^117YK5eH].

> Let me translate this into a practical, evidence-aligned approach I can defend clinically. I should initiate moderate crystalloid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's, consider a 10 mL/kg bolus if hypovolemic, start at approximately 1.5 mL/kg/h with early titration, reassess at 6-hour intervals in the first 24–48 hours with goals including urine output at least 0.5 mL/kg/h, MAP maintenance, and BUN reduction, and escalate monitoring intensity for patients with SIRS or organ failure who warrant a higher-acuity setting [^114kcCwV] [^116kTEqx] [^113LBAt4].

> I should double-check the overload risk and how to mitigate it because third spacing paradoxically coexists with susceptibility to edema-related complications. Excessive volumes, particularly beyond about 6 L in 24 hours in observational cohorts, associate with pulmonary fluid overload, rising CRP, hypoalbuminemia, and ICU transfer, and in severe pancreatitis, vigilance for and management of intra-abdominal hypertension are crucial to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome, which may necessitate fluid restriction, decompression, and other tiered measures [^117T5p5M] [^114jcV2z].

> Let me consider adjunctive strategy nuances and the role of "goal-directed therapy". The AGA suggests goal-directed fluid management may be considered, yet high-quality evidence demonstrating improved hard outcomes remains limited, so I need to ensure frequent, individualized reassessment while avoiding dogmatic targets; for milder disease, a more conservative fluid approach appears reasonable to minimize iatrogenic overload without sacrificing outcomes [^115f5bKS] [^11411mFS] [^115zeJuL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that early aggressive hydration was uniformly recommended based on older guidance emphasizing large upfront volumes. Hold on, I should verify and correct that my default should now reflect updated evidence, because while the 2013 ACG guideline framed aggressive hydration as beneficial largely within the first 12–24 hours, modern RCT data and 2024 ACG guidance have shifted practice toward moderate, closely titrated resuscitation to avoid fluid overload without compromising clinical outcomes [^111DcXgA] [^115n3A9i] [^114EjzNE].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge knowledge gaps so I do not overstate certainty. Optimal resuscitation endpoints beyond urine output and BUN trends remain unsettled, the benefit of advanced hemodynamic monitoring is not proven in pancreatitis, and whether formal goal-directed algorithms improve mortality or infected necrosis is still uncertain, which reinforces the need for dynamic clinical judgement and serial evaluation rather than fixed-volume recipes [^11411mFS] [^115f5bKS].

> To synthesize, third spacing in acute pancreatitis reflects inflammatory capillary leak driving relative intravascular depletion and organ hypoperfusion, demanding timely but measured lactated Ringer's resuscitation with frequent reassessment, preference for moderate over aggressive volumes to limit overload, early escalation of monitoring in those with SIRS or organ failure, and active surveillance for intra-abdominal hypertension, all aligned with contemporary guidelines and randomized evidence while acknowledging persistent uncertainties in precise endpoints [^112qqP9N] [^116kTEqx] [^114kcCwV] [^115n3A9i] [^113LBAt4].

Third spacing in pancreatitis is driven by **capillary leak from systemic inflammation** [^112qqP9N], causing large-volume sequestration into the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces, mesentery, and bowel wall, with ascites and pleural effusions common [^112MjBnX]. This leads to **hypovolemia and organ dysfunction**, including shock, AKI, and respiratory failure [^112rNnhp] [^112qqP9N]. Early, moderate fluid resuscitation with **lactated Ringer's** is recommended, with frequent reassessment to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload [^114EjzNE] [^116kTEqx] [^114kcCwV]. Aggressive fluids increase fluid overload and respiratory complications without improving outcomes [^1119KAhp] [^112enMJf]. Monitor for rising BUN, hematocrit, and intra-abdominal pressure; manage complications with supportive care [^114kcCwV], and use diuretics or drainage only when clinically indicated [^114jcV2z].

---

## Pathophysiology of third spacing in pancreatitis

Inflammatory mediators, including cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) and proteases, **increase capillary permeability**, leading to fluid and protein extravasation [^112rNnhp]. Endothelial dysfunction and capillary leak drive fluid sequestration in the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces, mesentery, and bowel wall [^112qqP9N]. The resulting **intravascular depletion** reduces perfusion, causing hypovolemia with shock, AKI, and respiratory failure [^112rNnhp] [^114MEGHb].

---

## Clinical manifestations and complications

- **Ascites and pleural effusions**: Commonly observed on imaging [^112MjBnX].

- **Hypovolemia and shock**: Reduced intravascular volume [^112rNnhp] causes hypotension and shock [^112qqP9N].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Hypoperfusion [^112rNnhp] and intra-abdominal hypertension contribute to AKI [^114jcV2z].

- **Respiratory complications**: Pleural effusions and pulmonary edema cause respiratory distress and failure [^112qqP9N] [^1119KAhp].

- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: Increased intra-abdominal pressure impairs organ function [^112qqP9N] [^115Tw9Hw].

---

## Diagnostic methods and monitoring strategies

- **Clinical assessment**: Monitor vital signs, urine output [^1139JBPT], and signs of hypovolemia or fluid overload [^114kcCwV].

- **Laboratory tests**: Track hematocrit, BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes to assess fluid status and organ function [^116LM2vd] [^114kcCwV].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT to detect ascites, pleural effusions, and fluid collections [^112MjBnX].

- **Intra-abdominal pressure monitoring**: Detect and manage intra-abdominal hypertension and compartment syndrome [^112qqP9N] [^115Tw9Hw].

---

## Fluid management strategies

- **Early moderate fluid resuscitation**: Initiate early, moderate resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids (preferably lactated Ringer's) [^114EjzNE] [^116kTEqx] [^117YK5eH].

- **Frequent reassessment**: Reassess fluid status within 6 hours and over the next 24–48 hours, targeting urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h [^1139JBPT] and decreasing BUN [^114kcCwV].

- **Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation**: Aggressive fluids increase fluid overload and respiratory complications without improving outcomes [^1119KAhp] [^112enMJf].

- **Goal-directed therapy**: Use clinical and laboratory parameters to guide fluids and avoid overload [^115f5bKS] [^11411mFS].

---

## Potential complications of improper fluid management

Improper fluid management can cause **fluid overload**, leading to pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and respiratory failure [^1119KAhp] [^117T5p5M]. Excessive fluids may also precipitate abdominal compartment syndrome by increasing intra-abdominal pressure and impairing organ function [^112ECW7D] [^112qqP9N]. Conversely, inadequate resuscitation contributes to persistent organ failure and increased mortality [^117Ckf3C] [^112qqP9N].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **early, moderate resuscitation** with isotonic crystalloids — preferably **lactated Ringer's** [^114EjzNE] [^116kTEqx] [^114nNcyp]. Clinicians should reassess fluid status frequently and adjust therapy to avoid overload [^114kcCwV] [^113aahR2]. Use **goal-directed therapy** that tailors fluids to clinical and laboratory parameters [^115f5bKS]. Exercise additional caution in patients with cardiovascular or renal comorbidities [^115kccSY].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Third spacing in pancreatitis is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, including higher risks of organ failure, infections, and death [^112qqP9N] [^112wr2Qt]. It also prolongs hospitalization and increases healthcare costs [^117Ckf3C] [^112qqP9N]. Persistent organ failure and related complications further worsen overall prognosis [^112wr2Qt] [^112qqP9N].

---

Third spacing in pancreatitis reflects **capillary leak from systemic inflammation**, causing hypovolemia and organ dysfunction [^112rNnhp]. Early, moderate resuscitation with lactated Ringer's and frequent reassessment are essential to balance perfusion and avoid fluid overload, improving outcomes [^1119KAhp] [^114EjzNE].

### Role of the gut barrier in acute pancreatitis [^112rNnhp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The small intestine is one of the distant organs that become damaged during severe acute pancreatitis due to microcirculation disturbance associated with loss of fluids in the "third space", hypovolemia, splanchnic vasoconstriction, and ultimately ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this scenario, the gut acts as the initiator for severe systemic complications. The failure of the intestinal barrier is associated with the translocation of bacteria, as well as inflammatory and toxic products produced in the intestinal wall, which can lead to sepsis and infection of the necrotic pancreas and contribute to systemic inflammatory response. Therefore, one of the main goals of treatment in the early phases of severe acute pancreatitis should be to maintain the integrity of the gut barrier in the small intestine.

These strategies include appropriate fluid resuscitation to limit damage due to relative hypovolemia and early enteral feeding. The role of intravenous antibiotics in preventing infection of the pancreatic necrosis is controversial. The role of probiotics, which seemed promising in vitro and in early clinical trials, needs further investigation to better understand the effects of specific strains at various doses and timing before designing new clinical trials.

### Abdominal free fluid in acute pancreatitis predicts necrotizing pancreatitis and organ failure [^112MjBnX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical course of acute pancreatitis ranges from a mild, self-limited illness to a fulminant, fatal course, and the type can be indistinguishable upon initial presentation. Predicting the clinical course in acute pancreatitis remains challenging, despite decades of studies investigating a wide variety of clinical, imaging, and serological predictors.

Cross-sectional abdominal imaging, mainly computed tomography (CT) scanning, is performed in 60–70% of patients with acute pancreatitis within the first 24–48 hours of presentation. While the intent of the imaging study is primarily diagnostic, much information from cross-sectional imaging may be harnessed for predictive purposes, especially with the emergence of artificial neural networks. Traditional predictors for severity in acute pancreatitis, including persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hematocrit (HCT), Ranson criteria, and other clinical scoring systems, have only been proven to be moderately effective and can take up to 48 hours to calculate or measure. CT imaging features have the benefit of immediate acquisition as the examination is already performed in the majority of patients.

Free abdominal fluid, or ascites, is often observed in acute pancreatitis, but this finding is frequently overlooked, under-reported in some radiologic interpretations, or not considered to be of clinical significance unless large in volume or creating increased abdominal pressure. The release of free fluid in acute pancreatitis may be due to either pancreatic duct leakage or other mechanisms.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^112enMJf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Despite early aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation playing an important role in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP), some recent studies have suggested that aggressive hydration may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at 18 centers worldwide reported that early aggressive fluid resuscitation resulted in a higher incidence of fluid overload, which required meeting at least two of the following three criteria: symptoms, physical signs, and imaging evidence of hypervolemia. In addition, acute respiratory distress syndrome had to be ruled out. However, this approach did not lead to improvements in clinical outcomes, such as the incidence of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis.

Two previous meta-analyses explored the effect of early aggressive hydration. One meta-analysis reported that early aggressive IVF therapy did not improve mortality and may potentially increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and pulmonary edema. Another meta-analysis indicated that, compared to conservative hydration, aggressive hydration increased in-hospital mortality and the incidence of pancreatic necrosis and renal failure.

The lack of evidence for the efficacy of aggressive fluid resuscitation has practical implications, as it challenges the strong predilection of many clinicians for early high-volume hydration. These findings compel us to revisit the effects of early aggressive hydration in patients with AP.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^112qqP9N]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

In the majority of patients, acute pancreatitis is a mild and self-limiting disease. However, about fifteen percent of patients develop severe disease, characterized by persistent organ failure. Mortality in acute pancreatitis is mainly associated with multiple organ failure, while the risk of death is minimal in patients without or with transient organ dysfunctions.

In acute pancreatitis, multiple organ failure results from the excessive activation of a systemic inflammatory response cascade. Inflammatory mediators induce end-organ endothelial cell activation, leading to increased permeability. Leaking microvessels cause a loss of intravascular fluid and, in conjunction with vasodilatation, lead to hypotension and shock. The accumulation of inflammatory cells in tissues, increased interstitial fluid, and activation of coagulation with microvascular thrombosis further impair the oxygen supply to tissues. The clinical manifestation of this is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which develops early during the course of acute pancreatitis.

Over half of the patients with severe pancreatitis show signs of organ dysfunction upon hospital admission, and most organ dysfunctions develop within the first four days after admission. More than half of the deaths occur within the first week from the onset of the disease, typically within a week after the manifestation of MODS.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^1143LPo6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Given that subsequent influential clinical management decisions are based on mortality outcomes, in-hospital mortality was chosen as the primary outcome of this meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes included clinical improvement within 36 hours, defined as a composite outcome requiring several criteria to be fulfilled: a decrease in hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine from baseline, a decrease in epigastric pain level, and tolerance of oral nutrition. Other secondary outcomes were pancreatic necrosis, persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), infection, organ failure, renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, and length of stay. All these outcomes were determined according to the definitions of each study and occurred within the first 24 hours.

Two authors independently performed data extraction of all eligible studies, with the final results reviewed and confirmed by a third adjudicative senior author. The following information was collected: (1) research characteristics (author, year of publication, and country); (2) the characteristics of patients (quantity of patients, age, etiology, and severity of the disease); (3) fluid therapy (fluid type, fluid rate, and FV); (4) the information of patients' outcome (aggressive versus nonaggressive). The extraction of information was repeated if two authors were unable to reach a consensus.

Since the eligible studies included RCTs and observational studies, we used two tools to assess the potential risk of bias: the Cochrane Collaborative Risk of Bias Assessment.

### Acute pancreatitis and critical illness: A pancreatic tale of hypoperfusion and inflammation [^114MEGHb]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Since it was first widely recognized at the end of the 19th century, acute pancreatitis has proven a formidable clinical challenge, frequently resulting in management within critical care settings. Because the early assessment of severity is difficult, the recognition of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the implementation of critical care treatment precepts are often delayed. Although different management strategies for life-threatening features of SAP have been debated for decades, there has been little recent reduction in mortality rates, which can be as high as 30%. This article discusses severity designation at the time of diagnosis, reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms characterized by the noxious combination of severe systemic inflammation and hypoperfusion, and provides a management algorithm that parallels critical care strategies.

### Less aggressive hydration may be more in acute pancreatitis [^115zeJuL]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Consider a more conservative approach to fluid resuscitation in mild acute pancreatitis to avoid fluid overload without sacrificing patient-oriented clinical outcomes.

### Fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^11411mFS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the evidence from the literature to establish the perspective on fluid resuscitation (FR) in acute pancreatitis (AP). This review will examine the rationale, type of fluid, rate of administration, total volume, duration, monitoring, and ideal outcomes to be studied in clinical trials, along with recommendations for future studies.

Recent findings indicate that FR remains a key component of supportive therapy in AP. The paradigm has shifted from the administration of aggressive fluid resuscitation toward more moderate FR strategies. Lactated Ringer's solution remains the preferred fluid for resuscitation. However, there are critical gaps in knowledge regarding the endpoints that indicate adequate resuscitation and accurate assessments of fluid sequestration and intravascular volume deficit in AP.

In summary, there is insufficient evidence to support that goal-directed therapy — using any parameters to guide fluid administration — reduces the risk of persistent organ failure, infected pancreatic necrosis, or mortality in AP, as well as to determine the most appropriate method for the same.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^117H4hUV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What is new in the assessment of severity? The original Ranson criteria from 1974, last modified in 2012, have been followed by several new and in part much more complex scoring systems; however, these have only increased diagnostic performance modestly (AUC from 0.57 to 0.74). Recent findings suggest that the presence of under- or overweight, development or persistence of organ failure, and assessment of biomarkers, such as cytokine levels, might help to further improve identification of high-risk patients.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^111Xt9PS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas, which can lead to a syndrome of local and systemic inflammatory responses, as well as organ failure. The incidence of AP and hospitalization has been increasing over the last 20 years. The etiology of AP includes, but is not limited to, pancreatic duct obstruction secondary to gallstones, alcohol, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and various drug-induced pathological cellular pathways and organelle dysfunction that ultimately characterize AP. The clinical course of the disease varies and can be categorized as mild, moderately severe, or severe. Most patients suffer from mild conditions with only interstitial changes in the pancreas. Around 20% of cases present with moderate or severe episodes of AP, accompanied by necrosis of the peripancreatic or pancreatic tissue, organ failure, or both, and a mortality rate of 20–40%.

Intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation, oxygen, analgesia, and nutrition are the fundamental management strategies for AP. Fluid administration can counteract tissue hypoperfusion and third-space volume loss without causing pancreatic and systemic hemodynamic deterioration in the inflammatory cascade. It is widely recommended by several guidelines and is highlighted as a pivotal therapeutic strategy. However, the evidence is limited, and recent guidelines suggest that IVF should be guided with caution, as fluid overload is known to exacerbate tissue edema and impact impaired oxygen delivery.

A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided insights into this treatment strategy.

### Initial management of acute pancreatitis: Critical issues during the first 72 hours [^1164wTc2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis experience a mild course, almost a quarter of patients will develop complications. It has become clear that the early management of patients with acute pancreatitis is likely to affect outcomes. Too often, patients are admitted to the hospital with what appears to be mild disease, only to later deteriorate into severe disease. This review focuses on the early management of patients with acute pancreatitis to prevent severe disease, complications, and death.

### Effect of intravenous fluids and analgesia on dysmotility in patients with acute pancreatitis: A prospective cohort study [^116cSoaM]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Analgesia and intravenous fluid resuscitation are cornerstones of initial patient management in acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim was to investigate the effect of intravenous fluids and analgesia on gastrointestinal motility in the early course of AP.

- **Methods**: Gastrointestinal dysmotility was assessed using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). One-way analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were conducted, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, severity of AP, preexisting diabetes mellitus, and time from first symptom onset to hospital admission.

- **Results**: A total of 108 patients with AP were prospectively enrolled. Opioid analgesia, when compared with nonopioid analgesia, was significantly associated with an increase in total GCSI score in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. There was no significant difference between aggressive and nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. A combination of opioids and any intravenous fluids was associated with a significantly increased total GCSI score compared with opioids and no intravenous fluids in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Duration of symptoms was the confounder that significantly affected 6 of 9 studied associations.

- **Conclusions**: Intravenous fluids and analgesia significantly affect motility independent of severity and other covariates. Guidelines on the prudent use of opioids and fluids in AP need to be developed, particularly taking into account the duration of symptoms from onset to hospitalization.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^111DcXgA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the management of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically.

Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation, and resuscitative measures should begin as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidities preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12–24 hours and may have little benefit beyond this period.

Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 hours of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or post-procedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate should be used.

### The "golden hours" of management in acute pancreatitis [^113wTtMW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

In the past decade, significant research has transformed the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) during the first 24 hours of presentation. Rapid initiation of treatment is emphasized to prevent the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with delayed interventions. Recent data validate simple and accurate tools for prognostication of AP, replacing older, more complex methods that required numerous factors and up to 48 hours to complete.

We provide evidence-based guidelines and endpoints for fluid resuscitation. Additionally, this research clarifies two previously controversial topics in AP treatment: the use of prophylactic antibiotics and early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114M78xD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute pancreatitis, specifically in the context of aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering CT-guided FNA for Gram stain and culture. This is to confirm an infected severe acute pancreatitis and guide antibiotic therapy, although it is no longer routinely used.

### Large volume fluid resuscitation for severe acute pancreatitis is associated with reduced mortality: A multicenter retrospective study [^114SPxXB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Although fluid resuscitation is critical in acute pancreatitis, the optimal fluid volume is unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the volume of fluid administered and clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study at 44 institutions in Japan. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older and diagnosed with SAP from 2009 to 2013. Patients were stratified into two groups: administered fluid volume < 6000 mL and ≥ 6000 mL in the first 24 hours. We evaluated the association between the two groups and clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of pancreatic infection and the need for surgical intervention.

- **Results**: We analyzed 1,097 patients, and the mean fluid volume administered was 5,618 ± 3,018 mL (mean ± SD), with 708 and 389 patients stratified into the fluid < 6000 mL and fluid ≥ 6000 mL groups, respectively. Overall in-hospital mortality was 12.3%. The fluid ≥ 6000 mL group had significantly higher mortality than the fluid < 6000 mL group (univariable analysis, 15.9% vs. 10.3%; P < 0.05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, administration of ≥ 6000 mL of fluid within the first 24 hours was significantly associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio, 0.58; P < 0.05). No significant association was found between the administered fluid volume and pancreatic infection, or between the volume administered and the need for surgical intervention.

### Early fluid resuscitation reduces morbidity among patients with acute pancreatitis [^117Ckf3C]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Early fluid resuscitation is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality among patients with acute pancreatitis, although the impact of this intervention has not been quantified. We investigated the association between early fluid resuscitation and the outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: Non-transfer patients admitted to our center with acute pancreatitis from 1985–2009 were identified retrospectively. Patients were stratified into groups on the basis of early (n = 340) or late resuscitation (n = 94). Early resuscitation was defined as receiving ≥ one-third of the total 72-hour fluid volume within 24 hours of presentation, whereas late resuscitation was defined as receiving ≤ one-third of the total 72-hour fluid volume within 24 hours of presentation. The primary outcomes were the frequency of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), organ failure, and death.

- **Results**: Early resuscitation was associated with decreased SIRS compared with late resuscitation, at 24 hours (15% vs 32%, P = 0.001), 48 hours (14% vs 33%, P = 0.001), and 72 hours (10% vs 23%, P = 0.01), as well as reduced organ failure at 72 hours (5% vs 10%, P < .05), a lower rate of admission to the intensive care unit (6% vs 17%, P < .001), and a reduced length of hospital stay (8 vs 11 days, P = 0.01). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that these benefits were more pronounced in patients with interstitial rather than severe pancreatitis at admission.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with acute pancreatitis, early fluid resuscitation was associated with reduced incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, decreased organ failure, lower intensive care unit admission rates, and shorter hospital stays.

### Lactated Ringer's solution reduces systemic inflammation compared with saline in patients with acute pancreatitis [^117YK5eH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). High credibility.

Aggressive fluid resuscitation is recommended for the initial management of acute pancreatitis. We performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol on systemic inflammation in patients with acute pancreatitis. We then determined the impact of resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with normal saline.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 40 patients with acute pancreatitis at three New England hospitals from May 2009 to February 2010. Patients received either goal-directed fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, goal-directed fluid resuscitation with normal saline, standard fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, or standard fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Systemic inflammation was measured based on the levels of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level after 24 hours.

- **Results**: The volumes of fluid administered during a 24-hour period were similar among patients given goal-directed or standard fluid resuscitation (mean, 4300 vs. 4600 mL, respectively; p = 0.87). Goal-directed resuscitation did not significantly reduce the incidence of SIRS compared with standard resuscitation (11.8% vs. 13.0%, respectively; p = 0.85), nor did it affect the levels of CRP after 24 hours (87.1 vs. 69.2 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.75). By contrast, there was a significant reduction in SIRS after 24 hours among subjects resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with normal saline (84% reduction vs. 0%, respectively; p = 0.035).

### Aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^115n3A9i]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Early aggressive hydration is widely recommended for the management of acute pancreatitis, but evidence for this practice is limited.

- **Methods**: At 18 centers, we randomly assigned patients who presented with acute pancreatitis to receive goal-directed aggressive or moderate resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Aggressive fluid resuscitation consisted of a bolus of 20 mL per kilogram of body weight, followed by 3 mL per kilogram per hour. Moderate fluid resuscitation consisted of a bolus of 10 mL per kilogram in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus in patients with normovolemia, followed by 1.5 mL per kilogram per hour in all patients in this group. Patients were assessed at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and fluid resuscitation was adjusted according to the patient's clinical status. The primary outcome was the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis during hospitalization. The main safety outcome was fluid overload. The planned sample size was 744, with a first planned interim analysis after the enrollment of 248 patients.

- **Results**: A total of 249 patients were included in the interim analysis. The trial was halted owing to between-group differences in the safety outcomes without a significant difference in the incidence of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (22.1% in the aggressive-resuscitation group and 17.3% in the moderate-resuscitation group; adjusted relative risk, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 2.18; P = 0.32). Fluid overload developed in 20.5% of the patients who received aggressive resuscitation and in 6.3% of the patients who received moderate resuscitation.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to the aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections, the BPIGS 2016 guidelines recommend observing patients with acute peripancreatic fluid collections in the absence of radiological or clinical suspicion of infection. It is advised to avoid image-guided FNA due to the risk of introducing infection into a sterile collection.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^1139JBPT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Aggressive fluid therapy during the early phase of acute pancreatitis has traditionally been the cornerstone of treatment. The rationale for fluid therapy is to correct hypovolemia caused by third space fluid loss. High admission hematocrit (above normal reference limits) may serve as a marker of hemoconcentration. It is present in up to 60% of patients who develop organ failure; however, this marker is too unspecific for predictive purposes.

Fluid resuscitation decreases hematocrit, which could be used as a resuscitation endpoint. Nonetheless, overly aggressive resuscitation may lead to inappropriate hemodilution, and very low hematocrit values (< 30%) may increase the risk of sepsis and death for patients. Moreover, excess volume loading may increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and lead to the development of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome.

In patients with acute pancreatitis, hematocrit and central venous pressure as resuscitation endpoints are poor indicators of volume depletion. Urine output (≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h) may serve as another resuscitation endpoint, but other modalities are needed for volume management if oliguria persists after initial volume loading. According to a recent systematic review, there is little evidence concerning the rate of infusion, optimal resuscitation endpoints, and the type of fluid in patients with acute pancreatitis.

In patients with pancreatitis who develop shock, the same management guidelines as for septic shock patients can be applied. These include an initial fluid challenge with specific parameters.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: A scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^115DfHzC]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

All studies identified in the scoping review were extracted into Microsoft Excel. The study screening was delivered over a two-staged process by two independent reviewers. In stage 1, all the titles and abstracts were screened by two authors. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if consensus could not be reached, the senior author arbitrated. Once agreement was reached on the included studies, the titles and abstracts were screened again by two more authors, prior to retrieving full texts.

The inclusion criteria were: (i) clinical practice guideline for the management of adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute pancreatitis; (ii) provide guidance into more than one facet of investigations, diagnosis, and management (i.e.g.uidance on nutritional support and antibiotic prescribing). Where more than one clinical practice guideline originated from a group, the most current at the time of writing was included.

The exclusion criteria were: (i) non-English papers; (ii) secondary review of clinical guidelines; (iii) clinical practice guidelines focusing on chronic pancreatitis and severe acute pancreatitis only; and (iv) not the most recent guideline or position statement by date of publication (supplemented by the newest version by the same government or organization). When multiple guidelines were identified from the same group, country, or authorship, the most recent guideline was included to avoid duplication and potential bias due to overlapping recommendations.

### Do larger periprocedural fluid volumes reduce the severity of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis [^116YVitj]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid therapy is a cornerstone of the early treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP), but data conflict on whether it affects disease severity. Administering greater fluid volumes (FVs) during the induction of experimental AP preserves pancreatic perfusion and reduces severity but does not prevent the onset of AP. We hypothesized that administering larger FVs during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) associates with less severe post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).

- **Methods**: In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 6,505 patients who underwent 8,264 ERCPs between January 1997 and March 2009; 211 of these patients developed PEP (48 mild, 141 moderate, and 22 severe). Data for FVs were available for 173 patients with PEP.

- **Results**: In univariable analysis, only 1 of 16 variables was significantly associated with moderate to severe PEP — larger periprocedural FV was protective (0.94 ± 0.3 L vs 0.81 ± 0.4 L; P = 0.0129). Similarly, multivariable analysis of moderate to severe PEP identified 1 independent predictor — larger periprocedural FV was protective (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.83). Conversely, moderate to severe disease correlated with larger FV administered after PEP diagnosis, reflecting treatment decisions.

- **Conclusions**: This hypothesis-generating study suggests that administering larger periprocedural FVs is protective against moderate to severe PEP. Prospective studies on this topic are warranted.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^114jcV2z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of colloids can reduce the overall volume needed for resuscitation and, thus, could decrease the risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), their use is not recommended in the guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) does not provide any benefit compared with normal saline and its use is associated with an increased need for renal replacement therapy.

In severe pancreatitis, IAH develops due to fluid resuscitation and capillary leakage. Fluid accumulates in the retroperitoneal space, ascites may form, and tissue edema develops. Additionally, a paralytic bowel can contain substantial amounts of fluid and air. All of this occupies space in the abdominal cavity, leading to distension of the abdominal wall. The abdomen can tolerate increased volume to some extent, but when the abdominal wall becomes distended, the increasing intra-abdominal volume causes elevation in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). When IAH (IAP ≥ 12 mmHg) develops, conservative methods should be applied to prevent the development of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). These include restriction of intravenous fluids, gastrointestinal decompression with a nasogastric tube, and drainage of ascitic fluid. Abdominal wall compliance can be increased with adequate pain management; intubation and sedation usually decrease IAP, and sometimes even neuromuscular blockade can be used for this purpose. An effective way to correct positive fluid balance and prevent the development of ACS is the early introduction of hemofiltration.

Renal function is impaired at IAP levels as low as 12 mmHg. In patients with established IAH, both IAP and abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) should be monitored.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^1157R6eE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Two distinct stages of acute pancreatitis (AP) have been identified: the early (≤ 2-week) stage, characterized by systemic SIRS and/or multi-organ failure (MOF), constituting the first peak of death; and the late (> 2-week) stage, characterized by local complications and, in the case of multiple complications due to co-infection of the pancreas and peripancreatic necrotic tissue, this phase constitutes the second peak of death. Recognition of the critical importance of organ failure in determining disease severity is essential. Therefore, fluid therapy to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion is the long-term cornerstone of initial AP treatment.

The combination of microangiopathic effects and inflamed pancreatic edema is now believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AP, resulting in reduced blood flow, cellular death, necrosis, and sustained increased release of pancreatic enzymes, which activates a number of cascade responses. Inflammation also increases capillary permeability, leading to increased fluid loss in the third space, exacerbating pancreatic hypoperfusion, further aggravating SIRS, and leading to MOF. Early aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation can therefore provide microcirculation support, restore blood perfusion, and reduce the occurrence of serious complications such as pancreatic necrosis. Clinical guidelines for fluid therapy proposed by many experts agree that intravenous volume resuscitation should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of AP is made. Ringer's lactate, normal saline, and other crystal solutions can be the first choice for liquid therapy.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^117K5zG5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Admittedly, there are still some limitations to this study:

- **Observational studies**: Several observational studies were included, which led to a decrease in the credibility of the sample.
- **Reverse causality bias**: This meta-analysis was unable to address the issue of reverse causality bias. Clinically, the volume of infusion varies according to the severity of the pancreatitis. Patients with severe pancreatitis have a higher chance of receiving more fluid, which contributes to skewed outcomes.
- **Types of fluids**: There was no uniformity in the types of fluids included in the studies, and no further analysis of the functional differences between each component.
- **Criteria for hydration**: There is no uniform criteria for defining nonaggressive and aggressive hydration. Some literature uses the fluid volume within the first 24 hours as a cut-off, while others are based on fluid rate. Therefore, differences among literature may reduce the validity of this systematic review.

Nevertheless, there are many strengths to our study. A total of 15 studies, including 4072 patients, were included in our meta-analysis, making it the largest meta-analysis on this issue in history. Meanwhile, multiple factors such as study type, region, etiology, age, and severity of disease were also analyzed. There was low to moderate heterogeneity between studies and no publication bias was shown. This study is the first to find that nonaggressive fluid resuscitation is particularly beneficial in Oriental patients and in patients with severe pancreatitis, which provides some guidance for clinical practice.

Subsequently, Bansal et al. in a cohort of 248 patients found that RAC and DBC are similar in ICU admission, need for percutaneous drainage, need for surgery, and in-hospital mortality. The critical category in DBC identified the most severe disease. Nawaz et al. enrolled prospectively 256 patients and assigned a severity category for all three classifications: RAC, DBC, and Atlanta 1992. They found that RAC and DBC severity categories accurately reflected clinical outcomes and were superior to Atlanta 1992, evaluating mortality, ICU admission, and ICU length of stay.

Two years later, a retrospective study of 395 patients in China, with an overall 8.9% in-hospital mortality, found similar results. The authors found that all three classification systems (RAC, BDC, and Atlanta 1992) accurately classify the severity of AP. However, the RAC and the DBC performed better than the Atlanta 1992, and they were comparable in predicting long-term clinical prognosis, major complications, and clinical interventions.

Choi et al, studying 553 patients with AP admitted to a single center during a 7-year period, validated the RAC correlating well with clinical outcomes, despite not considering infected necrosis. However, patients in the severe group and with infected necrosis (classified as critical in DBC) should be considered separately from those without it. The mortality rate increased fourfold, up to 32%. Another study analyzed 543 episodes of AP from 459 patients in a prospective cohort. They found that the different classification systems varied in accuracy and reliability.

### Current controversies in fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review [^116LM2vd]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common inflammatory disorder of the pancreas resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is generally recommended for all patients with AP and remains the cornerstone of their management. However, the optimal rate, type, and goal of resuscitation remain unclear. This review aims to provide insight into the pathophysiologic alterations in the pancreatic microcirculation that occur in AP, the markers for early recognition of the severity of pancreatitis, and the optimal fluid, timing, and extent of fluid resuscitation.

An early elevated hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine should prompt clinicians to institute more intensive early resuscitation measures. Crystalloids are the currently recommended fluids for the management of these patients. Studies are currently underway to determine the optimal end points of fluid resuscitation that affect outcomes.

Further, there were no recommendations highlighted in the palliation domain across the different CPGs. Although acute pancreatitis (AP) is often considered a self-limiting condition, patients with severe or necrotizing disease may experience a high symptom burden, prolonged hospital stays, and significant morbidity. In such cases, a palliative approach that focuses on symptom management, quality of life, and supportive care may be needed.

Pain management remains a cornerstone of treatment, particularly in patients with persistent abdominal pain despite resolution of the acute episode. In addition to opioids and adjunctive analgesics, multimodal pain relief strategies, including regional anaesthesia and non-pharmacological interventions, should be considered. Nutritional support also plays a role in palliation, especially for patients who develop pancreatic insufficiency or experience recurrent acute pancreatitis (reAP) episodes that impact their nutritional status. Early enteral feeding is recommended in severe cases, but for patients with long-term complications, dietary modifications and enzyme supplementation may be required to maintain nutritional balance and prevent weight loss.

In rare cases where acute pancreatitis progresses to multisystem organ failure, discussions regarding goals of care and end-of-life decision-making may be necessary. For patients with refractory AP or those at high risk of mortality, palliative care services can provide holistic support, addressing not only symptom relief but also psychological and family-centered concerns.

### Intravenous fluid resuscitation in the management of acute pancreatitis [^114atUSu]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In the absence of proven effective pharmacologic therapy for acute pancreatitis, intravenous fluid resuscitation remains the cornerstone of early treatment due to its simplicity, wide availability, and perceived safety. This article reviews the rationale for fluid therapy, critically appraises published literature, and summarizes recent studies.

Several observational studies and small clinical trials have raised concerns regarding the efficacy and safety of aggressive fluid resuscitation. Early aggressive fluid therapy shows the highest benefit among acute pancreatitis patients with predicted mild severity. Conversely, aggressive resuscitation in predicted severe cases may be futile and harmful. Based on animal studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses, lactated Ringer's solution is the preferred fluid type. Guidelines, quality indicators, and global practice patterns exhibit wide variations in fluid resuscitation approaches.

There is a lack of high-quality data supporting early aggressive fluid resuscitation. Large, well-designed, multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal timing, fluid type, volume, rate, and duration of fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the first 72 hours [^116Rxvou]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a common condition that affects patients with varying degrees of severity and may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the paradigm in acute pancreatitis management within the first 72 hours of diagnosis.

- **Recent findings**: Patients presenting with acute pancreatitis should be evaluated clinically for signs and symptoms of organ failure to appropriately triage them. Initial management should focus on fluid resuscitation, with some data supporting Ringer's lactate over physiological saline. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in acute pancreatitis is not recommended, nor is urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant acute cholangitis. Early oral feeding should be encouraged, and the use of parenteral nutrition is discouraged. Cholecystectomy during the same admission of biliary pancreatitis should be performed to prevent future acute pancreatitis episodes. Patients with acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol should receive alcohol counseling. There is ongoing interest in the development of prognostic laboratory tests in acute pancreatitis and pharmacological therapies to reduce the inflammation that occurs in this condition.

- **Summary**: Acute pancreatitis is a common and heterogeneous condition with the potential for significant morbidity. Best practices in acute pancreatitis management focus on triage, hydration, and enteral feeding.

### Prevalence of fluid overload in a cohort of patients with acute pancreatitis: Results from a retrospective tertiary single-center study [^117T5p5M]. Pancreas (2025). Low credibility.

Aggressive fluid expansion has been an undisputed aspect of navigating the early stages of acute pancreatitis. However, evidence from the WATERFALL trial supports a more conservative approach to fluid resuscitation, as patients face higher odds of fluid overload while experiencing no benefit to their underlying condition. This retrospective, monocentric observational study seeks to identify fluid-related complications in patients with acute pancreatitis of any grade of severity.

- **Methods**: One hundred twenty-nine patients with acute pancreatitis, including moderately severe and severe courses, were divided into groups based on their cumulative fluid administration within the first 24 hours (restrictive: > 6 L). Vital signs and laboratory values were reported at defined time points.

- **Results**: Most patients were allocated to the group of moderate fluid resuscitation. At baseline, patients did not differ in systemic disease severity as indicated by critical illness scores. A higher proportion of patients with moderately severe or severe pancreatitis associated with an acute peripancreatic fluid collection had previously been administered > 6 L fluids. C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients with > 6 L, while albumin levels were decreased. Patients receiving > 6 L of fluids were more likely to show radiological features of pulmonary fluid overload and be transferred to the intensive care unit. Additionally, oxygenation markedly deteriorated in aggressively hydrated patients compared to those on restrictive and moderate fluid regimes.

### Editorial: Fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: striking the right balance [^111FWNnW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is a key component of the early management of acute pancreatitis. Clinical practice guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation, despite limited prospective data. In this month's issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, de-Madaria et al. present findings from a prospective cohort study that evaluate the relationship between early resuscitation parameters and several important outcome measures. Their findings challenge several of our long-held beliefs regarding the benefits of vigorous fluid resuscitation in the early phase of acute pancreatitis. Findings from this study, along with several others, now suggest that a more tailored approach to resuscitation is needed.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114yFFds]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis experience the mild form of the disease, about 20–30% develop a severe form, often associated with single or multiple organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Identifying the severe form early is one of the major challenges in managing severe acute pancreatitis.

Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. While most patients with sterile necrosis can be managed non-operatively, patients with infected necrosis usually require an intervention, which can be percutaneous, endoscopic, or open surgical.

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis, developed from a collaboration of a panel of experts who met during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery from June 27–30, 2018, in Bertinoro, Italy. The main topics of these guidelines fall under the following categories: diagnosis, antibiotic treatment, management in the intensive care unit, surgical and operative management, and open abdomen.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112posCB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Several interventions have been identified as critical within 48 hours, particularly fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and nutritional support.

- **Fluid therapy**: Sustainable scientific, and particularly clinical, data on how to guide fluid therapy in this disease are still scarce. A recent review underlined the concept of early aggressive resuscitation, guided by clinical estimation and the assessment of BUN and hematocrit levels. Recent results from a small retrospective single-center cohort study seem to support such an aggressive approach in severe acute pancreatitis, whereas data from another prospective study reported that excessive hydration (10–15 ml/kg/h), aimed at obtaining a hematocrit of 35%, resulted in increased organ failure, respiratory insufficiency, and mortality. Whether guiding fluid therapy by cardiac output measurements and/or assessment of fluid responsiveness will lead to improvements in the management of this important therapeutic action with positive effects on outcomes, as shown in recent experimental studies, needs to be confirmed in clinical settings.

- **Analgesia**: Because of the severity of pain in severe acute pancreatitis, opioids are widely used. However, there remains uncertainty regarding whether their side effect of inducing spasms of the smooth muscles may obscure the resolution of the disease or induce additional pain. Data from a recent Cochrane analysis do not support those concerns, but, as stated by the authors, this analysis is founded on a very limited number of heterogeneous trials [Cochrane Database Syst Rev Jul 26;7:CD00].

### Liberal fluid resuscitation is associated with improved outcomes in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^111ozuRV]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate outcomes, this study focused on children from an observational cohort registry of index acute pancreatitis (AP) admissions managed with different types and rates of intravenous fluid therapy.

- **Study design**: Patients with index admission of AP between 2013 and 2023 were included. Those who received more than 1.5 times the maintenance intravenous fluid rate were assigned to the liberal fluid group. Patients who received twice the maintenance did not have higher rates of organ dysfunction or severe disease.

- **Conclusions**: Children with AP may benefit from liberal fluid therapy and a continued diet compared with more conservative fluid resuscitation and nothing by mouth status.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^116F9dGS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

If prophylactic antibiotics are not given, the empiric use of antibiotics is encouraged in patients who develop organ dysfunctions, because there is a high risk of bacteremia during the first week. Patients with severe pancreatitis fulfill the criteria for severe sepsis in cases of infection, and there is no rapid and reliable diagnostic method available to rule out infection. Delayed administration of antibiotics has been shown to worsen survival in patients with severe sepsis, with or without septic shock.

After the end of the second week, empiric antibiotics may be needed for the treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis if sepsis continues or the patient does not recover. Empiric antibiotics at this stage should cover potential pathogens, including gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. The role of empiric antifungals is not clear. Fine needle aspiration for microbiological samples should be taken if infected necrosis is suspected, although negative samples do not rule out infection. Positive samples help in the selection of antimicrobials and the initiation of possible antifungal therapy. Prophylactic or empiric antibiotics should be discontinued when the patient recovers from organ dysfunctions and there is no evidence of infection.

- **Surgery for infected necrosis**: Infected pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis has traditionally been considered an indisputable indication for surgical debridement. Infected necrosis is a significant source of sepsis, and the removal of devitalized tissue is believed to be necessary for the control of sepsis. However, infection usually continues after necrosectomy.

### Balanced solution versus normal saline in predicted severe acute pancreatitis: A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial [^114nNcyp]. Annals of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of balanced multielectrolyte solutions (BMESs) versus normal saline (NS) for intravenous fluid on chloride levels and clinical outcomes in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis (pSAP).

Isotonic crystalloids are recommended for initial fluid therapy in acute pancreatitis. However, whether the use of BMES in preference to NS confers clinical benefits is unknown.

In this multicenter, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial, we enrolled patients with pSAP (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score ≥ 8 and C-reactive protein > 150 mg/L) admitted within 72 hours of the advent of symptoms. The study sites were randomly assigned to staggered start dates for a one-way crossover from the NS phase (NS for intravenous fluid) to the BMES phase (sterofudin for intravenous fluid). The primary endpoint was the serum chloride concentration on trial day 3. Secondary endpoints included a composite of clinical and laboratory measures.

Overall, 259 patients were enrolled from 11 sites to receive NS (n = 147) or BMES (n = 112). On trial day 3, the mean chloride level was significantly lower in patients who received BMES [101.8 mmol/L (SD: 4.8) vs 105.8 mmol/L (SD: 5.9), difference -4.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -5.6 to -3.0 mmol/L); P < 0.001]. For secondary endpoints, patients who received BMES had less systemic inflammatory response syndrome (19/112, 17.0% vs 43/147, 29.3%, P = 0.024) and increased organ failure-free days [3.9 days (SD: 2.7) vs 3.5 days (SD: 2.7), P < 0.001] by trial day 7. They also spent more time al

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^115Tw9Hw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Statement (increased intra-abdominal pressure)**: Limitation of sedation, fluids, and vasoactive drugs to achieve resuscitative goals at lower normal limits is suggested. Deep sedation and paralysis can be necessary to limit intra-abdominal hypertension if all other nonoperative treatments, including percutaneous drainage of intraperitoneal fluid, are insufficient before performing surgical abdominal decompression.

- **Discussion**: Increased systemic permeability induced by systemic inflammation and therapeutic attempts such as fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drugs are associated with gut failure and worsening of intra-abdominal pressure. Excessive sedation can further worsen gut dysfunction with a subsequent increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Limiting "usual ICU medications" when side effects overcome benefits is crucial.

- **Statement (pharmacological treatment)**: No specific pharmacological treatment except for organ support and nutrition should be given.

- **Discussion**: Despite extensive research, no effective pharmacological treatment has been found.

- **Statement (enteral nutrition)**: Enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent gut failure and infectious complications. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be avoided, but partial parenteral nutrition integration should be considered to reach caloric and protein requirements if the enteral route is not completely tolerated. Both gastric and jejunal feeding can be delivered safely.

- **Discussion**: Enteral feeding maintains the gut mucosal barrier, prevents disruption, and prevents the translocation of bacteria that can seed pancreatitis.

### Aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^1119KAhp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study WATERFALL was published by Enrique de-Madaria and colleagues in 2022 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine. This study focuses on acute pancreatitis. The trial question was whether early aggressive fluid resuscitation is superior to moderate fluid resuscitation in patients with acute pancreatitis.

The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving 249 patients (127 female, 122 male). The inclusion criteria focused on adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pancreatitis. Key exclusion criteria included moderately severe or severe disease, heart failure, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, life expectancy of less than one year, chronic pancreatitis, chronic renal failure, and decompensated cirrhosis.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Aggressive fluid resuscitation group**: n = 122 received a bolus of 20 mL/kg of body weight, followed by 3 mL/kg/hr.
	- **Moderate fluid resuscitation group**: n = 127 received a bolus of 10 mL/kg in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus in patients with normovolemia, followed by 1.5 mL/kg/hr.

- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (22.1% vs. 17.3%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.18).

### The impact of early goal-directed fluid management on survival in an experimental model of severe acute pancreatitis [^114ccKQZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) remains a life-threatening disease characterized by a systemic inflammatory response, with a mortality rate between 30% and 50%. The aim of this study is to compare two different treatment strategies of goal-directed hemodynamic management and evaluate their impact on survival, microcirculation, tissue oxygenation, and histopathological damage in acute pancreatitis in a prospective animal study.

Thirty-four domestic pigs were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. After inducing acute pancreatitis, group 1 received volume administration guided by central venous pressure (CVP > 12 mmHg) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Group 2's hemodynamic management was guided primarily by left-ventricular stroke volume variation (SVV < 10%), MAP, and cardiac output (CO). Treatment according to randomization was conducted for 6 hours, with evaluations of tissue oxygen tension in the pancreas and pancreatic microcirculation. Following the treatment, animals were observed for 7 days and then sacrificed. Standardized tissue specimens were analyzed post mortem, and histopathological scoring was performed.

Survival after 7 days was 29.4% in group 2 compared to 11.8% in group 1 (p < 0.05). Pancreatic oxygen tension (138.0 ± 89.5 mmHg versus 71.1 ± 35.3 mmHg; p < 0.05) and pancreatic microcirculation (1,209.9 ± 630 AU versus 732 ± 315 AU; p < 0.05) were significantly higher in group 2. Significantly less histopathological damage within the pancreas was observed post mortem in group 2.

### Recurrent acute pancreatitis: International state-of-the-science conference with recommendations [^113vU3Jk]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) is a clinically significant problem globally. The etiology remains unclear in approximately 10% to 15% of patients despite a thorough workup. Data on natural history and efficacy of treatments are limited. We aimed to establish criteria for diagnosis, evaluate the causative factors, and arrive at a consensus on the appropriate workup and management of patients with RAP. The organizing committee was formed, and a set of questions was developed based on the evidence, controversies, and topics that needed further research. After a vetting process, these topics were assigned to a group of experts from around the world with a special interest in RAP. Data were presented as part of a workshop on RAP organized as a part of the annual meeting of the American Pancreatic Association. Pretest and posttest questions were administered, and the responses were tabulated by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. The consensus guidelines were established in the format of a diagnostic algorithm. Several deficiencies were identified concerning etiology, treatment efficacies, and areas that need immediate research at the time of writing.

### Decreased mortality in acute pancreatitis related to early aggressive hydration [^115GhUgW]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

Early aggressive intravenous hydration is believed to prevent morbidity and mortality by preventing intravascular volume depletion and maintaining perfusion of the pancreas, possibly preventing pancreatic necrosis. This study was initiated to determine the relationship between the observed decrease in mortality and the role of early aggressive hydration.

A consecutive series of patients with acute pancreatitis from a single community hospital in 1998 were compared to a consecutive series of patients from the same institution in 2008. Significantly more patients developed pancreatic necrosis: 26 (15%) of 173 patients in 1998 compared to 4 (4%) of 113 patients in 2008. The mean rate of hydration was significantly higher in 2008 compared with that in 1998 (P = 0.02). In 1998, hydration was provided at 184 mL/h during the first 6 hours and 188 mL/h during the first 12 hours, compared with 284 mL/h during the first 6 hours and 221 mL/h during the first 12 hours in 2008. There was a significant decrease in mortality in 2008 compared with 1998 (3.5% vs 12%, P = 0.03).

The decrease in mortality seen in patients with acute pancreatitis during the last decade may be related to the increased aggressive hydration preventing pancreatic necrosis.

Regarding medical management for pediatric pancreatitis, specifically with respect to intravenous fluids, NASPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend administering crystalloids either with lactated Ringer or normal saline in the acute setting for initial resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute pancreatitis. Administer a bolus of 10–20 mL/kg in cases of hemodynamic compromise. Provide 1.5–2 times maintenance IV fluids with monitoring of urine output over the next 24–48 hours in pediatric patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^1134Hr2j]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

- **During the second week from disease onset**: Continue supportive care, and try to eliminate excessive third space fluids if possible. If the patient is septic at the end of the second week or later, consider a repeat CT scan with image-guided FNA, followed by empiric antibiotics for possible infected pancreatic necrosis. If infected necrosis is diagnosed, image-guided percutaneous drainage of the collection should be performed. An alternative to FNA is to place a percutaneous drain directly into the collection and take samples; however, if cultures are negative, the drain should be removed to avoid increased risk for infection. Surgery for infected pancreatic necrosis should be avoided during the first two weeks, because necrosis is not well demarcated and surgery is associated with a high risk of hemorrhage and high mortality.

- **After the second week from disease onset**: Continue as in the second week with repeat CT scans if the patient deteriorates, and weekly if the patient is not recovering. Percutaneous drainage of infected pancreatic necrosis can be continued if the patient shows signs of recovery; some patients may even avoid surgical treatment. If the patient is deteriorating despite percutaneous drainage, proceed to surgical necrosectomy, regardless of whether there is proven infection. In patients who do not recover but are stable, surgery for pancreatic necrosis is possible, but should be postponed as long as possible, preferably later than four weeks after disease onset. A CT scan before surgery is recommended for localization.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^113Hw8Vt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Numerous biomarkers have been studied as potential early predictors of the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) so that treatment can be optimally tailored to prevent complications. Currently, no laboratory test is practically available or consistently accurate to predict severity in patients with AP.

In the absence of gallstones or a significant history of alcohol use, serum triglyceride should be measured and considered as the etiology if the value is > 11.3 mmol/l (> 1000 mg/dl).

Many textbooks consider C-reactive protein (CRP) as the gold standard for disease severity assessment. Using a cut-off value from 110 to 150 mg/l, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 38 to 61%, and 89 to 90%, respectively, at the time of hospital admission. The major drawback of CRP is that peak levels are reached only after 48 to 72 hours.

In a prospective study of 175 patients divided into mild and non-mild acute pancreatitis according to the Atlanta classification, CRP and IL-6 combined demonstrated good discriminative capacity with an area under the curve of 0.803.

Resistin is a newly identified peptide hormone, secreted specifically by adipocytes, that can cause obesity and hypertriglyceridemia due to its association with insulin resistance. Studies have revealed that resistin is also an important cytokine in inflammatory reactions and in the regulation of other cytokines. In a prospective observational study, resistin levels were better for predicting severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) than CRP or white blood cell levels on day 3, and better than CRP levels for predicting the development of necrosis.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^112ECW7D]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis has high mortality, but multiple and timely interventions can improve survival. Early in the course of the disease, aggressive fluid resuscitation is needed for the prevention and treatment of shock. In conjunction with leaking capillaries, this results in increased tissue edema, which may lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome.

Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is essential for optimizing fluid therapy, while monitoring intra-abdominal pressure is necessary for identifying patients at risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal compartment syndrome usually develops within the first days after hospitalization.

- **Conservative treatment**: Modalities are useful in prevention but also in the treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome. If conservative management fails, surgical decompression of the abdomen may be needed.

- **Infections**: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and increased intra-abdominal pressure predispose patients with severe pancreatitis to secondary infections. Extrapancreatic infections predominate during the first week of the disease, whereas infection of pancreatic necrosis usually develops later. Early enteral nutrition reduces the risk of infections, whereas the advantage of prophylactic antibiotics is lacking evidence.

- **Surgical intervention**: Surgery for infected pancreatic necrosis is associated with high mortality when performed within the first two weeks of the disease. Therefore, surgery should be postponed as late as possible, preferably later than four weeks after disease onset.

### Prognostic value of a new computed tomography severity score in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [^11647CtY]. Emergency radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The components of the CT severity score are highly nonspecific imaging features, warranting careful interpretation. Fluid third-spacing can result from a variety of causes, including malignancy, inflammation, renal insufficiency, heart failure, and portal hypertension. To enhance the specificity of the CT severity score, fluid third-spacing was excluded when juxta-renal findings were absent. Nevertheless, juxta-renal findings themselves can also arise from diverse etiologies, such as renal inflammation, infection, systemic diseases, fluid overload, or bladder outlet obstruction.

Notably, the observation that juxta-renal findings can result from fluid overload raises the possibility that the CT score's prognostic value may, in part, reflect the detection of aggressive resuscitation efforts in patients already experiencing clinical deterioration. Severe fluid overload is also a major indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Ideally, the confounding effect of fluid overload should have been accounted for; however, due to the retrospective nature of this study, precise input and output monitoring before and during hospitalization was unavailable for most patients. This limitation represents a significant drawback of our study.

Additionally, our study population consisted exclusively of young male military personnel in their twenties, which may have led to an overestimation of the utility of the CT severity score. For broader generalizability, further validation studies are needed, incorporating patients of varying ages and genders.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112wr2Qt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

During almost 20 years, the 1992 Atlanta Classification has been used, but some of the definitions and classifications have been confusing. In a revision of 447 articles, Bollen et al. found that alternative definitions of the 1992 Atlanta Classification were used in more than half of the studies, and that definitions are often used erroneously.

Important insights on the management of acute pancreatitis, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of organ failure and necrotizing pancreatitis, improved diagnostic imaging, minimally invasive techniques, and studies showing that patients in the severe group of the 1992 Atlanta Classification comprise subgroups with very different outcomes indicated that a more accurate classification is warranted.

In a review in 2004, Johnson et al. reported that persistent organ failure (POF) for more than 48 hours in the first week is strongly associated with the risk of death or local complications. They used a previous database of 290 patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis recruited from 78 hospitals through 18 centers in the UK, and also cited that resolution of organ failure within 48 hours suggests a good prognosis.

A retrospective study of 759 patients with acute pancreatitis performed by the University of Edinburgh found that 25.4% of the patients with persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) died, compared with 8% with transient SIRS and 0.7% without SIRS.

These and other studies showed that organ failure is central to the definition of severe acute pancreatitis. If organ failure persists for more than 48 hours, the patient is at high risk of death (one out of three).

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112QfvGG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis have a mild form of the disease, about 20–30% develop a severe form, often associated with single or multiple organ dysfunctions requiring intensive care. Identifying the severe form early is one of the major challenges in managing severe acute pancreatitis. Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions.

While most patients with sterile necrosis can be managed nonoperatively, patients with infected necrosis usually require an intervention that can be percutaneous, endoscopic, or open surgical. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from a collaboration of a panel of experts meeting during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery on June 27–30, 2018, in Bertinoro, Italy.

The main topics of these guidelines include:

- **Diagnosis**: Comprehensive strategies for early identification of severe acute pancreatitis.
- **Antibiotic treatment**: Recommendations on the use of antibiotics.
- **Management in the intensive care unit**: Guidelines for care within an ICU setting.
- **Surgical and operative management**: Best practices for surgical interventions.
- **Open abdomen**: Indications and management strategies for open abdomen procedures.
