## Question

Negative CT imaging on C spine but persistent pain with movement. No neurological deficits. Can outpatient MRi be performed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriateness of outpatient cervical spine MRI for an adult with acute blunt cervical trauma, negative CT, persistent neck pain with movement, and no neurologic deficits, and how to decide safely between options like MRI, continued immobilization, or dynamic films. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-backed indications for MRI after a negative CT. Then, I should verify the diagnostic yield and impact on management of MRI in this exact population. Next, I will consider patient risk stratification and feasibility of an outpatient pathway. After that, I need to compare alternatives such as inpatient MRI, flexion-extension radiographs, or continued collar alone. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework with explicit safety steps, documentation, and follow-up, including when to avoid outpatient MRI altogether [^112JMR3N] [^1153CrA2].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and what it implies pathophysiologically. An alert, neurologically intact adult with persistent neck pain after trauma and a negative high-quality CT raises concern for disco-ligamentous or soft tissue injury not visible on CT, although muscle strain remains common; this is the classic question of whether occult instability exists despite a reassuring CT, and it is the scenario addressed in ACR suspected spine trauma criteria and AANS/CNS cervical spine clearance guidelines [^112JMR3N] [^1153CrA2].

> I should verify guideline direction on "what next" after a negative CT when symptoms persist. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria explicitly support cervical MRI as the next imaging step in patients aged 16 years or older with suspected ligamentous injury after acute blunt trauma when there are clinical findings such as persistent pain or tenderness, especially if clearance is being considered, and they also acknowledge that ongoing immobilization with follow-up is reasonable in selected cases [^112JMR3N] [^1165jnMD]. The AANS/CNS guideline for awake patients with neck pain and normal high-quality CT offers several acceptable options: continue immobilization until asymptomatic, discontinue immobilization after normal flexion-extension radiographs, discontinue after a normal MRI obtained within about 48 hours, or discontinue at the treating physician's discretion, which confirms that MRI is guideline-concordant but not mandated in all cases [^1153CrA2].

> Wait, let me verify whether dynamic flexion-extension films still have a role here, because older protocols favored them. The AANS/CNS option set includes dynamic flexion-extension radiographs for awake patients, but more recent data suggest they are often low-yield after modern CT and sometimes limited by pain or patient guarding; several series show minimal actionable findings, and some recommend excluding routine flexion-extension films from clearance algorithms when CT is negative, which tempers enthusiasm for this pathway in most patients with persistent pain [^1153CrA2] [^116GdWzH]. Hold on, I should also note that improvements in CT and MRI access have further reduced reliance on dynamic radiographs, although they can rarely detect instability missed by CT, so the choice must remain individualized [^111T6tXp].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic yield and management impact of MRI after a negative CT in this exact cohort. Prospective and observational studies report MRI-detected soft tissue abnormalities in roughly 20% to 44% of CT-negative, tender patients, but most represent stable lesions; changes in management are infrequent, typically collar use, with surgery required in a very small minority, indicating frequent detection of clinically minor injuries and a nontrivial false-positive rate with respect to instability [^114LB8Fs] [^115iyNPj]. Larger series show that after negative CT, the negative predictive value for unstable injury is approximately 98% to 99%, and management changes attributable to MRI occur in only about 0.4% to 3%, reinforcing that MRI rarely uncovers an unstable injury requiring operative stabilization in this population [^112qkMiz] [^115iyNPj].

> I need to check the risk in this specific patient profile and not overstate it. With no neurologic deficits and a normal modern CT, the probability of an unstable lesion missed by CT is very low but not zero; pooled data suggest an NPV around 98.5% for unstable injury, which anchors the risk discussion, and this should be balanced against the small but catastrophic risk of deterioration if a truly unstable ligamentous injury were missed without protective measures [^112qkMiz] [^115iyNPj]. But wait, what if we are underappreciating rare exceptions; case reports do exist where delayed neurologic decline occurred after discharge with a negative CT, which underscores the need for reliable precautions and follow-up if an outpatient pathway is chosen [^113EbXWr].

> Now, I will examine feasibility and safety of an outpatient MRI strategy. Outpatient MRI is medically reasonable if the patient can remain in a rigid cervical collar, adhere to spine precautions, and obtain imaging and follow-up promptly; guidelines support immobilization with either outpatient MRI for clearance or expectant management until asymptomatic, acknowledging system and patient factors, and they recognize follow-up imaging in patients kept in a collar for pain without new neurologic symptoms, which aligns with an outpatient workflow [^1153CrA2] [^1165jnMD]. I should double-check resource considerations too; cost and throughput studies suggest MRI adds time and expense when CT is negative, and economic models in obtunded patients even find no follow-up to be cost-effective when CT's NPV is high, which does not directly dictate care in awake patients but highlights the importance of selective use and timely coordination if done as an outpatient [^111jfy2f] [^111oGcaH].

> Let me consider viable alternatives to outpatient MRI and their trade-offs. Inpatient MRI offers faster answers and immediate specialty input but at greater cost and resource use; continued collar without further imaging is accepted by AANS/CNS in some awake patients, but persistent pain argues for further evaluation or a structured plan to reassess; dynamic flexion-extension films can be considered, yet in the CT era they are often nondiagnostic and may be safely omitted in most algorithms given their low incremental yield after high-quality CT [^1153CrA2] [^116GdWzH]. Hold on, I should verify that some reports still document rare instability found on dynamic studies after negative CT, so the decision should incorporate clinical suspicion and local expertise rather than a blanket rule, especially when pain improves and active motion becomes feasible without guarding [^111T6tXp].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my recommendation aligns with both evidence and practicality. Outpatient MRI is appropriate when the patient is reliable, understands continuous collar use and return precautions, has timely access to MRI and follow-up, and the mechanism and examination do not suggest high-risk features; this approach is consistent with ACR and AANS/CNS options for MRI as the next step after a negative CT with suspected ligamentous injury and with the discretion allowed for immobilization strategies in awake patients [^112JMR3N] [^1153CrA2].

> I should also flag situations where outpatient MRI should be cautioned or avoided. High-energy mechanisms, severe uncontrolled pain suggesting potential instability, poor reliability or access to follow-up, or conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, which carry a higher risk of unstable injury and for which combined CT and MRI are specifically recommended, would favor expedited inpatient imaging and specialist co-management rather than an outpatient pathway [^113RB6iN] [^115BgnR1]. Hmm, wait a minute, even with low to moderate mechanisms, evolving neurologic symptoms would immediately override outpatient plans and necessitate urgent re-imaging and consultation, which is a critical safety net to emphasize [^115BgnR1].

> To implement an outpatient MRI plan safely, I need to ensure precise instructions and follow-up. Maintain a rigid cervical collar continuously, provide return precautions for any new or worsening neurologic symptoms, restrict high-risk activity, target MRI ideally within a week, and arrange follow-up within 24 to 48 hours of imaging to act on results; this mirrors the AANS/CNS framework for immobilization with either MRI-based clearance or continued observation and aligns with ACR advice on follow-up imaging in patients kept in a collar for pain without new deficits [^1153CrA2] [^1165jnMD]. Let me first confirm shared decision-making documentation too, including the low but real risk of missed unstable injury after negative CT, the likelihood that MRI will find soft tissue injuries that rarely change management, and the alternative options of inpatient MRI or, selectively, dynamic radiographs if clinically feasible [^112qkMiz] [^115iyNPj].

> Hold on, I should verify whether involving a spine specialist adds value even when choosing outpatient MRI. A brief consultation, especially in systems with established protocols, helps confirm appropriateness, accelerates scheduling, and sets expectations for collar discontinuation criteria after negative MRI or for escalation if positive, which is consistent with collaborative guidance in scenarios of high suspicion but normal CT [^1151BMUV] [^113eLq7Y]. Let me reconsider timing as well; while AANS/CNS noted MRI within about 48 hours in some pathways, practical outpatient scheduling within a week is reasonable if the collar is maintained and there is no neurologic change, with faster imaging preferred if the mechanism or examination raises concern [^1153CrA2].

> In summary, yes — outpatient cervical MRI can be performed and is guideline-concordant for an awake, neurologically intact adult with persistent neck pain after a negative high-quality CT, provided the patient is reliable, remains immobilized, and has timely access to imaging and follow-up; the expected diagnostic yield is predominantly soft tissue injuries with low rates of management change, so the decision should be individualized and balanced against the very small risk of missed unstable injury and the resource implications of MRI [^112JMR3N] [^112qkMiz] [^115iyNPj]. If any red flags develop or risk factors are present that increase the pretest probability of instability, prioritize expedited inpatient imaging and specialist involvement rather than an outpatient pathway [^115BgnR1] [^113RB6iN].

Yes, outpatient **MRI** is appropriate for persistent cervical pain with a negative CT and no neurological deficits [^112JMR3N], as MRI can detect **occult ligamentous or soft-tissue injuries** missed by CT [^114LB8Fs] [^112qkMiz]. MRI is **not urgent** [^115iyNPj] unless neurological deficits develop; it is reasonable to arrange outpatient MRI **within 1–2 weeks** while maintaining a soft collar and activity restrictions. If MRI is unavailable or delayed, consider flexion–extension radiographs [^1153CrA2] or clinical follow-up, and **escalate care if neurological symptoms arise** [^115BgnR1].

---

## Clinical significance of persistent cervical pain after negative CT

Persistent cervical pain following a negative CT may reflect **occult ligamentous or soft-tissue injury** that CT cannot reliably detect [^112qkMiz] [^113xx9FK]. MRI can reveal these injuries, which may be stable or unstable and sometimes require intervention [^114LB8Fs] [^112gnMQh].

---

## Indications for MRI after negative CT

MRI is indicated following a negative CT when there is clinical suspicion of ligamentous or soft-tissue injury, including persistent midline tenderness [^112JMR3N] [^112qkMiz]. The **ACR recommends MRI** as the next imaging step in patients with suspected ligamentous injury following a negative CT [^112JMR3N] [^115BgnR1].

---

## Evidence supporting MRI in this clinical scenario

MRI can detect occult injuries missed by CT [^113xx9FK]. One study showed that 44% of patients with persistent midline tenderness and a negative CT had acute cervical injuries on MRI, including some requiring surgery or prolonged immobilization [^114LB8Fs]. Another study found MRI **changed management** in 2.8% of such patients [^114LB8Fs] [^112gnMQh].

---

## Timing and urgency of MRI

MRI is **not urgent** in neurologically intact patients with persistent pain following a negative CT [^115iyNPj]. Outpatient MRI within 1–2 weeks is reasonable while maintaining a soft collar and activity restrictions. Urgent MRI is indicated if neurological deficits develop [^115BgnR1].

---

## Alternative diagnostic approaches

If MRI is unavailable or delayed, consider **flexion–extension radiographs** or clinical follow-up to assess stability and guide management [^1153CrA2], as these radiographs can help detect instability when MRI is not immediately available [^111T6tXp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The ACR recommends MRI as the next imaging step in patients with suspected ligamentous injury following a negative CT [^112JMR3N] [^115BgnR1]. The **AANS/CNS guidelines support MRI** or flexion–extension radiographs in awake patients with persistent pain and a normal CT [^1153CrA2].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of outpatient MRI

MRI is noninvasive and avoids radiation [^114ZfMbX], but it may detect incidental findings that could lead to unnecessary interventions. However, it can identify **clinically significant injuries** that may require intervention or prolonged immobilization [^114LB8Fs] [^112qkMiz].

---

## Clinical decision-making process

The decision to obtain outpatient MRI should be **based on clinical suspicion**, patient preferences, and resource availability. MRI is appropriate when pain persists and ligamentous injury is suspected, even with a negative CT [^112JMR3N] [^1165jnMD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended imaging** | **Timing** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Persistent cervical pain following a negative CT with no neurological deficits | MRI | Outpatient within 1–2 weeks | Detect occult ligamentous or soft-tissue injuries [^112JMR3N] [^114LB8Fs] [^112qkMiz] |
| MRI unavailable or delayed | Flexion–extension radiographs or clinical follow-up | As soon as feasible | Assess stability and guide management [^1153CrA2] [^111T6tXp] |
| Neurological deficits develop | MRI | Urgent | Evaluate for spinal cord or nerve root injury [^112JMR3N] [^115BgnR1] |

---

Outpatient **MRI** is appropriate for persistent cervical pain following a negative CT without neurological deficits, as it can detect **occult ligamentous or soft-tissue injuries** that may require intervention [^112JMR3N] [^114LB8Fs]. MRI is not urgent in neurologically intact patients, but should be obtained within 1–2 weeks. If MRI is unavailable or delayed, consider flexion–extension radiographs or clinical follow-up [^1153CrA2].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, MRI, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining cervical spine MRI as the next imaging step after CT in patients aged ≥ 16 years with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and clinical or imaging findings suggesting ligamentous injury.

### Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging in alert, neurologically intact trauma patients with persistent midline tenderness and negative computed tomography results [^114LB8Fs]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We aim to determine the prevalence and factors associated with cervical discoligamentous injuries detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in acute, alert, neurologically intact trauma patients. These patients had computed tomography (CT) imaging negative for acute injury but persistent midline cervical spine tenderness. We present the cross-sectional analysis of baseline information collected as a component of a prospective observational study.

- **Methods**: Alert, neurologically intact trauma patients presenting at a Level I trauma center with CT negative for acute injury, who underwent MRI for investigation of persistent midline cervical tenderness, were prospectively recruited. Deidentified images were assessed, and injuries were identified and graded. Outcome measures included the presence and extent of MRI-detected injury of the cervical ligaments, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and associated soft tissues.

- **Results**: There were 178 patients recruited during a 2-year period to January 2009. Of these, 78 patients (44%) had acute cervical injury detected on MRI. There were 48 single-column injuries, 15 two-column injuries, and 5 three-column injuries. Of the remaining 10 patients, 6 had isolated posterior muscle edema, 2 had alar ligamentous edema, 1 had epidural hematoma, and 1 had atlanto-occipital edema. The injuries to 38 patients (21%) were managed clinically; 33 patients were treated in cervical collars for 2 to 12 weeks, and 5 patients (2.8%) underwent operative management, 1 of whom had delayed instability. Ordinal logistic regression revealed that factors associated with these outcomes…

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Cervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^112eoXGp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, particularly with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend considering cervical spine X-ray or CT. Alternatively, performing a facet injection/medial branch block of the cervical spine is suggested as the initial evaluation for patients with cervicogenic headache and new or increasing nontraumatic cervical or neck pain without neurologic deficits.

### Clinical outcome following magnetic resonance imaging as first-line imaging in low-impact pediatric spine trauma: A single-center retrospective observational study [^11161Ymd]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Immediate additional CT imaging was obtained in 15 children. All CT scans were suggested by a radiologist on call to further investigate a suspected fracture or joint dislocation. Only 1 out of 15 additional spinal CT scans covered the entire cervical spine, while the others were targeted to a specific suspicious segment. In total, five complementary CT scans helped rule out spinal trauma, and eight were concordant with MRI, showing no further bony injuries. Thoracic CT was performed in one patient because of a suspected sternal fracture on MRI; however, no sternal fracture was found, and the vertebral contusion seen on MRI was not visible on CT.

When sensitivity and specificity were calculated using targeted CT as a reference standard, MRI was found to be 100% sensitive and 23% specific. This reflects the ability of MRI to reveal bone bruises not visible on CT. Although only limited conclusions can be drawn from 15 patients, this finding underlines the potential pitfall of interpreting bone bruises as fractures. If no fracture line or vertebral height loss is seen, the term "fracture" should not be used. The specificity of MRI for bony injuries can be improved with zero echo time imaging (ZTE), which offers significantly better visualization of detailed bony structures compared to T1-weighted sequences, thus reducing the need for CT. We did not use the ZTE technique in this study.

### Are upright lateral cervical radiographs in the obtunded trauma patient useful? A retrospective study [^112jH4U5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is widely recognized that MRI is better suited than CT for visualization of the soft tissues. D'Alise et al. argued in favor of MRI prior to CT, citing concerns about the inability to visualize soft-tissue changes in the normally-aligned spine imaged by CT. Conversely, Brohi and co-workers maintain that unstable disc or ligamentous injury may be detected indirectly by CT through evaluation of malalignment or malrotation. Indeed, we have observed subtle abnormalities, such as facet joint widening, which led to confirmatory MRI studies. Not surprisingly, MRI has been demonstrated to be very accurate for identifying traumatic disc herniation. The impact of the presence of disc herniations on the decision to remove an immobilization device remains unclear.

A recent effort to delineate evidence-based guidelines for the exclusion of cervical instability recommended that MRI be obtained within 48 hours to be valid. Horn et al. recently examined the use of MRI for identifying posttraumatic instability. In their series of 70 patients whose only positive findings were soft tissue injuries on MRI, none were noted to have instability when flexion-extension radiographs were performed. This finding raises the question of the value of MRI for identifying cervical instability, as it appears to have a high false-positive rate. Schuster and colleagues conducted a prospective comparison of MRI and CT imaging in patients presenting with blunt trauma and concluded that, for patients without obvious motor weakness, MRI was unnecessary.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^116Cq9Ae]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neck pain, more specifically with respect to physical therapy and neck pain with mobility deficits, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend offering a multimodal approach in patients with chronic neck pain and mobility deficits, including:

- **Thoracic manipulation and cervical manipulation or mobilization**: This involves using hands-on techniques to relieve pain and improve mobility.

- **Mixed exercise for cervical/scapulothoracic regions**: Incorporate neuromuscular exercise like coordination, proprioception, and postural training. Include stretching, strengthening, endurance training, aerobic conditioning, and cognitive-affective elements.

- **Other interventions**: Utilize dry needling, laser therapy, or intermittent mechanical/manual traction to alleviate symptoms and improve function.

### Imaging appropriateness for neck pain [^116nfNz4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Imaging of neck pain contributes to a significant proportion of health care costs and is expected to increase with practices that heavily use radiologic studies as a diagnostic tool. Though consensus guidelines are available to assist physicians in the selection of appropriate imaging examinations for neck pain, it is unclear if ordering practices reflect their use and understanding. To investigate this, we analyzed the number and types of imaging examinations performed for neck pain at a university medical center over the past year.

Trends at our institution suggest that clinicians use consensus imaging guidelines, but there is still controversy in the cervical spine regarding when not to image. To promote appropriate imaging utilization, we developed an algorithm to guide imaging of neck pain, based upon clinical presentation, referral patterns for neck pain, and a review of the literature.

### Occult subaxial cervical disco-ligamentous injuries in computer tomography negative trauma patients [^116EvaqZ]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Due to the lack of consensus on cervical clearance in the literature and the devastating consequences of missed cervical injuries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently performed on neurologically intact symptomatic patients with negative CT scans to rule out disco-ligamentous injuries. This study retrospectively evaluates occult disco-ligamentous injuries detected by MRI in patients with no abnormalities detected by modern multi-detector CT scanning and postulates a new theory of ligamentous stability of the cervical spine.

Cervical spine injury patients treated at a spinal trauma referral center from 2010 to 2013 were retrospectively identified. Available clinical records and radiographic imaging were reviewed to find neurologically intact symptomatic patients with no identifiable acute cervical spine injury on CT scan but MRI evidence of isolated subaxial disco-ligamentous injuries. Patient demographics, injury profile, and treatment details were extracted. The Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification (SLIC) and Denis three-column spinal stability theory were adopted to assess the stability of injuries.

Of the 566 cervical spinal admissions, 316 had CT and MRI scans. Eleven (3.5%) CT-negative patients were found to have occult disco-ligamentous injuries on MRI. The average age of these patients was 51.1 years, which was not significantly different from all cervical trauma admissions (p = 0.09). Eight patients sustained flexion-type injuries, and three sustained extension-type injuries. The most common mechanisms were sports and falls on flat surfaces. The average SLIC score was 3.1.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging [^114N3xxx]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with two important questions: Is this headache a migraine? Does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

- **Objective**: To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination in distinguishing patients with migraine from those with other headache types and in identifying patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

- **Data sources and study selection**: A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine, with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard. It also addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology, with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

- **Data synthesis**: Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All four of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if three or four criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized.

### Are upright lateral cervical radiographs in the obtunded trauma patient useful? A retrospective study [^116tA6S8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The best method for radiographic "clearance" of the cervical spine in obtunded patients prior to removal of cervical immobilization devices remains debated. Dynamic radiographs or MRI are thought to demonstrate unstable injuries, but can be expensive and cumbersome to obtain. An upright lateral cervical radiograph (ULCR) was performed in selected patients to investigate whether this study could provide this same information, enabling the removal of cervical immobilization devices in multiple trauma patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed our experience with ULCR in 683 blunt trauma victims who presented over a 3-year period, with either a Glasgow Coma Score < 13 or who were intubated at the time of presentation.

- **Results**: ULCR was performed in 163 patients. Seven patients had studies interpreted to be abnormal, of which six were also abnormal, by either CT or MRI. The seventh patient's only abnormality was soft tissue swelling; MRI was otherwise normal. Six patients had ULCR interpreted as normal, but had abnormalities on either CT or MRI. None of the missed injuries required surgical stabilization, although one had a vertebral artery injury demonstrated on subsequent angiography. ULCR had an apparent sensitivity of 45.5% and specificity of 71.4%.

- **Conclusion**: ULCR are inferior to both CT and MRI in the detection of cervical injury in patients with normal plain radiographs. We therefore cannot recommend the use of ULCR in the obtunded trauma patient.

### Cervical spine injury in the young child [^1132SXbw]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

MRI is highly sensitive, and the clinical relevance of many subtle findings on MRI has not been completely established. Often, obtaining a cervical spine MRI requires deep sedation or general anesthesia, takes much longer, and may require the transport of potentially unstable patients to areas far from the emergency department or intensive care unit. However, MRI identifies spinal cord, soft tissue, and ligamentous injuries particularly well, all of which are poorly identified on a CT scan. In infants and children, MRI may be the study of choice for clearing the difficult cervical spine.

Evaluation of a protocol established to obtain an MRI on all children that could not be cleared clinically or with plain radiographs or CT within 72 hours revealed a trend toward reduced intensive care unit and hospital days, as well as a savings of $7,700 per patient.

Young children are not able to communicate effectively, and severe injuries may require intubation and sedation. Cervical spine clearance after trauma in children between 0 and 3 years is, therefore, deceptively difficult. Recently, however, three proposed algorithms for cervical spine clearance in children have been published, including one specifically for non-communicative infants. These guidelines attempt to integrate NEXUS (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study) criteria, cervical spine radiographs, neurological status, and additional imaging studies like CT, MRI, and flexion/extension radiographs. Even though NEXUS criteria are valid only for adults and inapplicable in non-communicative children, they are still considered in these guidelines.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of patients with cervicogenic headache [^112bhxgP]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

Cervicogenic headache (CH) is a syndrome postulated to originate from nociceptive structures in the neck or head. While the exact anatomical structures responsible for CH pain have not been clearly identified, it is presumed to stem from the cervical spine. In this study, cervical MRIs were evaluated in 22 patients with cervicogenic headache and 20 control patients without any disease affecting the bone and muscle structures of the cervical region. MRI imaging of the cervical vertebrae showed disc bulging in 10 (45.4%) out of 22 patients with CH and in 9 (45.0%) of 20 controls (P > 0.05). The distribution of pathological lesions between patients and controls was not significantly different (P > 0.05). Consequently, MRI may not be adequate to detect pathological findings underlying the etiology of CH, such as nerve roots, intervertebral joints, and periosteum.

### Clinical diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with transient and minor neurological symptoms: A prospective cohort study [^115A2PWQ]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with transient or minor neurological symptoms is uncertain. We sought to determine the proportion of participants with transient or minor neurological symptoms who had MRI evidence of acute ischemia at different clinical probabilities of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.

- **Methods**: Cohort of participants with transient or minor neurological symptoms from emergency and outpatient settings. Clinicians at different levels of training provided each participant with a diagnostic probability: probable (when TIA/stroke was the most likely differential diagnosis), possible (when TIA/stroke was not the most likely), or uncertain (when a diagnostic probability could not be given) before 1.5 or 3T brain MRI ≤ 5 days from onset. Post hoc, each clinical syndrome was defined blind to MRI findings as National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria TIA/stroke; International Headache Society criteria migraine aura; non-TIA focal symptoms; or nonfocal symptoms. MRI evidence of acute ischemia was defined by two reads of MRI. Stroke was ascertained for at least 90 days and up to 18 months after recruitment.

- **Results**: Two hundred seventy-two individuals participated (47% female, mean age 60, SD 14), with 58% undergoing MRI ≤ 2 days of onset. Most (92%) reported focal symptoms. MRI evidence of acute ischemia was found for stroke/TIA clinical probabilities as follows: probable 23 out of 75 (31% [95% CI, 21%–42%]); possible 26 out of 151 (17% [12%–24%]); and uncertain 9 out of 43 (20% [10%–36%]).

### Radiographic assessment [^1126WidE]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically in terms of cervical imaging: CT and the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend not obtaining cervical spine imaging in awake, asymptomatic patients (those without neck pain or tenderness) who have a normal neurological examination, are able to complete a functional range of motion examination, and do not have any injury detracting from an accurate evaluation. In these scenarios, cervical immobilization should be discontinued without performing cervical spinal imaging.

### Survey of inappropriate use of magnetic resonance imaging [^112QvEg3]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Appropriate use of both MRI and CT is very important both medically and economically. There are suspicions of various forces influencing overutilization in many countries, such as financial incentives, self-referrals, and defensive medicine. These are probably not major problems in Finland, but there are concerns about duplicate imaging studies and patient expectations. Institutional and regional variations in imaging patterns and practices may affect appropriateness as well.

Seven percent of the MRI examinations analyzed in our study were inappropriate. In another study of 3,367 hospitals, the use of outpatient imaging varied widely, possibly indicating overuse. Low imaging volume, a rural setting, for-profit ownership, and non-teaching hospitals were more likely to report the highest use. Lack of details about patients' clinical data was reported to be one of the limitations of the study. Another report concerning outpatient CT and MRI scans revealed a 70-fold difference between hospitals in the frequency of scans ordered for a specific indication. A study about outpatient MRIs at a university hospital referred by primary care physicians revealed 23 percent of the 175 examinations to be inappropriate. Most of the inappropriate examinations were in the group of shoulder and lumbar spine MRIs. In another study, referrals for MRI examinations from various hospitals and clinics performing MRI in the area of Stockholm, Sweden, were surveyed. Nine percent of the MRIs were deemed inappropriate.

### Treatment of subaxial cervical spinal injuries [^113RB6iN]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cervical spine injury, particularly in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining CT and MRI in trauma patients with ankylosing spondylitis, even after minor trauma.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^115P5mao]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, more specifically with respect to the initial assessment, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining assessments of impairments of body function when evaluating a patient with neck pain over an episode of care. This is to establish baselines, monitor changes over time, and assist in clinical decision-making to rule in or rule out the following conditions:

- **Neck pain with mobility deficits**: Cervical active range of motion (ROM), cervical flexion-rotation test, and cervical and thoracic segmental mobility tests.

- **Neck pain with headache**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, and upper cervical segmental mobility testing.

- **Neck pain with radiating pain**: Neurodynamic testing, Spurling's test, distraction test, and Valsalva test.

- **Neck pain with movement coordination impairments**: Cranial cervical flexion and neck flexor muscle endurance tests.

### Positivity rates and subsequent patient dispositions after utilisation of cervical spine imaging referral guidelines in Singapore [^112e2Crd]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

MRI is not currently available to our local ED physicians for imaging referral. While MRI is often considered the best test in many clinical scenarios, it may not significantly improve patient management. It would be ineffective for our large cohort of patients, many of whom (approximately 50%) presented with cervical radiculopathy for cervical spine X-ray, because there are high rates of both false-negative and false-positive results when compared to the gold standard of clinical assessment by specialists. A study found that although there was a significant increase in emergency MRI use following the installation of an easily accessible MRI unit in the ED, patients undergoing MRI had increased ED length of stay but decreased admission rates, and the associated hospital length of stay post-admission decreased.

Some patients locally had to be admitted to have an MRI investigation performed, which contributed to the admission rates and potentially overloaded the inpatient MRI services. This resulted in increased hospital length of stay due to the prolonged wait time for MRI investigations. Furthermore, studies conducted on neuro-related conditions suggested lower long-term direct costs and higher cumulative quality-adjusted life years. Therefore, an opportunity exists to improve work procedures related to imaging referrals in the ED, empowering ED physicians to request imaging that has been "pre-authorised" according to the guidelines' imaging recommendations. This will eliminate the need for physicians to seek radiologists' approval for imaging referrals.

### Imaging of dizziness [^116NJ9CR]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency settings, with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, distinguishing a benign peripheral etiology from a central cause can be difficult, especially in the emergency setting.

We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, in addition to examining literature on diagnostic yield in both acute and outpatient settings.

### Sticking our neck out: Is magnetic resonance imaging needed to clear an obtunded patient's cervical spine [^116sad7t]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluating the cervical spine in the obtunded trauma patient is a subject fraught with controversy. Some authors assert that a negative computed tomography (CT) scan is sufficient, while others argue that CT alone misses occult unstable injuries and that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will alter treatment. This study examines data from an urban, county trauma center to determine if a negative cervical spine CT scan is sufficient to clear the obtunded trauma patient.

- **Methods**: Records of all consecutive patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center from January 2000 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients directly admitted to the intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 13, contemporaneous CT and MRI, and a negative CT reading were included. The results of the cervical spine MRI were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 309 patients had both CT and MRI, 107 (35%) of whom had negative CTs. The mean time between CT and MRI was 16 days. Of those patients, seven (7%) had positive acute traumatic findings on MRI. These findings included ligamentous injury, subluxation, and fracture. However, only two of these patients required surgical intervention. None had unstable injuries.

- **Conclusions**: In the obtunded trauma patient with a negative cervical spine CT, obtaining an MRI does not appear to significantly alter management, and no unstable injuries were missed on the CT scan. This should be taken into consideration given the efforts at cost-containment in the healthcare system. It is one of the larger studies published at the time of writing.

### Controversies in cervical spine imaging in trauma patients [^112kxmaZ]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

No area of emergency radiology has generated as much discussion in recent years as the subject of cervical spine imaging for trauma patients. This review will be in three parts.

- **Indications for cervical imaging**: The first part will examine the indications for cervical imaging and will focus on those factors that make patients at high risk or low risk for cervical injury.

- **Radiography and computed tomography**: The second part will discuss the merits of radiography and computed tomography as the main screening diagnostic examination. In addition to the roles of each modality in the evaluation process, factors such as the efficacy of diagnosis, study duration, and cost will be discussed.

- **Methods for clearing the cervical spine**: Finally, the third part will explore the methods currently employed to "clear" the cervical spine in comatose patients.

### Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in cervical clearance of obtunded blunt trauma following a normal computed tomographic finding [^111oGcaH]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be performed for cervical clearance of obtunded blunt trauma, despite poor evidence regarding its utility following a normal computed tomographic (CT) finding.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of MRI vs no follow-up following a normal cervical CT finding in patients with obtunded blunt trauma.

- **Design, setting and participants**: This cost-effectiveness analysis evaluated an average patient aged 40 years with blunt trauma from an institutional practice. The analysis used a Markov decision model over a lifetime horizon from a societal perspective with variables from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and reimbursement rates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, National Spinal Cord Injury Database, and other large published studies. Data were collected from the most recent literature available.

- **Interventions**: No follow-up vs MRI follow-up following a normal cervical CT finding.

- **Results**: In the base case of a 40-year-old patient, the cost of MRI follow-up was $14,185 with a health benefit of 24.02 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY); the cost of no follow-up was $1,059 with a health benefit of 24.11 QALY, and thus no follow-up was the dominant strategy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed no follow-up to be the better strategy in all 10,000 iterations. No follow-up was a better strategy when the negative predictive value of the initial CT was relatively high (> 98%) or the risk of an injury treated with a cervical collar turning into a permanent neurologic deficit was higher than 25%.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^1165jnMD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically concerning cervical imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend considering cervical spine CT, MRI, or X-ray in patients aged 16 years or older with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine. This recommendation extends to follow-up imaging in patients initially demonstrating no unstable injury but who are kept in a collar for neck pain without new neurologic symptoms, including whiplash-associated disorders.

### Are computed tomography scans adequate in assessing cervical spine pain following blunt trauma [^111T6tXp]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Good quality three-view radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and open-mouth/odontoid) of the cervical spine exclude most unstable injuries, with sensitivity as high as 92% in adults and 94% in children. The diagnostic performance of helical computed tomography (CT) scanners may be even greater, with reported sensitivity as high as 99% and specificity 93%. Missed injuries are usually ligamentous and may only be detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or dynamic plain radiographs. With improvements in the accessibility of advanced imaging (helical CT and MRI) and with improvements in the resolution of such imaging, dynamic screening is now used less commonly to screen for unstable injuries. This case involves a patient with an unstable cervical spine injury whose cervical subluxation was only detected following use of dynamic radiographs, despite a prior investigation with helical CT. In this way, the use of dynamic radiographs following blunt cervical trauma should be considered an effective tool for managing acute cervical spine injury in the awake, alert, and neurologically intact patient with neck pain.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^111CAH1g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend considering obtaining cervical spine CT, MRI, or X-ray in patients aged ≥ 16 years with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine. It is also advised as follow-up imaging in patients with no unstable injury demonstrated initially, but who are kept in a collar for neck pain with no new neurologic symptoms, including whiplash-associated disorders.

### Development of a new clinical decision rule for cervical CT to detect cervical spine injury in patients with head or neck trauma [^116T6pkF]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical plain radiography has now been shown to be inferior to cervical CT from the perspectives of both sensitivity and specificity. As a result, a recent guideline recommended cervical CT as the first-line modality for detecting CSI. Nowadays, CT can be performed in EDs, but indiscriminate use of CT leads to unnecessary radiological exposure, and clinical decision rules for CT thus need to be validated and applied. Although one study addressed the derivation of a clinical decision rule exclusively for cervical CT, the researchers concluded that the new criteria lacked specificity and more narrow criteria should be validated in an effort to limit the number of cervical spine CTs being performed.

We previously conducted a retrospective study in a single Japanese institution with the aim of deriving a clinical decision rule for determining the need for cervical CT in patients with head or neck trauma (Rule 1). According to that study, cervical spine CT was recommended for patients with (1) GCS score < 14; (2) posterior cervical tenderness or neurological deficit, and GCS score 14–15; (3) age ≥ 60 years who have fallen down stairs; or (4) age < 60 who have been injured in a motorcycle collision or fallen from height. Rule 1 was retrospectively validated in a separate cohort from the same institution. Validation of this previously developed clinical decision rule in a multicentre study is essential before introduction to clinical practice.

The present dual-centre prospective study was therefore conducted as part of the Emergency Medicine, Registry Analysis, Learning and Diagnosis.

### Clinical relevance of magnetic resonance imaging in cervical spine clearance: a prospective study [^115iyNPj]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A missed cervical spine (CS) injury can have devastating consequences. When CS injuries cannot be ruled out clinically using the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study low-risk criteria due to a neurologic deficit or pain, the optimal imaging modality for CS clearance remains controversial.

The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CS clearance. This prospective observational study was conducted from January 1, 2010, through May 31, 2011, at a level I trauma center. Participants included 830 adults who were awake, alert, and able to be examined, all of whom experienced blunt trauma with resultant midline CS tenderness and/or neurologic deficits, and were undergoing CT of the CS. Initial examinations, all CS imaging results, interventions, and final CS diagnoses were documented. The criterion standard for the sensitivity and specificity calculations was the final diagnosis of CS injury at discharge.

Clinically significant CS injuries are defined as injuries requiring surgical stabilization or halo placement. Overall, 164 CS injuries (19.8%) were diagnosed, with 23 of these (2.8%) classified as clinically significant. All clinically significant injuries were detected by CT. Fifteen of 681 patients (2.2%) with a normal CT scan had newly identified findings on MRI; however, none of the injuries required surgical intervention or halo placement. There was no change in management based on MRI findings.

### Are flexion extension films necessary for cervical spine clearance in patients with neck pain after negative cervical CT scan [^116GdWzH]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Variations exist in cervical spine (CS) clearance protocols for neurologically intact blunt trauma patients who present persistent neck pain but have negative radiological imaging. Guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma suggest maintaining the cervical collar or obtaining either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or flexion-extension films (FEF). This study evaluates the utility of FEF in the era of routine computerized tomography (CT) for CS imaging in trauma.

- **Materials and methods**: All neurologically intact, awake, nonintoxicated patients who underwent FEF for persistent neck pain following a negative CT scan of the CS at our level I trauma center over a 13-month period were identified. Their charts were reviewed, and demographic data were obtained.

- **Results**: The study included 354 patients (58.5% male) with negative cervical CS CT scans who had FEF due to residual neck pain. Incidental degenerative changes were observed in 37% of patients which did not affect acute management. FEF were positive for possible ligamentous injury in 5 patients (1.4%). However, two of these patients had negative magnetic resonance images and the other three had collars removed within 3 weeks as the findings were ultimately determined to be degenerative.

- **Conclusions**: In the current era, where cervical CT has universally replaced initial plain films, FEF appear to be of little value in evaluating persistent neck pain. Their use should be excluded from cervical spine clearance protocols in neurologically intact, awake patients.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers-a cause for concern [^113cXgmz]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Traumatic pediatric cervical spine injury can be challenging to diagnose, and the clinical algorithms meant to aid physicians differ from adult trauma protocols. Despite the existence of standardized guidelines, imaging decisions may vary according to physician education, subjective assessment, and experience with pediatric trauma patients. Our study investigates the rates of pediatric posttraumatic cervical spine imaging across trauma centers, hypothesizing that more specialized centers will have lower rates of advanced cervical spine imaging.

- **Methods**: The 2015 to 2016 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database was reviewed for patients younger than 18 years to assess rates of cervical spine imaging on presentation across different trauma centers. Propensity stratification logistic regression was performed, controlling for patient- and center-specific variables. p Values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

- **Results**: Of 110,769 pediatric trauma patients, 35.2% were female, and the average age was 9.6 years. Overall, 3.6% had cervical spine computed tomography (CT) and less than 1% had cervical spine MRI or X-ray. Compared with all others, Level I trauma centers were significantly less likely to use cervical spine CT for the initial evaluation of younger (≤ 14 years) but not older trauma patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.99; AOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.09). Level I centers had higher odds of cervical spine MRI use, but only for patients 14 years or younger (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09–2.44).

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers-a cause for concern [^115qYozr]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Nonetheless, variability in imaging performance is to be expected to a certain extent, and our findings should not be interpreted as an indictment on inadequate guideline adherence. Each of the published algorithms allows for subjective clinical assessment, physician suspicion, and physician experience to factor into individual imaging decisions. Given the gravity of missing CSI in children, physicians, especially those at less specialized centers who are also less accustomed to caring for pediatric trauma patients, may be taking a "better safe than sorry" diagnostic approach.

Another important possibility to consider, especially in the context of older pediatric trauma patients, is that providers might have been using adult cervical spine clearance algorithms; unfortunately, it is likely that this issue persists today. In 2016, Duane et al. published findings from a decade-long study to determine the best practice for clearance of the cervical spine in the setting of adult trauma patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control trauma team alert criteria. The authors declared that any adult trauma patient meeting the Centers for Disease Control trauma team alert should undergo a CT scan which captures the cervical spine. Hence, providers at adult trauma centers today who immediately request cervical spine CT scans for the initial evaluation of a pediatric trauma patient might actually be following guidelines (in)appropriately because they either lack familiarity with the pediatric-specific protocols or believe the pediatric patient is old enough to meet adult criteria.

### Growing utilization of total spine MRI relative to localized spine MRI for patients presenting through emergency departments over the past decade [^111aGLjA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

MRI has become a routine part of spine care, especially for degenerative, trauma, infection, and/or neoplastic pathologies presenting to the emergency department (ED). Such scans may be of localized regions of the spine (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, cervical and thoracic, or thoracic and lumbar) or of the total spine (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar). Trends and factors associated with such decisions are of clinical interest.

There may be advantages to obtaining an MRI of the total spine. For infections and tumors, this can be advantageous to assess for multifocal aspects of pathology. For trauma, this can be advantageous to assess for fracture/ligamentous injury throughout the spine, especially for the obtunded or distracted patient. For degenerative indications, this can be advantageous if the etiology of symptoms is not clear, and there are red flags such as bowel/bladder dysfunction with concern of spine etiology. In each of these situations, pathology could be missed if MRI was focused on localized regions of the spine.

On the contrary, there can be disadvantages to obtaining an MRI of the total spine, most notably related to study duration and image resolution. One study looked at the utility of whole spine MRI following a whole spine CT for patients who experienced blunt trauma and found that it was unlikely, in most cases, to alter management and advocated for targeted spine MRIs. In an attempt to overcome the resource utilization of total spine MRIs, some have worked to evolve shorter sets of imaging sequences. Unfortunately, this approach may result in the need to reimagine strategies to maintain image quality and diagnostic utility.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^114PYg1n]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Radiological findings associated with whiplash injury illustrate the extent of damage to cervical facet joints. In a prospective study by Rydman et al, conducted on 121 patients presenting to the ED after MVC who underwent cervical CT scans within 10 days of admission, it was found that the mean pain intensity 6 months after MVC was significantly associated with baseline CT findings of facet joint degeneration. The overall prevalence of cervical facet joint degeneration was 45.5%, and patients with a moderate degree of facet joint degeneration were significantly more likely (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.9 to 24.3) to self-report an absence of recovery at 6 months. Facet joint degeneration on CT was graded by the presence of joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and irregularities of the articular surface. However, any specific correlation between the affected facet joints on CT and the suspected levels of pain was not analyzed.

In a longitudinal study by Daimon et al, comparing MRIs of the cervical spine obtained 2 weeks and 20 years following a whiplash injury, changes in clinical symptoms (e.g. neck pain, shoulder stiffness, dizziness, and tinnitus) were not associated with the progression of degenerative changes on MRI. In another study by Gore et al, the presence or severity of neck pain was not related to the presence of degenerative changes on radiographs. However, postmortem studies performed on victims of fatal MVCs have identified lesions and small fractures undetectable on plain radiographs, which raises the possibility that more sensitive imaging modalities might be necessary to fully assess the extent of the injury.

### Outcomes at 12 months after early magnetic resonance imaging in acute trauma patients with persistent midline cervical tenderness and negative computed tomography [^112gnMQh]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

A prospective observational cohort study was conducted involving alert, neurologically intact trauma patients who presented to the emergency department with midline cervical tenderness. Screening cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed after negative computed tomography (CT) when tenderness persisted.

The objective of the study was to determine the association of acute findings and demographic characteristics with any long-term neck disability and the time to return to work in such patients. The relationship between acute findings and outcomes in these patients is unknown, and it was hypothesized that outcomes at 12 months would correlate with acute clinical signs and symptoms, MRI findings, and mechanisms of injury.

Trauma patients at a Level 1 trauma center with persistent midline cervical tenderness, in the absence of evidence of intoxication, painful distracting injury, persistently abnormal neurology, or acute CT findings, who underwent early cervical MRI under the institutional protocol, were reviewed in the outpatient spine clinic after discharge. Factors associated with neck disability and time to return to work were examined at follow-up 12 months after presentation.

Of the 178 patients, 162 were available for follow-up at 12 months (91%). Among these, 46% had MRI-identified cervical spine injury at their initial examination, and 22% had required clinical management, including 2.5% with operative stabilization. Neck disability was present in 43% of patients and was associated with depressive symptoms and workers' compensation claims.

### The effect of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guideline on spinal magnetic resonance imaging use in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients over time [^117PU2wJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines suggest that computed tomography without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sufficient to rule out clinically significant cervical spine injury in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients. This study evaluated MRI utilization over time to investigate the impact of the 2015 Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines, which recommend cervical collar clearance with computed tomography alone for this population. We hypothesized that MRI utilization would decrease following the guidelines.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 to 2018 using multivariable logistic regression on the likelihood of spinal MRI utilization. Blunt trauma patients aged 18 years and older, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less, and an Abbreviated Injury Score head of 4 or greater, intubated for at least 72 hours were included.

- **Results**: The sample consisted of 76,450 patients from 567 trauma centers. Controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, injury mechanism, Injury Severity Score, GCS, GCS motor, hospital teaching status, and trauma center level, patients seen after 2015 had a higher odds ratio (OR) of undergoing spinal MRI relative to those seen before 2015 (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.49–2.09; P < 0.001). Each year was associated with a significantly increased OR of undergoing spinal MRI compared to the year prior (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05–1.15; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Spinal MRI use has been increasing in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients, including after the release of the Eastern Association guidelines.

### Are early MRI findings correlated with long-lasting symptoms following whiplash injury? A prospective trial with 1-year follow-up [^113KthYz]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Neck pain is the cardinal symptom following whiplash injuries. The trauma mechanism could theoretically lead to both soft tissue and bone injury that could be visualized by means of MRI. From previous, quite small trials, it seems that MRI does not demonstrate significant tissue damage. Large, prospectively followed cohorts are needed to identify possible clinically relevant MRI findings.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the predictive value of cervical MRI after whiplash injuries and the value of repeating MRI examinations after 3 months, including sequences with flexion and extension of the cervical spine. Participants were included after rear-end or frontal car collisions. Patients with fractures or dislocations diagnosed by standard procedures at the emergency unit were not included.

MRI scans of the cervical spine were performed at baseline and repeated after 3 months. Clinical follow-ups were performed after 3 and 12 months. Outcome parameters were neck pain, headache, neck disability, and working ability. A total of 178 participants had a cervical MRI scan on average 13 days after the injury. Traumatic findings were observed in seven participants. Signs of disc degeneration were common and most frequent at the C5–6 and C6–7 levels. Findings were not associated with outcome after 3 or 12 months.

The population had no considerable neck trouble prior to the whiplash injury, and the non-traumatic findings represent findings to be expected in the background population. Trauma-related MRI findings are rare in a whiplash population screened for serious injuries.

Radiological findings associated with whiplash injury

Imaging findings immediately after whiplash illustrate the extent of injury to cervical facet joints. In a prospective study by Rydman et al, conducted with 121 patients presenting to the ED after MVC who underwent cervical CT scans within 10 days of admission, it was found that mean pain intensity 6 months after MVC was significantly associated with baseline CT findings of facet joint degeneration. Overall, the prevalence of cervical facet joint degeneration was 45.5%. Patients with a moderate degree of facet joint degeneration were significantly more likely (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.9 to 24.3) to self-report absence of recovery at 6 months.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111vkoEz]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Detecting early degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) can be challenging. A high index of suspicion, alongside a comprehensive neurological examination, is advised. Commonly reported symptoms and examination findings are critical in diagnosing DCM.

- **Clinical**: Pain is a prevalent reason patients seek treatment. Musculoskeletal pain might be present in the neck, while neuropathic pain can affect upper and lower limbs and occasionally the trunk. Patients often report neck stiffness, sometimes without pain. A textbook case would describe gait dysfunction and bilateral hand impairment. Not all symptoms are always present. For instance, pain might be absent, and symptoms can be unilateral, varying in severity even daily. Atypical symptoms such as headaches and muscle cramps are also reported.

The more consistent feature of DCM is the evolution of symptoms. Most patients describe symptoms that have been ongoing for months and worsening. The rate of progression varies; some individuals experience mild symptoms over extended periods, while in others, disease progression accelerates. Functional decline can be insidious, with patients often attributing these symptoms to "getting older". Typical features include loss of dexterity (difficulty with buttons, using keys, mobile phones, or writing) or mobility (use of walking aids or frequent falls).

Symptoms might precede objective examination findings. As in focal central nervous system disorders, examination features in DCM have low sensitivity; a normal finding does not exclude the condition.

### Development of a new clinical decision rule for cervical CT to detect cervical spine injury in patients with head or neck trauma [^112Dq1oK]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical spine injury (CSI) occurs in 2%–6% of patients with blunt trauma to the head or neck. Most clinicians will investigate patients with cervical tenderness or neurological deficit using cervical radiographic assessment, but a non-negligible proportion of patients with cervical spine injury show neither tenderness nor neurological abnormality. Because overlooking CSI may lead to severe sequelae, several clinical decision rules have been developed for this pathology.

The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilisation Study low-risk criteria (NEXUS) assesses five factors and was the first decision rule developed for all patients with head or neck injuries to be validated with high sensitivity. The Canadian C-spine rule (CCR) has also been shown to have high sensitivity. Ottawa researchers compared the CCR and NEXUS using a prospective cohort of alert and stable patients, concluding that the CCR offered significantly higher sensitivity (99.4% vs 90.7%) and specificity (45.1% vs 36.8%). However, researchers in the United States found that the CCR was unsuitable for determining which patients should be transported to Level 1 trauma centres because of the extremely low specificity (0.6%).

### ACR appropriateness criteria cervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^114ZfMbX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Nontraumatic neck pain is a leading cause of disability, with nearly 50% of individuals experiencing ongoing or recurrent symptoms. Radiographs are appropriate as initial imaging for cervical or neck pain in the absence of "red flag" symptoms or if there are unchanging chronic symptoms; however, spondylotic changes are commonly identified and may result in both false-positive and false-negative findings. Noncontrast CT can be complementary to radiographs for evaluation of new or changing symptoms in the setting of prior cervical spine surgery or in the assessment of the extent of ossification in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Noncontrast MRI is usually appropriate for assessment of new or increasing radiculopathy due to improved nerve root definition. MRI without and with contrast is usually appropriate in patients with new or increasing cervical or neck pain or radiculopathy in the setting of suspected infection or known malignancy. Imaging may be appropriate; however, it is not always indicated for evaluation of cervicogenic headache without neurologic deficit. The American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging.

- **Continue cervical immobilization**: Until asymptomatic.

- **Discontinue cervical immobilization**: Following normal and adequate dynamic flexion/extension radiographs.

- **Discontinue cervical immobilization**: Following a normal MRI obtained within 48 hours of injury.

### Additional imaging in alert trauma patients with cervical spine tenderness and a negative computed tomographic scan: Is it needed [^113gLYkD]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The value of additional imaging in clearing the cervical spine (C-spine) of alert trauma patients with tenderness on clinical exam and a negative computed tomographic (CT) scan is still unclear.

- **Methods**: All adult trauma patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, C-spine tenderness in the absence of neurologic signs, and a negative C-spine CT were included. The study period extended from September 2011 to June 2012. C-spine CT scans were interpreted in detail and considered negative in the absence of any findings indicating bony, ligamentous, or soft tissue injury around the C-spine. The incidence of C-spine injury was evaluated using early (< 24 h) repeat physical examination, MRI, and/or flexion-extension films.

- **Results**: Of 2015 patients with a C-spine CT, 383 (19%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age was 43 (IQR: 30–53), and 44.7% were female. Thirty-six patients (9.4%) underwent MRI (3.7%), flexion-extension imaging (5.2%), or both (0.5%), with no significant injuries identified and subsequent removal of the collar allowed. The remaining patients were clinically cleared within 24 hours of presentation. None of the patients developed neurological signs following removal of the collar. On bivariate analysis, no variable except for evaluation by trauma surgery was associated with the performance of additional imaging.

- **Conclusion**: C-spine precautions can be withdrawn without additional imaging in most blunt trauma patients with C-spine tenderness but negative neurologic evaluation and C-spine CT. Focus should be placed on detailed and comprehensive clinical assessments.

### Cervical spine clearance in the traumatically injured patient: is multidetector CT scanning sufficient alone? Clinical article [^113xx9FK]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2013). Low credibility.

The clearance of the cervical spine in patients who have sustained trauma remains a contentious issue. Clinical examination alone is sufficient in neurologically intact patients without neck pain. However, patients with neck pain or those with altered mental status or a depressed level of consciousness require further radiographic evaluation. No consensus exists regarding the appropriate imaging modality. Some advocate for multidetector CT (MDCT) scanning alone, but this approach has been criticized because MDCT is not sensitive in detecting ligamentous injuries, which can often only be identified on MRI.

- **Methods**: Patients were identified retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database at a Level I trauma center. All patients admitted between January 2004 and June 2011 who had a cervical MDCT scan interpreted by a board-certified radiologist as being without evidence of acute traumatic injury and who also had a cervical MRI study obtained during the same hospital admission were included. Data collected included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale score at the time of MRI, the indication for and findings on MRI, and the number, type, and indication for cervical spine procedures.

- **Results**: A total of 1004 patients were reviewed, of whom 614 were male, with an overall mean age of 47 years. The indication for MRI was neck pain in 662 patients, altered mental status in 467, and neurological signs or symptoms in 157. The MRI studies were interpreted as normal in 645 patients, evidencing ligamentous injury alone in 125, and showing nonspecific degenerative changes in the rest.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers - a cause for concern [^113pLLcB]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In our multivariate analyses, controlling for patient demographics, injury severity, and hospital-level covariates, we found that patients 14 years or younger presenting to any Level I trauma center had significantly decreased odds of having a cervical spine CT (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.80–0.99) and significantly increased odds of having a cervical spine MRI (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09–2.44) and X-ray (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.67–2.63). However, children older than 14 years only had significantly increased odds of having a cervical spine X-ray (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.05–2.42), while cervical spine CT and X-ray utilization were equivocal.

### Cervical spine clearance: a review [^111RsufC]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Ethical concerns have hindered any randomized control blinded studies on the imaging required to assess the cervical spine in an unconscious trauma patient. The issue has been contentious for many years and has resulted in burgeoning but inconclusive guidance. MRI and multislice CT technology have made rapid advances, but the literature is slower to catch up. Nevertheless, there appears to be an emerging consensus for the multiply injured patient.

The rapid primary clinical survey should be followed by lateral cervical spine, chest, and pelvic radiographs. If a patient is unconscious, then CT of the brain and at least down to C3 (and in the United States down to D1) has now become routine. The cranio-cervical scans should be a maximum of 2 mm thickness, and probably less, as undisplaced type II peg fractures can be invisible even on 1 mm slices with reconstructions. If the lateral cervical radiograph and the CT scan are negative, then MRI is the investigation of choice to exclude instability.

- **Patients with focal neurological signs**: Evidence of cord or disc injury and patients whose surgery require pre-operative cord assessment should be imaged by MRI. It is also the investigation of choice for evaluating the complications and late sequelae of trauma. If the patient is to have an MRI scan, the MR unit must be able to at least do a sagittal STIR sequence of the entire vertebral column to exclude non-contiguous injuries, which, since the advent of MRI, are now known to be relatively common. Any areas of edema or collapse then require detailed CT evaluation.

### Utility of MRI for cervical spine clearance in blunt trauma patients following a negative CT [^112qkMiz]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of cervical spine MRI in evaluating blunt trauma for instability following a negative non-contrast cervical spine CT.

- **Methods**: A review of medical records identified all adult patients with blunt trauma who underwent CT of the cervical spine followed by MRI within 48 hours over a 33-month period. The utility of subsequent MRI was assessed based on findings and impact on outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 1,271 patients with blunt cervical spine trauma underwent both cervical spine CT and MRI within 48 hours. In the study analysis, 1,080 patients were included. Sixty-six percent of patients who had a CT cervical spine study received a negative result. Of these, the subsequent cervical spine MRI revealed positive findings in 20.9%; 92.6% had stable ligamentous or osseous injuries, 6.0% had unstable injuries, and 1.3% had potentially unstable injuries. For unstable injury, the negative predictive value (NPV) for CT was 98.5%. Among all 712 patients undergoing both CT and MRI, only 1.5% had unstable injuries, and just 0.42% experienced a significant change in management.

- **Conclusions**: MRI for blunt trauma evaluation is not infrequent at our institution. MRI may have utility only in certain patients with persistent abnormal neurological examination.

- **Key points**:
	- MRI has limited utility following a negative cervical CT in blunt trauma.
	- MRI is frequently positive for non-specific soft-tissue injury.
	- Unstable injury missed on CT is infrequent.

### Clinical diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with transient and minor neurological symptoms: A prospective cohort study [^112ACuzS]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in patients with transient or minor neurological symptoms is uncertain. We sought to determine the proportion of participants with transient or minor neurological symptoms who had MRI evidence of acute ischemia at different clinical probabilities of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.

- **Methods**: A cohort of participants with transient or minor neurological symptoms was recruited from emergency and outpatient settings. Clinicians at different levels of training assigned each participant a diagnostic probability: probable (when TIA/stroke was the most likely differential diagnosis); possible (when TIA/stroke was not the most likely differential diagnosis); or uncertain (when diagnostic probability could not be given) before 1.5 or 3T brain MRI, conducted within ≤ 5 days from onset. Post hoc, each clinical syndrome was defined blind to MRI findings as: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria TIA/stroke, International Headache Society criteria migraine aura, non-TIA focal symptoms, or nonfocal symptoms. MRI evidence of acute ischemia was defined by two reads of MRI scans. Stroke was assessed for at least 90 days and up to 18 months after recruitment.

- **Results**: Two hundred seventy-two participants (47% female, mean age 60, SD 14) were studied, with 58% undergoing MRI within ≤ 2 days of onset. Most (92%) reported focal symptoms. MRI evidence of acute ischemia was found for stroke/TIA clinical probabilities of: probable 23 out of 75 (31% [95% CI, 21%-42%]); possible 26 out of 151 (17% [12%-24%]); and uncertain 9 out of 43 (20% [10%-36%]).

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers — a cause for concern [^1146CgVo]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Our primary outcomes were the performance of any cervical spine imaging within 24 hours of presentation, including cervical spine computed tomography (cervical spine CT), cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (cervical spine MRI), and/or cervical spine radiography (cervical spine X-ray). Imaging performance data were extracted from the database using DRG International Classification of Diseases — 10th Rev. — Clinical Modification codes: BR20ZZZ, BR201ZZ, BR200ZZ, and BR20YZZ for cervical spine CT; BR30ZZZ, BR30Y0Z, and BR30YZZ for cervical spine MRI; and BR00ZZZ and BR00ZZ1 for cervical spine X-ray.

- **Independent variables**: Hospital trauma level (labeled as I, II, or III/IV/other/not reported, according to either state or ACS designation) and pediatric specialty center status. Additional variables included patient age and sex, region of the country, injury severity (including Injury Severity Score [ISS] and Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), vital signs, method of injury, presence of a confounding comorbidity, and whether the presentation immediately followed an injury (initial presentation) or corresponded to an interfacility transfer.

Vital signs were dichotomized as either normal or abnormal based on the patient's age group. The method of injury was categorized according to DRG International Classification of Diseases — 10th Rev. — Clinical Modification codes as either a fall, gunshot wound, other penetrating injury, MVA, pedestrian versus motor vehicle (peds vs. MVA), cycling injury, or motorcycle accident.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^112bWoU2]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The scientific question related to the accuracy and safety of image- versus non-image-guided procedures has not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials. The ASA's 2010 practice guidelines are referenced in some insurance company determinations, although their language more generally references 'appropriate image guidance' and does not limit recommendations to specific imaging modalities. The SIS guidelines recommend the use of fluoroscopic imaging with multiple views using the lowest amount of radiation but do not mention the use of CT, US, and imaging modality combinations.

For MBBs, the nerve is not directly visible with fluoroscopy, but its location can be inferred based on accepted bony landmarks. Fluoroscopy is a familiar technology that most pain physicians are comfortable using. However, either real-time fluoroscopy or preferably digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is needed to reliably detect and visualize intravascular injection. Nevertheless, fluoroscopy — and particularly CT — have considerable costs associated with them, including purchase price, maintenance, and the need for dedicated facilities. Further, both modalities — and particularly CT — expose patients and providers to significant radiation, which may have cumulative health effects. The CPT codes for cervical joint procedures that are recognized by most insurance companies are bundled with image guidance, specifically fluoroscopic and CT guidance. Separate US-based codes for cervical procedures (e.g. 0213T–0215T) are considered experimental and investigational.

### Impact of MRI to clear the cervical spine following a negative CT for suspected spine trauma [^111jfy2f]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To describe the clinical presentation of trauma patients receiving a negative cervical spine MRI (CSMRI) after cervical spine CT (CSCT) without acute findings and calculate the associated costs, our cohort consisted of 55 retrospectively reviewed consecutive trauma patients. These patients had CSMRI performed between October 2016 and March 2020, having negative CSCT within 7 days of CSMRI and no other clinically significant injuries. Our outcome was the cost related to CSMRI, estimated by CSMRI charges and the charges related to additional hours of prolonged hospital stay from CT until MRI.

- **Results**: The most common presenting mechanisms of injury were a fall from standing (20/55, 36%), followed by motor vehicle accident (18, 33%). Indications for CSMRI included persistent neck pain (32/55, 58%), recommendation from the radiologist (12, 22%), and neurological symptoms concerning for spine injury (9, 16%). An average of 11.2 hours (median: 8.5, range: 0.2–25.4 hours) passed from CSCT to CSMRI. Fifty-four (98%) of the CSMRI exams were completed within 24 hours of the CSCT. The Medicare reimbursement for non-contrast CSMRI is $309, with the average cost for waiting in ED observation being $907. The total cost of CSMRI and associated wait time ranged from $325 to $2366, with an average of $1216 per patient.

The cost of negative CSMRI following a negative CSCT for cervical spine clearance in trauma patients without other significant injury is substantial. The length of time that trauma patients remain in observation in the cervical collar prior to the finalized MRI examination adds to the costs and resource utilization in emergency care settings.

### Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury with "negative" cervical spine CT scan [^113EbXWr]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old man fell four steps, striking his neck and experiencing associated neck pain and discomfort. He was evaluated at a local emergency department and reported no neurological deficit but exhibited focal mid-cervical tenderness. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans were "negative" for cervical spine fracture, dislocation, or pre-vertebral soft tissue swelling. He was discharged home in a cervical collar with a scheduled outpatient follow-up.

Over the proceeding hours, neurologic deterioration occurred, including hand and lower limb weakness and the inability to urinate. The patient returned to the local emergency room and was transferred to a tertiary care hospital, where examination revealed C5ASIAB deficits. A repeat high-resolution CT scan of the cervical spine with reformatted images was unremarkable for osseous fractures except for some loss of definition in the posterior cervical musculature. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a subluxation of the C5/6 right facet (not evident on CT) with disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamentum flavum, and disc space, as well as an abnormal T2-weighted spinal cord hyperintense signal at C5/6.

He underwent emergency C5-C6 anterior and posterior decompression and fusion. One week later, an examination showed improved C5ASIAD. This case reveals the difficulty of assessing the cervical spine for instability and the potential limitations of management schemes.

### Cervical magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities not predictive of cervical spine instability in traumatically injured patients. Invited submission from the Joint Section Meeting on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves, March 2004 [^1148ndcn]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Identifying instability of the cervical spine can be challenging in traumatically injured patients. This study aimed to determine whether cervical abnormalities demonstrated on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are predictive of spinal instability.

Data from all patients admitted through the Level I trauma service at the authors' institution who had undergone cervical MR imaging were retrospectively reviewed. The reasons for MR imaging screening included neurological deficit, fracture, neck pain, and indeterminate clinical examination (e.g. coma). Abnormal soft-tissue (prevertebral or paraspinal) findings on MR imaging were correlated with those revealed on computerized tomography (CT) scanning and plain and dynamic radiography to determine the presence or absence of cervical instability.

Of the 6,328 patients admitted through the trauma service, 314 underwent MR imaging of the cervical spine. Among 166 patients in whom CT scanning or radiography demonstrated normal findings, 70 had undergone MR imaging that revealed abnormal findings. Of these 70 patients, 23 underwent dynamic imaging, with findings that were normal. In each case of cervical instability (65 patients), CT, radiographic, and MR imaging studies demonstrated abnormalities. Furthermore, there were 143 patients with abnormal CT or radiographic study findings, in 13 of whom MR imaging revealed normal findings. Six of the latter underwent dynamic testing, which demonstrated normal results.

Magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive to soft-tissue injuries of the cervical spine.
