## Question

What is the best imaging for parotid enlargement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best imaging modality for parotid enlargement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and likely etiologies. Then, I should verify age-specific considerations. Next, I will examine first-line imaging choices and their strengths and limitations. After that, I need to check when to escalate to cross-sectional imaging and which modality to choose. I will then consider advanced techniques and the role of PET/CT. Finally, I should confirm the role of tissue diagnosis and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and exceptions, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-level sources and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and differential. Parotid enlargement spans inflammatory/infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, obstructive, and systemic causes, and the best imaging choice depends on suspected etiology, age, acuity, and whether malignancy is a concern, so I need to ensure I anchor on those axes before choosing a modality [^11682og9] [^113Q5pdL] [^111QCT2B].

> I should double-check age-specific nuances. In children, ultrasound is typically first-line because it is noninvasive, avoids radiation, and can characterize superficial lesions and vascularity; CT is reserved for acute infection, abscess, or suspected calculi, while MRI is preferred when deep extension or tumor is suspected or when facial nerve involvement needs evaluation; in adults, ultrasound remains the usual starting point, but cross-sectional imaging is often needed for deep lobe disease, suspected malignancy, or operative planning [^1165zmEy] [^114KiYuv] [^114k99ph] [^113UfGXA].

> Now, let me consider first-line imaging. Ultrasound is generally the best initial test for most non-emergent parotid enlargement because it differentiates focal from diffuse disease, cystic from solid, detects calculi, guides FNA, and avoids radiation; it is also endorsed by AIUM practice parameters for salivary gland evaluation and is first-line in pediatrics, though it has limited visualization of the deep lobe and skull base, which I need to keep in mind [^111ziCGx] [^112hz3eS] [^1165zmEy] [^114KiYuv] [^113UfGXA].

> Wait, let me verify when to escalate. If ultrasound suggests a mass, if malignancy is suspected by clinical features, if there is facial nerve dysfunction, fixation, or concern for deep lobe or skull base extension, or if FNA is planned for a deep lesion, contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging is indicated; ASCO and NCCN recommend CT with IV contrast and/or MRI of the neck and primary site in suspected salivary malignancy, and ACR neck mass criteria support contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for nonpulsatile neck masses at risk for malignancy [^114DPt9q] [^11682og9] [^112PrnPX].

> Hold on, I should verify the choice between CT and MRI. CT with IV contrast is preferred when bone involvement is suspected, for acute inflammatory processes, or when rapid acquisition is needed; MRI with contrast and diffusion sequences is superior for soft tissue characterization, perineural spread, and skull base involvement, and is the modality of choice when facial nerve mapping is required; both are acceptable for tumor delineation, and some centers use both for complex cases, so I need to align the choice with the clinical question and local expertise [^113gcX4e] [^113F3NpV] [^111PwLVu] [^112mADdx] [^112MM9jx] [^113v3M4Y].

> I need to check the role of advanced MRI techniques. Diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can improve differentiation of benign versus malignant tumors and help distinguish pleomorphic adenoma from Warthin tumor, though they do not replace tissue diagnosis; multiparametric MRI and decision-tree models built on ADC and perfusion metrics have shown improved diagnostic performance, which can refine preoperative planning when available [^112s4tCv] [^111vd3AH] [^113aFCt8].

> But wait, what about PET/CT. I initially thought PET/CT might help broadly in suspected malignancy, but I should correct that; FDG-PET/CT is not for initial evaluation of a parotid mass because benign lesions like Warthin tumor are FDG-avid and some malignancies are not, so false positives and negatives occur; PET/CT is reserved for staging advanced high-grade salivary cancers or for surveillance in select scenarios, and even ESMO limits its routine use to high-grade or node-positive disease for distant metastasis assessment [^1161eJEg] [^1168986i] [^1162p6rZ].

> Next, I should review the role of tissue diagnosis. Imaging cannot reliably distinguish benign from malignant in many cases, so ultrasound-guided FNA is the standard for cytologic diagnosis; core needle biopsy is reasonable if FNA is nondiagnostic or sampling is limited by location; I should confirm that ASCO and NCCN endorse tissue sampling to support malignancy distinctions and that FNA accuracy is high in experienced hands, while acknowledging limitations and the need for risk stratification reporting [^113F3NpV] [^11682og9] [^111scBy4].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it. Start with ultrasound for most presentations; if ultrasound is indeterminate, if deep lobe or skull base is involved, if malignancy is suspected, or if operative planning is needed, obtain contrast-enhanced CT or MRI based on bone versus soft tissue questions; prefer MRI for perineural spread, skull base, and facial nerve concerns; reserve PET/CT for advanced high-grade disease staging or select surveillance; integrate FNA/CNB for definitive histology when results will change management; this aligns with ASCO, NCCN, ACR, and pediatric radiology guidance [^114DPt9q] [^11682og9] [^112PrnPX] [^1165zmEy].

> I should double-check special scenarios. In acute painful swelling with suspected abscess or sialolith, CT with contrast can rapidly define collections or calculi; in suspected Sjögren disease, ultrasound and MRI patterns can support the diagnosis and stage disease; in recurrent pleomorphic adenoma, MRI better estimates lesion number than CT and should be prioritized for surgical planning; in children, avoid ionizing radiation when possible and favor ultrasound first, escalating to MRI when deep disease is suspected [^113v3M4Y] [^112pHzTc] [^112nmtbY] [^114KiYuv] [^1165zmEy].

> Final answer, keeping the nuance explicit: there is no single "best" imaging for all parotid enlargement; ultrasound is the best first-line modality for most cases, MRI with contrast is the best problem-solving modality when malignancy is suspected or deep extension and perineural spread must be assessed, and CT with contrast is the best when bone involvement is suspected or rapid acquisition is needed; PET/CT is reserved for staging select high-grade cancers, and tissue diagnosis remains essential when imaging cannot resolve the clinical question [^111ziCGx] [^113F3NpV] [^113gcX4e] [^1161eJEg] [^11682og9].

---

The best imaging for parotid enlargement is **ultrasound as the first-line** [^111ziCGx] modality because it is noninvasive, widely available, and excellent for differentiating cystic from solid lesions, identifying calculi, and guiding FNA [^112hz3eS]. For deep lobe or complex lesions, or when malignancy is suspected, **MRI is the preferred second-line** [^113F3NpV] modality due to superior soft-tissue contrast, perineural spread assessment, and skull base evaluation [^113F3NpV]. CT is reserved for **bone involvement** [^113gcX4e], acute infection, or when MRI is contraindicated [^112MM9jx]. PET/CT is not for initial evaluation [^1161eJEg] but may be used for staging high-grade or advanced disease [^1168986i].

---

## Ultrasound (US)

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging modality** for parotid enlargement [^112XmNMW] because it is noninvasive, widely available, and does not involve radiation exposure. It is particularly useful for differentiating between cystic and solid lesions, identifying salivary gland calculi, and guiding fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies [^112hz3eS]. Ultrasound can also assess vascularity using Doppler imaging, which aids in the diagnosis of vascular malformations and tumors [^112hz3eS]. However, ultrasound has limitations in evaluating deep lobe lesions and perineural spread, necessitating further imaging in complex cases [^114k99ph].

---

## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI is the **preferred second-line imaging modality** for parotid enlargement, particularly when malignancy is suspected or when detailed evaluation of deep lobe lesions, perineural spread, or skull base involvement is required [^113F3NpV]. MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast compared to CT and ultrasound, allowing for better characterization of tumors and assessment of local extension [^111QCT2B]. Advanced MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, further improve diagnostic accuracy by providing functional information about tumor cellularity and vascularity [^113aFCt8]. MRI is also valuable in evaluating recurrent pleomorphic adenomas and distinguishing them from other lesions [^112nmtbY].

---

## Computed tomography (CT)

CT imaging is particularly useful in acute settings, such as suspected abscess formation or sialolithiasis, and when MRI is contraindicated [^113v3M4Y]. CT provides excellent visualization of bone structures and is the **modality of choice for assessing bone involvement** or erosion in parotid gland lesions [^113gcX4e]. However, CT involves radiation exposure and may be less effective than MRI in characterizing soft-tissue lesions and assessing perineural spread [^113F3NpV].

---

## Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)

PET/CT is not routinely used for initial evaluation of parotid enlargement but may be considered in cases of suspected high-grade malignancy or for staging and surveillance purposes [^1161eJEg]. PET/CT can provide valuable information regarding metabolic activity of tumors and detect distant metastases, but its **limited availability and high cost** restrict its routine use [^1168986i].

## Summary of imaging modalities and their indications

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | - First-line <br/> - Cystic vs solid lesions <br/> - Calculi <br/> - FNA guidance | - Limited deep lobe evaluation <br/> - Operator-dependent |
| MRI | - Suspected malignancy <br/> - Deep lobe lesions <br/> - Perineural spread <br/> - Skull base involvement | - Limited availability <br/> - Contraindications (e.g. pacemaker) |
| CT | - Acute infection <br/> - Abscess <br/> - Bone involvement <br/> - MRI contraindicated | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Limited soft-tissue contrast |
| PET/CT | - High-grade malignancy <br/> - Staging <br/> - Surveillance | - Limited availability <br/> - High cost |

---

Ultrasound is the **best initial imaging modality** for parotid enlargement, while MRI is the preferred second-line modality for complex cases or suspected malignancy. CT and PET/CT are reserved for specific clinical scenarios, such as bone involvement, acute infection, or high-grade malignancy.

### An algorithm approach to diagnosing bilateral parotid enlargement [^113Q5pdL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This contemporary review aims to categorize the disease entities that cause bilateral parotid enlargement and to develop a question-based algorithm to improve diagnosis of bilateral parotid masses.

Data Sources

A PubMed search for bilateral and parotid showed 818 results. Of these, 68 relevant studies were reviewed to compile a list of disease processes that can cause bilateral parotid enlargement.

Review Methods

A total of 22 diseases entities were reviewed. The disease processes were initially grouped into 6 categories based on etiology: sialadenosis, infection, neoplasm, autoimmune, iatrogenic, and miscellaneous. For each lesion, the incidence, history, and physical examination were compiled in a matrix.

Conclusion

After reviewing the matrix, it was clear that grouping diseases based on specific history and physical findings limits the differential diagnosis. The most important factors included disease incidence, timing of onset, nodular or diffuse, pain, and overlying skin changes. With this algorithm, the differential diagnosis can be limited from 28 to 7 or fewer likely diagnoses for a given presentation. Implications for Practice Bilateral parotid disease has a wide differential diagnosis with an expanding number of available tests. An algorithm, based solely on data obtained from the history and physical examination in the first patient encounter, may reduce the differential and aid the clinician in deciding on further workup and treatment. Following the algorithm presented here should allow the clinician to arrive at a diagnosis rapidly without ordering unnecessary tests and wasting resources.

### Evaluation of parotid lesions [^1136mi94]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of a parotid lesion is broad, and the otolaryngologist must consider inflammatory, neoplastic, autoimmune, traumatic, infectious, or congenital causes. A comprehensive history and physical examination, in conjunction with judicious use of radiographic imaging (MRI, computed tomography, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine studies), laboratory studies, and pathologic analysis (fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, incisional biopsy), facilitates making an accurate diagnosis. This article reviews the key history and physical elements and adjunctive diagnostic tools available for working up parotid lesions.

### Imaging evaluation of pediatric parotid gland abnormalities [^1165zmEy]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Parotid gland lesions in children can be divided into benign or malignant. The age of the patient helps narrow the differential diagnosis, with vascular and congenital lesions being more frequent in the 1st year of life, while solid tumors are more frequent in older children. Inflammatory disease usually has rapid onset in comparison with that of neoplastic or congenital processes, which have more gradual clinical evolution. Currently, multiple imaging techniques are available to study the parotid region, such as US, CT, and MRI. However, it is still a challenge to distinguish nonmalignant lesions from malignant ones. US is the first-line diagnostic approach in children to characterize the morphology and vascularity of these lesions. CT in children may be indicated for evaluation of abscesses or sialolithiasis. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for investigating the nature of the lesion and its extent. In addition to complete and detailed clinical information, knowledge of parotid gland anatomy and characteristic radiologic features of parotid disorders is essential for optimal radiologic evaluation and avoiding unnecessary interventional diagnostic procedures or treatment. This article illustrates a variety of entities (congenital, inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic) that can occur in the parotid gland, highlighting the most frequent radiologic patterns of manifestation and correlating them with clinical, surgical, and pathologic findings. © RSNA, 2018.

### Management of salivary gland malignancy: ASCO guideline [^1161eJEg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Salivary gland malignancy — PET/CT use and caveats: Providers may perform a PET/CT from the skull base to mid-thighs for patients with advanced-stage high-grade salivary gland cancers (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak). There is no literature to support FDG-PET/CT for the initial evaluation of a parotid mass and it lacks preoperative anatomic detail, but PET/CT may more accurately predict nodal and distant metastatic extent and is of value for staging and surveillance in advanced-stage or high metastatic potential disease; some salivary malignancies have low FDG uptake and many benign tumors (eg, Warthin, benign mixed) are FDG-avid.

### Do magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound add anything to the preoperative workup of parotid gland tumors? [^1165Bbk6]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the additional value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) to physical examination (PE) and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the preoperative determination of the location and histology of parotid gland tumors.

Patients and Methods

Prospectively, 99 patients with 77 benign and 22 malignant lesions were included; 82 underwent parotidectomy. FNAC was performed in 88 patients. On PE, the location of the tumor was predicted. Eighty-nine patients had MRI and 47 US. Various characteristics and the presumed diagnosis were assessed. Furthermore, the location of the tumor in relation to the facial nerve was predicted. The results were compared with the definite histology and the location during surgery.

Results

Of the MRI characteristics, incomplete demarcation from normal parotid gland tissue showed the highest positive predictive value (PPV) for malignancy of 0.48. Of the US characteristics, enlarged lymph nodes yielded the highest PPV for malignancy of 0.5. Cytology correctly predicted the benign or malignant nature of the tumor in all cases. Superficial location was well predicted on PE with a PPV of 0.8, slightly better on MRI (PPV of 0.87), and worse on US (PPV of 0.7).

Conclusion

FNAC is the only accurate investigation for classifying a parotid gland tumor as benign or malignant. Palpation and MRI are superior to US in predicting tumor location. Because the results for palpation and MRI are almost equal, MRI should only be reserved for specific cases, and not routinely requested.

Parotid and submandibular ultrasound evaluation — Sonographic evaluation of the major salivary glands may be comprehensive or focused as appropriate, with the parotid and submandibular glands evaluated in two planes, although oblique planes may be required due to anatomic limitations. A lower frequency transducer may be helpful to visualize the deep aspects of the parotid gland, and Color Doppler may be added for the evaluation of diffuse or focal abnormalities. Reporting should include overall echotexture and measurements, with salivary ductal dilation and calculi reported; when possible, a dilated salivary gland duct should be traced to the level of obstruction, and descriptions of focal abnormalities/masses should include size in three dimensions, margins, echogenicity, composition, and internal blood flow.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of salivary gland tumours: key findings for imaging characterisation [^112s4tCv]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Salivary gland tumours are rare, representing only 3% of all head and neck neoplasms, with the parotid gland being the most common site (80%). The risk of malignancy is inversely proportional to the size of the gland: lesions arising in the sublingual or minor salivary glands are more likely to be malignant, whereas parotid gland neoplasms are mostly benign. Fine needle aspiration cytology and core needle biopsy are considered the most accurate modalities for the diagnosis of a salivary gland neoplasm; however, they are not always conclusive due to procedural sampling errors and for the presence of a cytological / histological overlap between benign and malignant tumours. Moreover, they cannot be easily performed for parotid deep portion localisation. The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is growing and advanced techniques (diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging) can provide useful additional information for the assessment of salivary gland neoplasms. The aim of this review is to present the main MRI and clinical features of salivary gland tumours to improve their comprehensive evaluation and characterisation.

### Swelling at the angle of the mandible: imaging of the pediatric parotid gland and periparotid region [^112MM9jx]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

The pediatric parotid gland and periparotid region are subject to a variety of lesions and are most often evaluated with ultrasonography (US), contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. US may be used to assess the size of the parotid gland, distinguish diffuse from focal disease, assess vascularity and adjacent vascular structures, distinguish cystic from solid lesions, and guide fine-needle aspiration. However, further evaluation with CT or MR imaging may be needed to better define the nature and extent of disease. CT is the imaging modality of choice for most pediatric parotid disease (including acute inflammation, abscess, calculi, and major salivary duct obstruction) and most solid masses and may obviate sedation. However, a mass associated with facial nerve symptoms should be evaluated with MR imaging because it is the only modality that can consistently demonstrate the facial nerve. Findings at US, CT, and MR imaging allow localization of parotid lesions and may suggest a specific cause. Clinical information, familiarity with normal parotid anatomy at various stages of its development, and knowledge of the imaging characteristics of parotid and periparotid lesions are essential for appropriate radiologic evaluation. This information can be used to guide therapy and plan a surgical approach.

### Controversies in the workup and surgical management of parotid neoplasms [^113fobHN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Parotid neoplasms are a rare heterogeneous group of tumors with varied clinical presentation and behavior. Here we provide an evidence-based review of the contemporary approach to evaluation and surgical management of parotid tumors.

Data Source

PubMed and Web of Science Databases.

Review Methods

Searches of the PubMed and Web of Science databases were performed on subjects related to the diagnosis and surgical management of parotid neoplasms. Particular emphasis was placed on the following areas: evaluation of parotid tumors, including imaging workup and the utility of fine-needle aspiration; extent of surgery of the primary lesion, including the extent of parotidectomy as well as oncologic management of the facial nerve; the extent of surgery of involved and at-risk cervical lymphatics; and parotid bed reconstruction. Articles published from 2014 to the present were prioritized, supplementing with information from prior studies in areas where data are lacking.

Conclusion

A summary of the literature in these areas is outlined to provide an evidence-based approach to evaluation and management of parotid neoplasms.

Implications For Practice

While data are available to help guide many aspects of workup and management of parotid neoplasms, further research is needed to refine protocols for this heterogeneous group of diseases.

### Management of salivary gland malignancy: ASCO guideline [^113UfGXA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative imaging modalities — For any patient, adult or pediatric, cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI offers localization of a palpable mass to a major salivary gland and allows detection of additional salivary masses or nodal metastases, although imaging has diagnostic limitations even in distinguishing benign from malignant tumors; cross-sectional imaging may offer further tumor characterization. CT and US may also assist in guidance for FNA or biopsy, which provides greater accuracy for pathologic diagnosis. Adult salivary gland masses are most often inflammatory or malignant, whereas pediatric masses may also be congenital lesions such as infantile hemangiomas, vascular malformations, and first branchial cleft cysts of the parotid. Ultrasound is often a first-line imaging tool in children, but US is limited for evaluation of the deep extent of masses or involvement of the skull base.

### Preoperative computed tomography scans for parotid tumor evaluation [^115gF4WC]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine whether an advantage is obtained in the routine use of computed tomography (CT) scans in preoperative assessments of parotid tumors.

Methods

A prospective study of 32 consecutive cases of patients who underwent evaluation for parotidectomies was performed. Twenty-nine received preoperative CT scans. The scans were systematically reviewed to see if they correlated with the clinical findings. Specifically, we compared clinical and CT assessments of tumor size, location, density, and malignancy. Further comparisons were performed based on postoperative tissue pathology.

Results

In our series of patients, routine preoperative CT scans resulted in the discovery of details not revealed on clinical examination: some masses were found to be extra-parotid rather than primary parotid tumors, some tumors deemed to be deep were superficial, tumor density was more clearly identified, and certain pathology correlates were clarified. Most importantly, there were instances of detection of additional tumors in the same lobe, and in one instance in the opposite lobe, that were not otherwise noticed.

Conclusions

To reduce errors of omission in the treatment of suspected parotid tumors, it would seem appropriate to consider the inclusion of CT scans for the routine preoperative evaluation of all parotid masses.

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^116pzK62]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

AIUM practice guideline — salivary glands ultrasound evaluation states that salivary glands should be systematically evaluated in transverse, anteroposterior, and longitudinal planes, noting parenchymal echogenicity and the presence of focal abnormalities, and each salivary gland examined should be compared with the asymptomatic contralateral gland. The normal echogenicity of all major salivary glands is typically homogeneous and varies from relatively bright and hyperechoic to only "slightly" hyperechoic compared to the adjacent musculature of the neck, with intraglandular fat appearing bright on sonography and sometimes limiting interrogation to the superficial aspect of very fatty glands. The submandibular gland is seen inferior to the body of the mandible and framed by the digastric muscle bellies, with submandibular glands posterolaterally positioned just deep to the mylohyoid and it is usually possible to identify the portion that extends deep to the mylohyoid. The parotid gland's superficial lobe overlies the masseter muscle with its "tail" extending posterior to the angle of the mandible, while the deep lobe extends deep to the plane of the mandible and its full dimension is lost from view in the parapharyngeal space.

### Imaging of salivary gland tumours [^114k99ph]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Salivary gland neoplasms account for < 3% of all tumors. Most of them are benign and parotid gland is the commonest site. As a general rule, the smaller the involved salivary gland, the higher is the possibility of the tumor being malignant. The role of imaging in assessment of salivary gland tumour is to define intra-glandular vs. extra-glandular location, detect malignant features, assess local extension and invasion, detect nodal metastases and systemic involvement. Image guided fine needle aspiration cytology provides a safe means to obtain cytological confirmation. For lesions in the superficial parotid and submandibular gland, ultrasound is an ideal tool for initial assessment. These are superficial structures accessible by high resolution ultrasound and FNAC which provides excellent resolution and tissue characterization without a radiation hazard. Nodal involvement can also be assessed. If deep tissue extension is suspected or malignancy confirmed on cytology, an MRI or CT is mandatory to evaluate tumour extent, local invasion and perineural spread. For all tumours in the sublingual gland, MRI should be performed as the risk of malignancy is high. For lesions of the deep lobe of parotid gland and the minor salivary glands, MRI and CT are the modalities of choice. Ultrasound has limited visualization of the deep lobe of parotid gland which is obscured by the mandible. Minor salivary gland lesions in the mucosa of oral cavity, pharynx and tracheo-bronchial tree, are also not accessible by conventional ultrasound. Recent study suggests that MR spectroscopy may differentiate malignant and benign salivary gland tumours as well as distinguishing Warthin's tumor from pleomorphic adenoma. However, its role in clinical practice is not well established. Similarly, the role of nuclear medicine and PET scan, in imaging of parotid masses is limited. Sialography is used to delineate the salivary ductal system and has limited role in assessment of tumour extent.

### Imaging of major salivary gland lesions and disease [^111QCT2B]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious and inflammatory disorders are the commonest pathologies to affect the major salivary glands however frequently overlap in clinical presentation. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, usually initially performed by CT or ultrasound. MRI, with its superior soft-tissue characterization compared with CT, provides a better evaluation of tumors and tumor-like conditions. Imaging features may suggest that a mass is more likely to be benign versus malignant, however, biopsy is often needed to establish a definitive histopathologic diagnosis. Imaging plays a key role in the staging of neoplastic disease.

### Contemporary management of tumors of the salivary glands [^114oEvX6]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Management of tumors of the salivary glands requires a detailed understanding of the anatomy and pathologic processes affecting these glands. Salivary glands give rise to benign and malignant neoplasms and are affected by a variety of systemic diseases. CT remains the most common primary imaging study; magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound have also been explored. Fine-needle aspiration as part of the diagnostic evaluation remains controversial due to varying sensitivities and specificities. Surgical extirpation is the primary modality for management of tumors of the salivary glands. Parotid surgery carries a potentially high morbidity with possible unsightly scarring and facial nerve damage. Nontraditional surgical approaches and instrumentation, as well as facial nerve monitoring, can decrease the morbidity of a parotidectomy. In specific instances, malignant salivary gland tumors warrant cervical lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant therapy is primarily accomplished with radiation. Chemotherapy continues to play a palliative role in salivary gland malignancies; however, newer trials are investigating the therapeutic role of chemotherapy.

### The relative value of fine-needle aspiration and imaging in the preoperative evaluation of parotid masses [^116s368H]. Head & Neck (2000). Low credibility.

Background

To establish the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of imaging and fine-needle aspiration (FNA), alone or in combination, in distinguishing benign from malignant histologic findings for parotid lesions.

Methods

Retrospective blinded review of preoperative imaging and FNA studies of parotid masses and comparison with histologic findings after excision.

Results

Forty-eight patients were identified (13 with CT, 35 with MRI); 23 (48%) of the lesions were malignant, 25 (52%) were benign. MRI, CT, and FNA misclassified 17%, 46%, and 21% of the lesions, respectively. The sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of these tests for detecting malignant lesions were as follows: MRI (88%,77%,83%), CT (100%,42%, 69%), and FNA (83%,86%,85%) and were not significantly different. Combinations of imaging and FNA were not significantly better in detecting malignancy.

Conclusions

Imaging and FNA are comparable in their ability to correctly identify malignant parotid lesions preoperatively. Combining these two modalities yields no advantage in terms of specificity, sensitivity, or accuracy of a malignant diagnosis.

### Parotid tumors: MR imaging with pathological correlation [^115YM8Ya]. European Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Most parotid tumors grow slowly, whether benign or malignant; thus, it is difficult to predict the malignant or benign nature of a tumor clinically. Magnetic resonance imaging may have a place in the diagnostic work-up of parotid tumors. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the MR imaging findings of parotid tumors and to correlate them to pathologic findings. The MR imaging may be helpful in differentiation of benign and malignant tumors of the parotid gland, and can provide important clues in the diagnosis of their histologies.

### Cytologic diagnosis of parotid gland warthin tumor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XCJ6t]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the reports of slow growth, some studies reported on cases in which WT doubled in size within 1 year. It is therefore of prime importance to identify the patients at risk of rapid WT growth. However, the literature is scarce and does not include important demographics and clinical data. Several studies evaluated the performance of FNA for the diagnosis of WT but showed considerably conflicting results. So et al. reported on 95.8% sensitivity and 97.2% positive predictive value (PPV), and Viguer et al. reported on 90.4% and 98.1%, respectively, whereas other studies demonstrated a rate of false diagnosis of about 25%–40%.,

This systematic review and meta‐analysis considered publications that include a comparison between preoperative FNAC (index test) and postsurgical histopathological diagnosis (reference test) of WT in the parotid gland. In addition, the mean growth rate of the tumor as measured by imaging modalities was calculated.

### Parotid gland incidentalomas: a single-institution experience [^114K8dB5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Parotid gland incidentaloma (PGI) management has not been well characterized in the literature. This study assesses clinicopathologic features, initial evaluation, management, and outcomes of PGIs discovered on various imaging modalities.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective case series from a single academic institution. The study cohort included 34 patients with parotid gland incidentalomas discovered between January 2009 and December 2019.

Results

Parotid gland incidentalomas were most frequently identified on magnetic resonance imaging (16 patients, 47.1%). Most patients (26 patients, 76.5%) underwent further evaluation with subsequent imaging, most often magnetic resonance imaging (18 patients, 69.2%), and fine needle aspiration biopsy (33 patients, 97.1%). Most tumors were benign on fine needle aspiration biopsy (19 patients, 57.6%). Most cases (21 patients, 61.8%) were managed with observation without parotidectomy. Malignant findings on fine needle aspiration cytology were associated with increased likelihood of undergoing parotidectomy (25% vs 0%; p = 0.04). Among the patients who received a parotidectomy, most (8 patients, 61.5%) had benign findings on final histopathology.

Conclusion

Parotid gland incidentalomas were discovered across a diverse set of imaging modalities in our institution. Magnetic resonance imaging and fine needle aspiration were often performed for further evaluation. Most cases were found to be benign on fine needle aspiration and were managed with observation. These findings highlight the necessity of appropriate work-up for these tumors, and the need for shared decision making between the patient and the physician in selecting the appropriate treatment strategy.

### Applications of 3-dimensional ultrasonography in the neck, excluding the thyroid [^111WmTcd]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) of the neck is an accepted, useful imaging modality for many applications beyond its usefulness in thyroid disease. Two-dimensional US has been effectively used for evaluation of many types of neck conditions, and now, 3-dimensional US can be added to the imaging armamentaria. Three-dimensional US is useful in the evaluation of cervical lymph nodes, recurrent/residual thyroid neoplasia, parathyroid glands, parotid and submandibular glands, as well as thyroglossal duct cysts and other assorted palpable and visible abnormalities because of its unique capabilities, including multiplanar reconstruction, accessibility of the coronal view, volume calculation, and regularly spaced incremental slice evaluation.

### Sonoelastography techniques in the evaluation and diagnosis of parotid neoplasms [^112XmNMW]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the first-line imaging investigation in the evaluation of parotid gland lesions; however, ultrasound alone cannot differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. An imaging technique with this capability would be of great value, as fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is not always accurate and partial/total parotidectomy is associated with facial nerve palsy and Frey's syndrome. Sonoelastography is a novel imaging technique that has been employed in the research setting in the evaluation of tissues including breast, thyroid, prostate and the salivary glands. More recently it has been used as a diagnostic adjunct in the sonographic evaluation of major salivary gland lesions. This review article outlines the current role of sonoelastography in the diagnostic imaging of parotid lesions, with particular reference to the findings of two research papers published in European Radiology. These papers employ slightly different techniques: the first utilises shear wave elastography whilst the second uses real-time sonoelastography. Sonoelastography may have potential as a diagnostic imaging adjunct to conventional ultrasound. However, it seems likely that FNAC/core biopsy will continue to be necessary. Further studies to evaluate the reproducibility of sonoelastographic results across a range of operators and systems are also needed. Key Points
- Ultrasound is the initial and often definitive investigation for parotid lesions
- Ultrasound-based strain elastography has been attempted but offered little additional information
- New shear wave elastographic techniques did not confer much advantage either
- However, analysis of elastographic patterns seems to provide advantages over ultrasound alone.

### FDG-PET / CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^1162p6rZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Salivary glands

FDG is physiologically taken up by the salivary glands and excreted into saliva. Low to high FDG symmetrical uptake is noted in the parotid and submandibular glands (Fig. 3). Benign conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, viral infections, bacterial infections, obstructive lithiasis and radiation-induced sialadenitis can also cause increased FDG uptake in the salivary glands. Asymmetrical salivary gland uptake in the floor of the mouth can mimic focal areas of oral cavity malignancy. Asymmetrical submandibular gland uptake can be seen in patients who have undergone surgical removal of a gland with contralateral hypertrophy and in patients who have undergone unilateral radiation therapy (Fig. 4). This focal asymmetrical uptake may occasionally mimic metastatic adenopathy at level IB or II. While symmetrical diffuse uptake in the salivary glands may be physiological (Fig. 3), focal, asymmetrical uptake may also be suggestive of FDG-avid benign or malignant salivary gland tumours like Warthin tumour, pleomorphic adenoma, primary parotid lymphoma or intraparotid lymph node metastasis from skin cancer. The SUVs of most malignant parotid tumours are significantly higher than those of benign lesions. However, some benign tumours may show very high FDG uptake (typically Warthin tumours), thereby mimicking malignant disease, while a few malignant parotid gland neoplasms (typically adenoid cystic carcinomas, low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma or necrotic SCC) may have no significant FDG avidity. Also, some studies show that high-grade salivary gland malignancies are associated with higher SUVs compared with low grade malignancies. Smaller salivary gland tumours may be missed on CECT. Hence, in the presence of a focal asymmetrical FDG uptake, further evaluation with ultrasound (US)/US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (US FNAC) and/or MRI is often mandatory to reach the definitive diagnosis. Due to wide availability, low cost and high diagnostic accuracy, US is commonly used as a problem-solving modality for the evaluation of salivary gland conditions. Many authors advocate the use of US FNAC for the pre-operative evaluation of parotid masses due to its good diagnostic accuracy. One study shows that the positive predictive value of US FNAC for diagnosing parotid malignancy was 84.6% and the negative predictive value was 96.4%. Although MRI is mostly used for the precise assessment of tumour spread, it can also be used as an adjunct to differentiate between benign and malignant salivary gland tumours. Malignant salivary gland tumours are often associated with ill-defined margins, low T2 signal due to high cellularity, perineural spread most often along the facial nerve (when originating in the parotid gland), invasion of the mandible, skull base, subcutaneous fat or skin and lymph node metastases. Nevertheless, these signs may be absent in small-sized or well-differentiated malignant tumours, making differentiation from benign lesions difficult. Quantitative analysis with DWI may be of help as the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of benign tumours (1.72 × 10⁻³ mm²/s is often higher than that of malignant tumours (1.05 × 10⁻³ mm²/s (P < 0.001), with the exception of Whartin tumours, which typically show very low ADC values.

### Surgeon-performed ultrasound for the assessment of parotid masses [^114sEwrW]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Studies on parotid gland ultrasound assessments performed specifically by surgeons are seldom reported.

Methods

Retrospective series of a single academic surgeon experience, analyzing 70 new parotid masses with evaluable preoperative SP-US characteristics, location measurements, and perioperative events.

Results

31/70 masses were malignant. SP-US characteristics significantly associated with both malignancy and positive margins included extraparenchymal extension, irregular borders, hypervascularity, infiltration, and the lack of deep enhancement. The larger the skin-to-deep-aspect-of-tumor distance, the more likely the tumor was deep to FN. For the 39 cytologically benign tumors, neither CT nor MRI provided additional information to change management except for full delineation of parapharyngeal space extension in 2 cases.

Conclusion

SP-US can help predict parotid mass benignity/malignancy, positive margin risk, and tumor relation to FN. SP-US may be used as the sole imaging in cytologically benign tumors unless the deep tumor extent cannot be identified.

### Salivary gland disorders: rapid evidence review [^112oBFLb]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

The major salivary glands are the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Salivary gland disorders can affect the glandular tissue or its excretory system. The parotid glands are the largest and produce aqueous serous secretions that are less immunogenic. They are more susceptible to infections and neoplasms. The submandibular glands produce mucinous secretions that are high in calcium and phosphate salts through a long submandibular duct that flows against gravity. The submandibular glands are responsible for more than 80% of salivary stones. Sialadenitis can be acute or chronic and caused by bacterial, viral, and obstructive etiologies; the most common bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus. The most common viral etiologies in children are mumps (globally) and juvenile recurrent parotitis (in vaccinated populations). Sialadenosis is a chronic asymptomatic enlargement of the salivary glands due to systemic disease. Sialolithiasis causes up to 50% of salivary gland disorders. It is associated with salivary stasis and inflammation caused by dehydration, malnutrition, medications, or chronic illness. Obstruction is also caused by trauma, stenosis, and mucoceles. Neoplasms are rare and typically benign, but they warrant referral and imaging with ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance sialography. Most disorders are managed with conservative measures by treating the underlying etiology, optimizing predisposing factors, controlling pain, and increasing salivary flow with sialagogues, hydration, massage, warm compresses, oral hygiene, and medication adjustment. Sialendoscopy is a gland-sparing technique that can treat obstructive and nonobstructive disorders. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):550–559.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^114KiYuv]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Imaging tools

With high-frequency transducers, sonography provides high-resolution images of superficial tissues such as salivary glands. Being readily achievable, non-invasive (notably non-ionizing) and a low-cost modality, ultrasonography is the first-line technique to explore parotid anomalies in children. It differentiates rapidly parotid from non-parotid lesions and indicates if the lesion is cystic, vascular or solid. When further exploration is needed, CT or MRI may be considered. In acute situation, when an inflammatory or infectious disorder is suspected, when a lithiasis is sought or when looking for a bone involvement, CT may be performed. However, when a parotid tumor is suspected and/or deep structures must be explored, MRI is the best imaging modality. MRI provides high contrast resolution images, non-invasive sialography, diffusion-weighted sequences and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences (DCE-MRI). Morphological MRI images assess the size, the location and the content of a neoplasm. Multi-parametric MR imaging helps in distinguishing benign from malignant tumors, based on studies using a combination of some of the following parameters: ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient), TIC (time intensity curve), Ve (extracellular volume ratio), permeability MRI, TBF (tumor blood flow). Moreover, the feasibility of intraparotid facial nerve MR tractography in estimating the presence of a contact between the facial nerve and a tumor has recently been shown, in adults. However, the precise location of the facial in the parotid gland is not routinely assessed. Digital subtraction sialography is no more used.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^112pHzTc]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS)

SS is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects mainly middle-aged women. In children, two forms are distinguished: primary and secondary (associated with another autoimmune disease, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). SS consists of lymphocytic infiltration followed by parenchymal destruction, which primarily involves the salivary and lacrimal glands, causing a dry syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia). Extra-glandular manifestations (arthritis, vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, nephropathy and neuropathy) occur in a few patients. SS, particularly the primary form, is even rarer in childhood than in adulthood, and symptoms of dry eye and xerostomia develop later during the disease. Patients commonly present recurrent episodes of acute, tender parotid swelling and progressive glandular enlargement. Sonography reveals glandular enlargement and heterogeneity due to hyperechoic foci of mucoid impactions and hypoechoic ductal dilatations. Later on, foci of lymphocytic aggregates, calcifications and atrophy may be seen. MRI, including MR sialography, is an excellent technique for diagnosis and staging. Indeed, MRI shows a punctate, globular, cavitary or destructive appearance in the parotid gland, associated with the phase of the disease. Primary SS carries a long-term risk for malignant degeneration into lymphoma.

### Effect of regression of enlarged neck lymph nodes on radiation doses received by parotid glands during intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer [^113Ax96F]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The regression of enlarged neck lymph nodes during intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may increase actual radiation doses to the parotid glands of patients with head-and-neck cancer. We investigated the changes in the lymph nodes volume during IMRT and the effect of these changes to the parotid gland doses.

Methods

Ten head and neck cancer patients with enlarged neck lymph nodes were enrolled in this study. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was repeated to evaluate the change in lymph nodes volume after initial 45 Gy, and the second part of IMRT (21 Gy) was then replanned to reflect the change of nodal tumor volume. The dosimetric benefit of parotid sparing with replanning was compared with that of no replanning.

Results

The enlarged neck lymph nodes in all patients pushed the parotid glands outward in pretreatment CT images. After 45 Gy of IMRT, nodal regression caused the parotid glands to shift inward into the high-dose area. When compared with those without replanning, we found modification of IMRT plan after 45 Gy significantly reduced radiation dose to parotid glands (mean reduction of 2.95 ± 1.10 Gy to the left and 3.23 ± 1.37 Gy to the right, respectively; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Excessive parotid gland doses secondary to the regression of enlarged neck nodes could be mitigated by replanning after 45 Gy. However, recontouring of large lymph nodes that regress during therapy has a risk of under-dosing extracapsular extension of lymph node metastases. Therefore, recontouring should be done with extreme caution.

### The increasing potential of nuclear medicine imaging for the evaluation and reduction of normal tissue toxicity from radiation treatments [^113uKfJb]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging to evaluate toxicity

Imaging therefore presents itself as a good candidate to measure toxicity objectively, locally, in vivo and non-invasively. The ability to visualise and quantify local effects of radiation dose on the voxel level provides new insight into the dose-effect relationships beyond dose-volume effects. Anatomical imaging with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used to do so. Shrinkage of parotid gland volume, fibrosis in the lung and thickening of pericardium are just some of the normal tissue toxicity effects that can be visualised. Anatomical imaging is, however, insufficient for evaluating many important aspects of toxicity. Instead, a quantifiable measure of decrease in organ function is desirable. Beyond morphological changes, CT or MRI can be used quantitatively as well, for example by looking at changes in Hounsfield units or apparent diffusion coefficient in salivary glands post-therapy as a marker of functional tissue loss. 4DCT has been used to measure ventilation changes in the lung, but applications to other organs are limited.

Nuclear medicine imaging techniques have an advantage here and show promise, since they by principle are functional modalities, using radioactive pharmaceuticals to map physiological processes. Moreover, changes in function often precede anatomical changes, thereby allowing for evaluation of biological changes in tissues on shorter timescales. This is typically applied for evaluating the response of tumours to treatment. The challenge in evaluating toxicity, however, is in finding or developing tracers that are substantially taken up by healthy or damaged normal tissue. The decay mode of the radionuclide in the tracer used determines the modality of the scan that can be made. Photons emitted from gamma emitters inside a patient, like technetium-99m, are detected by a gamma camera, with which 2D planar scintigraphy or 3D single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images can be made. Positron emitters, like fluorine-18, are imaged in 3D using positron emission tomography (PET), whereby the photon pairs created from the annihilation of positrons inside a patient are coincidentally detected. Each technique has its own advantage when it comes to resolution, quantification, price, availability and convenience. Regardless of the technique employed, changes in the distribution or dynamics of such a radioactive tracer, when compared to a baseline control scan, forms the principle by which tissue toxicity can be evaluated. This can be further used to derive local dose-effect relationships and correlated with clinical outcomes.

### Cytologic diagnosis of parotid gland warthin tumor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KtLQW]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy

This systemic review and meta‐analysis followed the referred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) extension for diagnostic test accuracy guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted on July 25, 2021 to identify relevant publications. The search terms used were "fine needle aspiration" OR "fine needle sampling" OR "FNA", AND "Warthin tumor" OR "adenolymphoma" OR "parotid" AND "tumor" OR "neoplasm" OR "mass" as well as "growth rate". No date restriction was applied. To expand the search, "similar articles" function in PubMed and "related articles" function in Google Scholar were used. In addition, the reference list of selected articles was screened.

2.2 Eligibility criteria

Articles that used FNAC for the diagnosis of a parotid gland lesion and histopathological assessment for a final postoperative diagnosis were included. Cases with a nondiagnostic FNAC result were not included for the assessment of FNAC accuracy. Case reports, letters, or comments to the authors, article not in English, and cases or articles that did not address WT were excluded. To calculate WT growth rate, we included articles that diagnosed WT using histopathology or cytology. WT size evaluations were based on articles reporting on CT‐ or MRI‐based tumor size evaluation at least twice with a minimum time interval of 3 months, a measured dimension, and which mention follow‐up duration. If more than two size evaluations were available, only the first and the last were included. In cases where several articles used the same database in overlapping years, only the most recent published article was included to avoid data duplication.

### Advanced imaging for quantification of abnormalities in the salivary glands of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome [^1113A1dr]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, these results corroborate a hypothesis in which pSS may start with inflammatory reactions that are followed by deterioration of salivary and lacrimal gland function and a gradual atrophy that includes replacement of glandular cells with fat. The observation of retained right–left symmetry, which is consistent with previous work, indicates that the disease is global and not sporadically attacking one specific gland. Intra-individual differences seen in imaging parameters of parotid and submandibular glands indicate that the disease manifestation may separately affect the parotid or submandibular glands to different degrees.

Study limitations include the use of historical control data for the ¹⁸F-FDG analyses, which did not allow precise comparisons between patients and controls, and analysis of correlations between imaging vs function/clinical parameters in the parotid gland only (for technical reasons for DCE-MRI and to limit the number of comparisons conducted). However, with a few exceptions, the major findings between the parotid and submandibular glands were similar. Parotid imaging parameters only were correlated with overall salivary flow, although the disease generally does involve both parotid and submandibular glands. Finally, the imaging techniques used were not compared with ultrasound examination of the salivary glands.

In conclusion, ¹¹C-MET scans of the salivary and lacrimal glands in patients with pSS have the potential to quantitatively assess residual function in individual glands, while ¹⁸F-FDG is a potential method to assess salivary gland inflammation. These imaging modalities may facilitate non-invasive assessment of patients with pSS, particularly in early phase clinical trials. ¹¹C-MET PET-CT, ¹⁸F-FDG PET-CT and MRI fat fraction could be used to define patients with inflammation (as measured by increased 18 F-FDG uptake) along with relatively preserved residual salivary gland function (preserved 11 C-MET uptake) as opposed to patients with severe dysfunction; the former 'sub-group' potentially being better candidates for drug therapy. Additionally, although not evaluated here, some of these parameters could be used in future interventional studies to assess the mechanistic effects of therapeutic interventions, complementing clinical scoring.

### Sonographic assessment of the submandibular space [^115YNvdb]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

There is a wide variety of pathological processes which may present with swelling in the submandibular space. Although the submandibular gland is the most important structure in this region, there are a number of extraglandular causes of swelling which frequently mimic submandibular gland enlargement. In this review the use of high-resolution ultrasound in the assessment of the submandibular gland and adjacent structures is discussed and illustrated.

Parotid gland anomalies

Parotitis

Parotitis is defined as inflammation of the parotid gland, which may have various causes, including infectious (viral or bacterial), autoimmune, lithiasic or idiopathic causes. Infectious sialadenitis is more common in parotid than other salivary glands. In contrast, sialolithiasis is much rarer in parotid than in submandibular glands and has no specific imaging appearance.

Acute viral parotitis

Acute viral parotitis is more common than bacterial parotitis and is frequently bilateral (90% of cases) but not always synchronously. The main viruses are paramyxovirus (mumps, whose incidence has greatly reduced due to vaccination), Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza and HIV. Clinical signs are painful swelling of the parotid gland, fever and inflammation of the orifice of Stensen's duct. Occasionally, the submandibular and sublingual glands are also affected. Imaging is not needed for the diagnosis. When performed, ultrasonography shows a glandular enlargement with foci of salivary secretions, lymph nodes and increased vascularization (Fig. 3). Spontaneous regression in a few days is the rule.

The special case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

Note that HIV children prevalence rate is low, in western countries. Indeed, if the estimated 1.72 million children under 15 years of age are living with HIV, 89 per cent live in sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition to causing acute parotitis, HIV infection may cause persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (including intraparotid lymph nodes), lympho-epithelial cysts and benign lympho-epithelial lesions. These lesions occur early in the course of the retroviral infection and consist of lymphocytic infiltration, intraductal epithelial proliferation and atrophy of salivary acini. Sonography and MRI reveal a diffuse glandular enlargement, multiple thin-wall cysts of variable size and/or multiple solid masses and cervical lymphadenopathies (Fig. 4). These lesions may also be present in disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis. With HIV infection, there is also increased risk of malignant lymphoma.

### Ultrasound and sialogram correlates to parotid immunoglobulin G4-related disease [^111aa97d]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is an immune-mediated disorder that commonly manifests in the salivary glands. As a recently described disorder, the description and classification of IgG4-related disease is an ongoing process. Diagnosis of IgG4-related disease requires integration of clinical history, histopathology, and radiographic findings, including ultrasonography and sialography. In this case report, we correlate parotid ultrasonographic and sialographic findings in a patient with proven IgG4-related disorder confirmed from analysis of previous submandibular gland resections. We aim to highlight the utility of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.

### MR imaging of parotid tumors: typical lesion characteristics in MR imaging improve discrimination between benign and malignant disease [^114VLtba]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The surgical approach to parotid tumors is different for benign and malignant neoplasms, but the clinical symptoms do not correlate well with histology. Difficulties in tumor classification also arise in imaging modalities, in which sonography has the lowest and MR imaging, the highest accuracy. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using conventional MR imaging of the neck in the evaluation of parotid tumors and to evaluate which MR imaging findings are best able to predict malignant histology.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-four consecutive patients (43 males, 41 females; median age, 56 years; range, 9–85 years) with parotid gland tumors who underwent MR imaging before surgery were prospectively included in the present study and retrospectively analyzed. Histology was available for all tumors. We analyzed the following MR imaging parameters: signal intensity, contrast enhancement, lesion margins (well-defined versus ill-defined), lesion location (deep/superficial lobe), growth pattern (focal, multifocal, or diffuse), and extension into neighboring structures, perineural spread, and lymphadenopathy.

Results

The 57 (68%) benign and 27 (32%) malignant tumors consisted of 29 pleomorphic adenomas, 17 Warthin tumors, 11 various benign tumors, 5 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 3 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 1 acinic cell carcinoma, 1 carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, 9 metastases, and 8 various malignant neoplasms. Specific signs predictive of malignancy were the following: T2 hypointensity of the parotid tumor (P = 0.048), ill-defined margins (P = 0.001), diffuse growth (P = 0.012), infiltration of subcutaneous tissue (P = 0.0034), and lymphadenopathy (P = 0.012).

Conclusions

Low signal intensity on T2-weighted images and postcontrast ill-defined margins of a parotid tumor are highly suggestive of malignancy.

### CT versus MR: still a tough decision [^1154t2bR]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

CT and MRI are the two most widely used imaging modalities for evaluating head and neck pathology. There is continued controversy in the literature about which modality is superior for imaging different areas of the head and neck. This article summarizes the literature supporting the use of CT, MRI, or both for specific clinical scenarios in otolaryngology. Familiarity with the benefits and potential pitfalls of each modality allows referring physicians and radiologists to tailor imaging regimens to the needs of individual patients.

### Sonoelastography for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions: a meta-analysis [^113Vp8Vt]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasonography, CT and MRI are non-invasive imaging methods that are commonly used for the evaluation of parotid tumours. However, these conventional imaging methods are less accurate owing to the overlap in the appearance of parotid tumours. Some malignancies that contain a large amount of serous and mucoid contents are well defined with a homogeneous appearance and resemble benign lesions. In addition, haemorrhage and calcification in benign tumours may result in a heterogeneous appearance that resembles a malignancy. Although ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is considered the gold standard for preoperative diagnosis, it is an invasive method and, as a general rule, non-invasive methods are preferred when the results are similar.

Sonoelastography is an innovative diagnostic imaging tool that assesses tissue stiffness. Since malignant tissues are generally stiffer than benign components, sonoelastography has been used in many organs, such as the breast, thyroid and prostate, for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign lesions. Recently, numerous studies have been published on the role of sonoelastography for differentiating between malignant and benign parotid lesions. However, there are large differences in the results, with a sensitivity ranging from 40% to 100% and a specificity ranging from 26% to 97%. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the performance of sonoelastography for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions using a meta-analysis.

### Balanced turbo field-echo sequence for MRI of parotid gland diseases [^111DL957]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

A balanced turbo field-echo (FE) sequence is a balanced steady-state free precession sequence used for achieving rapid and high imaging. We tested whether this imaging technique is applicable to the diagnosis of parotid gland diseases.

Conclusion

The balanced turbo FE sequence is a novel alternative MRI technique for the diagnosis of various parotid gland diseases.

### Management of salivary gland malignancy: ASCO guideline [^115GPxtx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — post-treatment surveillance for salivary gland cancer — states that follow-up imaging of the primary site and chest from years 3–5 should be directed by symptoms and examination findings, and yearly follow-up imaging may be offered for high-grade histology or poor prognostic clinicopathologic features. Long-term follow-up beyond 5 years with yearly examination should be offered to all patients with salivary gland cancer, and yearly chest CT may be offered especially for those with high-grade histology or poor prognostic clinicopathologic features.

Salivary gland malignancy — when to obtain contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging: When there is concern for malignancy such as neck adenopathy or cranial nerve dysfunction or when full tumor delineation is required for operative planning, contrast-enhanced CT or contrast-enhanced MRI of the glands and neck is recommended, and it is not uncommon to use both modalities when planning resection, particularly with suspected skull base invasion or perineural tumor spread.

### Distinguishing benign from malignant parotid gland tumours: low-dose multi-phasic CT protocol with 5-minute delay [^115CBd1h]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Our study had some limitations. First, parotid gland malignancies include various types of tumours, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, squamous cell carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, duct carcinoma and lymphoma. Second, some selected masses were biased in Warthin's tumours and malignant tumours, only the largest masses of the parotid gland were evaluated. Third, because of the small sample size and overlap in data among the three study subgroups, validation of the proposed cut-off values of CT diagnostic parameters needs to be performed in a larger scale trial. Lastly, if multiple-phasic CT were performed along with a diagnostic study, the patients would be exposed to an additional radiation dose.

In summary, the percentage wash-out ratios in contrast material-enhanced CT may reflect various characters of parotid gland neoplasms, and assist in differentiating the benign from malignant tumours. Combining the percentage enhanced wash-out ratios of the CT protocol can yield diagnostic results in malignant parotid gland tumours.

Salivary gland malignancy — CT for suspected bone involvement: Providers should perform CT of the neck with IV contrast for patients with suspicion of salivary gland cancer and involvement of adjacent bone (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). One of the advantages of CT over MRI and US is the ability to evaluate for erosion of bone adjacent to the temporal bone, skull base or mandible, or the palate with minor salivary gland tumors, and IV iodinated contrast is recommended for all neck CT scans to enhance lesion conspicuity and assessment of metastatic adenopathy and vascular structures.

### Diagnostic imaging in sialadenitis [^112EugGP]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents a survey of the imaging procedures in inflammatory changes of the salivary glands. State-of-the-art procedures are described along with a perspective on recent innovations. Various imaging procedures are discussed, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Then, imaging options in different forms of acute and chronic sialadenitis are considered. The choice of method is guided by consideration of the reliability, the side effects, the accessibility, and, ultimately, the costs. The focus is mainly on diagnostic ultrasound and resonance methods because, with their aid, the investigation of almost all the inflammatory diseases of the large salivary glands can be performed with accurate results, without exposing the patient to radiation.

### Sonoelastography for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions: a meta-analysis [^117GVZUh]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

A strict procedure was carried out to screen the articles and ultimately 10 relative studies were identified. Deeks' funnel plots showed no significant publication bias. Most of the studies were high quality according to the QUADAS questionnaire. A meta-regression revealed that the QUADAS score was not a significant factor affecting study heterogeneity. However, the QUADAS score seemed to perform better in relatively lower quality studies, as shown in Table 4. In one study, it was unclear whether the observers knew the histopathological results before analysing the images. In another study, the observers were aware of histological properties before reviewing the images and videos. These unblinded studies probably had better performance and influenced the results. In addition, in all the studies it was unclear whether the histopathology reviewer knew the results of sonoelastography evaluations, which probably caused heterogeneity and influenced the results as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of sonoelastography merely for differentiating between malignant and benign parotid lesions, except for salivary gland masses.

There are some limitations in our study. First, relatively few studies were included (i.e. ten). Second, we failed to acquire unpublished data and language limitations might have affected the reliability of the results. Third, postoperative pathology was used as a reference standard for tumour detection in most of the studies in this meta-analysis; however, in one study, only cytological and histological results from ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy were used as reference standards, and in another two studies, cytology results from ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration were used in six cases and two cases, respectively. Although cytology and histology of fine-needle aspiration biopsy are suggested diagnostic methods for most parotid tumours, these methods have variable success with sensitivity ranging from 57% to 98%, specificity ranging from 56% to 100% and accuracy ranging from 78% to 98%.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that sonoelastography has a limited value for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions. Quantitative and semiquantitative methods performed better than qualitative ones. Further large-sample, prospective, multicentre studies evaluating these two assessment methods are needed to confirm the findings. In addition, more studies should focus on the correlation between sonoelastography and corresponding histopathological changes in the future.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^115MXbBc]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Metastasis

Even if quite exceptional in childhood, squamous cell carcinoma, periauricular melanoma and thyroid carcinoma may spread in the parotid lymph nodes. The diagnosis is suggested by a careful examination of the face and neck and is based on the pathologic examination.

Other disorders

Sialadenosis or sialosis

Sialadenosis or sialosis is a non-inflammatory, non-tumor bilateral swelling of the major salivary glands (mainly the parotid glands), which can be painful or asymptomatic. In adults, sialadenosis is most commonly due to alcoholism, endocrine disorders such as diabetes, nutritional disorders or drugs. During late childhood and adolescence, the main causes are eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia. Sonography shows enlarged, homogeneous parotids, whose diffuse hyperechogenicity may limit the visibility of their deep lobe. MRI also shows diffuse and homogeneous hypertrophy of both parotid glands (Fig. 20). The conditions feature neither focal anomaly nor hypervascularization. Major differential diagnoses of chronic, bilateral swelling of parotid glands are sarcoidosis, Sjogren's syndrome, malignant hemopathies, Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis have been reported, but are exceptional.

### Distinguishing benign from malignant parotid gland tumours: low-dose multi-phasic CT protocol with 5-minute delay [^11751d6S]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Parotid gland masses are common: about 80% of parotid tumours are benign, and most of them, about 60%, are pleomorphic adenoma, followed by Warthin's tumour (about 10%). Malignant tumours comprise about 15 to 30% of all kinds of parotid tumours. The most common parotid gland malignancy is mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The cystic adenoid carcinoma is the second most frequent malignancy; other parotid tumours include acinar cell carcinomas, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS), lymphoma, and the carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The main symptom in patients with parotid neoplasms is a lump in the parotid gland area. Other symptoms such as pain, facial palsy and skin ulcers may emerge in malignancies. According to the extent of the tumour, partial or total parotidectomy is the mainstream treatment measure for benign and malignant parotid tumours. Radiotherapy may aid in malignant cases as adjuvant therapy; chemotherapy is rarely applied. Parotid gland neoplasm recurrence rates of local, regional and distant are 40%, 15% and 11%, respectively. Patients with recurrence have a poor prognosis.

The use of CT and MR imaging has resulted in the detection of parotid gland masses. More recent literature has focused on different approaches to characterising parotid masses, including assessing lesion size, describing morphological criteria, measuring attenuation or signal intensity, calculating the contrast material change of single or dual enhancement. Kress et al. have demonstrated that CT sialography is dispensable in the diagnosis of suspected malignant tumours. Casselman and Mancuso reported that CT and MR imaging were the first choices for providing the same diagnostic information in all cases of parotid gland neoplasms. Choi et al. demonstrated that the ratio of CT numbers in enhancement patterns and the attenuation change was significantly different between Warthin's tumours and pleomorphic adenomas, and between Warthin's tumours and malignant tumours. Yabuuchi et al. showed that parotid neoplasms could be differentiated by the 120 s of MR time of peak enhancement and a 30% wash-out ratio (WR), and benign and malignant tumours were recognised by a combined classification of time signal intensity curve and 30% WR. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports of comparisons for benign and malignant parotid gland tumours by the attenuation and percentage enhancement wash-out ratios.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^113mAfcG]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP)

JRP is the most common inflammatory salivary gland disease in childhood and adolescence, with many assumed and possibly interwoven causes: genetic, immune, infection, dehydration, allergy, ductal abnormalities and ductal obstruction. JRP begins in early childhood and resolves in adolescence. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Patients present repeated episodes of painful swelling of the gland, sometimes complicated by a bacterial infection. Between two episodes, the volume of the gland returns to normal or, at least, decreases. At the end of the disease course, the parotid gland may be hard and mimic a tumor on clinical examination. Ultrasonography may be sufficient for diagnosis, showing multiple hypoechoic foci of salivary secretions, scattered in the gland and inconstantly containing central calcification (Fig. 8 a, b). Vascularization of the gland is a normal appearance, on Doppler color imaging. According to the stage of the disease, early or late, the parotid gland is either enlarged or atrophic. When a second imaging modality is needed, MR sialography can confirm the diagnosis. MRI reveals a non-dilated Stensen's duct and multiple small "cystic" round areas of high signal on T 2 -weighted images (mimicking a bunch of grapes), in an enlarged gland (Fig. 8 c, d). Treatment is not consensual: antibiotics, analgesics, sialendoscopy with unclogging.

Congenital anomalies

Congenital anomalies of the parotid are mainly venolymphatic malformations and branchial cleft cysts. They may occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome.

The new classification of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies distinguishes vasoproliferative lesions (e.g. infantile and congenital hemangiomas, tumors with increased endothelial cell turnover) and vascular malformations (with normal endothelial cell turnover). The latter may be high-flow malformations (arteriovenous malformation or fistula) or low-flow malformations (capillary, venous, lymphatic or mixed).

### Comparison of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of parotid tumors [^112mADdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of parotid tumors was investigated.

Methods

Forty patients with the clinical suspicion of a parotid mass underwent both CT and MRI of the parotid region. Two radiologists independently assessed the CT and MRI results with respect to tumor localization, tumor margin characteristics, and infiltration of surrounding tissue. Histopathologic specimens were obtained in all cases and correlated with the radiologic findings.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of CT and MRI were nearly the same for tumor location, tumor margin, and tumor infiltration.

Conclusion

The 2 imaging techniques provided the same information with respect to the presurgical planning and contribute to the diagnosis and therapy planning of parotid tumors.

Providers should perform CT of the neck with intravenous contrast for patients with suspicion of salivary gland cancer and involvement of adjacent bone (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). Providers should perform contrast-enhanced MRI with a diffusion sequence of the neck and skull base for patients with suspicion of salivary gland cancer with concern for perineural invasion and/or skull base involvement (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). Providers may perform a PET/CT from the skull base to mid-thighs for patients with advanced-stage high-grade salivary gland cancers (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak). Providers should perform a tissue biopsy (either fine needle aspiration biopsy [FNAB] or core needle biopsy [CNB]) to support distinction of salivary gland cancers from nonmalignant salivary lesions (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). Providers may perform CNB if FNAB is inadequate or subsite precludes FNAB such as deep minor salivary glands (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Pathologists should report risk of malignancy using a risk stratification scheme for salivary FNABs with particular attention to high-grade features (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). Pathologists may perform ancillary testing (immunohistochemical or molecular studies) on FNABs and core needle biopsies to support diagnosis and risk of malignancy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Distinguishing benign from malignant parotid gland tumours: low-dose multi-phasic CT protocol with 5-minute delay [^117DB6Zo]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Salivary gland neoplasms account for approximately 3% of all head and neck tumours. About 70% of all salivary gland neoplasms occur in the parotid gland. Several studies have investigated the value of computed tomography (CT) in distinguishing parotid gland tumours. The results of some documents have demonstrated that CT could identify patients with pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin's tumours and malignant tumours, and evaluate the extent of parotid gland tumours. Moreover, detailed information on signal intensity and wash-out ratio in parotid gland tumours by contrast-enhanced MRI has been reported for pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin's tumours, and malignant tumours. To our knowledge, very few data on the percentage enhanced wash-out ratio in low-dose multiple-phasic CT among pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin's tumours and malignant tumours have already been analysed. Consequently, this study focused on strategies to differentiate benign from malignant neoplasms by measuring the percentage enhanced washout ratio of patients with parotid gland tumours.

### Salivary endoscopy for idiopathic chronic sialadenitis [^113XeTyW]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To describe the findings and therapeutic role of salivary endoscopy for idiopathic chronic sialadenitis.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

The records of 258 patients who underwent salivary endoscopy between November 2008 and May 2012 were reviewed. Included cases presented with recurrent inflammation and swelling of a single major salivary gland, without identifiable etiology on examination and imaging.

Results

A total of 51 cases (20%) were identified. These patients had a mean age of 54.4 years (range, 23–75) and 57% were female. Mean duration of symptoms was 22.8 months (range, 1–102), with most cases (75%) involving the parotid gland. The primary imaging modalities used were ultrasound (62%) and computed tomography (31%). The most common findings on imaging included ductal dilation (42%), enlarged lymph nodes (23%), normal glandular imaging (15%), and possible sialoliths (14%). The most common findings on salivary endoscopy included stenosis (57%), strictures (27%), and inflammatory debris (18%). Occult stones were the cause of sialadenitis in only 4 (8%) cases. Outcomes included complete symptom resolution in 31 patients (61%), improved but occasional symptoms in 14 patients (27%), and no improvement in 6 patients (12%) after a mean follow-up time of 20.0 months (range, 4–45). Excision of the involved gland was required in 2 (4%) patients.

Conclusion

Salivary endoscopy is a minimally invasive technique that is effective in the management of idiopathic chronic sialadenitis refractory to medical therapy. It provides diagnostic information in most patients and offers a therapeutic intervention with gland preservation.

### Recurrent pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland: a comparison of radiographic and pathologic tumor burden [^112nmtbY]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare recurrent pleomorphic adenoma tumor burden as detected on magnetic resonance and computerized tomography imaging with postoperative histopathology.

Materials and Methods

44 patients were identified at a tertiary medical center between 2000 and 2015. Patients were included if they had viewable preoperative imaging and a postoperative diagnosis of recurrent pleomorphic adenoma. Primary outcomes were differences in the number and size of lesions detected on imaging and pathology.

Results

The size in greatest dimension between pathology and imaging was not significant on aggregate MRI + CT (p = 0.78), MRI (p = 0.41), or CT (p = 0.69). There were more lesions found on pathology compared to both aggregate MRI + CT (p = 0.003) and CT alone (p = 0.014). The number of lesions between MRI and pathology failed to reach significance (p = 0.06). On univariate analysis, the interval between imaging and pathology (recurrent surgery) did not significantly affect the number of lesions detected (p = 0.18). On multivariable analysis, CT as the primary imaging modality and > 1 recurrence was independently associated with greater inaccuracy with respect to number of lesions detected (p = 0.006; p = 0.008).

Conclusion

The size of the largest lesion on pathology can be accurately determined with imaging. Compared to MRI, CT scans significantly underpredict the number of lesions found on pathology. MRI should be prioritized unless contraindications exist. These findings will help guide imaging choice, preoperative planning, and patient counseling.

### A single-center study of clinical features of pediatric Sjögren's syndrome [^114Fq3Aq]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Cimaz R and Stiller M reported recurrent parotid swelling was the most common clinical feature being present in 57.5% and 47.8%, respectively. But in our cohort, it was only 3.7%. The reason for the difference is not clear, it may be related to the different ethnic composition of the cohort.

The examination of the exocrine glands consists mainly of the salivary gland and lacrimal gland examinations. Salivary secretion function can be evaluated by measuring salivary flow rate, including post-stimulation flow rate (e.g. chewing gum test, Saxon test) or resting/non-stimulation flow rate. Parotid gland imaging or ⁹⁹ᵐTcO₄-nuclein imaging are also commonly used for detection. Salivary gland biopsy, which has low acceptance in pediatric patients, can visualize glandular involvement, and focal infiltration of lymphoid cells can be seen around the glandular ducts in patients with SS. Salivary gland ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are also used. In our center, nuclide imaging is often used to evaluate the secretory and excretory functions of the salivary gland and ultrasonography is utilized to observe the parenchymal damage of the gland. In this cohort, the positive rate was 70.4% for nuclide imaging and 55.6% for ultrasonography. Although the clinical manifestations of glandular enlargement were few, the ratio of glandular function and parenchymal damage was actually high, which suggested that there was mostly objective evidence in the pediatric salivary gland examination, but the external manifestations were absent. The means commonly used for lacrimal gland examination include Schirmer's test, tear break-up time, and corneal and conjunctival staining score. The Schirmer I test, a method that does not use surface anesthesia, is used to determine the secretory function of the primary lacrimal gland and is generally well tolerated by children. The positive rate for Schirmer I test was not high in patients in our cohort, which is consistent with the low incidence of subjective dry eye symptoms of patients, and our results indicated that in pediatric SS, the involvement of salivary glands was greater than that of lacrimal glands.

### Sonoelastography for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions: a meta-analysis [^116EHU7u]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Literature search

The study complied with the PRISMA recommendations. An independent literature search of English medical databases including PubMed, Embase and Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Ovid was performed to identify all studies evaluating differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions. The strategies are shown in Table 1. Duplicated articles were excluded manually. Unpublished relative data were considered as well, but no suitable studies were identified for inclusion. The study was performed by two independent researchers. This literature search was updated until 30 October 2017 and a beginning date limit was not used.

Table 1
Search strategy of each database

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All the articles were assessed independently by two researchers. The inclusion criteria for the studies were as follows: (1) The study was approved by an ethics committee or institutional review board. (2) The diagnostic performance of sonoelastography for the differential diagnosis between malignant and benign parotid lesions was evaluated in the study. (3) Postoperative pathology and/or fine-needle aspiration cytology (and/or histology) results were used as the reference standard in the study. (4) Complete reported data were available to calculate the true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN) and true negative (TN) cases. The exclusion criteria for the studies were as follows: (1) Reviews, case reports, letters, conference reports, editorial comments and articles that were not published in English were excluded. (2) In studies with insufficient data, the corresponding authors were contacted and requested to provide the missing data via e-mail. The studies were excluded if the author did not reply within 15 days. (3) When two or more studies were performed by the same department, the study that was older or that had the smaller number of patient samples was excluded. All the disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data extraction

Two investigators extracted the data independently. All relevant data including first author, country where the study was performed, published year, patient age, proportion of male and female patients, number of patients, number of lesions, reference standard, type of lesions, ultrasound system, sonoelastography index, cut-off value and number of TPs, FPs, FNs and TNs were extracted. The cut-off value was defined according to the Youden method if it was not clearly provided by the author. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Adding automated decision-tree models to multiparametric MRI for parotid tumours improves clinical performance [^111vd3AH]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Therapeutic management of parotid gland tumours depends on their histological type. To aid its characterisation, we sought to develop automated decision-tree models based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and to evaluate their added diagnostic value compared with morphological sequences.

Methods

206 MRIs from 206 patients with histologically proven parotid gland tumours were included from January 2009 to January 2018. Multiparametric MRI findings (including parameters derived from diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] and dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE]) were used to build predictive classification and regression tree (CART) models for each histological type. All MRIs were read twice: first, based on morphological sequence findings only, and second, with the addition of multiparametric sequences and CART findings. The diagnostic performance between these two readings was compared using ROC curves.

Results

Compared to morphological sequences alone, the addition of multiparametric analysis significantly increased the diagnostic performance for all histological types (p < 0.001 to p = 0.011), except for lymphomas, where the increase was not significant (AUC 1.00 vs. 0.99, p = 0.066). ADCmean was the best parameter to identify pleomorphic adenomas, carcinomas and lymphomas with respective cut-offs of 1.292 × 10⁻³ mm²/s, 1.181 × 10⁻³ mm²/s and 0.611 × 10⁻³ mm²/s, respectively. × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The mean extracellular-extravascular space coefficient was the best parameter to Warthin tumours from the others, with a cut-off of 0.07.

Conclusions

The addition of decision tree prediction models based on multiparametric sequences improves the non-invasive diagnostic performance of parotid gland tumours. ADC and extracellular-extravascular space coefficient are the two best parameters for decision making.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^113v3M4Y]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Sialadenitis and sialolithiasis

Salivary stones (sialoliths) represent calcium concretions, most commonly within the submandibular ductal system, owing to the relatively higher calcium and phosphate salt concentrations of the gland's secretions. The resultant inflammation clinically manifests as glandular tenderness and swelling, particularly after meals. Sialadenitis is best evaluated with CT, which will show increased size and density of the gland, with ductal calcifications; post-contrast imaging will show diffuse, intense enhancement (Fig. 10). Advanced stages of sialadenitis can present with suppurative infections and abscess formation. The differential diagnosis of abscess within the salivary glands includes superinfected cysts in HIV patients, suppurative and necrotic lymph nodes, and cystic degeneration of malignancy; therefore, clinical context must be reviewed carefully, and follow-up to resolution may be warranted.

Sialolithiasis with resultant sialadenitis. Axial contrast-enhanced CT images at the level of the submandibular gland demonstrate two well-circumscribed calcifications in the distal right submandibular duct (a, arrow). The right submandibular duct is dilated proximal to the stones (b, arrowhead). There is enlargement and enhancement of the right submandibular gland (*) compared to the normal left submandibular gland

Ductal obstruction and calculi as small as 3 mm can be detected on ultrasound, although it is operator dependent. Sialography is the reference standard imaging modality, as it can demonstrate ductal obstruction from multiple aetiologies, including recurrent infection, autoimmune processes and trauma (Fig. 11). MRI and conventional digital subtraction sialography have been found to be comparable in diagnostic performance.

### Classification of parotid gland tumors by using multimodal MRI and deep learning [^117RV2cF]. NMR in Biomedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Parotid gland tumor (PGT) is the most common type of salivary gland tumor. Major PGT types include pleomorphic adenoma (PMA), Warthin tumor (WT), and malignant tumor (MT). Determination of the type of PGT is crucial for clinical diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Imaging modalities, such as MRI and computed tomography, are useful to identify the location and size of PGTs. Fine‐needle aspiration biopsy is the primary method for identifying the tumor type, but its sensitivity is low (70%‐80%) for recognizing malignant PGTs. 1, 2

MRI can be useful for tumor classification. For example, T 1 ‐ and T 2 ‐weighted images clearly present the texture of tumors, including areas of normal and lesion tissues. 3 High‐grade malignant salivary gland tumors are distinguished on routine MR images by ill defined borders, cystic components, low T 2 signal intensity, necrosis, and invasion of surrounding tissues. However, MRI is often unable to distinguish between benign and malignant salivary tumors. 4, 5, 6 The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be associated with tumor cellularity, and MTs exhibit hyperintensity in DWI. 7, 8 The ADC value of a PGT region is useful for differentiating between WTs and PMAs. 9, 10, 11, 12 However, the mean ADC values of WTs and MTs are not significantly different. 8, 10, 13 The ADC has a sensitivity of 50%‐60% in distinguishing MTs. 9, 14 Therefore, identifying MTs through MRI remains a challenge.

A 75-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of an enlarging mass in the left parotid gland. Biopsy revealed a parotid plasmacytoma, and the patient was referred for a staging F-FDG PET/CT to evaluate the presence of multiple myeloma bone involvement. The PET/CT scan showed intense FDG uptake in the neck mass but no FDG-avid lymphadenopathy or distant metastases. Plasmacytoma involving the parotid gland is extremely rare. We present the F-FDG PET/CT imaging of solitary parotid plasmacytoma.

### Diffusion kurtosis imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for the differentiation of parotid gland tumors [^113aFCt8]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parotid gland tumors (PGTs) contain abundant histological types and subtypes including pleomorphic adenomas (PAs), Warthin tumors (WTs), other benign tumors (OBTs), and malignant tumors (MTs). The treatment strategy and long-term prognosis vary widely depending on the histological type of the tumors. Compared with benign tumors, total parotidectomy with radiotherapy is preferred in the malignancies. In the treatment decision of benign tumors, for patients with PAs, they may require complete surgical excision due to the potential for recurrence and malignant transformation, whereas patients with WTs and OBTs, local or superficial parotidectomy, or conservative observation may be sufficient. Therefore, precise preoperative diagnosis is of great importance.

Conventional MRI can delineate lesions concerning the internal structure, morphology, accurate localization, locoregional extension, invasion, and perineural spread of tumors, but the diagnostic performance is limited, particularly when benign tumors have similar imaging findings to low-grade malignant tumors showing low signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI. Advanced MRI techniques like diffusion MRI and perfusion MRI may provide the information of intratumoral water molecular diffusion, microstructural complexity, and capillary blood flows. DKI, a sophisticated modality that quantifies the non-Gaussian behavior of water molecule diffusion, can provide information about heterogeneity and cellularity in vivo with two parameters, including diffusion kurtosis (K) and diffusion coefficient (D), and has been proven to be useful in the field of parotid gland lesions. However, DKI used alone may not fully reflect the pathophysiological characteristics of PGTs. Moreover, DCE-MRI monitors T1 changes in tumor tissues over time after contrast administration of gadolinium to quantify the tumor perfusion and vessel permeability. A quantitative evaluation can be made with perfusion parameters including transfer constant (K trans), rate constant (K ep), fractional volume of the extravascular extracellular space (V e), and initial area under the contrast agent concentration–time curve (iAUC) to identify benign and malignant lesions and monitor tumor responses to treatment in the head and neck. Previous studies showed that quantitative DCE-MRI has played an important part in improving the diagnosis of parotid gland lesions. However, those studies may have some limitations, such as the relatively small sample size. Up to now, none of the studies have demonstrated the added value of combining DKI and DCE-MRI for PGT characterization. We hypothesized that the combined use of DKI and DCE-MRI could reflect the discrepancies in diffusion and perfusion of PGTs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether DKI and DCE-MRI quantitative parameters are beneficial for differentiating PGTs.

### Cytologic diagnosis of parotid gland warthin tumor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1141Zf5D]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Data extraction, processing, and synthesis

The following data were extracted for each case: method of needle guidance, needle size, patient characteristics, the time (years) range of the data, FNAC diagnosis, and final histopathological diagnosis. Data regarding follow‐up duration for each lesion, imaging modality used, and initial and final size of WT were also extracted.

The following parameters were calculated: true positives (TP): FNAC and histopathological diagnosis is WT; false positive (FP): FNAC result is WT, but histopathological diagnosis is not; false negative (FN): FNAC result is a different lesion (not WT), but histopathological result is WT; true negative (TN): both FNAC and histopathology results are not WT. Our goal was to conduct meta‐analysis of individual FNAC estimates in the diagnosis of WT; for this reason, all the included studies contain cases of FP, FN, and TP and some studies also contain TN cases. Studies that lack case of FP, FN, or TP were excluded. All the false positive and false negative results were classified as malignant, benign, or normal. Cytodiagnostic or histopathologic results that were classified as "probably malignant", "suspected malignant", "suspicious for malignancy", "cannot exclude malignancy" were included in the malignant group.

2.4 Quality assessment

The included studies were assessed for quality of methodology based on the Diagnostic Accuracy Research Quality Assessment‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. The risk of bias was rated as "low", "high", or "unclear", corresponding to a score of "2", "1", and "0", respectively. A study awarded a cumulative score ≥ 6 was considered of high quality.

### MR imaging of salivary gland tumors [^113a6RKE]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Neoplasms of the salivary glands are characterized by their marked histologic diversity giving them nonspecific imaging findings. MR imaging is the best imaging modality to evaluate salivary gland tumors. Multiparametric MR imaging combines conventional imaging features, diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion imaging to help distinguish benign and low-grade neoplasms from malignant tumors; however, a biopsy is often needed to establish a definitive histopathologic diagnosis. An awareness of potential imaging pitfalls is important to prevent mistakes in salivary neoplasm imaging.

### Sialadenitis: a possible early manifestation of COVID-19 [^114hD3uN]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute sialadenitis may be caused by viruses, including coronaviruses. Although there are anecdotal reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) salivary gland infections, there have been no well-documented cases of sialadenitis in patients with COVID-19 described in the literature. We report a case of parotitis and submandibular gland sialadenitis, as well as an isolated case of parotitis, in two patients with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated parotid and submandibular gland enlargement with heterogenous enhancement and attenuation, consistent with sialadenitis. Medical management was sufficient for successful resolution of the acute sialadenitis. Laryngoscope, 130:2595–2597, 2020.

### Assessment of major salivary gland ultrasonography in Sjögren's syndrome. A comparison between bedside and post-examination evaluations [^115eKAhK]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Major salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) is a suitable diagnostic tool in Sjögren's syndrome (SS). We aimed to determine the more representative gland, projection and format most applicable for reproducible image analysis.

Methods

One investigator performed SGUS in patients with SS. Parotid and submandibular glands were examined in longitudinal and transverse planes and evaluated bedside using a simplified scoring system (0–3). Longitudinal and transverse images and videos of all glands were stored and later evaluated/graded by three investigators, at two time-points. Agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

The ICC for static image and video scoring compared to bedside evaluation ranged from 0.131 to 0.882. Average ICC for longitudinal/transverse image was 0.667/0.662, and 0.683/0.510 for longitudinal/transverse video. Interobserver reliability was good to excellent (0.81–0.94). Intraobserver reliability scores ranged from fair to excellent (0.46–0.96). The correlation between image and video evaluations of all modalities and examiners was good to excellent (0.614–0.904). The best mean ICC was found for the longitudinal projection of the left parotid gland (0.861) and the lowest mean ICC was for the transverse projection of the left submandibular gland (0.66).

Conclusions

Our study indicates a trend favouring longitudinal video of the parotid gland as preferred projection, gland and storage format.

### Improvements in CBCT image quality using a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm: a clinical evaluation [^111nVmTz]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

We note statistically significant improvements in parotid gland contouring for the Hausdorff distance metric as well as statistically significant improvement for the left parotid gland Dice coefficient value. The anatomic change of the parotid gland during radiation therapy is well documented, and the improved ability to visualize the parotid is an important step toward improving HN CBCT utility. In particular, improved visualization of the parotids has the potential to aid in tracking parotid gland anatomic changes during a patient's treatment course, thereby aiding in clinical decisions with regard to parotid dose reduction and the need for adaptive planning.

At our clinic, we typically use a clockwise direction with half-trajectory for HN CBCT scans to allow for an initial volumetric modulated arc therapy beam gantry angle of 181° (with clockwise delivery), resulting in some projection sampling discrepancy between the left and right sides. This may be the reason for difference in image quality on the patient's left side (Figs. 4 A and C) and contouring results for the parotid glands. Overall, there are limitations to the contouring analysis because the gross tumor volume for patients with HN is not well visualized on CBCT, and some image quality improvements in the inferior portion of the image set are not captured by any reasonable OAR contour.

### Radiation-induced damage to microstructure of parotid gland: evaluation using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging [^1169JYz7]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To elucidate the radiation-induced damage to the microstructure of the parotid gland using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods and Materials

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the parotid gland was performed before radiotherapy (RT) and during the RT period or ≤ 3 weeks after RT completion for 12 head-and-neck cancer patients using a 1.5-T scanner with a microscopy coil. The maximal cross-sectional area of the gland was evaluated, and changes in the internal architecture of the gland were assessed both visually and quantitatively.

Results

Magnetic resonance images were obtained at a median parotid gland dose of 36 Gy (range, 11–64). According to the quantitative analysis, the maximal cross-sectional area of the gland was reduced, the width of the main duct was narrowed, and the intensity ratio of the main duct lumen to background was significantly decreased after RT (p < .0001). According to the visual assessment, the width of the main duct tended to narrow and the contrast of the duct lumen tended to be decreased, but no significant differences were noted. The visibility of the duct branches was unclear in 10 patients (p = .039), and the septum became dense in 11 patients (p = .006) after RT.

Conclusion

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive method of evaluating radiation-induced changes to the internal architecture of the parotid gland. Morphologic changes in the irradiated parotid gland were demonstrated during the RT course even when a relatively small dose was delivered to the gland.

### A deep learning model for classification of parotid neoplasms based on multimodal magnetic resonance image sequences [^117STRzs]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Deep learning is a subdivision of artificial intelligence (AI). In recent years, the demand for deep learning in medical diagnosis has gradually emerged, largely due to the technological advancement in the pertaining field. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is the fundamental algorithm of deep learning. At present, CNN has led to respectful outcomes in the application of the two‐dimensional magnetic resonance image (MRI) image classification, and it was recently suggested that the CNN trained by dynamic contrast enhancement MRI sequence would result in improved performance on the classification and localization of breast cancer.

The tumors of the salivary gland mostly occur in the parotid gland, which is the largest salivary gland in the human body, and about 25% of parotid neoplasms are malignant. Surgery is the primary treatment option for parotid neoplasms, and detailed evaluation is typically carried out before the surgery in order to select the appropriate surgical tactic for a particular pathological tumor type. The preoperative assessment of parotid gland tumors mainly includes medical history, physical examination, imaging examination, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and so on. An FNAC is in general invasive and less diagnostically sensitive to malignant tumors. However, other studies proposed that the hollow needle biopsy technique has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of parotid neoplasms, while the accuracy also heavily depends on the doctor's surgical skills and the selection of equipment. The accuracy of preoperative FNAC can be effectively improved with the assistance of ultrasound, but as a stand‐alone preoperative evaluation method, the capability of ultrasound is limited. Typically, the imaging methods for evaluating the parotid gland tumor include ultrasound, computerized tomography, and MRI. Comparing the first two methods, MRI is more effective and accurate to obtain the tumor's internal structural feature and spatial relationship with surrounding tissues. Yet, further advancement in the functional MRI has recently been evident in terms of the diagnostic accuracy of disease. For example, using a multiparametric non‐contrast MRI approach, Takumi et al. recently improved the differentiation of malignant salivary gland lesions from the benign ones.

Multi‐Modal Paradigm

In real‐world practice, clinicians and radiologists evaluate parotid gland tumors through multiple MRI sequences. The present study simulated the practice and used multiple sequences as the training input of the network to extract features from multi‐modal MRI sequences (Table III). The fusion of multiple modal MRI images evidently elevated the efficiency of the deep learning diagnosis model, with significantly improved accuracy, ROC‐AUC, sensitivity, and specificity scores. The combination of MRI sequences in the multi‐modal paradigm enhanced ROC curves from that of individual sequences in the single‐modal paradigm (Fig. 4A–D). In addition, the late‐fusion strategy resulted in better effectiveness than the early‐fusion strategy, while the vector splicing method exhibited a superior outcome to the vector addition method. In sum, the deep learning model trained by T2, CE‐T1, and DWI‐b1000, using the vector splicing method with a late‐fusion strategy, presented the best performance, with an AUC‐ROC score of 0.96, accuracy of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.90, and specificity of 0.84 (Table III). It is also worth noting that the best result was not achieved by the fusion of all the modalities of MRI sequences.

Performance Comparison Between the Deep Learning Model and Radiologists

The effectiveness of the present model trained by multi‐modal MRI sequences was compared to an experienced radiologist (Table III), ROC‐AUC curves from both optimally trained multi‐modal paradigm and single‐modal paradigm were also compared to the radiologist (Fig. 4E, F). Using either multi‐modal sequences or a single sequence as the training input, the model produced efficacious ROC curves, indicating superior diagnostic performance compared to the experienced radiologist.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration for parotid and submandibular gland lesions [^111scBy4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the parotid and submandibular glands.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary referral academic center.

Subjects and Methods

Retrospective analysis was performed for all parotid and submandibular gland FNAs from a single center from 2001 to 2014. There were 1283 FNAs performed for 1076 patients. Of these, 343 cases had surgical follow-up (parotid gland, n = 272; submandibular gland, n = 71). Cases were included where the patient had a preoperative FNA, followed by surgical excision. Correlation of preoperative FNA results to final surgical pathology was performed, with measures of diagnostic accuracy computed.

Results

Malignancy was identified in 29.0% of parotid tumors and 42.3% of submandibular tumors, based on final pathology. FNA was nondiagnostic due to insufficient cellularity for evaluation in 22 of 343 cases (6.4%) and indeterminate in 39 of 343 cases (11.4%). Diagnostic accuracy in the parotid and submandibular glands for distinguishing benign from malignant pathology was determined as follows, respectively: sensitivity, 75.0% and 91.3%; specificity, 95.1% and 94.1%; positive predictive value, 84.9% and 91.3%; and negative predictive value, 91.2% and 94.4%.

Conclusion

FNA has high accuracy in identifying malignancy in parotid and submandibular gland lesions when performed at a high-volume center. Preoperative FNA results provide otolaryngologists with valuable diagnostic information that may influence the surgical management of salivary gland tumors. FNA, in conjunction with cross-sectional imaging, is useful in counseling patients for a complete informed consent.

### Bilateral and multifocal warthin's tumors of parotid glands: PET / CT imaging [^111h4BA3]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Unilateral hypermetabolic lesion of parotid gland demonstrated on PET/CT imaging may originate from a large spectrum of benign or malignant processes, such as adenoma, Warthin's tumor, oncocytic neoplasm, lymphoma, and primary or secondary malignancy of the gland. Bilateral and multifocal parotid gland disease is less common but possible because of the known characteristics of Warthin's tumors. The authors present such a case that was incidentally documented during PET/CT evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodule.
