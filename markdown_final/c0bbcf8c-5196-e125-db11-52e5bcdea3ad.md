## Question

hyponatremia workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the hyponatremia workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should classify severity and acuity. Next, I will assess volume status and integrate urine studies. After that, I will build a prioritized differential and outline targeted ancillary tests. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation, and a concise decision algorithm, while continuously checking for pitfalls and correcting myself if I overstate anything.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude pseudohyponatremia, because I need to ensure we are dealing with true hypotonic hyponatremia before proceeding. I should measure serum osmolality and correct measured sodium for hyperglycemia using the standard correction factor of 1.6 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL glucose above 100 mg/dL, since hyperglycemia can artifactually lower measured sodium without true hypotonicity, and I should also consider hyperlipidemia or paraproteinemia as causes of pseudohyponatremia when osmolality is normal or high despite low sodium, which would redirect management entirely away from sodium correction strategies [^0632c300] [^5c2976a5] [^19dbc176].

> Next, I should review severity and acuity, because symptom risk and correction limits hinge on both. Mild is 130–134 mEq/L, moderate 125–129 mEq/L, and severe less than 125 mEq/L, and I should classify as acute if onset is within 48 hours versus chronic if longer or unknown, since acute severe hyponatremia carries a high risk of cerebral edema and justifies hypertonic therapy, whereas chronic hyponatremia increases the risk of osmotic demyelination if corrected too quickly, so I need to be precise here and not jump to conclusions about chronicity without corroborating history or prior labs [^9f3f9f1f] [^8623e8d2] [^90dd948b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I assess volume status, because the therapeutic fork in the road depends on it. I will examine for orthostasis, mucous membranes, edema, jugular venous distension, and lung crackles, and I should double-check for confounders like diuretics, heart failure, cirrhosis, and malignancy, since misclassification of hypovolemia as euvolemia is common and leads to mismanagement, and I should remember that in cancer patients, nearly 40% initially labeled euvolemic were later reclassified as hypo- or hypervolemic, underscoring the need for careful bedside assessment and, when needed, objective markers like fractional uric acid excretion to improve diagnostic accuracy [^037b6ac2] [^7a64bcf8].

> I will now examine urine studies, because urine osmolality and sodium refine the differential when combined with volume status. If urine osmolality is 100 mOsm/kg or less, I should consider primary polydipsia or low solute intake, whereas values above 100 mOsm/kg suggest impaired free water excretion and should prompt a urine sodium to distinguish hypovolemic from euvolemic or hypervolemic states, with urine sodium 30 mmol/L or less pointing to hypovolemia or hypervolemic edematous states, and urine sodium above 30 mmol/L supporting SIADH or diuretic effects, though I need to check for recent diuretic use before concluding SIADH [^2791a906] [^4174e596] [^a3af82a4] [^06c7e275].

> Let me think about the differential diagnosis in layers, and I should verify that I am not missing reversible causes. Hypovolemic causes include gastrointestinal losses, diuretics, and third spacing, euvolemic causes include SIADH, glucocorticoid deficiency, hypothyroidism, and primary polydipsia, and hypervolemic causes include heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome, with medications such as thiazides, SSRIs, carbamazepine, and PPIs frequently implicated, so I need to take a meticulous medication history and consider endocrine testing when clinically indicated [^19dbc176] [^90dd948b].

> Wait, let me verify the ancillary tests I should order based on the working diagnosis. For suspected SIADH, I should confirm hypotonicity, inappropriately high urine osmolality, and urine sodium above 30 mmol/L, and I should exclude hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency with TSH and morning cortisol, noting that fractional uric acid excretion less than 12% can support SIADH and that copeptin may help distinguish SIADH from other causes in research settings, though it is not routinely available in practice [^68a56514] [^7a64bcf8] [^1d0d0173].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts so I do not misapply standard algorithms. In pregnancy, physiologic changes and placental vasopressinase alter water handling, so I need to consider pregnancy-specific etiologies and avoid overly rapid correction. In exercise-associated hyponatremia, fluid overload is common and hypertonic saline boluses are first-line for severe cases, with fluid restriction and oral hypertonic solutions for mild cases. In stroke, cerebral salt wasting and SIADH can coexist, so I must integrate neurologic status and urine studies carefully. And in the ICU, frequent monitoring and staged correction are essential given the high risk of both under- and overcorrection [^a504908f] [^102f8b73] [^e5cb7367] [^90dd948b].

> Next, I should review documentation and safety, because poor documentation and lack of monitoring drive errors. I need to record the exact sodium value, symptom severity, estimated onset, volume status assessment, urine osmolality and sodium, and the working diagnosis, and I should plan serial sodium checks every 4–6 hours initially in severe cases, with a hard stop to reassess if the rise approaches 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk, especially in chronic hyponatremia [^90dd948b] [^19dbc176].

> Let me reconsider the decision algorithm to ensure it is actionable and safe. If serum osmolality is 275 mOsm/kg or higher, I should stop and reconsider pseudohyponatremia or hypertonic states. If osmolality is less than 275 mOsm/kg, I should classify severity and acuity, assess volume status, obtain urine osmolality and sodium, and then branch to hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic pathways, treating severe symptoms immediately with hypertonic saline while continuing the diagnostic workup in parallel to avoid delays in life-saving therapy [^0632c300] [^90dd948b].

> But wait, what if the urine studies conflict with the clinical picture. I should double-check for assay issues, recent diuretics, or mixed states, and if uncertainty persists, I can use a diagnostic saline trial cautiously in hypovolemic suspects or consider fractional uric acid excretion to refine the call, recognizing that misclassification is common and that expert input or repeat assessment can prevent iatrogenic harm from inappropriate therapy [^7a64bcf8] [^45c03e3c].

The hyponatremia workup centers on **confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia** with measured serum osmolality and corrected sodium for glucose, then **classifying by volume status** (hypovolemic, euvolemic, hypervolemic) using clinical assessment and urine sodium/osmolality [^0632c300] [^5c2976a5]. Next, **identify the cause** with targeted tests: TSH/cortisol for euvolemic cases; uric acid, CXR, CT/MRI, or medications for SIADH; and evaluation for heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome in hypervolemic cases [^68a56514] [^90dd948b]. Always **assess symptom severity and acuity** to guide urgency, and monitor sodium closely to avoid rapid correction and osmotic demyelination [^90e56399] [^8623e8d2].

---

## Step 1: confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia

- **Measured serum osmolality**: Confirm hypotonicity (< 275 mOsm/kg) [^0632c300].
- **Corrected sodium**: Correct for hyperglycemia (add 1.6 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL glucose > 100 mg/dL) [^5c2976a5].
- **Exclude pseudohyponatremia**: Consider hyperlipidemia or paraproteinemia if osmolality is normal or high [^notfound].

---

## Step 2: classify by volume status

Use **clinical assessment** (orthostatics, mucosa, edema, JVP) to assign hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic categories [^d9a90efb]. Then obtain **urine studies** — urine sodium and osmolality — to refine the classification [^28477fe5].

| **Volume status** | **Urine sodium** | **Urine osmolality** | **Clinical clues** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | ≤ 30 mmol/L | > 100 mOsm/kg | - GI losses <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency |
| Euvolemic | > 30 mmol/L | > 100 mOsm/kg | - SIADH <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Glucocorticoid deficiency |
| Hypervolemic | ≤ 30 mmol/L | > 100 mOsm/kg | - Heart failure <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome |

---

## Step 3: identify the underlying cause

### Hypovolemic hyponatremia

Assess for **GI losses**, diuretics, and **adrenal insufficiency** (check cortisol) [^notfound].

---

### Euvolemic hyponatremia

- **SIADH**: Most common; diagnose by exclusion with inappropriately high urine osmolality, normal thyroid/adrenal function, and no diuretics [^68a56514].
- **Hypothyroidism**: Check TSH [^notfound].
- **Glucocorticoid deficiency**: Check morning cortisol [^notfound].
- **Medications**: SSRIs, carbamazepine, thiazides, PPIs, MDMA [^e5cb7367].

---

### Hypervolemic hyponatremia

Evaluate for **heart failure**, **cirrhosis**, and **nephrotic syndrome** [^notfound].

---

## Step 4: assess symptom severity and acuity

Classify as **mild, moderate, or severe** based on symptoms (nausea, confusion, seizures, coma) [^90e56399]. Determine whether the onset is **acute (< 48 h)** or **chronic (≥ 48 h)** to guide correction limits [^8623e8d2].

---

## Step 5: additional diagnostic tests (as indicated)

- **TSH**: Hypothyroidism [^notfound].
- **Morning cortisol**: Adrenal insufficiency [^notfound].
- **Uric acid**: Low in SIADH [^68a56514].
- **CXR/CT/MRI**: Lung cancer, CNS lesions [^68a56514].
- **Medication review**: Identify drug-induced hyponatremia [^e5cb7367].

---

## Step 6: monitoring and safety considerations

Monitor **serum sodium** every 4–6 hours initially, then daily once stable. Avoid **rapid correction** (> 8–10 mEq/L in 24 h) to prevent osmotic demyelination; use desmopressin and hypotonic fluids if needed [^90dd948b] [^5dbd5c7e].

---

The hyponatremia workup proceeds from **confirming true hypotonicity** to **classifying volume status**, identifying the cause, and aligning management with symptom severity and acuity, with vigilant monitoring to prevent overcorrection [^90dd948b].

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^f430c9d4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^81ecfb0a]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains.

The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^cc2b8ddc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^b3bf34d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^e6f1a16b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

[Na], Serum sodium concentration; +, always; +/–, If clinically indicated/sometimes useful.

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^45c03e3c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^dd7ed4d9]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the "real world", the non-expert doctor who initially recognises and responds to severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 120 mmol/L) in a critically ill patient will often be a junior trainee working "out of routine office hours". In this emergency setting, the doctor may have limited immediate access to important additional diagnostic tests, e.g. serum and urine osmolality and urine electrolytes. Urgent treatment decisions may need to be taken to manage symptoms such as confusion and seizures, with incomplete patient history and diagnostic information. There is a general consensus that hypertonic saline is effective in the immediate management of acute symptomatic hyponatraemia but available guidelines differ on the volumes and rates of saline infusion. Ultimately, it is clinical judgement rather than adherence to a particular guideline that will determine an individual patient's treatment. Intuitive clinical algorithms, with proven efficacy, would help to encourage "best practice" in the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder.

### Hyponatremia in the emergency department [^318aa7b2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, is frequently encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. Symptoms are often unspecific and include a recent history of falls, weakness and vertigo. Common causes of hyponatremia include diuretics, heart failure as well as Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis (SIAD) and correct diagnosis can be challenging. Emergency treatment of hyponatremia should be guided by presence of symptoms and focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic hyponatremia.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^d18691e4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^957d6d78]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^7eb9cd53]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) management principles and heat illness definition — For this guideline, heat illness is defined "as any total body water deficit (> 2% of body weight) that can occur from sweat loss during physical activity in high environmental temperatures". When EAH is confirmed or strongly suspected, "empiric treatment of symptomatic EAH is an acceptable option", and "treatment options should be predicated on the presence (or absence) of neurologic impairment to differentiate mild EAH from severe EAH and guide resuscitative choices". The page notes this algorithmic empiric approach "can be lifesaving and is unlikely (but unconfirmed) to induce harm", and emphasizes that "individuals can rapidly progress from mild to severe EAH", so "initial resuscitation and symptomatic care to minimize morbidity and progression of disease are of paramount importance".

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^8c9ce4c2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^102f8b73]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Exercise-associated hyponatremia: updated guidelines… [^5aeb0ecf]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- EAH risk can be reduced by limiting drinking only to respond to thirst with prolonged exertion.
- Because EAH and heat illness symptoms overlap, rectal temperature measurement is critical when assessing altered mental status associated with prolonged exertion.
- Severe EAH is best treated with hypertonic saline boluses. Aggressive cooling can be added if heat illness is also suspected.
- Mild EAH is treated with fluid restriction and oral hypertonic solutions, or salty foods can be added. From the AFP Editors Exercise-associated hyponatremia occurs when exertion results in sodium concentration less than 135 mEq per L, and symptoms can present up to 24 hours after physical activity. When asymptomatic ultramarathon participants are screened, up to one-half demonstrate hyponatremia. The usual cause of EAH is overhydration with hypotonic fluids such as water or sports drinks.

Prevention EAH prevention centers on avoiding overhydration. No specific fluid volume intake recommendations have been shown to prevent hyponatremia, so the best recommendation is to limit drinking to respond to thirst. Limiting fluid availability during distance events reduces EAH rates. Because EAH is caused by overconsumption of hypotonic oral fluids and inappropriately elevated ADH levels, affected people most often have elevated or normal total body water. Hypovolemic EAH is uncommon and associated with chronic diuretic use and older age. The increased desire for high-sodium foods after prolonged sweating suggests that salt can be replaced orally. Sodium-rich foods and fluids should be available during lengthy exertion in high temperatures, although they will not prevent EAH when overdrinking occurs. MILD EAH Mild EAH often manifests as bloating, weight gain, and lack of orthostasis. Fluid restriction is the primary treatment until significant diuresis occurs.

External cooling can be added, and intravenous hypotonic or isotonic fluid should be avoided. In mild EAH, salt can be replaced through oral hypertonic solutions such as three to four bouillon cubes or three ramen seasoning packets per 125 mL of water, or by consumption of salty foods. Intravenous hypertonic saline may be used if anti-emetics are ineffective in enabling oral intake.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^39829cce]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^e5cb7367]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with stroke and associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality risk. The present review presents the underlying causes and provides a thorough algorithm for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in stroke patients. Concomitant diseases and therapies, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, along with diuretics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors are the most common causes of hyponatraemia in community. In the setting of acute stroke, the emergence of hyponatraemia might be attributed to the administration of hypotonic solutions and drugs (ie. mannitol and antiepileptics), poor solute intake, infections, as well as stroke-related conditions or complications, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, cerebral salt wasting syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatraemia, usually caused by hyperglycaemia or recent mannitol administration in patients with stroke. Determining urine osmolality, urine sodium level and volume status are the following steps in the differentiation of hypotonic hyponatraemia. Of note, specific parameters, such as fractional uric acid and urea excretion, along with plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic yield. Therapeutic options are based on the duration and symptoms of hyponatremia. In the case of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline administration is recommended. Hypovolaemic chronic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic solution administration. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for the rest forms of chronic hyponatraemia, therapies increasing renal free water excretion may be necessary. Loop diuretics and urea serve this purpose in patients with stroke, whereas sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors appear to be a promising therapy. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the appropriate restoration of sodium level improves outcomes in such patients. Randomized trials designed to compare therapeutic strategies in managing hyponatraemia in patients with stroke are required.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^be330dd8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of overcorrection

Risk factors for ODS included an initial SNa of < 105 mEq/L and overcorrection. International guidelines recommend avoidance of overcorrection in the management of patients with hyponatremia; however, risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. In contrast, avoidance of overcorrection or ODS may lead to prolonged or inadequate management of patients with hyponatremia, leading to undercorrection in clinical practice. We need to develop an optimal treatment strategy to assure a safe correction rate of SNa to achieve an appropriate correction while avoiding overcorrection. With this point of view, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the risk factors for overcorrection and believe that our results will guide physicians in the management of these patients. Our study revealed that a low level of SNa at presentation was associated with overcorrection, with an adjusted OR of 1.19 for every 1 mEq/L decrease (0.84 for every 1 mEq/L increase). This meant that a 4 mEq/L lower SNa level doubled the risk of overcorrection. Although several previous retrospective studies have indicated that the SNa at presentation was lower in patients with overcorrection compared to those without, a direct association between the SNa levels and risk of overcorrection has not been evaluated previously. Our results alert clinicians to be cautious of the incremental risk of overcorrection when patients present with low SNa levels.

Treatment protocol for Hyponatremia

All patients were treated using our standardized therapeutic protocol for hyponatremia (Fig. 1). This therapeutic protocol fundamentally complied with the international treatment recommendations on chronic profound hyponatremia, although it did involve an exceptionally aggressive strategy to avoid under-treatment. The steps in this protocol are carried out in sequence, rather than simultaneously. First, all the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia. This evaluation involved (1) an interview about the history of the present illness, (2) vital signs, (3) physical examination, (4) laboratory data, and (5) echocardiography, if appropriate. Urine osmolality ≦100 mOsm/kg suggested that the hyponatremia was caused by primary polydipsia or poor sodium intake. Patientsand received cause-specific treatments, such as water restriction for primary polydipsia, discontinuation of a drug that caused hyponatremia, and amelioration of physiological stimulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In addition, if patients had severe symptoms, such as seizures, coma, or cardiorespiratory distress, an intravenous (i.v.) bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline of weight-based (2 mL/kg) amount was initiated until the symptoms improved. When the patients were relieved from these severe symptoms, they were assessed to determine the extracellular water (ECW) status. Patients were considered to have hypovolemic hyponatremia if the following findings were present, along with the discretion of the attending physician: history of gastrointestinal loss, reduced oral intake, thiazide usage, reduced turgor, or prolonged capillary refill time on physical examination, urine Na ≦ 30 mEq/L, and collapsed IVC on echography. Hydration with 0.9% saline at 1 mL/kg/h i.v. was initiated for patients who were diagnosed with reduced ECW. The administration speed of 0.9% saline was increased to 2 mL/kg/h when the patient could not take food orally.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^1b780606]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^037b6ac2]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The HN Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Patients with hypovolemic HN were excluded, as were those with hypervolemic HN in the EU cohort. A large number of patients were excluded at the time of adjudication. Sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the major outcomes when patients with suspected hypovolemia were restored to the analysis. We believe that the exclusion of these patients represents a conservative approach. Ascertainment varied from center to center; enrollment of consecutive cases was not required. Consequently, the study provides no information about relative prevalence of different etiologies of HN. Accurate determination of clinical volume status is difficult under the best of circumstances. The selection of diagnostic studies and treatments was left up to the clinicians responsible for patients, and the study relied on treating clinicians to make a diagnosis. Neither a fluid challenge nor a urine sodium determination was required as an entry criterion for putatively euvolemic patients. This limited our ability to exclude hypovolemia and independently confirm the presence of SIADH with precision. Because the study's intent was to capture 'real-world' practice, this limitation did not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH is treated. Indeed, a principal conclusion is that diagnostic rigor in the case of SIADH is severely lacking, even in a study situation where some treating physicians were aware that their diagnostic choices were being observed. Some therapies were used too infrequently to assess. For example, urea, a treatment shown to be effective in SIADH, and recommended in recent EU guidelines, was used in only 10 patients. Because of the large number of combinations used at low frequency, analysis focused on monotherapy and initial therapy episodes. The study did not specify, much less randomize, treatment choices. We were unable to determine the rationale for choosing a particular treatment. In particular, we could not determine how often NS was used initially in a diagnostic trial to exclude volume depletion in patients suspected of SIADH, a reasonable strategy for its use. Choice of treatments was likely confounded by indication, and the study cannot accurately assess whether any particular treatment shortened hospital stay. We were not able to fully assess how maneuvers such as discontinuation of a HN-inducing medication or treatment of CHF affected [Na +] changes or the decision to add another treatment maneuver. As a result, even the limited comparisons showing superiority or inferiority of particular treatments that were feasible must be interpreted with much circumspection.

Feasibility and Acceptability

After initial chart review, the e-consulting nephrologist determined that 26 of 38 patients (68%) would benefit from specialist recommendations. The remaining 12 patients assigned to the intervention group did not receive e-consults because existing management was felt to be appropriate. The 26 patients who received hyponatremia TACos received a total of 67 hyponatremia e-consults (mean, 2.6 TACos per patient).

Surveys were sent to the providers for all 26 patients who received hyponatremia TACos. Of these, 18 responded to the survey (response rate of 69%). Of the respondents, 17 (94%) were aware that the TACo took place. Fourteen of 18 (78%) reported that the TACo changed their management by prompting them to order additional diagnostic tests (5 of 18; 24%) and/or changing their management plan (12 of 18; 57%). A total of 13 of 18 (72%) respondents reported that the TACo either greatly improved or slightly improved their understanding of the workup and management of hyponatremia, and 15 respondents (83%) definitely or probably wanted these TACos to continue.

A separate survey was sent to 24 providers of control patients who did not receive hyponatremia TACos. Of these, 17 responded (response rate of 70%). Of these, only one team (5.9%) reported formally consulting the nephrology service. Four respondents (23.5%) would have liked to have a nephrologist proactively leave recommendations.

Recipients of TACos answered 90% of hyponatremia knowledge questions correctly, while residents/attendings who did not receive e-consults answered 86% of questions correctly (p = 0.719).

Conclusion and Directions for Future Research

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitals and is associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, though causality remains to be clarified in future trials. SIAD is a frequent cause, but is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires careful workup. Approximately half of patients with SIAD do not respond to first-line therapy with FR. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to definitively guide second-line management of hypotonic hyponatremia, with only tolvaptan and empagliflozin subject to RCTs compared with placebo.

Based on current guidelines, and new information published since, tolvaptan and urea have emerged as the most effective second-line therapies in SIAD if FR fails. There is a need for further research such as RCTs of FR with and without urea (the use of placebo comparison complicated by urea's distinctive taste); tolvaptan vs FR; and comparison of second-line therapy after FR with tolvaptan, urea, or SGLT2is. Trials conducted in inpatients with moderate-severe hyponatremia reflecting real-world clinical care needs are lacking. It is possible that with further evidence, medications such as vaptans or urea may ultimately complement or supersede FR as the first-line treatment for SIAD, where targeted treatment addressing the underlying cause is not effective or if there are clinical or biochemical characteristics to suggest FR is unlikely to succeed.

Tolvaptan, urea, and SGLT2is (as all active hyponatremia treatments) carry a potential risk of sodium overcorrection — likely tolvaptan more so, though direct comparison is lacking. Close monitoring and readiness to administer prophylactic hypotonic fluid and/or DDAVP are key when prescribing medication to raise serum sodium concentration, to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

Areas for future research

Diagnosis

Identify point-of-care markers that can reliably diagnose SIAD and distinguish it from other causes of hyponatremia
Investigate whether subtypes of SIAD predict treatment response to vaptans or other therapeutic options
Identify markers (eg, genetic variation) that make patients more prone to SIAD and/or medication-associated hyponatremia (eg, thiazide induced)
Investigate value of copeptin measurement in the diagnosis of nephrogenic SIAD
Determine the degree to which chronic hyponatremia is a causal mediator of associated adverse clinical outcomes (eg, osteoporosis, fracture, falls, neurocognitive decline, and mortality)

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^be299382]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^19dbc176]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Addressing inpatient hyponatremia through targeted automatic E-consults: a pilot randomized trial [^576bbfcc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients. Treatment of hyponatremia is associated with improved outcomes, but more than one in three cases of new onset hyponatremia is not corrected by the time of hospital discharge. Nephrologist input may improve the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, but specialist resources are limited. Targeted automatic electronic consultations (TACos) may be one approach to provide expert nephrologist guidance to the workup and management of hyponatremia using a scalable model.

Objective

Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a TACo intervention for hospitalized patients with hyponatremia.

Design

Single-site, parallel-group cluster randomized trial.

Participants

Adult inpatients with hyponatremia on the hospital medicine service.

Interventions

A nephrologist conducted TACos on intervention patients, making diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations daily (if warranted) until discharge or resolution of hyponatremia.

Main Measures

Measures of feasibility included the number of eligible participants, percentage receiving TACos, number of TACos per participant, and percentage of formal nephrology consults. Acceptability was assessed by a post-intervention survey. Clinical outcomes, including the percentage of hyponatremia cases that resolved by discharge, were also assessed.

Key Results

We identified 62 patients who met inclusion criteria: 38 in the intervention group and 24 in the control group. A nephrologist determined that 26 of 38 intervention patients (68%) would likely benefit from diagnostic and management recommendations; 67 TACos were performed (mean 2.6 per patient). Fourteen of 18 primary team physicians (78%) reported that the e-consults changed their management, and 15 of 18 (83%) wanted TACOs to continue. Resolution of hyponatremia, length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and costs were similar in the intervention and control groups.

Conclusions

Inpatient TACos for hyponatremia were feasible and acceptable to primary teams, and frequently led to changes in diagnosis and management. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of the TACo model on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^ecf0d2d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Plasma osmolality measurement… [^9e2e1ac0]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Total body sodium is primarily extracellular, and any increase results in increased tonicity, which stimulates the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion. Arginine vasopressin then acts on the V2 receptors in the renal tubules, causing increased water reabsorption. The opposite occurs with decreased extracellular sodium: a decrease inhibits the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion, resulting in diuresis. In most cases, hyponatremia results when the elimination of total body water decreases. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia will be discussed later in this article. Treatment of Schmidt's syndrome involves steroid replacement before thyroxine T4 therapy to avoid precipitating an addisonian crisis. The reset osmostat syndrome occurs when the threshold for antidiuretic hormone secretion is reset downward. Patients with this condition have normal water-load excretion and intact urine-diluting ability after an oral water-loading test.

The condition is chronic — but stable — hyponatremia. 18 It can be caused by pregnancy, quadriplegia, malignancy, malnutrition, or any chronic debilitating disease. Treatment The treatment of hyponatremia can be divided into two steps. First, the physician must decide whether immediate treatment is required. This decision is based on the presence of symptoms, the degree of hyponatremia, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and the presence of any degree of hypotension. The second step is to determine the most appropriate method of correcting the hyponatremia. Shock resulting from volume depletion should be treated with intravenous isotonic saline. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, overzealous and rapid correction should be avoided because it can lead to central pontine myelinolysis. 9, 10 In central pontine myelinolysis, neurologic symptoms usually occur one to six days after correction and often are irreversible.

19 In most cases of chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia, removing the underlying cause of the hyponatremia suffices. 9 Otherwise, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment and the preferred mode of treatment for mild to moderate SIADH. 20 The combination of loop diuretics with a high-sodium diet may be required to achieve an adequate response in patients with chronic SIADH.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^5bef3293]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^758a0619]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

While there is some preclinical evidence that sex steroids may modulate the secretion of AVP, there is no consistent effect of sex on hyponatremia rates, with some studies reporting a slight male predominance, some a female predominance and others no effect.

In population-based studies, SIAD is the most common attributed cause of hyponatremia, accounting for 35% to 40% of cases. However, most retrospective studies to determine the etiology of hyponatremia are limited by an incomplete diagnostic workup, with 1 multicenter registry finding that less than 50% of 3087 patients with hyponatremia had all appropriate investigations performed. A prospective study of 121 consecutive inpatients with pNa less than 130 mmol/L at a single hospital in Germany, who were assessed by a senior endocrinologist according to a rigorous diagnostic protocol, determined that 35% had SIAD, 32% hypovolemia, 20% hypervolemia (heart failure, cirrhosis, angioedema), 7% thiazide-induced hyponatremia, 4% primary polydipsia, and 2% adrenal insufficiency. Another prospective study at a tertiary neurosurgical referral center in Ireland of 1323 patients admitted with pNa less than or equal to 130 mmol/L initially classified 573 (43.4%) of these patients as having SIAD, though 22 of these (3.8%) were subsequently reclassified to adrenal insufficiency after completing further investigation.

### Addressing inpatient hyponatremia through targeted automatic E-consults: a pilot randomized trial [^d7c5084d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence of 15–30%. Acute and severe hyponatremia can have dire consequences and must be treated promptly. – Moderate hyponatremia (125–129 mEq/L) is also associated with adverse outcomes and guidelines recommend treatment according to the chronicity and presence of symptoms. Studies across various patient populations have demonstrated improved outcomes after correction of hyponatremia, suggesting that inpatient clinicians should try to correct low sodium values when possible. – Specifically, improvements in plasma sodium are associated with improved gait parameters and reaction times as well as decreased length of stay, 30-day readmissions, hospital costs, and mortality.– Despite this evidence, more than one in three cases of acute-onset hyponatremia is not corrected by the time of hospital discharge. One approach to more consistently correcting hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is to provide expert nephrologist guidance into hyponatremia workup and management. However, specialist resources are limited and such consultations are not routinely obtained.

Targeted automatic e-consultation (TACo) is a model of proactive e-consultation based on automated identification of high-risk patients from the electronic health record (EHR). TACos are triggered by patients' EHR data rather than a consultation request. Once a patient is identified, the consultant is presented with a customized EHR view of pertinent information, and can then choose to provide targeted advice, suggest formal consultation, or neither. The TACo model has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in glucose management, and has been proposed for several other conditions. –

Hyponatremia may be well suited for management through the TACo model, as hyponatremia is common, easily identified via objective criteria in the EHR, often managed suboptimally by primary teams, and may benefit from specialist recommendations for further testing or treatment. However, there have also been concerns raised about TACos, including the feasibility from a workflow and resources standpoint, the possibility that receiving unsolicited management advice may not be acceptable to primary teams, and the potential erosion of clinical expertise if generalists consistently receive specialist input when managing common problems.

The feasibility, acceptability, and clinical effectiveness of targeted, automated e-consults for inpatients with hyponatremia have not been described in the literature. In this pilot randomized trial, we sought to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of TACos for hospitalized patients with hyponatremia. We also assessed the resolution of hyponatremia by discharge among patients receiving TACos and those receiving usual care.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### Utility and limitations of the traditional diagnostic approach to hyponatremia: a diagnostic study [^7a64bcf8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia is often challenging because of its association with multiple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diseases, and treatment options. Several algorithms are available to guide the diagnostic approach to hyponatremia, but their diagnostic and clinical utility has never been evaluated. We aimed to assess in detail the diagnostic utility as well as the limitations of the existing approaches to hyponatremia.

Methods

Each of the 121 consecutive subjects presenting with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmoL/L) underwent 3 different and independent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: inexperienced doctor applying an established Algorithm, intensive care senior physicians acting as Senior Physician, and senior endocrinologist serving as Reference Standard.

Results

The overall diagnostic agreement between Algorithm and Reference Standard was 71% (respective Cohen's kappa and delta values were 0.64 and 0.70), the overall diagnostic agreement between Senior Physician and Reference Standard was 32% (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). Regarding the therapeutic consequences, the diagnostic accuracy of the Algorithm was 86% (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and of the Senior Physician was 48% (0.01 and 0.04, respectively). In retrospect, by disregarding the patient's extracellular fluid volume and assessing the effective arterial blood volume by determination of the fractional urate excretion, the Algorithm improved its diagnostic accuracy to 95%.

Conclusion

Although the Algorithm performed reasonably well, several shortcomings became apparent, rendering it difficult to apply the Algorithm without reservation. Whether some modifications may enhance its diagnostic accuracy and simplify the management of hyponatremia needs to be determined.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^6605f4f3]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — in-hospital assessment and management: Urgent measurement of blood sodium by the most rapidly available means, assessment for clinical signs suggestive of developing cerebral edema, and obtaining and storing specimens for later analysis of blood serum osmolality and urine sodium and osmolality are advised; provide supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%, restrict fluids until onset of urination, and avoid intravenous normal saline until sodium correction is initiated, though normal saline may be required for hypovolemic shock or in renal protection therapy for rhabdomyolysis; in severe cases, administer intravenous 3% sodium chloride as a 100-mL bolus repeated twice at 10-min intervals aiming to reverse cerebral edema, and aim to increase serum sodium by approximately 4 to 5 mmol·L⁻¹ or until neurological symptoms are reversed by active treatment, then allow remaining correction to occur spontaneously via urinary free water excretion.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^69c2c422]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Approach to the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia in pregnancy [^a504908f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality. Severe hyponatremia in pregnancy poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Pregnancy involves changes in physiology that affect water and sodium homeostasis. Knowledge of these complex physiologic alterations during pregnancy is critical to managing dysnatremias in pregnancy. This teaching case describes a woman with chronic hyponatremia who presented during pregnancy with worsening hyponatremia. She had an activating vasopressin receptor mutation, which was passed on to her child, and her diagnostic workup is described.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^3c391830]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically synthesize and appraise clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia In accordance with the Prisma statement, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and searched an additional 337 websites of specialist societies and guideline organizations (Additional file 6). We used AGREE II, a validated and reliable instrument, and an adequate number of reviewers to individually appraise the guidance documents. On top of the individual appraisals, we included an attempt to resolve major discrepancies and increase consistency by introducing an audiotaped group consensus meeting. During this meeting, reviewers could explain and motivate their scores and adapt them if they wanted to. This mostly resulted only in modest downgrading of domain scores by 1% to 10%. Most of the changes happened because reviewers felt they had scored inconsistently for a same rationale, or because they missed information during the initial appraisal that was in fact available in the document. Although the scores did not change substantially, the group felt the discussion further highlighted the qualitative differences between the guidance documents. In addition, even the reviewers with large deviations from the mean in their initial scores felt they agreed with the conclusion. It means that final average scores were truly a product of consensus rather than a mathematical calculation, as proposed in the original AGREE protocol. We believe that a consensus meeting is valuable in any guideline appraisal process, and particularly useful if reviewer groups have the intention to select a guideline for local use.

This study has its limitations. We based our assessment on what guideline organizations actually reported. Reporting by guideline developers may not wholly reflect what occurred in practice with respect to the AGREE criteria, and we did not seek additional clarification. However, contacting guideline developers is not standard practice when using AGREE as the instrument specifically aims to provide a framework for assessing the quality of reporting of recommendations. We aimed to summarize the existing recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia as formulated by other guideline development groups and to evaluate the quality of the guideline development process. We did not aim to summarize or critically appraise the evidence base itself. Consequently, it is difficult to assess to what extent differences between guidance documents stem from differences in development procedures rather than important limitations in the evidence base that underpin individual recommendations. Secondly, the purpose of using the AGREE instrument was not to accuse guideline development groups of being biased, but rather to highlight both strengths and weaknesses of existing guidance to suggest on how we could make improvements in the future.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^4781b0ea]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^a2b2894e]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines received the highest scores for scope and purpose (median 62%; range 28% to 92%) and clarity of presentation (median 47%; range 27% to 75%), and lowest scores for applicability (median 19%; range 10% to 68%) and editorial independence (median 19%; range 2% to 79%).

Initial appraisal results differed more than one point on the Likert scale between two or more reviewers for 143/230 items (62%). The majority of discrepancies were found in the domain 'Clarity of Presentation', with 90% of items differing more than one point. Group discussion resulted in 287/920 (31%) of individual entries being changed. Finally, no scores differed more than two points and for 82% of items, scores were the same or within one point of each other. Major reasons for changing an entry were a change of own opinion after clarification of the opinion of other reviewers during the group discussion (180/920 entries; 20% entries); aiming for consistency between entries given same available data (39/920; 4%); re-evaluation of the score in light of a noted comment during the appraisal process (30/920; 3%); correction for available data that were overlooked during the initial appraisal (22/920; 2%); misinterpretation of the question during the initial appraisal (6/920; 0.7%); adjusting for arbitrary scoring of items that were felt to be inapplicable for some reason (3/920; 0.3%); adjusting for inconsistent approach to deal with the assumption that a criterion was fulfilled even if this was not clearly mentioned (4/920; 0.4%); and data entry error (3/920, 0.3%). Overall, this resulted in 29/60 (48%) of standardized domain scores being downgraded by a maximum of 10% and 10/60 (17%) of standardized domain scores being upgraded with a maximum of 10%; the remaining 35% remained unchanged.

Synthesis of recommendations

The included guidance documents addressed three major themes: diagnosis, treatment, and speed of correction.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^9abf1fb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^68a56514]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer — SIADH: Approximately 10% to 45% of SCLC and 1% of other lung cancer cases produce arginine vasopressin, but only 1% to 5% of patients with lung cancer have symptomatic SIADH; at serum sodium concentrations of 125 to 130 mEq/L patients usually experience symptoms, and when serum sodium levels drop to < 120 mEq/L life-threatening manifestations may ensue. Diagnostic features include hyponatremia (serum sodium < 134 mEq/L), hyposmolality (plasma osmolality, < 275 mosm/kg), inappropriately high urine osmolality (> 500 mosm/kg), inappropriately high urinary sodium concentration (> 20 mEq/L), and absence of hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency or volume depletion; further evaluation notes that by assessing effective arterial blood volume with the fractional excretion of urate the accuracy of a diagnostic algorithm for SIADH can approach 95%, and laboratory findings include urine osmolality of > 300 mosm/kg, urinary sodium level of > 40 mEq/L, serum osmolality of < 275 mosm/kg, and serum uric acid concentration of < 4 mg/dL. There are no evidence-based guidelines and recommended management is based on expert opinion; fluid water restriction (< 1 L/d) is a first-line treatment of asymptomatic mild SIADH and a recommended adjunct to other therapy for severe cases, hypertonic 3% saline IV is given in life-threatening or acute symptomatic and severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, and demeclocycline, lithium, and vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists (conivaptan, lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and satavaptan) may also be used to correct hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^a1e64d5e]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia (outpatient management), WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adding oral sodium in hypertonic solutions or advising foods with high sodium content (salty snacks) for increasing serum sodium levels and enhancing symptom relief (over fluid restriction) in patients with mild exercise-associated hyponatremia, if tolerated.
