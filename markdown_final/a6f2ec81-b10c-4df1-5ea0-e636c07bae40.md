## Question

54 yo F with known hereditary hemochromatosis presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (HR 114, BP 128/80, O2 98%) and mild pedal edema. Labs: Ferritin 1250 ng/mL, LFTs mildly elevated, INR 1.2. Cardiologist recommends starting amiodarone for rhythm control — do you agree?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether starting amiodarone for rhythm control of new-onset atrial fibrillation is appropriate in a 54-year-old woman with hereditary hemochromatosis, ferritin 1250 ng/mL, mildly elevated LFTs, and mild pedal edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's hemodynamic stability and whether rhythm control is indicated now. Then, I should verify guideline positions on amiodarone as a first-line rhythm-control agent. Next, I will examine the specific toxicity risks in the context of hemochromatosis and liver disease. After that, I should consider safer alternatives and the role of treating the underlying iron overload. Finally, I will outline a practical, guideline-concordant plan and monitoring strategy, including anticoagulation and follow-up testing.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and priorities. She is hemodynamically stable with a heart rate around 114 and no hypotension or ischemia, so urgent cardioversion or IV amiodarone is not indicated; in stable new-onset AF, both rate and rhythm control are acceptable strategies, and the choice should be individualized to symptoms, comorbidities, and risk profile.

> Wait, let me verify guideline positioning on amiodarone for rhythm control. Contemporary guidelines consistently advise reserving amiodarone for long-term rhythm maintenance only when other antiarrhythmics are contraindicated, ineffective, or not preferred, due to its substantial extracardiac toxicity profile; it is not a first-line choice for routine rhythm control in patients without structural heart disease or special indications [^113SZaLd] [^113wfZqX].

> I need to check the toxicity risks that are particularly relevant here. Amiodarone carries meaningful risks of hepatotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity, and it prolongs the QT interval; in someone with already mildly elevated LFTs, adding a potentially hepatotoxic drug is risky, and the long half-life means adverse effects can persist after discontinuation, which complicates management if toxicity emerges [^117UFF72] [^115p3MvJ] [^111bf2wS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider the pathophysiology of hemochromatosis. Cardiac iron deposition can cause cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, and early recognition with aggressive iron removal can reverse cardiac injury; thus, treating the underlying iron overload is foundational, and exposing the liver to additional hepatotoxins like amiodarone may be counterproductive in this context [^116KByFp] [^114Eb2S2] [^116AAur4].

> Let me think about safer, guideline-preferred alternatives. For rhythm control in a patient without significant structural heart disease, flecainide or propafenone are reasonable first-line options, with sotalol or dofetilide as alternatives depending on renal function and QT risk; dronedarone is also an option in selected patients without recent decompensated HF or severe LV dysfunction, and it is generally better tolerated than amiodarone for long-term use [^notfound] [^111SQDAn] [^115obCXX].

> I should double-check the role of rate control as an initial strategy. Given new-onset AF with only mild symptoms and no hemodynamic compromise, a rate-control approach with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is entirely acceptable while we address the iron overload; rhythm control can be reconsidered if symptoms persist or if there is evidence of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy or HF exacerbation despite optimal rate control [^1111eHN8] [^113SZaLd].

> Next, I should review the iron-overload management because it directly impacts arrhythmia risk. With ferritin 1250 ng/mL and mildly elevated LFTs, she meets criteria for urgent therapeutic phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion; guidelines target ferritin around 50 mcg/L during induction, with maintenance thereafter, and this strategy can reverse cardiac iron loading and reduce arrhythmogenic substrate over time [^114JFNc4] [^111Bw5iz] [^116KByFp].

> But wait, what if the cardiologist's rationale is structural heart disease or LV dysfunction? I need to ensure we are not missing cardiomyopathy. In patients with HFrEF or specific structural heart disease, amiodarone may be favored for rhythm control, yet even then, guidelines still emphasize careful selection and monitoring; given her stable vitals and lack of overt HF, that indication is not clearly present here, and the liver risk remains a compelling reason to avoid amiodarone if alternatives exist [^113wfZqX].

> I will now examine a practical, guideline-concordant plan. Start rate control with a beta-blocker or diltiazem, initiate therapeutic phlebotomy urgently with a goal ferritin near 50 mcg/L, and reassess symptoms and echocardiography in 4–6 weeks; if rhythm control is still desired and there is no structural heart disease, consider flecainide or propafenone with appropriate precautions, reserving amiodarone only if these fail or are contraindicated, with explicit informed consent about toxicity and a structured monitoring plan if used [^1111eHN8] [^114JFNc4] [^113SZaLd].

> Hold on, I should verify anticoagulation decisions. With new-onset AF, I need to check CHA2DS2-VASc; if it is 2 or more in women, oral anticoagulation is indicated, and if it is 1, individualize based on risk and preference; given her age of 54, she likely scores at least 1, so anticoagulation should be considered while we determine rhythm strategy and duration of AF [^1111eHN8].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. No, I do not agree with starting amiodarone now; the risk-benefit balance is unfavorable given her stable presentation, the availability of safer antiarrhythmics, and the presence of liver involvement from hemochromatosis, and guidelines support reserving amiodarone for refractory cases or specific structural heart disease scenarios with careful monitoring, which are not clearly present here [^1111eHN8] [^113SZaLd] [^113wfZqX].

I **do not agree** with starting amiodarone for rhythm control in this patient. Given her hereditary hemochromatosis with markedly elevated ferritin and mildly elevated LFTs, amiodarone's **hepatotoxic and pulmonary risks** are too high [^117UFF72] [^115p3MvJ]. Current AF guidelines recommend reserving amiodarone for refractory cases or when other options are contraindicated, and favor rate control as first-line in stable patients [^1111eHN8] [^113SZaLd]. I would prioritize aggressive iron depletion therapy and consider safer alternatives such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for rate control, and consider rhythm-control options like electrical cardioversion or dofetilide if symptoms persist after iron repletion [^114JFNc4] [^1137M2Xt] [^1111eHN8].

---

## Risks associated with amiodarone in hereditary hemochromatosis

Amiodarone has a **significant adverse effect profile**, particularly concerning in patients with underlying liver disease or iron overload:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Amiodarone is associated with hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Given the patient's mildly elevated LFTs and iron overload, the risk of further liver injury is substantial [^117UFF72] [^115p3MvJ].

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Amiodarone can cause potentially fatal pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. This risk is compounded by the patient's iron overload, which itself can cause organ damage [^117UFF72] [^115p3MvJ].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Amiodarone-induced hypo- or hyperthyroidism is common, adding complexity to management in patients with systemic iron overload [^115p3MvJ].

---

## Guideline recommendations for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy** and caution against routine use of amiodarone for rhythm control:

- **First-line therapy**: Rate control with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers is recommended as first-line therapy for stable patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly when structural heart disease is present [^1111eHN8] [^113SZaLd].

- **Reserve amiodarone**: Amiodarone is reserved for refractory cases or when other antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated or have failed, due to its significant toxicity profile [^1111eHN8] [^113SZaLd].

- **Alternative rhythm control**: Electrical cardioversion or pharmacological cardioversion with agents such as dofetilide may be considered in selected patients, with careful monitoring and consideration of patient-specific factors [^1137M2Xt] [^1116xxXV].

---

## Impact of hereditary hemochromatosis on cardiac function and arrhythmias

Hereditary hemochromatosis causes **iron deposition** in cardiac tissue, leading to cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and heart failure. The patient's elevated ferritin level (1250 ng/mL) indicates significant iron overload, increasing the risk of cardiac complications. Aggressive iron depletion therapy (therapeutic phlebotomy) is the cornerstone of management and can reverse cardiac dysfunction if initiated early [^114JFNc4] [^116KByFp].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Given the patient's clinical context, the following **alternative strategies** are recommended:

- **Rate control**: Initiate beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for rate control, with careful monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure [^1111eHN8].

- **Iron depletion therapy**: Urgent therapeutic phlebotomy should be initiated to reduce iron overload and mitigate cardiac complications [^114JFNc4].

- **Rhythm control alternatives**: If rhythm control is deemed necessary after addressing iron overload, consider electrical cardioversion or pharmacological cardioversion with dofetilide, with appropriate anticoagulation and monitoring [^1137M2Xt] [^1116xxXV].

- **Anticoagulation**: Given the patient's atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation should be considered based on CHA2DS2-VASc risk scoring to prevent thromboembolic complications [^1111eHN8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

I **do not agree** with starting amiodarone for rhythm control in this patient. The significant risks of hepatotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity outweigh the potential benefits, especially given the patient's iron overload and elevated liver enzymes. Current guidelines recommend reserving amiodarone for refractory cases, and alternative strategies such as rate control, aggressive iron depletion therapy, and safer rhythm control options should be prioritized.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

Treatment of arrhythmias with hemodynamic compromise in thalassemia major (TM) — once ventricular arrhythmia is diagnosed, "treatment is urgent and consists of intense, uninterrupted circulation therapy", supported by deferoxamine "by intravenous infusion in a continuous regimen at doses of up to 75 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ or more" and concurrent antiarrhythmic therapy with an "infusion of amiodarone by central vein". Adjunctive measures include electrolyte correction with potassium "target > 4.5 mmol/L", magnesium infusion, endocrine management, and maintaining blood glucose "within appropriate ranges (4.0–6.0 mmol/L)". In unstable patients, "direct current defibrillation may be required". For acute atrial fibrillation (AF) with decompensation or severe myocardial iron overload (T2✱ < 10 ms), "the immediate approach should be the same as for ventricular arrhythmia", and "there should be attention given to anticoagulation" because of "a theoretical potential for systemic embolization".

Hemochromatosis — cardiac involvement includes arrhythmias: Up to one third of homozygotes with hemochromatosis have cardiac involvement, and although the natural course of untreated cardiac involvement is progressive heart failure (HF), ventricular arrhythmias have been reported; their incidence and that of sudden cardiac death (SCD) are, however, unknown. Early detection and appropriate management of hemochromatosis are essential for a favorable outcome as cardiac and liver involvement may be reversible in the early stages of the disease, and arrhythmias are managed conventionally.

Intervention: Patients aged 18 years or older who develop new-onset atrial fibrillation in the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock and in whom the medical team deems appropriate to initiate amiodarone therapy in will be considered for study inclusion. All patients will receive a 150 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone, followed immediately by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/min for the first six hours, with a recommended reduction to 0. 5 mg/min subsequently. Conversion from IV to PO amiodarone will occur based on patient hemodynamic stability and physician/pharmacist discretion. Patients will be randomized to receive amiodarone at a full loading dose or a partial loading dose.

to normal sinus rhythm, the incidence of AF recurrence; and hemodynamic variables to be assessed at various time points after the initiation of amiodarone including mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, pH, serum bicarbonate, and serum lactate. Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety: Efficacy: Patients will be stratified based on response to therapy into one of three groups: conversion to NSR, non-converting AF that is hemodynamically stable or non-converting AF that is hemodynamically unstable. The primary efficacy outcome is the mean heart rate every 6 hours after initiation of the amiodarone infusion to day 7 or death.

Secondary efficacy endpoints will include the percentage of time spent hemodynamically unstable in the first 7 days following amiodarone initiation, ICU LOS, hospital LOS and 28-day mortality along with comparisons of the individual portions of the hemodynamic endpoints [mean arterial pressure, heart rate, systolic. SBP < 90 mmHg OR MAP < 70 mmHg, despite HR control of < 120 bpm; need for fluid boluses ± vasopressors or dobutamine), which the medical team believes to be caused by IV amiodarone therapy:

### Amiodarone therapy for atrial rhythm control: insights gained from a single center experience [^111JhZKr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone has been advocated as an effective "long-term" therapy for atrial rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to assess the sustainability of this therapeutic strategy.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis of a consecutive, single-center cohort (n = 168) with symptomatic AF who were treated with amiodarone and followed for 3 years. The incidence of amiodarone cessation was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years and attributed principally to drug inefficacy, intolerance, or toxicity. A gradual diminution in the number of patients on therapy was observed, such that by 3 years, only 45% remained. This was attributable to inefficacy (25%), intolerance (12%), or toxicity (18%). Pulmonary toxicity was surprisingly common, occurring in at least 7% of patients.

Conclusions

These data challenge the notion of amiodarone as a reasonable "destination" therapy for AF.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^111bf2wS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^112mLSF6]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In summarising the use of amiodarone, a bolus was defined as a fixed dose of greater than 150 mg given over 20 minutes to an hour, a continuous infusion was a fixed dose of amiodarone delivered hourly by a syringe pump for more than 2 hours, and delay to an infusion was a gap of 1 hour in the fluid administration record for the administration of a bolus and the commencement of an infusion.

Continuous automated ECG rhythm tracings were recorded for all patients for the entire duration of their ICU stay. Data collection included records of drugs administered (amiodarone and all inotropes), their doses, and infusion rates. Physiologic variables were recorded daily including fluid balance, white cell count, central venous pressure, and temperature. Demographic data included age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), ICU admission and discharge times, hospital admission and discharge times, hospital outcome, and ICU outcome. The time and date for AF onset, conversion to normal sinus rhythm, and any recurrence were extracted from ECG data. Data regarding comorbidities were collected using the Charlson Comorbidity Index with both scores and diagnoses recorded. The presence of past rheumatic fever, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, mitral valve disease, haemochromatosis, hypertension and concurrent use of digoxin and metoprolol were also recorded. If patients had multiple admissions during the study period only the initial admission in which amiodarone was used for the first time was included in data collection.

The study was granted low-risk research approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital as well as the Medical Research Ethics Committee, University of Queensland with individual consent waived due to the retrospective study design (HREC/11/QRBW/292 and 2012000135).

### Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications [^115p3MvJ]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although amiodarone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration only for refractory ventricular arrhythmias, it is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic medications in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate and synthesize evidence regarding optimal use of amiodarone for various arrhythmias.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other studies with clinical pertinence. The search was limited to human-participant, English-language reports published between 1970 and 2007. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, electrical storm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, surgery, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and Wolff-Parkinson-White. Bibliographies of identified articles and guidelines from official societies were reviewed for additional references. Ninety-two identified studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

Evidence Synthesis

Amiodarone may have clinical value in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation, though other agents are available. Amiodarone is useful in acute management of sustained ventricular tachyarrythmias, regardless of hemodynamic stability. The only role for prophylactic amiodarone is in the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. Amiodarone may be effective as an adjunct to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce number of shocks. However, amiodarone has a number of serious adverse effects, including corneal microdeposits (> 90%), optic neuropathy/neuritis (≤ 1%-2%), blue-gray skin discoloration (4%-9%), photosensitivity (25%-75%), hypothyroidism (6%), hyperthyroidism (0.9%-2%), pulmonary toxicity (1%-17%), peripheral neuropathy (0.3% annually), and hepatotoxicity (elevated enzyme levels, 15%-30%; hepatitis and cirrhosis, < 3% [0.6% annually]).

Conclusion

Amiodarone should be used with close follow-up in patients who are likely to derive the most benefit, namely those with atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction, those with acute sustained ventricular arrhythmias, those about to undergo cardiac surgery, and those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and symptomatic shocks.

### How I approach optimization of patients at risk of cardiac and pulmonary complications after CAR T-cell therapy [^114dJ3yw]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Part 3: arrhythmias

A 56-year-old female with history of hypertension, CAD, chronic kidney disease, and immunoglobulin Gκ multiple myeloma was admitted for treatment with B-cell maturation antigen–directed CAR T cells (idecabtagene vicleucel). On day 3, she developed fever and tachycardia consistent with grade 1 CRS and was placed on telemetry. She was noted to have new-onset atrial fibrillation. She was hemodynamically stable but off her antihypertensive medications. The patient was treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab and corticosteroids but her atrial fibrillation persisted, so she was started on amiodarone and placed on telemetry.

We recommend placing all patients who develop CRS on telemetry for monitoring of arrhythmias, if feasible, especially if patients develop grade 2 CRS. Arrhythmias are common after CAR T-cell therapy and consist of approximately two-thirds of the cardiovascular complications after CAR T-cell therapy. On the basis of data from the FDA adverse event reporting system of CD19 CAR T cells, 74% of reported arrhythmias were atrial fibrillation or flutter and 18% were ventricular tachycardias. In the setting of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation with low blood pressure, we may use amiodarone because CRS-related hypotension may often preclude patients from beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for rate control. For patients with a preserved blood pressure, beta-blockers are commonly used as first-line therapy. These patients usually cannot receive anticoagulants to prevent atrial fibrillation–related embolism, and, thus, the aggressive use of amiodarone may lead to conversion to sinus rhythm. However, if atrial fibrillation persists beyond 48 hours, we typically stop the amiodarone because the risk of embolism with chemical cardioversion increases. We rarely use digoxin in this case, and digoxin should be reserved for patients in whom amiodarone is contraindicated. Patients with hemodynamic instability should be admitted to the ICU, and cardioversion should be considered. Atrial fibrillation can be paroxysmal and resolve in < 24 hours, and we do not use anticoagulation or cardiac medications frequently in that setting. These decisions should be made in consultation with a cardiologist before discharge. For those in whom the atrial fibrillation lasts longer, and stroke risk is high, we first start patients on unfractionated heparin drip when platelet counts are > 50 × 10³/μL and then discharge patients using direct-oral anticoagulants. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter during CRS will not likely need long-term anticoagulant. However, the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence is unknown, and patients will need monitoring. After discharge, we place an ambulatory cardiac monitor to evaluate for arrhythmias. If we do not detect atrial fibrillation at that time, we stop the antiarrhythmic monitoring. For those with persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter, we place an ambulatory cardiac monitor ∼4 or 6 months after treatment, and, again, if no further arrhythmias, we stop the direct-oral anticoagulant and do not pursue further treatment.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guideline — other infiltrative cardiomyopathies and amyloidosis: Infiltrative cardiomyopathies are heterogeneous and uncommon; in some (such as Fabry's disease) VAs are uncommon and some (such as hemochromatosis) are highly treatable when diagnosed early; in all cases, treatment of the underlying condition must accompany arrhythmia management, and in general, unless contraindications are present, VAs should be treated as in any other cardiomyopathy. For amyloidosis, prognosis has historically been very poor but has improved with advances in medical therapy for light-chain amyloidosis; decisions must be individualized because data are too limited for formal recommendations and published ICD effectiveness reports are small, observational and with limited follow up; whether benefit from ICD placement differs between light chain and transthyretin-related amyloidosis remains uncertain.

Atrial fibrillation rhythm control — amiodarone dosing, cautions, and adverse-effect monitoring: Amiodarone is dosed as 3 × 200 mg daily over 4 weeks, 2 × 200 mg another 4 weeks, then 200 mg daily, and should be discontinued in case of excessive QT prolongation (> 500 ms). Concomitant drug cautions include concomitant use with VKAs or digitalis (their dose should be reduced) and increased risk of myopathy when used with statins. The drug requires regular surveillance for liver, lung and thyroid toxicity, has AV nodal slowing properties, but should not be used as monotherapy for rate control, and QT prolongation is common, but very rarely associated with TdP (< 0.5%).

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Other infiltrative cardiomyopathies — ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and device considerations: Infiltrative cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of uncommon systemic diseases with associated cardiac involvement; in some infiltrative cardiomyopathies, such as hemochromatosis, VAs are uncommon, and some, such as hemochromatosis, are highly treatable especially when diagnosed early. In all cases, treatment of the underlying condition must accompany management of cardiac arrhythmias, and, in general, unless contraindications are present, VAs should be treated as in any other cardiomyopathy. For cardiac amyloidosis, until recently prognosis was very poor with patients ultimately succumbing to progressive heart failure (HF), but advances in medical therapy for light-chain amyloidosis have led to improved outcomes. Decisions must be individualized because data remain too limited to allow formal recommendations as published reports on ICD effectiveness in amyloidosis are small, observational and with limited follow up, and whether there is greater benefit to ICD placement in light chain amyloidosis versus transthyretin-related amyloidosis remains uncertain.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

Amiodarone — comparative maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) shows higher efficacy than several alternatives, with amiodarone maintaining sinus rhythm (69% vs. 39%) over a 16-month follow-up period; in the AFFIRM study, 62% treated with amiodarone remained in sinus rhythm at 1 y compared with 23% on class I agents, and in another randomized comparison 60% versus 38% sustained sinus rhythm with amiodarone versus sotalol. However, 18% stopped amiodarone because of side effects after a mean of 468 d compared with 11% on sotalol or propafenone.

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^117UFF72]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Early rhythm control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure [^113PteVw]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Timing of Rhythm Control Therapy

Patients with HF who have atrial fibrillation are at high risk of cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, stroke, and worsening of HF. Recent-onset atrial fibrillation is associated with worse outcomes than established atrial fibrillation. The early timing of rhythm control therapy in this study could have amplified the clinical benefit of ERC compared with usual care. It is also possible that the early initiation of rhythm control therapy led to an improved efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in comparison with other trials testing antiarrhythmic drugs for rhythm control therapy in patients with HF.
