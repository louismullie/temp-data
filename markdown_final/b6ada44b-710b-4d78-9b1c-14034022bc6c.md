Salmonella symptoms

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of Salmonella, organized by syndrome, with attention to timing, severity, special populations, and complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two major clinical entities: nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis and typhoidal enteric fever. Then, I should verify incubation periods and the typical time course of symptoms. Next, I will examine core gastrointestinal and systemic features, followed by complications and extraintestinal manifestations. After that, I need to consider host-specific modifiers such as age, HIV status, and immunocompromise. Finally, I should confirm diagnostic triggers and when to suspect invasive disease, and close with a concise synthesis that distinguishes the syndromes and highlights red flags.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and their usual presentations. Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) typically causes acute gastroenteritis with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, and is usually self-limited, whereas typhoidal Salmonella (S. Typhi or Paratyphi) causes enteric fever, a systemic bacteremic illness with prolonged fever and often minimal early diarrhea, which carries higher risks of complications if untreated [^116miyKV] [^113nnopJ] [^111tdbZg].

> I need to check the incubation and time course carefully. For NTS gastroenteritis, symptoms usually begin 6–72 hours after exposure and last about 4–7 days, though some shed organisms for weeks. For enteric fever, onset is slower, typically 7–14 days after exposure with a range of 3–60 days, and fever rises gradually over several days, often plateauing by the end of week one if untreated [^116GqFC5] [^116miyKV] [^111tdbZg] [^113nnopJ].

> Now, let me consider the core gastrointestinal symptoms of NTS. Diarrhea is the hallmark and is often watery. Fever and abdominal cramps are common, with nausea and vomiting also occurring, though vomiting is less frequent than diarrhea. In children, vomiting may be prominent, and stools can occasionally contain blood or mucus, reflecting mucosal inflammation [^116miyKV] [^1147hWFh] [^117XGKYG].

> Hold on, I should verify the systemic features that accompany NTS. Fever is usually present and can be high. Headache and malaise are common, and dehydration risk is higher in young children and older adults. Importantly, NTS can lead to invasive disease in vulnerable hosts, presenting as bacteremia with nonlocalizing febrile illness rather than diarrheal disease [^116miyKV] [^117BgD4E] [^111EB6Py].

> Next, I will examine the enteric fever syndrome. Fever is the dominant feature, rising gradually to 39–40°C and often sustained. Patients report malaise, headache, myalgia, and sometimes a dry cough. Abdominal pain is diffuse and may localize to the right lower quadrant, mimicking appendicitis. Diarrhea is less common early and may be absent, while constipation can occur. Relative bradycardia may be seen in a subset, and rose spots can appear in a minority during the second week [^111tdbZg] [^113nnopJ] [^112u1zrF].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of complications in enteric fever. Life-threatening complications typically emerge in the second week of untreated illness and include intestinal perforation and hemorrhage, encephalopathy, hepatitis, cholecystitis, myocarditis, and psychosis. Case series suggest substantial complication prevalence in hospitalized cohorts, underscoring the need for early recognition and therapy [^113nnopJ] [^113Q9TBo].

> I will now examine extraintestinal and focal infections that can follow either NTS or typhoidal disease. These include bacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endovascular infection including mycotic aneurysm, and abscesses in various organs. Some serovars such as Dublin and Panama are disproportionately associated with invasive disease, and invasive NTS in sub-Saharan Africa carries high case fatality even with treatment [^117BgD4E] [^111EB6Py] [^113eeKA9] [^115d51kU].

> But wait, what about less common complications that can mislead clinicians. Acute pancreatitis, though rare, has been reported in children with Salmonella gastroenteritis and can present with severe epigastric pain and biochemical pancreatitis. Rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury is another rare complication. And reactive arthritis can follow either NTS or typhoidal infection, particularly in younger adults, sometimes persisting months to years [^113tX9ky] [^112Ydeug] [^116W6neq] [^116miyKV].

> Let me think about host-specific modifiers that change the clinical picture. In older adults, the proportion reporting classic enteric symptoms declines with age, yet hospitalization risk rises linearly, so absence of diarrhea does not exclude disease. In children under 5, enteric fever may present with fever alone and be misclassified as fever of unknown origin. In HIV, the risk of invasive NTS is 20–100 times higher and mortality is substantially increased, warranting longer antibiotic courses and consideration of secondary prophylaxis until immune reconstitution [^1112EN9i] [^112u1zrF] [^113imG9f] [^113CLKCu] [^116eiyp8].

> Hold on, I should verify the implications of immunocompromise beyond HIV. Patients with defects in IL-12/IL-23/IFN-γ pathways (Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease) are uniquely vulnerable to recurrent, severe Salmonella infections and may require prolonged or suppressive therapy. Likewise, individuals with asplenia or hemoglobinopathies are at higher risk for invasive disease and osteoarticular complications, influencing both diagnostic suspicion and treatment duration [^112auJ4H] [^115AhZc6] [^114QDRTZ].

> Next, I should review diagnostic triggers and when to suspect invasive disease. Fever or bloody diarrhea should prompt stool testing for Salmonella and other bacterial enteropathogens; in a febrile patient with travel to endemic areas or relevant exposures, enteric fever should be considered; persistent fever beyond 7–10 days, signs of sepsis, focal pain, or failure to improve should raise concern for invasive disease and prompt blood cultures and site-specific imaging or evaluation [^1147dqkc] [^111TEVvW] [^111u8tng].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought diarrhea is uncommon in typhoid, but I should double-check that nuance. While diarrhea is indeed less frequent early in typhoid and may be absent, it can occur later in the course, and some patients have constipation rather than diarrhea; thus, the absence of diarrhea does not reliably exclude enteric fever, especially early in illness [^111tdbZg] [^113nnopJ].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Nontyphoidal Salmonella typically causes an acute, self-limited gastroenteritis with diarrhea, fever, and cramps beginning 6–72 hours after exposure and lasting 4–7 days, whereas typhoidal Salmonella causes a systemic febrile illness with gradual onset over 3–7 days, sustained high fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, and variable early gastrointestinal symptoms, with complications clustering in the second week if untreated. Invasive NTS can mimic enteric fever clinically and carries high mortality in high-risk populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [^116miyKV] [^111tdbZg] [^113nnopJ] [^117BgD4E].

Salmonella infection typically presents with **diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps** [^1147hWFh] starting 6–72 hours after exposure, lasting 4–7 days, and resolving without antibiotics in most healthy hosts [^116GqFC5]. Nausea, vomiting, and headache are common, and **stool shedding can persist for weeks** [^116miyKV]. In high-risk groups (infants, older adults, immunocompromised), illness may be severe or invasive, with bacteremia, dehydration, or extraintestinal complications [^117BgD4E]. Enteric fever (Typhi/Paratyphi) presents with **prolonged fever, malaise, headache, and relative bradycardia** [^111tdbZg], often with minimal early diarrhea and risk of intestinal bleeding or perforation if untreated [^113Q9TBo]. Antibiotics are reserved for severe cases or high-risk hosts, as they do not shorten mild illness and can prolong carriage [^116z77NH] [^116Qoiew].

## Common symptoms of Salmonella infection

Salmonella infection typically presents with **gastrointestinal symptoms**, although systemic manifestations may occur, particularly in vulnerable populations [^116miyKV].

- **Diarrhea**: Usually watery; may occasionally contain blood or mucus [^117XGKYG].
- **Fever**: Commonly present, often mild to moderate, but can be high in severe cases [^1147hWFh].
- **Abdominal cramps**: Commonly experienced by patients [^1151wohq].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequent, though less common than diarrhea [^116miyKV].
- **Headache**: Common, particularly in enteric fever [^111tdbZg].
- **Loss of appetite**: Frequently reported [^113Q9TBo].

---

## Incubation period and duration of symptoms

The incubation period for Salmonella infection typically ranges from **6 to 72 hours** [^116GqFC5] after exposure, with symptoms usually lasting 4 to 7 days [^116GqFC5]. In some cases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with invasive disease, symptoms may persist for several weeks [^116miyKV].

---

## Severe symptoms and complications

While most Salmonella infections are self-limited, severe cases can occur — especially in **high-risk populations** — and may lead to significant complications:

- **High fever**: Temperatures exceeding 102°F (39°C) [^1147hWFh].
- **Bloody diarrhea**: Indicative of severe intestinal inflammation [^1147hWFh].
- **Dehydration**: Resulting from prolonged diarrhea and vomiting, particularly dangerous in young children and older adults [^116miyKV].
- **Bacteremia**: Presence of Salmonella bacteria in the bloodstream, occurring in approximately 1–5% of cases [^117XGKYG].
- **Extraintestinal infections**: Including meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and endocarditis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^117BgD4E].
- **Reactive arthritis**: Joint inflammation occurring weeks to months after infection, more common in individuals with specific genetic predispositions (e.g. HLA-B27) [^116miyKV].

---

## Symptoms of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid)

Enteric fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi, presents differently from non-typhoidal Salmonella infections. Common symptoms include:

- **Prolonged fever**: Gradual onset, rising to 39–40°C (102–104°F) over several days [^111tdbZg].
- **Malaise and fatigue**: Persistent and profound [^notfound].
- **Headache**: Commonly reported [^111tdbZg].
- **Abdominal pain**: Often diffuse and poorly localized [^111tdbZg].
- **Relative bradycardia**: Slower heart rate than expected for the degree of fever [^1112m4kc].
- **Rose spots**: Pink, blanching macules on the trunk and abdomen, occurring in a minority of cases [^1112m4kc].
- **Intestinal complications**: Including intestinal bleeding and perforation, particularly if untreated [^113Q9TBo].

---

## Differences in symptoms based on patient demographics

### Age

Children more often experience vomiting and dehydration, whereas **older adults** may have less pronounced gastrointestinal symptoms but are at higher risk of severe complications and hospitalization [^1112EN9i].

---

### Immune status

Immunocompromised individuals have an increased risk of **invasive disease**, bacteremia, and extraintestinal complications, whereas **immunocompetent individuals** more often experience mild, self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms [^117BgD4E].

---

## Long-term consequences and chronic symptoms

Salmonella infection can lead to **long-term consequences**, particularly in individuals with specific risk factors:

- **Reactive arthritis**: Joint inflammation occurring weeks to months after infection [^116miyKV].
- **Chronic carrier state**: Persistent colonization of the gallbladder, leading to ongoing shedding of bacteria and potential transmission to others [^116Dzm5h].
- **Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Chronic gastrointestinal symptoms persisting months after infection [^115p8pX8].

Clinical features of invasive disease in sub-Saharan Africa

The clinical presentation of invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease in Africa is typically febrile systemic illness, resembling enteric fever; diarrhoea is often absent and other clinical features are diverse and non-specific (figure 2). A study of bacteraemia in adults in Malawinoted that a combination of high fever and splenomegaly suggested invasive disease, but that diagnosis cannot reliably be made without microbiological tests. In young children especially, a problematic clinical overlap exists with the presentations of pneumonia and malaria, and paediatric guidelines for empirical diagnosis and treatment in low-income settings fail to identify or treat invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease. Patients with invasive disease frequently present with apparent focal infection, particularly of the lower respiratory tract, which is commonly attributable to co-infection with other pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Even microbiologically confirmed invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease treated with appropriate antimicrobial drugs has a case fatality of 22–47% in African adults and children.

Figure 2
Clinical features of invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease in adults and children in Africa

Risk factors for invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease in children include HIV infection; malnutrition; and malaria, especially severe malarial anaemia, acute severe malaria, and recent malaria. Sickle-cell anaemia is also an important risk factor in African children. Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella predates HIV as an important clinical disease in children in Africa, and, although HIV is independently associated with the illness in febrile paediatric admissions (odds ratio 2.6), only roughly 20% of African children who get non-typhoidal salmonella disease are infected with HIV. The main risk factor in adults is undoubtedly advanced HIV infection. Case series typically show 95% of adult cases to be in people infected with HIV, of whom 80% have a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of fewer than 200 cells per μL. In adults infected with HIV, before the antiretroviral therapy era 20–40% of survivors had recurrence, even after appropriate antimicrobial drugs; despite retreatment, up to 25% of patients had several recurrences. Genomic typing of index and recurrence strains suggests that recrudescence is more common than reinfection as a cause of recurrences.

### Genomic serotyping, clinical manifestations, and antimicrobial resistance of nontyphoidalGastroenteritis in hospitalized children in Ho chi minh city, Vietnam [^113tEgD7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

With an estimated 93.8 million cases (5th to 95th percentiles, 61.8 to 131.6 million) of gastroenteritis recorded globally per annum, nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) are among the most common etiological agents of diarrheal diseases worldwide. This burden disproportionally affects young children in Asia and Africa and results in ∼155,000 deaths per year (5th to 95th percentiles; 39,000 to 303,000).

The Salmonellae are a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The genus is classified into two species:and, withcomprised of a further six subspecies.subsp. enterica includes > 2,500 serovars which can cause a wide range of disease in humans and animals. This extensive diversity points to the ancestral origin of this subspecies, with Salmonella being recovered from human remnants dating back > 6,500 years ago. Infections caused by different NTS serovars can present with differing pathology, epidemiology, clinical presentations, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles. Clinically, NTS infections are usually observed as acute gastroenteritis with the onset of fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms are typically self-limiting and resolve within 5 to 7 days. Consequently, antimicrobial treatment is deemed unnecessary and is generally not recommended. However, salmonellosis can also result in invasive diseases (i.e. bloodstream infection) in immunocompromised patients, and it has a high mortality rate. Therefore, antimicrobials remain crucial for the treatment of some Salmonella infections, especially in high-risk patients. Currently, the WHO guidelines for treatment of pediatric diarrhea recommend the use of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc, and antimicrobials for all patients with bloody diarrhea, irrespective of their age. The first drug of choice is ciprofloxacin or one of the 3-s line alternatives: pivmecillinam, azithromycin, or ceftriaxone.

Objective

Radiologic findings in Salmonella infections are not well described. In most patients, Salmonella infections produce mild and self-limiting clinical manifestations and therefore are treated empirically with antibiotics. Radiologic investigations are usually performed for patients with severe clinical manifestations or complications and for patients with unusual findings.

Conclusion

This pictorial essay illustrates various imaging findings in culture-proven cases of Salmonella infection, described broadly as common and uncommon manifestations.

### British Infection Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of enteric fever in england [^1116Yf5N]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever (EF) is an infection caused by the bacteria called Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi. Infection is acquired through swallowing contaminated food or water. Most EF in England occurs in people returning from South Asia and other places where EF is common; catching EF in England is rare. The main symptom is fever, but stomach pain, diarrhoea, muscle aches, rash and other symptoms may occur. EF is diagnosed by culturing the bacteria from blood and/or stool in a microbiology laboratory. EF usually responds well to antibiotic treatment. Depending on how unwell the individual is, antibiotics may be administered by mouth or by injection. Over the past several years, there has been an overall increase in resistance to antibiotics used to treat enteric fever, in all endemic areas. Additionally, since 2016, there has been an ongoing outbreak of drug-resistant EF in Pakistan. This infection is called extensively drug-resistant, or XDR, EF and only responds to a limited number of antibiotics. Occasionally individuals develop complications of EF including confusion, bleeding, a hole in the gut or an infection of the bones or elsewhere. Some people may continue to carry the bacteria in their stool for a longtime following treatment for the initial illness. These people may need treatment with a longer course of antibiotics to eradicate infection. Travellers can reduce their risk of acquiring EF by following safe food and water practices and by receiving the vaccine at least a few weeks before travel. These guidelines aim to help doctors do the correct tests and treat patients for enteric fever in England but may also be useful to doctors and public health professionals in other similar countries.

### Typhoid spondylodiscitis of the cervical spine [^113VCU3J]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Spinal infection comprises pyogenic and non-pyogenic spondylodiscitis. This condition may manifest with non-specific clinical symptoms, elevated infective parameters and imaging findings that are difficult to distinguish. The cornerstone of a definitive diagnosis and subsequent successful treatment lies in tissue analysis through culture and histopathological studies. In this context, we present a case of Salmonella pyogenic spondylodiscitis affecting the C5/C6 vertebrae, complicated by Salmonella bacteraemia and characterised by mechanical neck pain that curtails daily activities and overall functioning, although without neurological deficits. The uniqueness of this case stems from its occurrence in an immunocompetent individual from a non-endemic area, with no identifiable sources of Salmonella infection or preceding gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Salmonella enterica serovar agbeni, British columbia, Canada, 2011 [^117Xn4fP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

We calculated incubation periods for GI symptoms for 6 persons as the time between onset of GI symptoms and the May 14 wedding (5 persons) or last travel date (1 person). The incubation period was 5–7 days (average 5.5 days). The incubation period for UTI, which could be calculated for 2 persons, was an average of 25.5 days. Long incubation periods for Salmonella spp. infections have been reported; reasons include exposure to a low dose of bacteria, specific populations (e.g. young children, child day care attendees), and method of food preparation. The age of persons in our investigation did not affect the length of the incubation period. The amount of food eaten was not collected during the interview; however, most persons in our investigation reported eating a wide variety of foods, and 1 reported eating small portions. All food was prepared during the week before the wedding and served cold. This length of time and the potential for temperature abuse could have increased the infectious dose and decreased the incubation period. In addition, the 1 person with travel-related infection was not exposed to these food items. We found no literature on the incubation period for S. enterica ser. Agbeni. The reason for the long incubation period in this investigation is unclear and could be due to host-specific factors, the implicated serotype, or the food source.

The 3-day time frame for exposures was not sufficient to identify appropriate exposures. Expanding the period for collecting exposure information about Salmonella spp. infections and the reporting and investigation of persons with Salmonella spp. identified in urine to public health authorities might be needed to help identify and solve outbreaks.

### Salmonellosis as a differential diagnosis [^112sfqLY]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

With a low incidence of Salmonella infection, salmonellosis is an uncommon problem in Scotland. It occurs in both immune-compromised and immune-competent patients. We present two cases of salmonellosis in immune-competent patients who had had a history of gastroenteritis. Diagnosis was delayed in one patient; however, both patients received appropriate treatment and made good recovery following their respective illnesses. Apart from acting as a reminder to consider salmonellosis as a differential diagnosis when managing patients with infective process, the cases also highlight the importance of concise history taking, and the importance of cultures-and-sensitivities in managing infectious cases.

### Salmonella meningitis in an immunocompetent adult [^112jjAk5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Non-enteric salmonella infections in immunocompetent adults are exceedingly rare in the United States, and meningitis is one of the least common extra-intestinal sites. In addition, it is very unusual for a patient with bacterial meningitis to present with classic meningitis signs and symptoms of > 72 h duration. The objective of this work is to describe a rare case of salmonella meningitis in an immunocompetent adult and, in the context of previously published case reports, describe the frequently atypical clinical course of salmonella meningitis along with the potential pitfalls encountered during its evaluation and treatment. An otherwise healthy 45-year-old man presented to our Emergency Department with frontal headache, fever, and stiff neck of 7 days duration. He was alert and oriented in triage, where he was noted to be afebrile, mildly tachycardic, with a normal blood pressure and respiratory rate; shortly after triage he developed a high fever, severe tachycardia, hypotension, and a change in mental status. He was resuscitated according to our severe sepsis protocol and treated empirically for bacterial meningitis. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures grew group D Salmonella berta. An evaluation for underlying immunodeficiency was unrevealing. The patient was discharged home on hospital day 7 in good condition. Salmonella meningitis can present with an indolent course and can mimic, in many misleading ways, the less serious diagnosis of aseptic meningitis. This case highlights the need for an unbiased clinical assessment, aggressive management of critical illness, and point-for-point correspondence between clinical data and assigned diagnosis.

### Diagnostic value of clinical features to distinguish enteric fever from other febrile illnesses in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan [^113ECpAK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever is a systemic bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi. Estimates of enteric fever incidence range from 550 per 100 000 in South Asia to 160 per 100 000 in Western sub-Saharan Africa to 0.3 per 100 000 in Western Europe.

Typhoid and Paratyphoid commonly cause nonlocalizing febrile illnesses that present similarly to many other bacterial, viral, and parasitic fevers. Physicians have struggled to distinguish enteric fever from other fever etiologies for hundreds of years, potentially even as early as the era of Hippocrates. While the advent of bacterial culturing techniques in the early 20 th century improved the accuracy of diagnosing enteric fever, the cost and logistical hurdles of setting up microbiology facilities put them largely out of reach for many of the regions with the highest enteric fever burden. Even when blood culture capacity is available, testing can be costly, has limited sensitivity, and is slow, with results taking up to 5 days. For these reasons, physicians managing patients with enteric fever in low- and middle-income countries often rely on clinical features, including both reported symptoms and clinical signs to make diagnoses and choose treatment regimens.

Despite the reliance of clinicians on clinical features to diagnose enteric fever, accurate clinical prediction rules have remained elusive. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of clinical features of blood culture–confirmed S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A patients enrolled in the Surveillance of Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), conducted in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. We also compared the clinical features of S. Typhi patients to S. Paratyphi A patients. Our objectives were to identify those clinical features that might have diagnostic value for identifying enteric fever and that might distinguish S. Paratyphi A from S. Typhi.

### Advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of invasive Salmonella infections [^112E32oX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serotypes are among the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illnesses in the developing world. In this review, we discuss new advances in understanding of the burden, diagnostic approaches, treatment and vaccines for invasive Salmonella infections.

Recent Findings

Recent estimates of the global burden of typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella not only affirm the importance of these infections but also highlight the paucity of systematic incidence data from many regions. New data from Africa indicate that typhoidal Salmonella may be more common than previously considered. Novel diagnostic techniques for Salmonella include new serologic, molecular and metabolomic approaches, but blood culture - although slow and insensitive - remains the primary means of establishing a diagnosis. Antibiotic resistance, particularly to fluoroquinolones, continues to emerge and threatens to undermine treatment success for these infections. New vaccines for typhoid, including conjugate vaccines with longer duration of immunity than prior vaccines, represent a promising tool for prevention of enteric fever.

Summary

Invasive Salmonella infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing antibiotic resistance in Salmonella is concerning, and empiric oral options are being rapidly eroded. Where new effective antimicrobials are lacking, developments in vaccines offer hope for reducing the burden of Salmonella infections globally.

### The global burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^115QpABy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, collectively referred to as enteric fever, are caused by systemic infection with Salmonella enterica subspecies serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, B, and C. Whereas most non-typhoidal Salmonella spp infections typically produce diarrhoeal illness and less commonly cause bloodstream infection, typhoid and paratyphoid infections produce primarily bacteraemic febrile illnesses, with prolonged high fever, headache, and malaise being characteristic symptoms. Without effective treatment, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers can lead to altered mental states (termed the typhoid state), ileus, gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, septic shock, and death. Typhoid and paratyphoid infections are relatively common in countries with poor water supply and sanitation, especially south Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, where they are a major cause of death and disability, especially among children.,

With growing antimicrobial resistance, and intensifying conversations around typhoid vaccine policy, accurate and detailed estimates of enteric fever burden are required. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of WHO convened in October, 2017, and recommended the use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in children between 6 months and 2 years of age, with a catch-up campaign for children up to 15 years of age, where possible, and WHO prequalified the first typhoid conjugate vaccine in December, 2017. These developments give typhoid-endemic, low-income countries priority access and funding for the vaccine and could make vaccines increasingly accessible. However, data to support their introduction remain sparse.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for "("typhoid" OR "paratyphoid" OR "typhi" OR "paratyphi") AND ("burden" OR "estimates" OR "model")", with no restrictions placed on date of publication or language. We identified global (or near-global) estimates of enteric fever incidence, ranging from 12 million to 27 million cases annually. Estimates of mortality ranged from 129 000 to 223 000 deaths. Most previous studies assumed a case fatality of 1%, whereas one study estimated a case fatality range of 0.4% to 2.1%. Only previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) have reported estimates of temporal trends and health gap metrics for typhoid and paratyphoid fevers separately.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^115AXuQc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Fever or bloody diarrhea — diagnostic and management recommendations state that people with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit, including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, or has laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In this document, Salmonella Typhi represents the more formal and detailed name Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi, and Salmonella Paratyphi corresponds to the Paratyphi serovar.

- Stomach cramps Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or a headache. Symptoms usually start within 6 hours–6 days after infection and last 4–7 days. Should I call the doctor? Call the doctor if you have:

- Diarrhea and a fever higher than 102°F
- Diarrhea for more than 3 days that is not improving
- Bloody stools
- Prolonged vomiting that prevents you from keeping liquids down
- **Signs of dehydration, such as**:

- Making very little urine
- Dry mouth and throat
- Dizziness when standing up

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^115a8ia4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The most common symptom reported by those with paratyphoid illness was headache (17/20 [85%]), followed by malaise (15/20 [75%]), abdominal pain (14/20 [70%]), and myalgia (14/20 [70%]). The majority of solicited symptoms were graded as mild and did not result in limitation of usual activity (Figure 1; Supplementary Table 2). In comparison with participants challenged with S. Typhi in earlier studies, paratyphoid resulted in a milder symptom profile, characterized by fewer severe symptoms and lower cumulative symptom scores (Figure 2; Supplementary Table 3).

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111GRpsa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) symptom evaluation and infection workup highlight that symptoms of bloody diarrhea, presence of mucus, bowel urgency, tenesmus, and abdominal cramping should trigger consideration of a diagnosis of UC, particularly in the absence of an alternate cause, and that history should assess extraintestinal manifestations including joint, skin, ocular, oral, and hepatobiliary involvement. Potential precipitants may include recent smoking cessation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and enteric infections. C. difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as complicating a significant proportion of patients with UC and is associated with increased risk of hospitalizations, colectomy, and mortality; among newly diagnosed or relapsing inflammatory bowel disease patients, CDI prevalence ranges from 5% to 47%, and concomitant CDI with UC has worse outcomes, including higher mortality. Testing for C. difficile is typically performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other enteric infections that could mimic UC include Escherichia coli (O157:H7), Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and parasitic infections like amoebiasis, so an infectious etiology should always be suspected and excluded at time of diagnosis and in the right clinical setting, with several institutions using comprehensive intestinal pathogen testing through PCR-based assays that may detect many bacterial and viral pathogens.

### Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections [^1154Tqap]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Salmonella enterica invade the host via the intestinal tract. There are ~2 thousand distinct serovars of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) that can cause gastroenteritis in normal hosts, but bacteremia is an uncommon complication of gastroenteritis except at the extremes of age (in Graham et al. Nontyphoidal Salmonella infections of children in tropical Africa. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000; 19:1189–96). In contrast, enteric fever and invasive NTS infections (iNTS) are each caused by only a few serovars of S. enterica
(Table 1), and bacteremia not gastroenteritis is their principal manifestation.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111TEVvW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — fever or bloody diarrhea and enteric fever: People with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, has consumed foods prepared by people with recent endemic exposure, or has had laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diarrhea is an uncommon feature, typhoid fever outbreaks in the United States are uncommon and usually associated with foodborne transmission from an asymptomatic carrier, and a travel history is frequent, reported in 68% of patients with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and 50% with Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi.

### Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome: follow-up of a patient cohort of confirmed cases of bacterial infection with Salmonella or Campylobacter [^115p8pX8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal infections have been proposed to predict subsequent irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but large-scale infectious events are rare and long-term data are missing.

Methods

We identified 576 individuals with a Salmonella or Campylobacter infection between 2000 and 2009 that were followed by a short postal questionnaire asking for the presence of current symptoms in 2010. In case of agreement (n = 90), an extended postinfectious (PI)-IBS questionnaire was mailed including the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire.

Key Results

A total of 189 patients reported back (36%); 98 had a Salmonella and 91 had a Campylobacter infection, of which 56 reported persistent symptoms (9.7% of the initial sample). Fifty-one patients returned the PI-IBS questionnaire. Of 48 patients with complete data, 15 reported no or mild symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort while 17 had moderate and 16 severe symptoms. Twenty-two met Rome IBS criteria, 14 (29%) reported GI symptoms before the infection. Patients with moderate and/or severe PI-IBS symptoms were significantly more often females, were more often infected by Salmonella than by Campylobacter, had more severe symptoms during the initial infection, and had more often GI symptoms prior to the infection. They reported higher anxiety, depression, and somatisation scores, but were not different with respect to acute stool habits.

Conclusions & Inferences

Nearly 10% of patients with an intestinal bacterial infection report postinfectious symptoms up to 10 years after the infectious event. They represent a clinically important population with high psychiatric comorbidity and somatic symptom burden.

### The current status of enteric fever diagnostics and implications for disease control [^116LoQET]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Enteric (typhoid) fever is a clinical syndrome caused by ingestion of the gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) or Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) A, B, or C. Despite the availability of good antimicrobial treatment regimens and new-generation conjugate vaccines for preventing S. Typhi infection (TCVs), enteric fever continues to cause a significant degree of morbidity and mortality worldwide; current estimates suggest approximately 13.5–26.9 million new cases of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A (the focus of this review) each year. The uncertainty around these estimates is, in part, due to the limitations in availability and performance of current diagnostic tools.

Enteric fever is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical disease, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms, such as fever, malaise, headache, and complications of ileal ulceration including perforation and profuse hemorrhage. Furthermore, some individuals who are exposed to S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi A will go on to become long-term carriers, where the organisms are retained in the gallbladder and occasionally at other sites including the kidney. Why different individuals present with differing clinical symptoms is not understood, but laboratory models and human challenge with virulent organisms have revealed a highly complex natural history of infection resulting from the co-evolution of bacteria with humans. The result is that both S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A are exquisitely adapted to transit almost effortlessly throughout the human body, triggering a cascade of events that result in symptomatic disease in some, and long-term asymptomatic carriage in others. Consequently, diagnosing enteric fever remains an enigma, with symptomatic infections mimicking various aspects of many other infectious diseases. These factors are especially relevant in settings with the limited resources found in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where differential diagnostic tests (many of which have their own inherent limitations) for febrile disease are often not available, and diagnosis is performed purely on the clinical judgment of an attending healthcare worker.

### Preventing foodborne illness… [^114boWeq]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever called salmonellosis. Salmonella can be spread by food handlers who do not wash their hands and/or the surfaces and tools they use between food preparation steps, and when people eat raw or undercooked foods. Salmonella can also spread from animals to people. People who have direct contact with certain animals, including poultry and reptiles, can spread the bacteria from the animals to food if they do not practice proper hand washing hygiene before handling food. Pets can also spread the bacteria within the home environment if they eat food contaminated with Salmonella. Symptoms Most people infected with Salmonella will begin to develop symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness, salmonellosis, usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.

More severe cases of salmonellosis may include a high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, a rash, blood in the urine or stool, and in some cases may become fatal. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that approximately 450 persons in the United States die each year from acute salmonellosis. Due to the range in severity of illness, people should consult their healthcare provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a Salmonella infection. At-Risk Groups Children younger than five, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe salmonellosis infections. Learn more about People at Risk of Foodborne Illness. Foods Linked to U. S. Outbreaks of Salmonellosis Past U. S.

### Salmonellae interactions with host processes [^111f4NT8]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Salmonellae invasion and intracellular replication within host cells result in a range of diseases, including gastroenteritis, bacteraemia, enteric fever and focal infections. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that salmonellae use to alter host cell physiology; through the delivery of effector proteins with specific activities and through the modulation of defence and stress response pathways. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of the complex interplay between bacterial and host factors that leads to inflammation, disease and, in most cases, control of the infection by its animal hosts, with a particular focus on Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. We also highlight gaps in our knowledge of the contributions of salmonellae and the host to disease pathogenesis, and we suggest future avenues for further study.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^112RA991]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To expedite the evaluation of vaccines against paratyphoid fever, we aimed to develop the first human challenge model of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A infection.

Methods

Two groups of 20 participants underwent oral challenge with S. Paratyphi A following sodium bicarbonate pretreatment at 1 of 2 dose levels (group 1: 1–5 × 10³ colony-forming units [CFU] and group 2: 0.5–1 × 10³ CFU). Participants were monitored in an outpatient setting with daily clinical review and collection of blood and stool cultures. Antibiotic treatment was started when prespecified diagnostic criteria were met (temperature ≥ 38°C for ≥ 12 hours and/or bacteremia) or at day 14 postchallenge.

Results

The primary study objective was achieved following challenge with 1–5 × 103 CFU (group 1), which resulted in an attack rate of 12 of 20 (60%). Compared with typhoid challenge, paratyphoid was notable for high rates of subclinical bacteremia (at this dose, 11/20 [55%]). Despite limited symptoms, bacteremia persisted for up to 96 hours after antibiotic treatment (median duration of bacteremia, 53 hours [interquartile range, 24–85 hours]). Shedding of S. Paratyphi A in stool typically preceded onset of bacteremia.

Conclusions

Challenge with S. Paratyphi A at a dose of 1–5 × 103 CFU was well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety profile. The frequency and persistence of bacteremia in the absence of clinical symptoms was notable, and markedly different from that seen in previous typhoid challenge studies. We conclude that the paratyphoid challenge model is suitable for the assessment of vaccine efficacy using endpoints that include bacteremia and/or symptomatology.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^114dxpkZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Forty healthy adult participants were enrolled into the study between 20 May and 20 November 2014 (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 2). Twenty participants were challenged with S. Paratyphi A at a target dose of 1–5 × 10³ CFU (group 1). A second group of 20 participants was challenged at a target dose of 0.5–1.0 × 10³ CFU (group 2).

Table 1.
Participant Demographic Characteristics

Paratyphoid infection was diagnosed in 50% (20/40) of all participants challenged. The primary study objective was achieved in challenge group 1, where 12 of 20 participants met the prespecified diagnostic criteria for paratyphoid fever (attack rate, 60%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 36%–81%) (Figure 1). Eleven participants (11/12 [92%]) in this group were diagnosed following a positive blood culture for S. Paratyphi A and 1 participant was diagnosed based on temperature criteria with subsequent blood culture confirmation. Median time from challenge to initiation of treatment was 6.4 days (range, 5.9–8.3 days) (Table 2).

How is it caused?

Enteric fever encompasses typhoid fever, caused by infection with bacteria Salmonella Typhi (S Typhi), and paratyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A and B. S Typhi is estimated to cause 76% of enteric fever globally. Paratyphoid fever is mostly seen in parts of South Asia and China. Ingestion of food or water contaminated by infected human faeces causes infection.

### Salmonella infections in immunocompromised adults [^113Gmgrz]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical syndromes caused by Salmonella infection in humans are divided into typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, and a range of clinical syndromes, including diarrhoeal disease, caused by a large number of non-typhoidal salmonella serovars (NTS). Typhoid is a human-restricted and highly adapted invasive disease, but shows little association with immunocompromise. In contrast, NTS have a broad vertebrate host range, epidemiology that often involves food animals, and have a dramatically more severe and invasive presentation in immunocompromised adults, in particular in the context of HIV. Immunocompromise among adults, including underlying severe or progressive disease, chronic granulomatous disease, defects or blockade of specific cytokines (particularly IL-12/IL-23/IL-17 and TNF), and HIV, is associated with suppurative foci and with primary bacteraemic disease, which may be recurrent. These patients have markedly increased mortality. Worldwide, invasive recurrent NTS bacteraemia associated with advanced HIV disease is a huge problem, and the epidemiology in this context may be more human-restricted than in other settings. This review will describe the presentation and pathogenesis of NTS in different categories of immunocompromised adults, contrasted to typhoid fever.

### Determinants of persistent Salmonella infections [^116KZRtX]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent bacterial infections constitute an enormous challenge for public health. Amongst infections with other bacteria, infections with typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovars can result in long-term infections of the human and animal host. Persistent infections that are asymptomatic are difficult to identify and thus can serve as a silent reservoir for transmission. Symptomatic persistent infections are often difficult to treat as they harbor a combination of antibiotic-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and boost the spread of genetic antibiotic resistance. In the last couple of years, the field has made some major progress in understanding the role of persisters, their reservoirs as well as their interplay with host factors in persistent Salmonella infections.

### Assessing the use of PCR to screen for shedding of Salmonella enterica in infected humans [^111GRJUr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recovery from enteric bacterial illness often includes a phase of organismal shedding over a period of days to months. The monitoring of this process through laboratory testing forms the foundation of public health action to prevent further transmission. Regulations in most jurisdictions in the United States exclude individuals who continue to shed certain organisms from sensitive occupations and situations, such as food handling, providing direct patient care, or attending day care. The burden that this creates for recovering patients and their families/coworkers is great, so any effort to provide efficiency to the testing process would be of significant benefit.

### Typhoid fever presenting with gastric ulcer bleeding [^116kviQd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Enteric fever is a systemic disease caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi. The bacteria usually invade the small intestinal mucosa, where they infect and multiply via the lymphatic/blood vessels. Typical symptoms include febrile symptom, whole abdominal pain and tenderness, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Most people diagnosed with enteric fever improve a few days after empirical antibiotic treatment. However, some patients develop complications. The complications of enteric fever can affect any organ system. The important gastrointestinal manifestations of enteric fever include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, and acalculous cholecystitis. Intestinal hemorrhage or perforation is the most serious complication of enteric fever. Occurring in 10% of cases, lower gastrointestinal bleeding most commonly affects the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve. Meanwhile, upper gastrointestinal bleeding has rarely been reported. We present a patient with enteric fever, presenting with gastric ulcer hemorrhage, as a rare complication of disease.

### The global burden of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^111EB6Py]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-typhoidal salmonella infections most commonly result in self-limiting diarrhoeal illness with low case fatality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimated that salmonella enterocolitis resulted in 95.1 million cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 41.6–184.8), 50 771 deaths (2824–129 736), and 3.10 million DALYs (0.39–7.39) in 2017. In addition to diarrhoeal disease, non-typhoidal salmonella infections can invade normally sterile sites, resulting in bacteraemia, meningitis, and other focal infections. Referred to as invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease, these infections are not typically associated with diarrhoea but present as non-specific febrile illnesses with symptoms that are clinically indistinguishable from other febrile illnesses, and with higher case fatality than is seen with non-invasive infection. Malnourished infants, elderly people, and individuals with sickle-cell disease, HIV, and acute or recent malaria are at particular risk.,

Invasive disease is seen most commonly in sub-Saharan Africa, where certain non-typhoidal salmonella serovars and sequence types are endemic, including Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 313, Enteritidis ST 11, Dublin, and Isangi. A recently emerged highly invasive S Typhimurium strain, ST 313, has caused large epidemics of non-typhoidal salmonella bacteraemia showing resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, including those recommended as first-line treatment. Similarly, a new variant of multidrug-resistant S Typhimurium, ST 34, has been associated with invasive disease in immunocompromised patients in Vietnam. Antimicrobial-resistant infections are associated with poorer clinical outcomes and higher case fatality. Studies evaluating the proportion of total isolates that are invasive, referred to as the invasiveness index, have identified Salmonella enterica serovars Dublin, Choleraesuis, Heidelberg, and Virchow as the most invasive. Conversely, Salmonella enterica serovar Newport has been associated with a lower risk of bacteraemia than S Typhimurium.

### Pathogen-targeting glycovesicles as a therapy for salmonellosis [^116GqFC5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

As our primary interface with the external environment, the gastrointestinal tract represents a vast mucosal surface area vulnerable to attack by enteropathogens. Salmonellosis, caused by food-borne Salmonellae is one of the most frequently occurring intestinal diseases. Globally, there are ~153 million cases of gastroenteritis and 57,000 deaths each year.

The typical symptoms of salmonellosis, involving stomach cramps, nausea, and acute diarrhea, appear ~6–72 h after consumption of contaminated food or water. This illness usually lasts 4–7 days, and most people recover without treatment. Current recommendations are to treat most patients with this illness with oral rehydration therapy but not with antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial therapy should be considered for patients who are severely ill (for example, those with severe diarrhea, high fever, or manifestations of extraintestinal infection) and for people at increased risk of invasive disease (infants, older adults, and the debilitated or immunosuppressed.

Antimicrobial therapy of salmonellosis is known to be associated with prolonged fecal carriage, without reducing symptom duration or severity, and may even increase the rates of long-term shedding of pathogens. Systemically absorbed antibiotics such as quinolones and sulfonamides are readily taken up into the bloodstream if given orally, which makes them difficult to retain high concentrations at the site of enteric infections. Poorly absorbed oral antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and β-lactam families allow localized enteric targeting of pathogens. However, these antibiotics alter the balance of gut flora, leading to a possible overgrowth of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria.

To overcome the inherent defects of antimicrobial therapy in patients with salmonellosis, here we introduce a versatile vesicle-based system for delivering antibiotics to target the illness-causative agent, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium selectively. This study might open up an avenue to develop pathogen-targeting antimicrobial glycovesicles to resolve enteric infections with a minimal risk of adverse outcomes.

### Complications and mortality of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^111CSxXW]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, we showed that a considerable proportion of patients with non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease have related complications and death. Prompt diagnosis and management, including consideration of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease in the empirical management of severe febrile illness and sepsis in endemic areas, is warranted to improve clinical outcomes. The findings of our systematic review are available to further refine burden of disease estimates for non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, the results of which inform investments in the development and deployment of vaccine and non-vaccine interventions to prevent non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease. Standardisation of definitions and reporting of complications would reduce the risk of bias of future reviews. Additional high-quality research relevant to non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease burden, including CFR, duration of illness and complications, disability weights, the effect of antimicrobial resistance on outcomes, and host risk factors, especially in regions with scarce data, are needed to better inform investments and decisions on vaccine development and deployment, as well as non-vaccine interventions.

### Enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever [^113nnopJ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Enteric fever, caused by the human-restricted bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (typhoid) and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, B, and C (paratyphoid), affects persons residing in, or travelling from, areas lacking safe water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. Transmission is by the faecal-oral route. A gradual fever onset over 3–7 days with malaise, headache, and myalgia is typical. Symptoms can be altered by previous antimicrobial use. Life-threatening complications can arise in the second week of untreated illness. Differentiation from other febrile illnesses is challenging. Blood or bone marrow culture remain reference standard diagnostic methods, despite the low sensitivity of blood culture. Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin (excepting cases originating in south Asia due to drug resistance), or ceftriaxone are recommended treatment options for both typhoid and paratyphoid; however, choice should be guided by local resistance patterns. Ciprofloxacin-resistant and ceftriaxone-resistant typhoid is common in Pakistan. Three vaccine types are available for prevention of typhoid disease, including the newer, more effective typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccines. Vaccination as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene measures are cornerstones of prevention.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^112Ydeug]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common pancreatic disorder in children, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. Recent studies have estimated the incidence of AP in children to be approximately 1/10,000 children per year, an incidence approaching that in adult patients.

At present, there are no evidence-based diagnostic guidelines for the diagnosis of AP in children. The expert definition of pediatric AP from the International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis (INSPPIRE) is modeled after the Atlanta classification in adult patients. As per INSPPIRE criteria, a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of the following:
Abdominal pain compatible with acute pancreatitis
Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal
Imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis

In children, blunt abdominal injuries, multisystem disease, biliary stones or microlithiasis, and drug toxicity are the most common contributing factors of AP. The severity of AP is highly variable, with most patients recovering spontaneously with supportive treatment only. Further, it is not uncommon for AP to lead to death if left untreated.

AP complicating Salmonella gastroenteritis is a rare complication among the pediatric population. This complication has been reported in adult patients with typhoid fever and nontyphoid Salmonella infection, but there are few reported cases in the pediatric population. Herein, we report a case of AP complicating Salmonella gastroenteritis infection in an immunocompetent child.

### Typhoid fever [^117AtLJJ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Control of typhoid fever relies on clinical information, diagnosis, and an understanding for the epidemiology of the disease. Despite the breadth of work done so far, much is not known about the biology of this human-adapted bacterial pathogen and the complexity of the disease in endemic areas, especially those in Africa. The main barriers to control are vaccines that are not immunogenic in very young children and the development of multidrug resistance, which threatens efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy. Clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists worldwide need to be familiar with shifting trends in enteric fever. This knowledge is crucial, both to control the disease and to manage cases. Additionally, salmonella serovars that cause human infection can change over time and location. In areas of Asia, multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi) has been the main cause of enteric fever, but now S Typhi is being displaced by infections with drug-resistant S enterica serovar Paratyphi A. New conjugate vaccines are imminent and new treatments have been promised, but the engagement of local medical and public health institutions in endemic areas is needed to allow surveillance and to implement control measures.

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### Enteric fever in Cambodia: community perceptions and practices concerning disease transmission and treatment [^116Dzm5h]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) and Paratyphi (Salmonella Paratyphi) A, B, and C are bacteria that cause typhoid and paratyphoid fever, respectively (also jointly referred to as "enteric fever"). Humans are the only host to these bacteria and the central mechanism by which the disease is transmitted is fecal shedding of the bacterium after infection, also known as carriage. Carriage is asymptomatic and can be either temporary (through intestinal lesions) or chronic (through gallbladder colonization). In countries with poor sanitation and food hygiene, the bacteria can contaminate water and food items. When a sufficient number of bacteria are ingested, they reach and invade the small intestine and eventually the blood circulation. At this stage, patients typically experience persistent fever and other nonspecific symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by culturing the causative bacterium from blood, which requires microbiology laboratories that are often absent in endemic settings. In addition, the sensitivity of blood cultures is poor (40–80%) and diagnosis can take up to 2–3 days. Often, health-care workers will resort to clinically unreliable but faster and cheaper alternative diagnostic methods (e.g. Widal test that detects Salmonella antibodies in blood). Confirmed cases, therefore, represent only a small proportion of the total affected population.

### Enteric fever [^111tdbZg]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

How do patients present?

Patients present with a gradual onset of fever which typically rises to a plateau of 39–40°C (102–104°F) towards the end of a week. This slow rise in fever contrasts with the intermittent high fever and rigors seen in malaria.

Abdominal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common as per a systematic review on clinical profile of enteric fever (see supplementary table 1 on bmj.com). Abdominal pain is diffuse and poorly localised but occasionally intense in the right iliac fossa, mimicking appendicitis. Patients may also have headache, cough, and malaise. Children under 5 years old frequently present with only fever, and the diagnosis may be missed unless they have complications.

Symptoms start 7–14 days after exposure (range 3–60 days). Paratyphoid fever has a shorter incubation period (4–5 days), but symptoms are indistinguishable from those of typhoid fever.

### Limited impact of Salmonella stress and persisters on antibiotic clearance [^1125Jd54]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

In contrast to our findings, it has been reported that infected macrophages trigger Salmonella to express toxin–antitoxin modules that arrest growth in a subset of Salmonella. These non-replicating persisters maintain an active type 3 secretion system 2 (T3SS-2) which is essential for their survivaland are proposed to cause eradication failures in infected mice receiving daily 300 mg kg⁻¹ enrofloxacin (30- to 60-fold more than recommended) for 5 days, starting one day after infection — before disease symptoms appear, which does not reflect typical clinical scenarios (Supplementary Note 8). Some of these data have been difficult to replicate, the role of non-mutated toxin–antitoxin modules for persister formation is debatable, (Fig. 1c, d), Salmonella does not require T3SS-2 for antibiotic survival in mice, and the evidence for any Salmonella surviving such excessive enrofloxacin doses is questionable, (Supplementary Note 8). Notably, macrophages do not induce a distinct subset of non-replicating Salmonella when infected with homogeneously growing Salmonella in vivo or in vitro (using Salmonella cultured under T3SS-2-inducing conditions to simulate ongoing intracellular replication while preventing rapid macrophage pyroptosis). A distinct subset of non-replicating intracellular bacteria, largely incapable of resuming growth after being released from host cells, only emerges when macrophages are infected with stationary-phase Salmonella cultures. Stationary cultures are highly heterogeneous, and macrophages may solely amplify this pre-existing heterogeneity. In mice, non-replicating Salmonella are observed in the first two days following infection with 2 × 10¹⁰ Salmonella, a dose > 10⁷ times higher than typically encountered in natural human infections(Supplementary Note 8). Under more clinically relevant infection and treatment conditions, non-replicating Salmonella are rare and have no detectable role in eradication failures. Instead, slow bacterial clearance results from slowly replicating Salmonella, which respond poorly to antibiotic treatment.

### An appraisal of the clinical features of pediatric enteric fever: systematic review and meta-analysis of the age-stratified disease occurrence [^112u1zrF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND COMPLICATIONS

The clinical features of pediatric enteric fever are nonspecific and overlap with a variety of infective etiologies in endemic settings. The proportion of cases clinical suspected with enteric fever may be as low as 4% at initial presentation in ultimately blood culture–confirmed cases in children. Clinical features, complications, and outcomes differ between adults and children; even among children, differences exist between infants and older children as well as between children in Africa and Asia. A recent systematic review of clinical and laboratory features of enteric fever indicated that the risk of mortality from enteric fever is 4 times higher in children < 5 years compared with those > 5 years of age.

Generalized Systemic Features

A typical febrile response usually occurs between 5 and 15 days after exposure to the organism as demonstrated in the challenge model in adult subjects. Evidence from a recently published systematic review reported that fever is a consistent feature of pediatric enteric fever, in 97%–100% of cases, not uncommonly being the sole manifestation, presenting as a fever of unknown origin with inconclusive laboratory results. Conversely, younger children with enteric fever may sometimes present with hypothermia [Supplementary Reference 41]. The widespread and poorly regulated use of antibiotics and antipyretics in low- to middle-income country settings not only confounds the clinical picture but also serves for the origin and propagation of MDR strains of Salmonella. If untreated, the febrile response reaches its peak in the second week of illness in a characteristic "stepladder" pattern [Supplementary Reference 42]. Chills and rigors are 4 times more common in adults than in children. Relative bradycardia, a classical finding in enteric fever, is identifiable in 11%–30% of children [Supplementary References 43–47] and appears to be 15 times more likely to occur in African children than the children in Asia.

### Salmonella enteritidis induced myocarditis in a 16-year-old girl [^112KzWbr]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis typically presents with non-specific clinical symptoms, and can easily be missed in the absence of a high index of clinical suspicion. Myocarditis caused by bacterial pathogens is rare in immunocompetent individuals, more commonly seen following viral infection. Although more classically associated with typhoid fever and gastroenteritis, Salmonella species are a rare cause of myocarditis. We report a case of Salmonella enteritidis-induced myocarditis after gastrointestinal infection in a 16 year-old girl, and discuss the diagnostic tools currently utilised to ascertain the diagnosis.

### Salmonella enterica serovar agbeni, British columbia, Canada, 2011 [^113a2Zhg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Agbeni is rare. In Canada, it was reported 8 times during 2000–2010 and never in the province of British Columbia (2011 population 4.5 million) (Public Health Agency of Canada, unpub. data). In June 2011, an outbreak of S. enterica ser. Agbeni affecting 8 persons was identified in British Columbia; pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns for all isolates were identical. Although no specific source was identified, 2 features were noted: 1) diagnosis through urine specimens for 3 of 8 persons and 2) a longer than typical incubation period for Salmonella spp. infection.

In British Columbia, public health authorities interview all reported Salmonella spp.–infected persons by using a standard questionnaire to collect information about potential exposures during the 3 days before date of illness onset. Seven of the ill persons in British Columbia had attended the same wedding on May 14, 2011, which was outside the 3-day period about which they were asked. The person with the earliest reported case (May 16) was not associated with the wedding or with the other ill persons.

We reviewed wedding food sources and preparation. The 7 persons with wedding-associated illness were reinterviewed by using a menu-specific questionnaire; no obvious food source was implicated. The first wedding guest to be reported with enteric symptoms was visiting from outside British Columbia and had assisted with food preparation. In April and May 2011, five persons from the same jurisdiction outside British Columbia in which this wedding guest resided were identified with S. enterica ser. Agbeni infection; isolates from these persons had the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern as those in British Columbia. Also, the ill person who was not associated with the wedding had traveled to that same jurisdiction before onset of symptoms. The original source of infection was probably outside of British Columbia.

Average age of the 8 ill persons was 52.8 years (range 21–82 years). Six were men. One person reported hospital admission. No underlying conditions were documented in any of the 8 ill persons.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^114SArro]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Giardia sp. norovirus, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. are predominant etiological agents of infectious gastroenteritis in individuals with CVID. Symptoms are typically nonspecific and vary from self‐limiting to chronic or refractory gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, and weight loss. A favourable correlation exists between Giardia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter infections in CVID patients exhibiting undetectable serum IgA levels, which is expected considering the recognized function of IgA in mucosal immunity. Norovirus and cytomegalovirus infections seldom possess clinical relevance in immunocompetent individuals; nonetheless, their sequelae might be severe in cases of CVID.

Norovirus gastroenteritis is a predominant cause of gastroenteritis globally. Its prevalence has been determined to be 7% among CVID patients. Norovirus impacts 19% of the global population; however, it has been detected in up to 100% of individuals with CVID enteropathy. Chronic norovirus infections have been recognized as a cause of CVID enteropathy. Consequently, individuals with CVID and concomitant norovirus infections must be actively followed for symptom remission, and alternate treatments should be contemplated if infections persist.

However, currently, there is no established conventional therapy for chronic norovirus infection resulting in CVID enteropathy. In the absence of systematic comprehensive studies, we must depend solely on case reports. We recently diagnosed and successfully treated a patient with CVID‐associated enteropathy related to chronic norovirus infection, which constitutes the central focus of this review. Our objective is to provide a concise overview of this distinct form of primary immunodeficiency, drawing on the current — albeit still incomplete — body of knowledge.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Treating salmonellosis — duration and secondary prophylaxis: For gastroenteritis without bacteremia, if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm³: 7–14 days (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³ particularly if primary illness was severe: 2–6 weeks (BIII). For gastroenteritis with bacteremia, if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm³: 14 days; longer duration if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³: 2–6 weeks (BIII). The role of long-term, secondary prophylaxis for patients with recurrent bacteremia or gastroenteritis is not well established and clinicians must weigh the benefit against the risks of long-term antibiotic exposure (BIII). Suppression of HIV replication with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expected to decrease the risk of recurrent illnesses, and clinicians should be aware that recurrence may represent development of antimicrobial resistance during therapy. Some experts recommend secondary prophylaxis for patients with recurrent bacteremia, or patients with recurrent gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³ and severe diarrhea (CIII). When to stop secondary prophylaxis is listed as after resolution of Salmonella infection and response to ART with sustained viral suppression and CD4 count > 200 cells/mm³ (CII).

### Antimicrobials for treating symptomatic non-typhoidal Salmonella infection [^116z77NH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) commonly causes diarrhoea, and is usually self-limiting, although sometimes people become ill with sepsis and dehydration. Routine antibiotic use for this infection could result in persistent colonization and the spread of resistant bacterial strains.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of giving antibiotics to people with NTS diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (up to August 2012), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (up to Issue 8 2012); and MEDLINE, African Index Medicus, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Science Citation Index, all up to 6 August 2012. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for both completed and on going trials and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic treatment for diarrhoea caused by NTS species with placebo or no antibiotic treatment. We selected trials that included people of all ages who were symptomatic for NTS infection. Examples of symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. We excluded trials where the outcomes were not reported separately for the NTS subgroup of patients. Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria prior to study inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on pre-specified outcomes and independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the presence of diarrhoea between two to four days after treatment. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methods.

Main Results

Twelve trials involving 767 participants were included. No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants; very low quality evidence). No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhoea at five to seven days after treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; two trials, 192 participants; very low quality evidence), clinical failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.25; seven trials, 440 participants; very low quality evidence). The mean difference for diarrhoea was 0 days (95% CI -0.54 to 0.54; 202 participants, four studies; low quality evidence); for fever was 0.27 days (95% CI -0.11 to 0.65; 107 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence); and for duration of illness was 0 days (95% CI -0.68 to 0.68; 116 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence). Quinolone antibiotic treatment resulted in a significantly higher number of negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week of treatment (microbiological failure: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.56; 166 participants, four trials). Antibiotic treatment meant passage of the same Salmonella serovar one month after treatment was almost twice as likely (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.98; 112 participants, three trials), which was statistically significant. Non-severe adverse drug reactions were more common among the patients who received antibiotic treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in NTS diarrhoea in otherwise healthy people. We are uncertain of the effects in very young people, very old people, and in people with severe and extraintestinal disease. A slightly higher number of adverse events were noted in people who received antibiotic treatment for NTS.

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a call to action [^1112m4kc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

THE DISEASE AND PATHOGENESIS

Typhoid fever is caused by infection with S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhi (S. Typhi), a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus. Paratyphoid fever results from infection with the related organism S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar paratyphi (S. Paratyphi), which is divided into three subtypes – S. Paratyphi A, B, and C. S. Typhi and Paratyphi are collectively referred to as typhoidal Salmonella serovars and infection with either can result in the clinical syndrome of enteric fever. Unlike other S. enterica serovars, S. Typhi, and Paratyphi are human-restricted pathogens that cause a systemic illness progressing to an asymptomatic chronic carrier state in some individuals.

Transmission of S. Typhi and Paratyphi occurs through consumption of contaminated food or water via short-cycle or long-cycle transmission. Short-cycle transmission is defined as the contamination of food and water in the immediate environment through inadequate hygiene and sanitation measures, either by shedding from acute or chronic carriers. Long-cycle transmission is defined as contamination of the broader environment, such as pollution of water supplies by sewage, or inadequate treatment of piped water. The relative contribution of each transmission mode may vary depending on the epidemiological context and may differ between S. Typhi and Paratyphi.

The clinical presentation of typhoid fever is highly variable, ranging from a mild-illness characterized by low-grade fever and malaise, through to a severe life-threatening systemic illness with multiple complications, including intestinal perforation, intestinal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy. Ingestion of bacteria and systemic invasion is followed by a short-lived period of asymptomatic primary bacteraemia. The incubation period, typically lasts 7–14 days, but can range from 3 to 60 days dependent, in part, on the size of the inoculum. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and include fever, malaise, anorexia, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and dry cough. Sporadic, asymptomatic, shedding of the bacteria in the stool can occur prior to the development of symptomatic disease. Clinical signs may include high fever, relative bradycardia, abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or rose-spots. S. Paratyphi may cause a milder disease than S. Typhi, although field data from the largest case series to-date, comprising 609 enteric fever patients in Nepal suggest that both serovars cause an indistinguishable clinical syndrome.

### Salmonella newport causing osteomyelitis in a patient with diabetes [^116bEf9n]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Salmonella is a foodborne pathogen that commonly causes intestinal symptoms. Bacteraemia and extraintestinal infections have been documented within the literature, and are more frequently associated with immunodeficiency and general debilitation. We discuss the case of a previously well 36-year-old man who presented with a septic knee and new-onset diabetes. Imaging confirmed osteomyelitis and a Brodie's abscess, with blood and tissue cultures revealing the isolate Salmonella enterica newport. He denied any previous gastrointestinal symptoms, recent travel, change in usual dietary habit or symptoms of diabetes. So far there have only been three reported cases of S. newport causing osteomyelitis. We discuss the incidence of Salmonella infections, including extraintestinal symptoms, its relation to immunodeficiency and the disease burden of S. newport.

### Clinical overview of salmonellosis | Salmonella infection… [^116miyKV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most patients with Salmonelladiarrheal illness require only supportive care.
- Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated.
- Antibiotic treatment should be considered only for certain patients.
- CDC has additional recommendations for managing patients with known or suspected multidrug-resistant SalmonellaNewport infection after travel to or from Mexico. Clinical features Symptoms of acute gastroenteritis due to infection with Salmonella can include:

- Sudden onset of diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps
- Fever usually present
- Nausea, vomiting, and headache may occur, though less frequent Diarrhea may last for several days and lead to potentially severe dehydration, especially young children and older adults. Even after clinical symptoms are no longer obvious, Salmonella may be found in stool for several weeks.

Diarrhea lasting more than 7 days Most people recover completely within a week, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. Less commonly, patients might have diarrhea lasting weeks or months or have periods of relief followed by relapse. Extra-intestinal infection Sometimes, Salmonella infection spreads to urine, blood, bones, or other internal organs, causing symptoms related to that body part or system. Some of these extra-intestinal infections can have long-term effects, depending on which part of the body is infected. Invasive infections
- Meningitis
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic arthritis
- Bacteremia. Reactive arthritis Some people with Salmonella infection develop pain in their joints called reactive arthritis. This condition can last for months or years and can lead to chronic arthritis. People with reactive arthritis may also have irritated eyes and pain while urinating. Reactive arthritis following a Salmonella infection is most common among people who are 15–35 years.

### Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease: an emerging and neglected tropical disease in Africa [^111U8KDS]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The bacterial genus Salmonella causes a huge global burden of morbidity and mortality. With regard to human disease, salmonellae are divided into typhoidal serotypes (Salmonella enterica var Typhi [S Typhi] and Salmonella enterica var Paratyphi A [S Paratyphi A]) and thousands of non-typhoidal salmonella serotypes (frequently referred to as NTS serotypes; panel). In high-income countries, non-typhoidal salmonellae predominantly cause a self-limiting diarrhoeal illness in healthy individuals; bloodstream or focal infection is rareand mainly happens in individuals with specific risk factors. By contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, non-typhoidal salmonellae are consistently the most common bacterial bloodstream isolates in both adults and children presenting with fever, and are associated with a case fatality of 20–25%. Evidence from epidemiological studies; whole-genome sequencing of the pathogen; and discoveries about host immunity at the cellular, humoral, and mucosal level are helping to create a coherent picture of an emerging pathogen with a new pathogenesis. We will set these new findings in the context of what is known from other presentations of salmonella disease, and will discuss the similarities to and contrasts with typhoid fever.

Panel
Salmonella nomenclature

The genus Salmonella consists of rod-shaped, Gram-negative, flagellated facultative anaerobes, and belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Two species exist, Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori; all medically important salmonellae are included in the former, and are divided into more than 2500 serotypes on the basis of surface antigens, by use of a scheme initially devised by Kauffman. Serotypes have traditionally been named either for the syndrome they were thought to cause (eg, Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium [S Typhimurium] was thought to cause a typhoid-like syndrome in mice) or for the location of their discovery (eg, Salmonella enterica var Panama [S Panama]).

Salmonellae causing human disease are traditionally divided into a small number of human-restricted invasive typhoidal serotypes (eg, Salmonella enterica var Typhi [S Typhi] and Salmonella enterica var Paratyphi A [S Paratyphi A]) and thousands of non-typhoidal salmonella serotypes [commonly known as NTS serotypes]), which typically have a broad vertebrate host range and cause various presentations that usually include diarrhoeal disease.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^113tX9ky]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Salmonella infection presents itself in a wide variety of ways, ranging from mild self-limited illness to severe systemic disease with multiorgan involvement. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a very rare complication that is associated with Salmonella infection, especially among the pediatric population.

Case Presentation

A five-year-old boy presented with a two-day fever and experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The boy was admitted as a case of acute gastroenteritis, and Salmonella was found in his stool culture. The severity of his abdominal pain during his hospital stay indicated the possibility of AP. A clinical examination and blood workup were performed and showed significant elevation in amylase and lipase, which confirmed the diagnosis of AP.

Conclusion

Although abdominal pain is a common presentation of Salmonella infection, the possibility of AP must be considered when the pain is severe and the characteristics of the pain are suggestive of AP. Herein, we report a case of AP complicating Salmonella infection in an immunocompetent child.

### Progress in typhoid fever epidemiology [^114hcrot]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CHAIN OF INFECTION

Reservoir

Humans are the reservoir (defined as the habitat in which the agent normally lives, grows, and multiplies) of Salmonella Typhi. Salmonella Typhi has limited capacity to multiply outside of the human host, but it may survive for extended periods in the environment. Acute Salmonella Typhi infection presents as typhoid fever. Typhoid fever may be difficult to distinguish clinically from other febrile illnesses. If untreated, intestinal, neuropsychiatric, and other complications develop in some patients. However, acute infection can also be mild and self-limited. Human challenge studies demonstrate that fecal shedding and even bacteremia may occur in the absence of clinical signs of typhoid fever.

Portal of Exit, Route of Infection, and Source

Feces represent the major portal of exit of Salmonella Typhi, although shedding in urine has also been documented. Salmonella Typhi may be shed in the stool or urine during and following both clinical and subclinical acute infection. Shedding may be temporary or chronic. Temporary shedding may be acute or convalescent. A convalescent carrier sheds Salmonella Typhi for ≥ 3–12 months after the onset of acute illness. A chronic carrier sheds typhoid bacilli for > 12 months after onset of acute illness. Practically speaking, a chronic carrier may be defined as someone with no history of typhoid fever or someone who had the disease > 1 year previously, who has fecal or urine cultures positive for Salmonella Typhi separated by at least 48 hours. The relative contribution of temporary shedding versus shedding from chronic carriers to new infections remains an unanswered yet critical question for typhoid control and elimination. Chronic carriers are known to be a major source of domestically acquired Salmonella Typhi infections in countries with low typhoid incidence. However, "Typhoid Mary" has assumed a place in both popular and medical consciousness that belies the potentially greater contribution to transmission of temporary shedding in settings of high typhoid incidence. Salmonella Typhi transmission is by the fecal–oral route. Water and food contaminated by human feces are the major sources (defined as the places from which the agent is transferred to a host) of Salmonella Typhi. The human reservoir is considered to occasionally be the source of Salmonella Typhi, and ingestion of human feces during oral–anal sex has been implicated.

### Diagnostic value of clinical features to distinguish enteric fever from other febrile illnesses in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan [^114MZMja]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Enteric fever, a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, frequently presents as a nonlocalizing febrile illness that is difficult to distinguish from other infectious causes of fever. Blood culture is not widely available in endemic settings and, even when available, results can take up to 5 days. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of clinical features, including both reported symptoms and clinical signs, of enteric fever among patients participating in the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), a 3-year surveillance study in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.

Methods

Outpatients presenting with ≥ 3 consecutive days of reported fever and inpatients with clinically suspected enteric fever from all 6 SEAP study hospitals were eligible to participate. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of select clinical features against blood culture results among outpatients using mixed-effect regression models with a random effect for study site hospital. We also compared the clinical features of S. Typhi to S. Paratyphi A among both outpatients and inpatients.

Results

We enrolled 20899 outpatients, of whom 2116 (10.1%) had positive blood cultures for S. Typhi and 297 (1.4%) had positive cultures for S. Paratyphi A. The sensitivity of absence of cough was the highest among all evaluated features, at 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.0–74.7), followed by measured fever at presentation at 59.0% (95% CI, 51.6–65.9) and being unable to complete normal activities for 3 or more days at 51.0% (95% CI, 23.8–77.6). A combined case definition of 3 or more consecutive days of reported fever and 1 or more of the following (a) either the absence of cough, (b) fever at presentation, or (c) 3 or more consecutive days of being unable to conduct usual activity — yielded a sensitivity of 94.6% (95% CI, 93.4–95.5) and specificity of 13.6% (95% CI, 9.8–17.5).

Conclusions

Clinical features do not accurately distinguish blood culture-confirmed enteric fever from other febrile syndromes. Rapid, affordable, and accurate diagnostics are urgently needed, particularly in settings with limited or no blood culture capacity.

### Current perspectives on invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease [^1113o1Q4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella senterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and the various pathovars ofs S. Paratyphi are commonly re-ferred to as typhoidal Salmonella serovars. These agents are restricted to human hosts. Salmonella serovars that fall outside of this group are typically referred to as the nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars and are considered to have the potential to interact with human and nonhuman hosts. Poor access to improved water supplies and adequate sanitation facilities, combined with growing urbanization, favor the transmission of NTS serovars through food or water sources and contact with animals. In addition to animal reservoirs, humans may be a growing substantial secondary pathogen reservoir. Typical NTS disease in immunocompetent hosts manifests as a mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis. In contrast, invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease commonly presents as a febrile bacteremia, which can be fatal if left untreated. Invasive NTS disease is associated with the extremes of age, malnutrition, clinical malaria, and HIV infections, especially in Africa. In this study, we review available literature published from 2015 to present on the global burden of iNTS disease, host risk factors, and the implications of these data for vaccination.

KEY POINTS

- Global estimates suggest 3.4 million iNTS illnesses and
618 316 iNTS diseaserelated deaths per year.
- The most common iNTS serovars are S. Enteritidis,
S. Dublin, S. Typhimurium; of particular concern is the
sS. Typhimurium ST313 variant.
- Bivalent S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium vaccines may decrease the global disease burden dramatically.

### Timeliness of enteric disease surveillance in 6 US States [^111isNXq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Table 1
Median number of days from onset of symptoms to specified timeline event for reported Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections, 6 US states, 2002

*PFGE, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.

A higher percentage of isolates were submitted to the public health laboratory in states where submission was required (98% for Salmonella spp. isolates, 100% for E. coli O157:H7) compared to states where submission was not required (75% for Salmonella spp. isolates, 80% for E. coli O157:H7). However, no difference was found between these states in length of time for isolates to be submitted.

Of 112 confirmed foodborne disease outbreaks, 83 (74%) had an etiologic agent confirmed by laboratory testing (Table 2). Of 29 outbreaks that were not confirmed, norovirus was the suspected cause in 17 (59%) outbreaks, and toxigenic bacteria were suspected in 7 (24%) outbreaks. Median intervals from onset of symptoms to outbreak complaint or recognition were 1 day for bacterial toxins, 3 days for norovirus, 8 days for E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter spp. and 16 days for Salmonella spp. (Table 2). Overall, 83 (74%) outbreaks were detected by a consumer complaint, 12 (11%) were detected by a healthcare provider, 11 (10%) were detected by PFGE cluster evaluation, and 6 (5%) were identified through an interview with an individual case-patient. Intervals from onset of symptoms to consumer complaint (median 3 days, range 0–21 days) or to report by healthcare provider (median 3 days, range 0–11 days) were similar. Outbreaks identified by case interview (median 11 days, range 6–16 days) or PFGE cluster evaluation (median 23 days, range 7–83 days) followed case surveillance timelines described above. The median interval from detection of the outbreak to the initiation of the first outbreak investigation step was 0 days (range 0–41 days) for all outbreaks.

### An evaluation of enteropathogen-specific disease severity and duration in children with acute gastroenteritis [^113hF6m3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Our primary objectives were to describe pathogen-specific symptom severity and duration in a prospective cohort study of children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Our secondary objective was to quantify health care resource utilization.

Methods

This secondary analysis of 2 trials included children aged 3 to 48 months with AGE. Children were eligible if they had ≥ 3 watery stools in the preceding 24 hours and were brought to the Emergency Department. Disease severity was quantified by frequency and duration of vomiting and diarrhea, and the Modified Vesikari Scale score. We used descriptive statistics to summarize severity and regression models to identify associations between pathogen type and outcomes.

Results

In total, 1565 trial participants had pathogen testing performed and completed follow-up. Viral pathogens were identified in 47.9% (749/1565) and bacterial pathogens in 5.9% (92/1565). Norovirus (322/1565; 20.6%) was the most frequently identified pathogen. Diarrhea duration was greatest (median 160h, IQR: 98, 216) for children with Salmonella. Vomiting (aOR: 11.02; 95% CI: 7.47, 16.26) occurred more commonly in children with viruses compared with bacteria. The mean duration of diarrhea was shorter for viruses compared with bacteria (aIRR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.96). Mean MVS scores were higher in children with viruses compared with those with bacteria (coefficient: 1.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 2.82).

Conclusions

We describe the clinical course of viral and bacterial pathogens. Although statistically significant, differences in symptom severity across pathogens were not clinically meaningful for distinguishing between them based on symptoms alone.

### Nontyphoidal salmonellosis [^114Kk3cp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Nontyphoidal Salmonella are important foodborne pathogens that cause gastroenteritis, bacteremia, and subsequent focal infection. These hardy bacteria are especially problematic in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including (but not limited to) patients with malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus, or diabetes, and those receiving corticosteroid therapy or treatment with other immunotherapy agents. Endovascular infection and deep bone or visceral abscesses are important complications that may be difficult to treat. The site of infection and the individual's immune status influence treatment choices. The harbingers of resistance of nontyphoidal Salmonella to both fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been reported recently, and such resistance is likely to be a therapeutic problem in the future. The current report presents a brief overview of the problems and trends associated with salmonellosis that are of interest to the infectious diseases clinician.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116Qoiew]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute severe inflammatory diarrhea in adults — several RCTs of empiric antimicrobial treatment have demonstrated an average of 1 day shorter symptoms compared with placebo, but these data are considered low quality; the largest treatment effect was seen in salmonellosis followed by campylobacteriosis, yet antimicrobial treatment also was accompanied by increased prolonged Salmonella shedding and occasional shedding of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter; the benefit of antimicrobial treatment of proven Campylobacter infection is small and antimicrobial agents are not recommended for most cases of proven Salmonella diarrhea; given that most inflammatory infectious diarrhea episodes are self-limited and the treatment benefit is modest, in most cases the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits, with exceptions in severe infections and in immunocompromised hosts.

### Presentation of interleukin-12 /-23 receptor beta1 deficiency with various clinical symptoms of Salmonella infections [^112auJ4H]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical disease caused by weakly pathogenic mycobacterial species, Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and non-tuberculous environmental mycobacteria (EM), which is known as Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), is a rare entity defined recently. Infections with the more virulent Mycobacterium species, M. tuberculosis, may have largely gone unnoticed in these patients due to early death. Mutations in five proteins (IFNgammaR1, IFNgammaR2, IL-12/IL-23Rbeta1, IL-12/IL-23p40 and STAT1) have been found in MSMD. These patients are prone to surprisingly few other infectious diseases mainly to salmonellosis. Here we present three IL-12/IL-23Rbeta1 deficient patients from three different families and with different genetic mutations, who presented exclusively with Salmonella infections. Bacteremia and lymph node involvement were common clinical expressions. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis developed in one of these patients. Two patients were not inoculated with BCG, the third patient did not develop BCG infection although BCG vaccine had been given twice at ages of 1 and 7 years. All three patients responded well to antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, patients with chronic, recurrent or complicated Salmonella infections should be screened for MSMD, particularly for IL-12/IL-23p40/IL-12R/-23Rbeta1 deficiency. Conversely, in patients with genetic IL-12/-23Rbeta1 deficiency a full evaluation for Salmonella infection is required. IL-12/IL-23p40/IL-12R/IL-23Rbeta1 deficiency seem to be underdiagnosed in patients with salmonellosis, and since such patients need prolonged therapy, diagnosis is important.

### From bench to bedside: stealth of enteroinvasive pathogens [^112sbdrW]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2008). Medium credibility.

Bacterial enteric infections are often associated with diarrhoea or vomiting, which are clinical presentations commonly referred to as gastroenteritis. However, some enteric pathogens, including typhoidal Salmonella serotypes, Brucella species and enteropathogenic Yersinia species are associated with a clinical syndrome that is characterized by abdominal pain and/or fever and is distinct from acute gastroenteritis. Recent insights into molecular mechanisms of the host-pathogen interaction show that these enteric pathogens share important characteristics that explain why the initial host responses associated with these agents more closely resemble host responses to viral or parasitic infections. Host responses contribute to the clinical presentation of disease and improved understanding of these responses in the laboratory is beginning to bridge the gap between bench and bedside.

### Serovar Panama, an understudied serovar responsible for extraintestinal salmonellosis worldwide [^113eeKA9]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonellosis is a disease caused by the enteric pathogen, a species that includes 2,637 different serovars. The various clinical presentations of Salmonella disease in humans include enteric fever, gastroenteritis, extraintestinal complications, and a chronic carrier state. The clinical manifestation of Salmonella is dependent on a number of features, including host immune status (reviewed in reference), as well as factors specific to the Salmonella pathovariant that is causing the infection. Certain pathogen factors are associated with clinical presentation, including serovar and certain core and accessory genome components, such as the presence of plasmids, prophages, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes. In this review, we focus onserovar Panama, which has a strong association with invasive disease and is a rarely discussed serovar that has global public health relevance. We review the global epidemiology, as well as the clinical picture, the transmission vehicles, and antimicrobial resistance, and put them into the context of our current genomic understanding.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^114ckcP7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The patient's clinical response was excellent. Whether the patient's improvement was due to antibiotics or supportive management for AP is unknown. Thus, whether Salmonella can lead to clinically evident pancreatitis remains unclear, and further studies must be done to answer this question. In this case, abdominal CT was the diagnostic imaging method of choice and it is a superior test compared to abdominal US that might have solved the confusion, but unfortunately, it was not done, as the family refused any further imaging.

In conclusion, although AP is a rare complication of Salmonella infection in the pediatric population, general pediatricians should entertain, the possibility of AP when patient presents with severe abdominal pain mimicking the characteristics of the pain associated with AP. Early screening and intervention will lead to better outcomes by decreasing the mortality and morbidity rates associated with Salmonella infection.

### Salmonella, the host and its microbiota [^113nmGPx]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The intestine is host to a diverse bacterial community whose structure, at the phylum level, is maintained through unknown mechanisms. Acute inflammation triggered by enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), is accompanied by changes in the bacterial community structure marked by an outgrowth of the pathogen. Recent studies show that S. Typhimurium can harness benefit from the host response to edge out the beneficial bacterial species that dominate in the healthy gut. The elucidation of how S. Typhimurium alters the bacterial community structure during gastroenteritis is beginning to provide insights into mechanisms that dictate the balance between the host and its microbiota.

### Characteristics of Campylobacter and Salmonella infections and acute gastroenteritis in older adults in Australia, Canada, and the United States [^1112EN9i]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The early detection of enteric infections in older adults is challenging because typical signs and symptoms of disease may be less common, absent, or overlooked. Understanding illness characteristics of enteric infections among older adults could improve the timeliness and accuracy of clinical diagnoses, thereby improving patient outcomes and increasing cases reported to surveillance.

Methods

Here, we describe illness characteristics (percentage reporting bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain; percentage hospitalized; duration of hospitalization; and duration of illness) among older adults (≥ 65 years) with acute gastroenteritis and culture-confirmed Campylobacter and nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in Australia, Canada, and the United States and compare these characteristics with those among younger people (< 5 years, 5–24 years, and 25–64 years).

Results

A significant negative correlation was found between all symptoms and increasing age group, except for bloody diarrhea in cases of acute gastroenteritis. Adults aged ≥ 85 years reported bloody diarrhea in only 9% of nontyphoidal Salmonella and 4% of Campylobacter infections compared with 59% and 55% among children aged < 5 years. Conversely, a greater percentage of older adults (≥ 65) than younger persons (< 5, 5–24, 25–64) reported being hospitalized, with an increasing linear relationship in age groups 65 years and older.

Conclusions

Although older adults are more likely to have severe illness and be hospitalized, we found that the proportion of persons reporting symptoms typically associated with enteric infections decreases with age. These findings have implications for clinical recognition and treatment of gastrointestinal illness, as well as for public health research.

### Effects of probiotic intake and gender on nontyphoid Salmonella infection [^112ZXZ3k]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Goals

The goal of the study was to examine if intake of Lactobacillus plantarum can accelerate clearance of nontyphoid Salmonella and reduce infection-related symptoms.

Background

Nontyphoid Salmonella is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Few studies have explored the effect of probiotics in these infections.

Study

Patients with Salmonella infection were randomized to daily intake of 5 × 10 colony forming units of freeze-dried Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v or placebo. Symptoms were recorded daily. Feces were cultured weekly. Treatment continued until 4 consecutive stool cultures negative for Salmonella had been obtained.

Results

The treatment and placebo groups did not differ significantly with regard to time to clearance of Salmonella, or time to resolution of symptoms. Irrespective of treatment, women tended to clear Salmonella more rapidly than men (19 vs. 28 d, P = 0.18), despite a longer diarrheal phase (5 vs. 3 days after inclusion, P = 0.001). After Salmonella clearance (postinfectious phase), women experienced loose stools, nausea, and flatulence more frequently than men. In women, L. plantarum treatment was associated with more abdominal pain, whereas in men L. plantarum treatment reduced the prevalence of hard stools, and increased the presence of diarrheal symptoms in the postinfectious phase.

Conclusions

Gender, but not administration of the probiotic strain L. plantarum 299 v, may influence acute symptoms during Salmonella infection and possibly clearance of Salmonella. Symptoms in the postinfectious phase were modified by the probiotics in a gender-specific way, but our results give little support for positive effects of L. plantarum 299 v treatment in nontyphoid salmonellosis.

### Questions and answers… [^1151wohq]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

Questions and Answers What are Salmonella. Salmonella are bacteria that make people sick. What illness do people get from Salmonella infection. Most types of Salmonella cause an illness called salmonellosis, which is the focus of this website. Some other types of Salmonella cause typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever. What are the symptoms of infection. Most people with Salmonella infection have diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. Symptoms usually begin six hours to six days after infection and last four to seven days. However, some people do not develop symptoms for several weeks after infection and others experience symptoms for several weeks. Salmonella strains sometimes cause infection in urine, blood, bones, joints, or the nervous system, and can cause severe disease. How is Salmonella infection diagnosed.

Salmonella infection is diagnosed when a laboratory test detects Salmonella bacteria in a person's stool, body tissue, or fluids. How is infection treated. Most people recover from Salmonella infection within four to seven days without antibiotics. People who are sick with a Salmonella infection should drink extra fluids as long as diarrhea lasts. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for:

- People with severe illness
- People with a weakened immune system, such as from HIV infection or chemotherapy treatment
- Adults older than 50 who have medical problems, such as heart disease
- Infants.
- Adults age 65 or older. Can infection cause long-term health problems. Most people with diarrhea caused by Salmonella recover completely, although some people's bowel habits may not return to normal for a few months.

Some people with Salmonella infection develop pain in their joints, called reactive arthritis, after the infection has ended. Reactive arthritis can last for months or years and can be difficult to treat. Some people with reactive arthritis develop irritation of the eyes and pain when urinating. How do people get infected. Salmonella live in the intestines of people and animals. People can get Salmonella infection from a variety of sources, including
- Eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water
- Touching infected animals, their feces, or their environment.

### Clinical review of nontyphoid Salmonella infections from 1991 to 1999 in a Danish county [^113iF1gd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To determine outcomes of nontyphoid Salmonella infections, we reviewed all 3328 cases of infection registered in a large Danish county from 1991 to 1999. The hospitalization rate was 27% among patients < 5 years old, 22% among patients 5–59 years old, and 54% among patients ≥ 60 years old; complications were present in 7% and extraintestinal disease in 4% of patients. We conclude that nontyphoid Salmonella infections may frequently cause severe disease even among patients without predisposing conditions.

### Diagnosis and management of foodborne illness [^115uzh14]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year, one in six Americans will experience a foodborne illness. The most common causes in the United States are viruses, such as norovirus; bacteria, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Listeria; and parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia. Resources are available to educate consumers on food recalls and proper handling, storage, and cooking of foods. Diagnosis and management of a foodborne illness are based on the history and physical examination. Common symptoms of foodborne illnesses include vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood), fever, abdominal cramping, headache, dehydration, myalgia, and arthralgias. Definitive diagnosis can be made only through stool culture or more advanced laboratory testing. However, these results should not delay empiric treatment if a foodborne illness is suspected. Empiric treatment should focus on symptom management, rehydration if the patient is clinically dehydrated, and antibiotic therapy. Foodborne illnesses should be reported to local and state health agencies; reporting requirements vary among states.

### Complications and mortality of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BgD4E]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-typhoidal salmonella typically causes acute enterocolitis that is mild and self-limiting in most people. The illness can also present as a febrile invasive disease often in the absence of diarrhoea, with bacteraemia, meningitis, or focal infections that, if untreated or improperly treated, can be fatal. At-risk populations for non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease include infants and young children, older individuals, immunocompromised or malnourished individuals, and those with recent malaria or HIV infection.,

There were an estimated 535 000 non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease illnesses and 77 500 deaths due to this disease in 2017. Of all non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease illnesses worldwide, most occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where non-typhoidal salmonella is a leading cause of community-onset bloodstream infection. Most high-income countries have national passive or active surveillance systems in place to monitor the epidemiology of both non-typhoidal salmonella-associated diarrhoea and bloodstream infection, with findings often available in surveillance reports that were outside the scope of our systematic review. By contrast, sentinel surveillance studies are needed to gather such data in low-resource settings. The incidence of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease often exceeds 100 illnesses per 100 000 individuals per year in some populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and can exceed 1000 illnesses per 100 000 per year in young children in this region. Due to clinical similarities with other febrile illnesses, early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease can be difficult. Recognised severe complications include sepsis, osteomyelitis, lung infections, and septic arthritis. Previous studies report case-fatality ratios (CFRs) of 20–28% in Mali, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, with CFRs as high as 47% in adults with HIV in Malawi.

### Typhoid conjugate vaccines for preventing typhoid fever (enteric fever) [^113Q9TBo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Presentation is often non‐specific, but includes a high temperature, up to 40°C, flu‐like symptoms, such as headache, chills, malaise and myalgia, and abdominal symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Abdominal pain may develop later in the clinical course. Complications of untreated typhoid fever include encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatitis, psychosis, myocarditis, cholecystitis and intestinal perforation, with prevalence rates of 27% amongst a hospitalised population.

Diagnosis is complicated, as symptoms overlap with other causes of fever, and is dependent on isolation of the bacterium in blood, through culture or polymerase chain reaction. Blood culture is limited by a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI 52 to 70). Stool, urine and bone‐marrow culture can also be used. Clinical diagnosis is often used, with administration of antibiotics whilst awaiting culture results. Early antibiotic treatment shortens disease duration and prevents complications, but can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Together with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions, typhoid vaccination has proven effective in preventing typhoid fever and reducing the disease burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends typhoid vaccination in routine immunisation programmes in high‐risk populations.

### Resistance in enteric Shigella and nontyphoidal Salmonella: emerging concepts [^1117SnsQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Enteric Shigella and nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) are widely recognized as predominant bacterial pathogens responsible for foodborne illnesses and are regarded as a significant public health concern globally. Although acute diarrhoea caused by Shigella and NTS can be unpleasant, these diseases are usually self-limiting, and symptoms usually resolve within a few days with appropriate fluid and electrolyte management. However, in vulnerable populations, including children under 5 years of age, elderly, malnourished and immunocompromised individuals, these diseases can be life threatening. The use of antibiotics is an important means to shorten duration of illness and reduce infectivity. However, with the increasing use of antibiotics, resistance of Shigella and NTS to different antibiotics continues to emerge, and these bacteria show high rates of multidrug resistance globally.

### One species, different diseases: the unique molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of typhoidal Salmonella infections [^116g7VN7]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Salmonella enterica is one of the most widespread bacterial pathogens found worldwide, resulting in approximately 100 million infections and over 200 000 deaths per year. Salmonella isolates, termed 'serovars', can largely be classified as either nontyphoidal or typhoidal Salmonella, which differ in regard to disease manifestation and host tropism. Nontyphoidal Salmonella causes gastroenteritis in many hosts, while typhoidal Salmonella is human-restricted and causes typhoid fever, a systemic disease with a mortality rate of up to 30% without treatment. There has been considerable interest in understanding how different Salmonella serovars cause different diseases, but the molecular details that underlie these infections have not yet been fully characterized, especially in the case of typhoidal Salmonella. In this review, we highlight the current state of research into understanding the pathogenesis of both nontyphoidal and typhoidal Salmonella, with a specific interest in serovar-specific traits that allow human-adapted strains of Salmonella to cause enteric fever. Overall, a more detailed molecular understanding of how different Salmonella isolates infect humans will provide critical insights into how we can eradicate these dangerous enteric pathogens.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^113kUJdH]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A five-year-old boy, previously healthy, presented with a two-day history of fever and experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Although his fever was high, it was not associated with chills or rigors. Vomiting was frequent but not projectile, nor was the vomit bilious or mixed with blood. The diarrheal stool was watery in nature and mixed with mucus, but no blood was detected. The abdominal pain was severe and colicky in nature, located in the epigastric area with no radiation. The pain was relieved by passing stool, with no other pain-relieving factors, including pain medications. Further, the pain was aggravated by food intake. No abdominal distension, no history of drug ingestion and no recent travel.

A physical examination on admission revealed a highly febrile child with a fever reaching 40 °C, tachycardia and otherwise normal vital signs. He also showed signs that indicated moderate dehydration. His physical examination, including an abdominal examination was unremarkable.

Blood investigations revealed normal complete blood count, with normal renal function and electrolytes. Blood and urine cultures were also normal. He had low bicarbonate level of 14 mmol/L (Normal Range: 22–26 mmol/L) and the rapid antigen detection test was positive for Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. Table 1.

The patient was admitted with the suspicion of GAS infection (tonsillitis), and his abdominal pain was attributed to mesenteric adenitis, which is usually associated with GAS infection. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) hydration and penicillin G sodium. Further, the patient did not have a sore throat at that stage, and his clinical examination did not reveal any sign of GAS tonsillitis.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^1142Vjhw]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever (typhoid) is an enteric bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi; S. Typhi). It is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases worldwide and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi A, B and C (S. Paratyphi) results in a disease that can have an identical clinical syndrome to typhoid fever, but is often less severe. Typhoid fever is most common in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with children predominantly affected. Like many febrile illnesses, typhoid presents with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially in its early stages. In routine healthcare settings in low/middle-income countries (LMICs), typhoid fever is commonly suspected and treated empirically with antibiotics. This overuse of antibiotics creates a selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that has resulted in the emergence and spread of typhoid strains that are resistant to all first-line antibiotics. Similarly, the low specificity of current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can lead to an over diagnosis of typhoid fever that may result in the overuse of antibiotics and delay the proper treatment for underlying conditions. For example, the use of the Widal test during an outbreak of acute febrile illness in Nepal led to misdiagnosis of typhoid which delayed the appropriate treatment of the causative agent (scrub typhus), resulting in dozens of deaths. The potential harms of current typhoid RDTs are compounded by the fact they are widely available, cheap and easy to use.

Median number of days from onset of symptoms to outbreak detection for outbreaks with confirmed etiology, 6 US states, 2002

The median duration of exposure for all outbreaks with a confirmed etiologic agent was 1 day (range 1–21 days). However, 12 (29%) of 41 norovirus, 2 (67%) of 3 E. coli O157:H7, and 9 (75%) of 12 Salmonella spp. outbreaks occurred over multiple days. The median duration of multiday outbreaks was 4 days for norovirus (range 2–13 days), 5 days for E. coli O157/H7 outbreaks (range 5–6 days), and 10 days for Salmonella spp. outbreaks (range 3–21 days).

### Pericardial abscess due to Salmonella typhi infection [^117MSaPi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Typhoid fever is a human-specific disease caused by subspecies of Salmonella enterica (Salmonella Typhi). It spreads through ingestion of contaminated food or water and is diagnosed through blood culture or bone marrow culture. It typically presents as an intestinal infection, with a few patients developing severe disseminated infections. Here, we report a rare case of purulent pericarditis secondary to S. Typhi infection. A 67-year-old elderly male suffered from recurrent fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain for 7 days. Initial blood and stool cultures were positive for Salmonella, and a follow-up blood culture confirmed S. Typhi. Magnetic resonance imaging showed pericardial abscess and hepatic abscess. After pericardiocentesis, the pericardial fluid culture grew S. Typhi, confirming the diagnosis of pericardial abscess secondary to S. Typhi infection. After percutaneous drainage of the pericardial abscess and administration of effective antibiotics, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. He subsequently recovered and was discharged from the hospital. During follow-up, there were no further recurrences. Disseminated infection secondary to Salmonella Typhi is extremely rare but can lead to serious life-threatening conditions. Our patient was found to have pericardial abscess caused by S. Typhi. Effective and adequate antibiotics, along with pericardial abscess drainage, can improve symptoms, assist in diagnosis, and enhance quality of life.

Estimation of Symptom-specific Probabilities for Visiting a Doctor and Having a Stool Test (P d and P s)

The component probabilities P d and P s were estimated from the National Gastroenteritis Survey (NGS) conducted in 2002. The telephone survey, using a random stratified sample from all states in Australia, included a total sample of 6,087 persons who were asked about diarrheal illness they had experienced in the previous 4 weeks. Respondents with chronic illness with diarrhea were not counted as case-patients unless they identified their symptoms as different than usual. Case-patients were asked details about their illness and days of duration of symptoms. The case definition of diarrheal illness was the following: at least 3 loose stools in 24 hours (excluding those persons who report a noninfectious cause of their diarrhea because of pregnancy, alcohol use, chronic illness, or medications) and duration < 28 days.

Adjusting Component Probabilities for Severity of Illness

To calculate improved pathogen-specific estimates rather than estimates of underreporting of all gastroenteritis, we estimated multipliers from NGS for gastroenteritis of varying severity. The proportion of cases in corresponding severity categories was then estimated for the 3 different pathogens by using other data from case-control studies (Table 1). The appropriate multipliers could then be applied according to the average severity of illness.

Symptoms of severity that predicted whether the person with gastroenteritis visited a doctor were identified from NGS by using multivariable logistic regression. The following conditions were evaluated: duration of illness, cramps, vomiting, nausea, blood in the stool, headache, respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, sore throat), fever, body aches, loss of appetite, and stiff neck. Age and sex of the patients were also considered. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Because the number of case-patients who had stool tests was small in the gastroenteritis survey (n = 15), univariate regression was used to identify severity symptoms that predicted whether a doctor ordered a stool test (statistical significance p < 0.1). Additional information from a random sample of general practitioners (GPs) from 2 states of Australia on the treatment of diarrheal disease was used to identify severity symptoms that prompted doctors to order a stool test. Data were stratified by symptom categories that were statistically significant determinants for both visiting a doctor and having a stool test ordered. Probabilities were calculated for case-patients in each symptom category of visiting a doctor and having stool tested.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^117XGKYG]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

The most common clinical presentation of salmonellosis is acute enteritis, in which the child will present with an abrupt onset of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and cramps, located primarily in the periumbilical area and right lower quadrant. This stage is typically followed by mild to severe watery diarrhea and sometimes by diarrheal stool containing blood and mucus. A large proportion of children with acute enteritis are febrile, although younger infants may exhibit a normal or subnormal temperature. Salmonella gastroenteritis can be associated with acute dehydration and complications that result from delayed presentation and inadequate treatment.

A total of 1–5% of children with Salmonella gastroenteritis can develop transient bacteremia. Following bacteremia, salmonellae have the propensity to seed and cause focal supportive infection of many organs. The most common focal infections involve the skeletal system, meninges, intravascular sites, and sites of pre-existing abnormalities.

Acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella gastroenteritis is a rare complication among the pediatric population. This complication has been reported in adult patients with typhoid fever and nontyphoid Salmonella infection, but there are few reported cases in the pediatric population.

Most cases of Salmonella gastroenteritis are associated with biochemical pancreatitis that is characterized by an acute elevation of serum amylase and lipase without clinical correlation. However, there is no agreement that acute pancreatitis could be regarded as a complication of Salmonella infection.

Boyd mentioned that necropsy on some patients who died from Salmonella food poisoning showed subtle diffuse acute interstitial pancreatitis. Since these patients died from bacterial or endotoxin shock, pancreatitis might be one of the signs of multiorgan failure. Later, two studies were conducted retrospectively on patients with Salmonella enteritis. Renner et al. reported that concomitant pancreatitis was observed in 62% of patients and that the course of pancreatitis was mild to moderate in most of the patients. Murphy et al. found that none of the 51 patients who presented with Salmonella infection had clinically apparent pancreatitis, and one patient had a mild elevation of serum amylase without clinical correlation. The interpretation of such inconsistent conclusions from both retrospective studies is not clear.
