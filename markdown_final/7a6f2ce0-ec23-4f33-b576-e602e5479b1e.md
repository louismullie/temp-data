## Question

What does this mean: 6. Unable to determine pulmonary artery systolic pressure due to insufficient TR.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "Unable to determine pulmonary artery systolic pressure due to insufficient TR" on an echocardiogram means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the technical basis of how echocardiography estimates PASP using the tricuspid regurgitant (TR) jet. Then, I should verify what "insufficient TR" actually means in practice and how often it occurs. Next, I will assess the clinical significance — does absence of a measurable TR jet exclude pulmonary hypertension, or not. After that, I should review alternative echocardiographic markers when TR is inadequate. Finally, I need to consider guideline-recommended pathways, including when to proceed to right heart catheterization, and practical steps to improve the Doppler signal if needed.

> Let me first confirm the technical foundation. Echocardiography estimates PASP by measuring the peak TR jet velocity and applying the simplified Bernoulli relation (PASP ≈ 4 × [TR velocity]² + estimated right atrial pressure), which requires a detectable, well-aligned continuous-wave Doppler envelope of the TR jet and a reasonable estimate of right atrial pressure from IVC indices, although IVC-based RAP is itself a frequent source of error. Wait, I should verify the known pitfalls: suboptimal Doppler alignment, incomplete spectral envelopes, and valve/outflow lesions can lead to over- or underestimation, and in many patients the TR envelope is simply not obtainable with adequate quality, limiting noninvasive PASP estimation. These technical constraints and accuracy concerns are well described in systematic evidence and methodological analyses [^111LL11z] [^114AxoQK] [^113aBTEn].

> Now, what exactly does "insufficient TR" mean? I need to ensure I'm precise. It typically means there is no measurable TR jet or the signal quality is inadequate for a reliable peak velocity measurement because the envelope is incomplete, poorly defined, misaligned, or the acoustic windows are poor. Hold on, I should verify alternative acquisition strategies: multiple views and careful color/Doppler optimization can sometimes salvage a usable envelope; in ventilated or severely hypoxemic patients, transesophageal echocardiography may be preferable when transthoracic windows are limited. The bottom line is that "insufficient TR" reflects a technical limitation of noninvasive PASP estimation, not a hemodynamic conclusion by itself [^114AxoQK] [^115pJyF5] [^113aBTEn].

> Next, how common is this and what does it imply clinically? I will now examine cohort data linking absent TR signals to invasive hemodynamics. In a large right heart catheterization–linked dataset from Vanderbilt, 36% of patients had no reported TR velocity on TTE, and critically, 47% of those without a measurable TR jet still had pulmonary hypertension by invasive criteria, yielding a negative predictive value of only about 53% for excluding PH. Wait, let me verify the implication: absence of a measurable TR jet does not rule out PH and should not reassure us if clinical suspicion remains. This echoes broader evidence showing substantial uncertainty in echo-derived pulmonary pressure estimates compared with the catheterization reference standard [^116z3NxU] [^111LL11z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I initially thought that if the TR jet is absent then PAP is probably normal, but that is incorrect. I should double-check the pathophysiology that can make the TR method fail in disease. In severe TR or when right atrial pressure is very high, early pressure equilibration between the right ventricle and right atrium can blunt the peak gradient and understate or obscure the true pulmonary pressure, leading to underestimation by Doppler even in patients with significant pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, valve or outflow tract lesions can confound right ventricular systolic pressure estimation. Therefore, both absence and deceptively low TR velocities can be misleading and must be interpreted alongside the rest of the study and the clinical context [^112uoL9w] [^114AxoQK].

> When TR is insufficient, what else on echo can guide us. Let me consider the recommended indirect markers of pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Septal flattening with D-shaped left ventricle, right ventricular dilation or hypokinesis, IVC dilation with blunted collapse, shortened pulmonary valve acceleration time, and RV outflow Doppler abnormalities increase the pre-test probability of PH when combined with symptoms and risk factors. I should confirm that guidelines and expert statements endorse using these parameters when TR is not measurable, with the caveat that they infer probability rather than provide a pressure value. Measures of RV–PA coupling, such as the TAPSE-to-estimated sPAP ratio when sPAP is estimable, also carry prognostic information, though this requires a pressure estimate and may not be feasible in the absence of TR. In sum, a structured synthesis of indirect signs can sustain or reduce suspicion, but cannot replace invasive confirmation when decisions hinge on accurate hemodynamics [^113aBTEn] [^111LL11z] [^112EoFdN].

> I should confirm guideline-directed next steps when suspicion persists despite insufficient TR. Both ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS guidance emphasize that right heart catheterization is the reference standard and should be pursued when noninvasive data are inadequate or discordant with clinical findings, particularly when management decisions depend on accurate pressures and resistances. For significant TR and right-sided pathology, expert consensus further underscores the risk of echo underestimation of PA pressures and the need for invasive confirmation of pulmonary hemodynamics before interventions. Hemodynamic panels should include mPAP, PAWP, PVR, cardiac index, and RA pressure to properly phenotype PH and guide therapy and procedural planning [^114Gp8c7] [^111LL11z] [^112uoL9w].

> But wait, before sending the patient to the cath lab, can we optimize the echocardiogram to rescue a TR signal. I need to ensure we have attempted meticulous acquisition: use multiple windows, align the continuous-wave Doppler beam carefully with the regurgitant jet, adjust color and spectral gain/filters, and reassess the IVC to refine RAP estimation. If transthoracic access is compromised, especially in mechanically ventilated or hyperinflated lungs, consider transesophageal echocardiography to obtain a better TR envelope for pressure estimation. If despite optimization the TR jet remains insufficient, we should not delay necessary decisions that require accurate hemodynamics — proceed to RHC as indicated by the clinical scenario [^114AxoQK] [^115pJyF5] [^114Gp8c7].

> Let me summarize to ensure internal consistency. "Unable to determine PASP due to insufficient TR" signifies a technical limitation of Doppler echocardiography that prevents noninvasive PASP calculation and does not exclude pulmonary hypertension, which is present in nearly half of such patients in invasive series. When TR is inadequate, weigh indirect echo signs of PH and RV strain to refine pre-test probability, but if clinical suspicion remains or management depends on precise pressures and resistances, pursue right heart catheterization as the definitive next step [^116z3NxU] [^111LL11z] [^114Gp8c7].

This means the echocardiogram **could not estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP)** because the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet was too weak or absent to measure [^113aBTEn]. PASP is typically **calculated from the TR jet velocity using the Bernoulli equation**, plus right atrial pressure; therefore, without a measurable TR jet, PASP cannot be determined noninvasively [^111LL11z]. This **does not rule out pulmonary hypertension** [^116z3NxU]; if clinical suspicion remains, consider right heart catheterization [^114Gp8c7] or alternative echocardiographic indices [^113aBTEn].

---

## Clinical significance of insufficient tricuspid regurgitation

- **Normal or low right-sided pressures**: Minimal TR can indicate normal or low right-sided pressures, but this is not definitive [^114AxoQK].

- **Technical limitations**: Poor acoustic windows, suboptimal Doppler alignment, or patient factors (e.g. obesity, lung disease) can limit TR jet detection [^113aBTEn].

- **Valve pathology**: Tricuspid stenosis or prosthetic valves can reduce TR jet velocity, making PASP estimation difficult.

## Alternative methods for estimating pulmonary artery systolic pressure

| **Method** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) jet | Use PR jet velocity to estimate mean/diastolic PA pressure [^111LL11z] | - PR jet often weak or absent <br/> - Less reliable for PASP |
| Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) | Shorter PAAT suggests higher PA pressures [^113aBTEn] | - Indirect <br/> - Less accurate than TR-based PASP |
| Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) measurements | RVOT flow patterns can suggest elevated PA pressures [^115pJyF5] | - Indirect <br/> - Less accurate than TR-based PASP |
| Right heart catheterization (RHC) | Gold standard for direct PA pressure measurement [^114Gp8c7] | - Invasive <br/> - Procedural risks |

## Clinical implications and management considerations

- **Pulmonary hypertension (PH)**: Absence of a measurable TR jet does not exclude PH [^114AxoQK]; nearly half of such patients may have PH on catheterization [^116z3NxU].

- **Right heart function**: Evaluate RV size/function, right atrial size, and indirect signs of elevated PA pressure (e.g. septal flattening, dilated pulmonary arteries) [^1154adwc].

- **Further testing**: If clinical suspicion persists, consider RHC [^114Gp8c7] or alternative echocardiographic indices [^113aBTEn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

In clinical guidelines, **ACC/AHA guidelines** advise obtaining TTE to assess TR severity and RV function and to estimate PASP [^1154adwc]; if noninvasive data are inadequate, consider invasive hemodynamics [^114Gp8c7]. ESC/ERS guidelines recommend **echocardiography for initial PH assessment** [^111LL11z], with confirmation by RHC when needed.

---

## Summary and clinical approach

"Unable to determine pulmonary artery systolic pressure due to insufficient TR" means the TR jet was **too weak or absent to estimate PASP noninvasively** [^113aBTEn]. This **does not exclude PH** [^116z3NxU]; assess RV/RA size and function, look for indirect signs of elevated PA pressure, and consider RHC or alternative indices if suspicion persists [^1154adwc] [^114Gp8c7].

### Lack of a tricuspid regurgitation Doppler signal and pulmonary hypertension by invasive measurement [^116z3NxU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is used to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure, but an adequate tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) needed to calculate pulmonary artery systolic pressure is not always present. It is unknown whether the absence of a measurable TRV signifies normal pulmonary artery pressure.

- **Methods and results**: We extracted hemodynamic, TTE, and clinical data from Vanderbilt's deidentified electronic medical record in all patients referred for right heart catheterization between 1998 and 2014. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg. We examined the prevalence and clinical correlates of PH in patients without a reported TRV. We identified 1262 patients with a TTE within 2 days of right heart catheterization. In total, 803/1262 (64%) had a reported TRV, whereas 459 (36%) had no reported TRV. Invasively confirmed PH was present in 47% of patients without a reported TRV versus 68% in those with a reported TRV (P < 0.001). Absence of a TRV yielded a negative predictive value for excluding PH of 53%. Right ventricular dysfunction, left atrial dimension, elevated body mass index, higher brain natriuretic peptide, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure were independently associated with PH among patients without a reported TRV.

- **Conclusions**: PH is present in almost half of patients without a measurable TRV who are referred for both TTE and right heart catheterization. Clinical and echocardiographic features of left heart disease are associated with invasively confirmed PH in subjects without a reported TRV.

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups (tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, 40 mg, or placebo) in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Subjects had to be at least 12 years of age and had a diagnosis of PAH that was idiopathic, heritable, related to connective tissue disease, anorexigen use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, associated with an atrial-septal defect, or associated with surgical repair of a congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt of at least 1-year duration (for example, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). Patients with a history of left-sided heart disease, severe renal insufficiency, or pulmonary hypertension related to conditions other than specified in the inclusion criteria were not eligible for enrollment.

### Prognostic relevance of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary arterial pressure ratio and its association with exercise hemodynamics in patients with normal or mildly elevated resting pulmonary arterial pressure [^112EoFdN]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) ratio is a noninvasive surrogate for right ventricle (RV)-pulmonary arterial (PA) coupling, which has been related to outcomes in patients with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (PH).

- **Research question**: Is RV-PA coupling of prognostic relevance in patients with suspected PH, but only normal or mildly elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), and is it associated with impaired exercise capacity and exercise hemodynamics?

- **Study design and methods**: Patients with mPAP of 3 mm Hg/L/min were included. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for clinical worsening (CW), defined by disease-related hospitalization, transplantation, or death.

- **Results**: Two hundred thirty-seven patients (155 female; median age 64 years [interquartile range (IQR), 54–73 years]; no PH: n = 147; mild PH: n = 90; EPH: n = 202) were included. During the observation period of 63 months (IQR, 29–104 months), 36 patients died and 126 clinical worsening events occurred. TAPSE to sPAP ratio was an age- and sex-independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.62; p = 0.014) and clinical worsening (HR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.35–0.78; p = 0.002). TAPSE to sPAP ratio was also correlated.

### Persistent tricuspid regurgitation and its predictor in adults after percutaneous and isolated surgical closure of secundum atrial septal defect [^116HzAJw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The fate of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after closure of a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) without any corrective tricuspid valve (TV) surgery remains unclear. We investigated this and the predictors of persistent TR after ASD closure. Thirty-two consecutive patients with moderate or severe TR before ASD closure were examined. Of these, 23 underwent percutaneous ASD closure, and 9 underwent isolated surgical ASD closure.

The left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular end-diastolic area, right ventricular fractional area change, right ventricular spherical index, right atrial area, TV annular diameter, TV tethering height, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and pulmonary/systemic blood flow ratio were determined by echocardiography before and early after ASD closure. The color Doppler maximal jet area was used to assess the severity of TR. After ASD closure, the jet area decreased for all patients (p = 0.009); however, 16 patients (50%) had persistent TR.

Multivariate analysis revealed that only pulmonary artery systolic pressure before ASD closure was related to the TR jet area after ASD closure (p = 0.003). A pulmonary artery systolic pressure of > 60 mm Hg predicted persistent TR with 100% sensitivity and 63% specificity. In conclusion, functional TR was ameliorated after percutaneous and isolated surgical ASD closure, although persistent TR was common. The presence of pulmonary hypertension before ASD closure predicted persistent TR; therefore, corrective TV surgery should be considered at ASD closure.

### Endothelin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and systolic pulmonary artery pressure in patients with Chuvash polycythemia [^1128kFZA]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

Endothelin-1 has been associated with the development of hypoxia-related pulmonary hypertension, while vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is linked with protection from this complication. In Chuvash polycythemia, the homozygous germline von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 598C→T mutation leads to the up-regulation during normoxia of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and several hypoxia-controlled genes, including erythropoietin and VEGF. We postulated that endothelin-1 and pulmonary artery pressure may be elevated in Chuvash polycythemia.

- **Design and methods**: Systolic pulmonary artery blood pressure was estimated by Doppler echocardiography, and plasma concentrations of endothelin-1, VEGF, and erythropoietin were determined in 14 patients with Chuvash polycythemia and 14 controls. The results indicated that plasma endothelin-1 (p = 0.010), VEGF (p = 0.022), and erythropoietin (p < 0.0005) concentrations, as well as Doppler-estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressures (p < 0.0005), were higher in the patients, while systolic systemic blood pressures were lower (p = 0.001). Five (36%) patients and no controls had mild pulmonary hypertension, defined as systolic pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 35 mmHg. Among the patients with Chuvash polycythemia, the trends of association of estimated pulmonary artery pressure with plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 (R = +0.236), VEGF (R = -0.389), and erythropoietin (R = +0.220) were not statistically significant.

- **Interpretations and conclusions**: Estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure and plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 and VEGF are increased in patients with Chuvash polycythemia.

### Valvular heart disease: Aortic regurgitation [^116hNeLc]. Circulation (2005). High credibility.

Chronic aortic regurgitation may be attributed to several causes. Among these are Takayasu arteritis, axial spondyloarthritis, thoracic aortic dissection, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, conditions such as aortic root dilation, systemic hypertension, and myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve can contribute. Rheumatic valve disease, degenerative aortic valve disease, and HLA-B27-associated valvulitis are also potential factors. Further causes include thoracic aortic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, and ventricular septal defect. Autoimmune and systemic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Whipple's disease may play a role, as can connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Other contributors to chronic aortic regurgitation include infective endocarditis, giant cell arteritis, and syphilitic aortitis.

Right-sided disease: pulmonary embolism

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be challenging because symptoms and signs are nonspecific. The transthoracic echocardiogram is normal in approximately 50% of unselected patients with acute pulmonary embolism and has a sensitivity of 50–60% and specificity of 80–90%. Therefore, other investigations are used to confirm the diagnosis, with echocardiography serving as a complementary imaging technique. The principal indirect echocardiographic findings are nonspecific and include right heart dilatation, right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis (with or without apical sparing), abnormal septal motion, and inferior vena cava dilatation (FIG. 3a). Secondary tricuspid regurgitation might be present, allowing estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure using the simplified Bernoulli equation (FIG. 3b). Given that the right ventricle can generate a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of only ≤ 60 mmHg acutely, a higher pressure suggests a more chronic process (either multiple repeated episodes or chronic pulmonary parenchymal disease, with or without pulmonary embolism). Although the peak tricuspid regurgitation gradient is the most commonly used parameter to assess pulmonary artery systolic pressure in clinical practice, difficulties in the detection of a good tricuspid regurgitation envelope might occur. Pulsed Doppler recordings of pulmonary valve flow acceleration time, pre-ejection period, and ejection time at the RV outflow tract can also be used to estimate pulmonary artery pressure and resistance.

Pericardial collection and tamponade can be involved in the context of right-sided disease.

### Tricuspid valve academic research consortium definitions for tricuspid regurgitation and trial endpoints [^112uoL9w]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

An assessment of pulmonary vascular pathophysiology is essential for understanding TR pathophysiology. Assessment of PA pressures, in particular, plays a crucial role. Precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with severe TR has been associated with worse outcomes following T-TEER. Echocardiography estimates of PA systolic pressure correlate well with invasive measurement in patients with nonsevere TR. However, they may underestimate PA systolic pressure when there is rapid equilibration of RA and RV pressures, which may occur with severe TR with or without a noncompliant RA.

Recent PH guidelines recommend confirmation of PA pressures with invasive right heart catheterization. The routine assessment of invasive pulmonary vascular hemodynamics in patients with TR is even more important given the discordance that may occur in some patients with severe disease. A recent study showed that high PA pressures by invasive measurement, with discordant low estimated pressures by echocardiography, are associated with poor outcomes following T-TEER. Variables that should be obtained by right heart catheterization are listed in Supplemental Table 4. The pulmonary artery pulsatility index, defined as the ratio of PA pulse pressure to RA pressure, has emerged as a predictor of RV failure and worse survival in patients with moderate or greater TR without pulmonary hypertension.

Because of the sensitivity of the RV to afterload, an index of ventricular contractility to afterload may further characterize RV function compensation to specific loading conditions. RV-PA coupling describes a hemodynamic state where mechanical stroke adapts efficiently to afterload changes.

### Mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressure is associated with a high risk of progression to pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176xcTr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Four studies investigated the incidences of progression to pulmonary hypertension (PH) during follow-up in the mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) group versus the normal PAP group. Pooled analyses of these studies showed a higher risk of progression to PH during follow-up in the mildly elevated PAP group than in the normal PAP group (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.21–2.71; P = 0.0040, I² = 0%) when only participants who had repeated right heart catheterizations (RHCs) were included in calculating the incidence of progression to PH. In contrast, when all participants in each group were included, regardless of repeated RHCs, the pooled risk ratio was higher (RR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.55–3.87; P = 0.0001, I² = 0%). Sensitivity analyses assessing the robustness and reliability of the merged results indicated no statistically significant publication biases based on Egger's tests (P = 0.2180 and P = 0.6950).

### Assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance by Doppler echocardiography in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113kMTYP]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

The assessment of pulmonary artery pressures, cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is crucial in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This study aimed to investigate whether Doppler echocardiography can be employed to determine PVR in patients with PAH.

- **Methods**: Forty-two patients were included, and Doppler echocardiography was performed simultaneously (n = 22) and non-simultaneously (n = 60) with right heart catheterization. The tricuspid regurgitation velocity was used to estimate pulmonary arterial peak systolic and diastolic pressures (PADP) using the Bernoulli equation. At the time of pulmonary valve opening, right ventricular pressure equals PADP. The tricuspid regurgitation velocity at the time of pulmonary valve opening was measured by superimposing the time from the QRS to the onset of pulmonary flow on the tricuspid regurgitation velocity envelope. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, and CO were assessed using standard Doppler echocardiography methods. Right heart catheterization was performed using Swan-Ganz catheters and thermodilution for CO determination.

- **Results**: The differences (mean ± SD) between catheter and simultaneous/non-simultaneous Doppler echocardiography were 0.3 ± 0.8 (p = 0.10)/-0.3 ± 1.1 (p = 0.06) liters/min for CO, 2.9 ± 5.1 (p = 0.02)/-1.2 ± 7.4 (p = 0.2) mm Hg for the transpulmonary gradient (TPG), and 0.3 ± 2.1 (p = 0.65)/0.8 ± 2.4 (p = 0.02) Wood units for PVR. The correlation coefficients between catheter and simultaneous/non-simultaneous Doppler echocardiography are not specified in the excerpt.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112AHfsX]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Concerning medical management for pulmonary hypertension, particularly in relation to PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the addition of inhaled treprostinil to improve the six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Alternatively, inhaled iloprost may be used to enhance the WHO functional class and delay the time to clinical worsening in patients with PAH who remain symptomatic on stable and appropriate doses of an endothelin receptor antagonist or a PDE5 inhibitor.

### Right ventricular pulmonary artery coupling and mortality in cardiac intensive care unit patients [^115AAVKB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction causing RV failure is common among hospitalized patients. RV dysfunction and RV failure among critically ill patients are typically the results of pulmonary hypertension (PH), RV insults, or both, and these conditions have frequently been associated with adverse outcomes. RV function can be assessed using measures of longitudinal RV motion, such as the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid annular peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity (TASV), the former potentially being more load-dependent. Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, measured by Doppler echocardiography based on the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, in the absence of pulmonary valve stenosis, can identify PH, which has been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients.

The ability of the RV to compensate with preserved systolic function in the face of an increasing afterload is referred to as maintaining RV‐PA coupling. Echocardiographic measures of RV‐PA coupling involve the ratio of RV longitudinal motion (i.e. TAPSE or TASV) to the RV systolic pressure (RVSP) or PA systolic pressure. Studies evaluating the TAPSE/RVSP ratio in patients with cardiovascular disease have shown associations between lower TAPSE/RVSP ratio (reflecting worse RV‐PA coupling) and adverse outcomes. Prior studies evaluating RV‐PA coupling using the TASV/RVSP ratio have involved invasive measurements of PA systolic pressure, rather than noninvasive RVSP derived from Doppler techniques.

### Operative classification of thromboembolic disease determines outcome after pulmonary endarterectomy [^111Wftue]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether the type and location of thromboembolic disease in the pulmonary vascular tree predict the hemodynamic result and clinical outcome in patients undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy.

- **Methods**: From 1998 to 2000, 202 patients with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular resistance ranging from 194 to 2950 dynes-s-cm(-5) underwent pulmonary endarterectomy. Preoperative and postoperative tricuspid valve function, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance were determined by means of transthoracic echocardiography and measurements with a Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif), respectively. Patients underwent intraoperative classification of thromboembolism as follows:
	- **Type 1 (76 patients)**: fresh thrombus in the main-lobar pulmonary arteries
	- **Type 2 (81 patients)**: intimal thickening and fibrosis proximal to the segmental arteries
	- **Type 3 (38 patients)**: disease within distal segmental arteries only
	- **Type 4 (7 patients)**: distal arteriolar vasculopathy without visible thromboembolic disease.

- **Results**: Overall perioperative mortality was 4.5% (9/202 patients). By means of univariate analysis, patients with type 3 or 4 disease (distal pulmonary vasculopathy) had more residual postoperative tricuspid regurgitation (P < 0.0001), higher postoperative pulmonary artery systolic pressure (P < 0.0001), and greater postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (P < 0.0001) compared with patients with type 1 or 2 disease, in whom thromboembolic disease was more surgically accessible.

### Is the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema in a heart-lung interaction [^115i9v9H]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Video 1 shows an apical four-chamber view with a hypokinetic apex and interventricular septum, a dilated left atrium and right ventricle, and collapsibility of the inferior vena cava during inspiration.

A right pleural tap was performed using a 12F drain and a closed collection system, resulting in the evacuation of 850 mL of transudate without active suction [Figure 2A].

### Secondary left heart failure occurred during VA-ECMO assistance for severe residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy: a case report [^1151KyDX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

During the first attempt to discontinue CPB, the PAP increased rapidly to 63/35(43) mmHg, with unstable hemodynamic (ABP 70/40 mmHg), and TEE suggested right heart insufficiency, accompanied by normal left ventricular function. CPB was resumed immediately. After assisting for another 45 minutes and increasing the dosage of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine 0.06 μg/kg.min, epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg.min, isoproterenol 0.05 μg/kg.min), the separation failed again, similar to the first attempt. Given that severe residual PH combined with right heart dysfunction were the main reasons for the failure of CPB weaning, ECMO was adopted. Consequently, a 19F arterial cannula and 22F venous cannula were inserted into the right femoral vessels, and femoral VA-ECMO was initiated with a flow of 3.0 ~ 3.5 L/min.

On arrival at the intensive care unit, the ECMO flow rate was 3.5 L/min, and severe PH (PAP 56/25 mmHg) persisted with low ABP (70/55 mmHg). Echocardiography revealed a significant decrease in biventricular function (TAPES 4 mm, LVEF 28%, average E/E′ 15, lateral E' 6.7 cm/s, TR velocity 4.1 m/s) on postoperative day (POD) 1. This indicated that the patient developed severe secondary left ventricular dysfunction on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction during ECMO support. The postoperative troponin-T (C-TNT) increased gradually, suggesting myocardial injuries occurred. Comprehensive measures were adapted: the ECMO flow rate was reduced from 3.5 L/min to 2.5 L/min to decrease left ventricular afterload while maintaining systemic perfusion. Norepinephrine…

### Impact of the new pulmonary hypertension definition on long-term mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing valve replacement [^112qMKtE]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively and systematically collected cardiac catheterization data. Overall, 487 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing cardiac catheterization prior to aortic valve replacement (AVR) in a single center between January 2011 and January 2016 were included. Complete data on mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (mPAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) were available for all patients, allowing classification according to both the 2015 and 2018 definitions. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Canton of St. Gallen (project number 2016–02113). Owing to its retrospective design, a waiver of consent was granted.

- **Cardiac catheterization**: Procedures were generally (> 95%) performed between 8 and 10 a.m. with the patient in the fasting state and after withholding loop diuretics and renin‐angiotensin system inhibitors. Patients underwent coronary angiography using 5‐ or 6‐French catheters via femoral or radial artery access, and right heart catheterization using 6‐French Swan‐Ganz catheters via femoral or brachial access. Routine right heart catheterization at the time of coronary angiography has been our practice for more than 20 years in patients with AS evaluated for AVR. The midthoracic level was used as the zero reference point. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (dPAP), mPAP, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were measured. Measurements were obtained at end‐expiration, while avoiding the patient's breath‐holding and especially Valsalva maneuvers. The mean of three to five measurements was taken.

Regarding surgical interventions for tricuspid regurgitation, particularly concerning indications for surgery, the ESC/EACTS 2022 guidelines recommend considering surgery in patients who are symptomatic or have right ventricular (RV) dilatation, with severe secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) (with or without previous left-sided surgery). This recommendation applies in the absence of severe RV or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and severe pulmonary vascular disease or hypertension.

Regarding the medical management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, specifically concerning the management of pulmonary hypertension, the BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend considering the referral of patients with ILD and pulmonary hypertension to a regional specialist pulmonary hypertension center if it is judged that the condition contributes to symptoms disproportionately to the extent of ILD or involves severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 50 mmHg). This allows for proper assessment and recruitment into high-quality clinical trials.

### Hemodynamic findings in severe tricuspid regurgitation [^116FTQSu]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) most commonly occurs in response to right ventricular (RV) dilation, with structural abnormalities in the tricuspid valve being rarer. In addition to RV size and valvular integrity, the amount of TR is influenced by RV preload and afterload, the respiratory cycle, left heart function, and atrial fibrillation.

Hemodynamic changes in right atrial (RA) pressures in severe TR include elevated mean pressures, a large systolic wave called an "s" wave, a prominent 'Y' descent, and a blunted 'X' descent. Additionally, RV end-diastolic pressure is elevated and cardiac output is reduced, especially with exercise. "Ventricularization" of the RA pressure tracing, in which the contour of the RA pressure is similar to, but of lower amplitude than, the contour of the RV pressure, is the most specific finding but is found in a minority of patients with severe TR.

In summary, alterations in the RA pressure tracing are common in patients with severe TR, but specific hemodynamic findings lack sensitivity. This may, in part, be due to the large effects of RV preload, RV afterload, and RA compliance on the amount of TR.

### Noninvasive estimation of both systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure from Doppler analysis of tricuspid regurgitant velocity spectrum in patients with chronic heart failure [^114cR4qS]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Noninvasive estimation of pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures usually requires the investigation of both tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitant jets, along with an estimate of right atrial pressure. A new noninvasive method has been described to obtain pulmonary diastolic pressure based solely on the analysis of tricuspid regurgitation. This method leverages the hemodynamic concept that right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure are equal at the time of pulmonary valve opening. This approach was initially tested in a small cohort of patients, and we sought to verify its accuracy in a larger population of heart failure patients.

- **Methods**: An estimate of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was derived by transposing the pulmonary opening time — from the onset of the R wave on the electrocardiographic tracing to the beginning of pulmonic forward flow on Doppler examination — onto the tricuspid regurgitant velocity curve. The pulmonary artery diastolic pressure value was calculated as the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and right atrium at this time. The study group comprised 86 consecutive patients (64 men, aged 52 ± 11 years) with heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥ II, 94%) who were in stable clinical condition, predominantly with idiopathic (57%), ischemic (24%), or other forms (13%) of dilated cardiomyopathy. Noninvasive right-sided pressures were compared with invasive measurements obtained during right heart catheterization performed within 24 hours. The Bland and Altman graphic method was employed, along with the calculation of…

### Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116X984w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Data from this study address controversy on the mPAP level required to capture clinical risk in patients referred for RHC or echocardiography using a meta-analysis, which is the optimal research tool for determining aggregate risk across study populations. We report that mildly elevated PA pressures, estimated by either echocardiography or invasive catheterization, are associated with a 19% increased risk of mortality over 5 years. Despite analyzing both community-based and referral populations with varying underlying comorbidities, there was only mild statistical heterogeneity of risk across the included studies. This suggests a truly generalizable association between mild PH and mortality. These data support the ongoing efforts to identify optimal cutoffs for hemodynamic parameters in PH, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, to identify at-risk populations earlier.

A notable finding of this study is the consistent association between mild PH and increased mortality when PA pressure was measured by either RHC or echocardiography. Although RHC is the only test available to diagnose PH, echocardiography is the preferred screening test for at-risk patients. Guidelines recommend further evaluation of patients for PH if the tricuspid regurgitation velocity is > 2.9 m/s (corresponding to PASP > ≈40 mm Hg). However, our findings demonstrate that PA pressure assessed by echocardiography, at levels currently considered to be below the range of clinical significance (tricuspid regurgitation velocity ≈ > 2.5 m/s, PASP > 35 mm Hg).

### Usefulness of the sum of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure as a congestion index that prognosticates heart failure survival (from the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness Trial) [^111pgnU6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) trial, the use of a pulmonary artery catheter did not significantly affect advanced heart failure outcomes. However, the success of achieving the targeted hemodynamic goals of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 15 mm Hg and right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mm Hg, and the association of these goals with clinical outcomes, were not addressed. Furthermore, goals with two independent variables, PCWP and RAP, left room for uncertainties.

We assessed the ability of a single hemodynamic target to achieve a threshold sum of PCWP and RAP as a predictor of all-cause mortality, death-or-transplantation (DT), or death-or-rehospitalization (DR) at six months in the pulmonary artery catheter-guided treatment arm of ESCAPE (n = 206). Patients with a post-treatment PCWP + RAP of < 30 mm Hg had characteristics similar to those of the population who achieved the ESCAPE hemodynamic goals. This group had 8.7% mortality, 13.0% DT, and 58.7% DR at six months.

The contrasting cohort with PCWP + RAP of ≥ 30 mm Hg showed significantly worse outcomes, with 45.3% mortality, 54.7% DT, and 84.9% DR at six months. This group also had a greater relative risk (RR) of death (RR 5.76), DT (RR 4.92), and DR (RR 1.80), as well as a higher prevalence of jugular venous pulsation, edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites at admission and discharge.

In conclusion, a post-treatment PCWP + RAP of 30 mm Hg or less, obtained early in the index hospitalization, may serve as a simple congestion index with prognostic value for heart failure survival and readmission rates at six months.

### Assessment of right ventricular adaptability to loading conditions can improve the timing of listing to transplantation in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113JfjEb]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Right ventricle (RV) performance is load dependent, and right-sided heart failure (RHF) is the main cause of death in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prediction of RV worsening for timely identification of patients needing transplantation (Tx) is paramount. Assessment of RV adaptability to load has proved useful in certain clinical circumstances. This study assessed its predictive value for RHF-free and Tx-free outcomes with PAH.

- **Methods**: Between 2006 and 2012, all potential Tx candidates with PAH, without RHF at the first evaluation, were selected for follow-up (except congenital heart diseases). At selection and at each follow-up, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and the 6-minute walk distance were measured. RV adaptability to load was assessed by echocardiography. Collected data were tested for the ability to predict RV stability and Tx-free survival.

- **Results**: During a 12-month to 92-month follow-up, RHF developed in 23 of 79 evaluated patients, despite similar medication and no differences in initial RV size and ejection fraction compared with the patients who remained stable. However, unstable patients had an initially lower RV load-adaptation index and afterload-corrected peak global systolic longitudinal strain-rate values, as well as higher RV dyssynchrony, tricuspid regurgitation, and NT-proBNP levels (p ≤ 0.01). At certain cutoff values, these variables appeared predictive for 1-year and 3-year freedom from RHF and 3-year Tx-free survival. An RV load-adaptation index reduction of ≥ 20% showed the highest predictive value for outcomes.

### The multiple systemic artery to pulmonary artery fistulas resulting in severe irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension in patient with previous history of pneumothorax [^116bcW5k]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Systemic artery to pulmonary artery fistulas (SA-PAFs) are extremely rare in individuals without congenital heart disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been reported in a single case within this patient group. We describe a case of multiple SA-PAFs, which caused severe non-reversible arterial pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a right-sided pneumothorax 35 years earlier.

- **Case presentation**: A 52-year-old Caucasian male with echocardiographically confirmed pulmonary hypertension (PH) was admitted to the cardiology department due to exertional dyspnea and signs of right ventricular failure. Routine screening for causes of secondary PH was negative. Right heart catheterization (RHC) confirmed a high degree of arterial PH [mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP): 50.6 mmHg, pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP): 11.3 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR): 11.9 Wood's units (WU)], which was irreversible in tests with inhaled nitric oxide. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) of blood samples obtained during the first RHC ranged from 69.3% to 73.2%. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed, and treatment with inhaled iloprost and sildenafil was initiated. Control RHC, performed 5 months later, showed increased values of mPAP (59.7 mmHg) and PVR (13.4 WU) compared to initial measurements; SaO2 of blood obtained during RHC from the upper lobe artery of the right lung was elevated to 89.7%. Following this, pulmonary arteriography was performed, indicating a lack of contrast in the right upper lobe artery with evidence of retrograde blood flow visible as a negative contrast.

### Impaired right atrial function preceding right ventricular systolic dysfunction: Clinical utility and long-term prognostic value in pulmonary hypertension [^114CXFwf]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 106 precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) were included in the study. Four individuals were excluded due to atrial fibrillation, and six due to insufficient cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image quality. Among the included patients, 68 had pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and 28 had chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The final analysis cohort comprised 36 PH patients without right ventricular systolic dysfunction (PH-nonRVSD), 60 PH patients with right ventricular systolic dysfunction (PH-RVSD), and 20 healthy controls (HCs). The interval between RHC and CMR was 6 (1–12) days.

Patients in the PH-nonRVSD group were significantly older than those in the PH-RVSD group (p = 0.005). PH-RVSD patients presented with higher B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) serum levels (p < 0.001) and a shorter 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) (p = 0.049). Among the RHC parameters, the PH-RVSD group demonstrated a significantly lower cardiac index (CI) (p = 0.004) and higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (p < 0.001) than the PH-nonRVSD group.

- **Key findings**
- **Patient characteristics**: This study highlighted critical differences in patient demographics and health metrics between PH-nonRVSD and PH-RVSD groups.
- **Right heart catheterization parameters**: The evaluation of RHC data showed variations in CI and PVR between the two groups, indicating different levels of cardiac function impairment.

Fig. 2 provides a patient flowchart detailing these categories and parameters, including acronyms such as RHC, CMR, RVEF (right ventricular ejection fraction), and distinctions between the PH-nonRVSD and PH-RVSD groups.

### Ventavis [^114RM6NJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and Precautions**: Hypotension leading to syncope has been observed. Monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. Ventavis should not be administered to patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Pulmonary venous hypertension: Discontinue if pulmonary edema is present. May cause bronchospasm; patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease may be more sensitive.

- **Risk of Syncope**: Monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. Do not initiate Ventavis in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Syncope can also occur in association with pulmonary arterial hypertension, particularly in association with physical exertion. The occurrence of exertional syncope may reflect a therapeutic gap or insufficient efficacy, and the need to adjust dose or change therapy should be considered.

- **Pulmonary Venous Hypertension**: Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when inhaled Ventavis is administered to patients with pulmonary hypertension, stop treatment immediately, as this may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension.

- **Bronchospasm**: Ventavis inhalation can induce bronchospasm. Bronchospasm may be more severe or frequent in patients with a history of hyperreactive airways. Ventavis has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or acute pulmonary infections.

### Novel scoring tool of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension for defining severity of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn [^115MDjeZ]. Journal of perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

The PH component of the HRF/PH score analyzed the first complete echocardiogram for the interventricular septum (IVS) position, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVsP), and presence of right ventricular dysfunction. If the echocardiogram report available in the chart did not contain all of these components, the echocardiogram was reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist (SS) on the research team to provide the missing data and validate measurements.

IVS position has been correlated to the degree of right ventricular pressures. Specifically, with increasing right ventricular pressures, the short axis geometry of the left ventricle is distorted and leads to progressive flattening of the IVS during systole. As such, the IVS position was scored from 0–3 based on its position in the parasternal short axis.

TAPSE, which was measured from a standard apical 4-chamber window and graded from 0–3 based on the numerical measurement, quantifies the systolic excursion of the tricuspid annulus in the longitudinal direction of the right ventricular free wall and represents a right ventricular longitudinal function.

The RVsP was calculated and graded from 0–3 based on the peak tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity and the use of the simplified Bernoulli equation: RVsP = 4(v)², where v is the peak velocity of the tricuspid valve regurgitant jet measured in meters/second. The tricuspid jet was determined either in the parasternal short axis or the apical 4-chamber — whichever image provided the most complete Doppler waveform.

### Epiphenomenon or prognostically relevant interventional target? A novel proportionality framework for severe tricuspid regurgitation [^115uuSoG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

A conceptual framework is proposed to assess whether tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a relevant interventional target or merely an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with pulmonary hypertension. This framework highlights the potential for targeted interventions.

A novel proportionality framework corrects the degree of TR severity using the ratio of tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area (TV EROA) to mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP). The findings indicate that patients with a TV EROA/mPAP ratio greater than 1.25 mm²/mm Hg, defined as having disproportionate TR, exhibit significantly better 2-year survival rates after transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) than patients with proportionate TR (69.6% [95% CI, 64.0–75.6] compared to 56.6% [95% CI, 47.5–67.5]; P = 0.005).

This research supports the idea that targeted interventions for disproportionate TR could lead to improved survival outcomes in affected patients.

### Does lowering pulmonary arterial pressure eliminate severe functional tricuspid regurgitation? Insights from pulmonary thromboendarterectomy [^1146CSRD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Because pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) can result in an immediate reduction in pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, we sought to evaluate the effect of PTE on severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) without tricuspid annuloplasty.

Few data exist regarding the frequency and magnitude of functional TR improvement after reduction in PA pressure. We identified 27 patients with severe TR, defined by a regurgitant index (RI) greater than 33%, who underwent PTE. The RI, tricuspid annular diameter (TAD), apical displacement of leaflet coaptation, and estimated PA systolic pressure were determined on pre- and post-PTE echocardiograms. Patients were stratified based on resolution (RI 33%) of severe TR.

Comparing pre- and post-PTE echocardiography results, severe TR resolved in 19 of 27 (70%) patients. This group had a more effective PA systolic pressure reduction after PTE (49 ± 20 mm Hg vs. 32 ± 16 mm Hg by echocardiography, p = 0.075, and 37 ± 16 mm Hg vs. 16 ± 13 mm Hg by catheter measurement, p = 0.004). No difference was observed in TAD, apical displacement of the tricuspid valve, or other features compared with the group with persistent severe TR. There was a trend toward longer hospital stays in the group with persistent severe TR (19 ± 15 days vs. 14 ± 9 days; p = 0.55).

After significant PA pressure reduction by PTE, severe functional TR with a dilated annulus may improve without annuloplasty despite dilated tricuspid annulus diameters.

### Further support for the vascular aetiology of Poland syndrome — a case report [^1168WrMR]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The aetiology of Poland syndrome remains unclear. It has been postulated that a developmentally normal foetus experiences a destructive process that subsequently results in cascading consequences, eventually resulting in its characteristic features. We report the case of a male patient with Poland's anomaly who presented at birth with a large lymphangioma also affecting the right side of his chest. We propose that the pressure exerted by the space-occupying lesion during embryological development lends further support to the existence of a subclavian artery supply disruption sequence as the causative insult.

### Echocardiographic Doppler estimation of pulmonary artery pressure in critically ill patients with severe hypoxemia [^115pJyF5]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

In spontaneously breathing cardiac patients, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) can be accurately estimated from the transthoracic Doppler study of pulmonary artery and tricuspid regurgitation blood flows. However, in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury, the presence of gas between the probe and the heart renders the transthoracic approach problematic. This study aimed to determine whether the transesophageal approach could offer an alternative.

- **Methods**: Fifty-one consecutive sedated and ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen < 300) were prospectively studied. Mean PAP measured from the pulmonary artery catheter was compared with several indices characterizing pulmonary artery blood flow assessed using transesophageal echocardiography: preejection time, acceleration time, ejection duration, preejection time on ejection duration ratio, and acceleration time on ejection duration ratio. In a subgroup of 20 patients, systolic PAP measured from the pulmonary artery catheter immediately before withdrawal was compared with Doppler study of regurgitation tricuspid flow performed immediately after pulmonary artery catheter withdrawal using either the transthoracic or the transesophageal approach.

- **Results**: Weak and clinically irrelevant correlations were found between mean PAP and indices of pulmonary artery flow. However, a statistically significant and clinically relevant correlation was found between systolic PAP and regurgitation tricuspid flow. In three patients (14%), pulmonary artery pr

### Tracleer [^115jdgFD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of bosentan was evaluated in an open-label, uncontrolled study involving 19 pediatric patients with PAH aged 3 to 15 years. Patients had either primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 10) or PAH related to congenital heart diseases (9 patients) and were classified as WHO functional class II (n = 15, 79%) or class III (n = 4, 21%) at baseline. Patients received bosentan at approximately 2 mg/kg twice daily (body weight adjusted dose, corresponding to the recommended adult dose) for 12 weeks. Half of the patients in each group were already being treated with intravenous epoprostenol, and the dose of epoprostenol remained constant throughout the study.

Hemodynamics were measured in 17 patients, revealing a mean decrease in PVR of 389 dyn∙sec∙cm-5, which was similar to the effect observed in adults. Hemodynamic improvements from baseline were similar regardless of whether epoprostenol was co-administered.

A small study involving 54 adult patients with Eisenmenger physiology and its open-label extension with 37 patients, conducted over up to 40 weeks, demonstrated that the effects of Tracleer on exercise and safety were similar to those observed in other trials involving patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).

- **Lack of benefit in congestive heart failure**: Tracleer is not effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. In two studies, involving 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, the findings were consistent.

### Porcine model of the arterial switch operation: Implications for unique strategies in the management of hypoplastic left ventricles [^112Po3W7]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

There are no reports on the performance of the arterial switch operation (ASO) in a normal heart with normally related great vessels. The objective of this study was to determine whether the ASO could be performed in a healthy animal model. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and coronary translocation techniques were used to perform ASO in neonatal piglets or a staged ASO with prior main pulmonary artery (PA) banding. Primary ASO was performed in four neonatal piglets.

Coronary translocation was effective, with angiograms confirming patency. However, piglets could not be weaned from CPB due to right ventricle (RV) dysfunction. To improve RV function for the ASO, nine piglets had PA banding, and all survived the procedure. Post-banding RV pressure increased from a mean of 20.3 ± 2.2 mmHg to 36.5 ± 7.3 mmHg (p = 0.007). At 58 ± 1 days post-banding, piglets underwent cardiac MRIs revealing RV hypertrophy and RV pressure overload with mildly reduced RV function. Catheterization confirmed RV systolic pressures of 84.0 ± 6.7 mmHg with LV systolic pressure 83.3 ± 6.7 mmHg (p = 0.43).

The remaining five PA-banded piglets underwent ASO at 51 ± 0 days post-banding. Three of five were weaned from bypass with patent coronary arteries and adequate RV function. We successfully performed an arterial switch with documented patent coronary arteries on standard anatomy great vessels in a healthy animal model. To our knowledge, this is the first time this procedure has been successfully performed. The model may have implications for studying the failing systemic RV and may support a novel approach for the management of hypoplastic left ventricles.

### Reliability of noninvasive assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure by Doppler echocardiography compared to right heart catheterization: Analysis in a large patient population [^114AxoQK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Potential sources of error for the sPAP assessment with Doppler echocardiography were already discussed by Yock and Popp and commented on in subsequent studies. In our study, we documented a series of sources of error in an offline analysis of all cases, with significant overestimation or underestimation of sPAP. Contrary to previous assertions, characteristics of the inferior vena cava were not the main reason for inaccuracies. Instead, the errors were mainly due to the many pitfalls inherent to the Doppler method. Optimal settings when assessing tricuspid regurgitation velocities should be taken into account, and further pitfalls should be kept in mind.

- **Sources of error**: Stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve, or the pulmonary trunk may lead to systematic overestimation of right ventricular systolic pressure. Severe tricuspid insufficiency may lead to underestimation as pressure gradients decrease with an increasing effective regurgitant orifice area. Furthermore, since the absence of tricuspid regurgitation does not rule out pulmonary hypertension, the presence of indirect signs must be observed.

Based on our experience, the following aspects should be considered for best results:

1. Since the angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of flow must be kept to a minimum, tricuspid regurgitation should first be detected with color Doppler from the best ultrasound view, and multiple transducer positions may be necessary.
2. Settings should be correct.

In summary, to improve accuracy, careful attention to the Doppler echocardiography method and consideration of alternative views and settings is essential in accurately assessing systolic pulmonary artery pressure.

### Two simple echo-Doppler measurements can accurately identify pulmonary hypertension in the large majority of patients with chronic heart failure [^116xCyVz]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The assessment of pulmonary hypertension in patients with heart failure is of great clinical importance not only for diagnostic purposes but also for prognostication. This study was undertaken on a consecutive basis with a group of patients with chronic heart failure. Patients were evaluated for their suitability for heart transplantation to explore the diagnostic accuracy of several echo-Doppler parameters of pulmonary hemodynamics in predicting the presence of elevated pulmonary artery pressure, defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥ 35 mmHg and mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg. Additionally, the study aimed to assess the diagnostic ability of the same parameters to identify patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and to evaluate the influence of right ventricular function and degree of tricuspid regurgitation in modifying diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

Echo-Doppler examination and right heart catheterization were performed consecutively within 24 hours in 86 patients. The optimal cut-off value for a series of echo-Doppler parameters capable of identifying patients with pulmonary hypertension was obtained by dividing the entire sample into two groups. The optimal threshold (highest sensitivity and specificity) of the echo and Doppler parameters used to classify patients with and without pulmonary hypertension was determined in 67% of cases by means of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which served as the testing sample. The proportion of cases classified correctly according to the selected cut-off was computed.

### The multiple systemic artery to pulmonary artery fistulas resulting in severe irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension in patient with previous history of pneumothorax [^117LvPQv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Echocardiography showed features of severe pulmonary hypertension: right ventricle enlargement to 44 mm (four-chamber view) with depressed function of the right ventricle TAPSE 9 mm; right atrium area enlargement to 40 cm²; severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (++++); increased calculated RVSP to 112 mmHg; shortened pulmonary artery acceleration time to 60 ms; and mild pericardial effusion. There was no interventricular septum defect. Trans-esophageal echocardiography did not show a defect in the atrial septum, which was later confirmed by angio-CT.

- **Figure 1: Angio-CT**: Preserved continuity of the atrial septum, high degree enlargement of the right atrium, and ventricle. RA: right atrium; RV: right ventricle; LA: left atrium; LV: left ventricle.

The SaO₂ of blood obtained from the radial artery was reduced to 87.8%. Right heart catheterization was performed. SaO₂ of blood samples obtained during RHC from the vena cava superior, vena cava inferior, right atrium, pulmonary trunk, middle lobe artery of the right lung, and left pulmonary artery amounted, respectively, to: 64.8%; 77.4%; 73.2%; 70.2%; 69.3%; and 71.2%, which did not indicate the presence of a left-to-right shunt.

- **Hemodynamic measurements** showed severe precapillary pulmonary hypertension, irreversible in vasoreactivity testing with inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm) and a combination of oral sildenafil (50 mg) and inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm).

- **Results of pulmonary arterial hypertension reversibility test**: PAPs (systolic pulmonary artery pressure); PAPd (diastolic pulmonary artery pressure); mPAP (mean pulmonary artery pressure).

### Pulsatile vascular afterload measurement improves prediction of right-sided heart dysfunction in undifferentiated and left-sided pulmonary hypertension [^115x5Gnn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Detailed phenotyping of vascular afterload has previously provided important insights into healthy and cardiovascular disease states affecting the systemic circulation. In contrast, relatively less is known about the pulmonary vascular bed. The pulmonary circulation receives the same blood flow from the heart with the same periodicity; however, the similarities end there. Anatomically, path lengths along vascular segments are shorter and more symmetrical, exhibiting tapering at the point of bifurcation, are elliptical in cross-section, have thinner walls, and exhibit no well-developed arterioles. Functionally, the normal pulmonary vascular bed is a low-pressure, low-resistance, high-compliance system capable of accommodating large increases in blood flow with minimal elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). As pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops, the pulmonary vascular bed becomes a high-pressure, high-resistance, low-compliance circuit. This may be attributable to cellular proliferation, progressive vascular remodeling, vasoconstriction, deposition of thrombus in the pulmonary artery (PA), or any combination of these. Historically, it has been shown that a main contributor to the differences in right ventricular (RV) afterload sensitivities does not reside with the right ventricle but, rather, in the nature of the PA loading systems.

- **Clinical applications**: Interest in how to quantify pulmonary vascular afterload hemodynamics and RV contractile properties, and how these combine to determine RV–PA coupling, has resurfaced in recent years, particularly with the introduction of prostacyclin and its analogs, inhaled nitric oxide, and oral therapies.

### Identification of rare variants in patients with Williams syndrome and severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis [^116bDkpk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

During cardiac catheterization, pulmonary arteriography revealed diffuse stenosis of the pulmonary artery with a thin peripheral side. The diameters of the narrowest portion of the left and right pulmonary arteries were 0.9 and 1.2 mm, respectively. Additionally, an aneurysm was observed in the left pulmonary artery, a site on the peripheral side of the stenotic region (Figure 1A). Chest contrast computed tomography showed flattening of the ventricular septum due to increased right ventricular pressure (Figure 1B). Pulmonary blood flow scintigraphy showed a heterogeneous blood flow deficit (Figure 1C). Catheterization also revealed elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (105/38 mm Hg, mean 66 mm Hg) with a cardiac index of 2.0 L/min∙m². Systolic right and left ventricular pressures were 103 and 120 mm Hg, respectively.

- **Imaging findings of Proband‐1 with severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis**:
	- A, Pulmonary angiography reveals diffuse, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary artery aneurysm formation. The right middle lobe of the lung was resected at the age of 12 years. B, Chest contrast computed tomography shows flattening of the ventricular septum due to increased right ventricular pressure. C, Pulmonary blood flow scintigraphy shows a heterogeneous blood flow defect.

We first considered whether percutaneous transluminal pulmonary angioplasty was feasible for this condition. However, we were concerned about new aneurysms developing and the risk of bleeding owing to the sudden high pressure on the peripheral side after percutaneous transluminal pulmonary…

### Embolization treatment of right pulmonary artery agenesis with patent ductus arteriosus causing pulmonary hypertension and hemoptysis: A case report and literature review [^111nrxmV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Children with pulmonary artery agenesis (PAA) may develop recurrent pulmonary infections (37%), reduced exercise tolerance (40%), pulmonary hypertension (44%), and hemoptysis (20%) as they age, or they may remain asymptomatic until adulthood. Physical examination may reveal chest asymmetry and abnormal breath sounds on the affected side, with a generally normal electrocardiogram.

When a chest X-ray shows increased lung transparency, lung hypoplasia, contralateral displacement of the trachea, and fewer pulmonary vascular segments, coupled with fine linear opacities in the peripheral lung, suspicion of PAA is high. However, it needs to be differentiated from diseases causing diffuse changes in one lung field, such as bronchiectasis, hypoplastic lung, scimitar syndrome, Swyer-James syndrome, mediastinal tumor, fibrotic mediastinitis, and pulmonary venous occlusive disease.

CT three-dimensional reconstruction is an important preoperative diagnostic method; angiography is reserved for individuals requiring surgical intervention due to its invasiveness. Common methods for measuring pulmonary artery pressure include the tricuspid regurgitation velocity method, pulmonary valve regurgitation method, and intracardiac shunt method. Right ventricular enlargement and thickening, as well as widening of the right ventricular outflow tract, are suggestive but lack diagnostic significance for patients with unilateral absence of a pathway in the pulmonary artery. In this case study, the patient's right subclavian artery systolic pressure was utilized, along with the catheter left-to-right shunt pressure difference, for estimation.

### Clinical care for cardiovascular disease in patients with Williams-Beuren Syndrome [^112FTefZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

In most centers, surgical repair of pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) is limited to patch augmentation of the proximal pulmonary arteries using a hilum-to-hilum, autologous pericardial patch. The peripheral pulmonary arteries beyond the hilum, those in the lung parenchyma beyond the first bifurcation of the right and left branch pulmonary arteries, have been considered beyond the reach of conventional surgical techniques. However, the newer technique of multilevel surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction addresses the predominant stenoses at bifurcation points beyond the hilum and normalizes right ventricular pressure, unlike the hilum-to-hilum technique.

Patients with Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) and PAS need lifelong follow-up with regular echocardiographic imaging. If patients have residual lesions after intervention for PAS, such as pulmonary valve insufficiency, they may require reintervention if they become symptomatic or have progression of the lesions. Those with mild valvar or mild residual PAS likely can be seen every 5 years. While acknowledging most patients with WBS do not undertake rigorous exercise, there should be no restrictions to exercise among those with mild residual PAS. Those with moderate PAS accompanied by right ventricular hypertension should avoid high-intensity and static sports, whereas those with severe stenoses and right ventricular hypertension should be restricted from all but the lowest intensity sports.

- **Recommendations for clinical management of pulmonary artery stenosis**:

	- Transcatheter interventions for native peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis are not recommended.

### Long-term clinical outcomes in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation [^1161zttR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular pressure overload, leading to the progression of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Conversely, TR may be a cause of pulmonary hypertension. With increasing TR, the right ventricle dilates and causes increased right ventricular diastolic pressure and, in advanced situations, a shift of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle. Such ventricular interdependence might cause restricted left ventricular filling and elevated left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure and pulmonary artery pressure. Butcher et al. reported that TR reduces cardiac output and adversely affects renal function via a reduced left ventricular end‐diastolic volume attributable to right ventricular enlargement. However, it is difficult to determine whether pulmonary hypertension was a cause or a consequence of the TR.

Left atrial enlargement is caused by volume and pressure loading of the left atrium. The left atrial volume index (LAVi) has been used not only to assess left atrial enlargement but also as a measure of left ventricular diastolic capacity. Although TR is not directly related to left atrial dilation, atrial fibrillation or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction may be related to ventricular septal exhaustion, similar to the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension. The combined use of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, which reflect right ventricle–pulmonary artery coupling, is also reportedly a poor prognostic indicator in these conditions.

In summary, the complex interplay between TR and pulmonary hypertension results in significant cardiac and multiorgan implications, necessitating further research to elucidate these relationships fully.

### Effects of morphologic left ventricular pressure on right ventricular geometry and tricuspid valve regurgitation in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries [^117D5CHX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is associated with tricuspid regurgitation (TR), which has been postulated to arise from the effect of ventricular septal position on the attachments of the tricuspid valve. This study was performed to determine the effect of left ventricular (LV) pressure on right ventricular (RV) and LV geometry and the degree of TR. Serial echocardiograms were reviewed from 30 patients with CCTGA who underwent pulmonary artery banding to train the morphologic left ventricle (n = 14) or left ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit placement and ventricular septal defect closure in conjunction with physiologic repair (n = 16).

- **Degree of TR and pressure changes**: The degree of TR, the LV/RV pressure ratio, RV and LV sphericity indexes, and tricuspid valve tethering distance and coaptation length were analyzed. After pulmonary artery banding, an increase in LV systolic pressure to ≥ 2/3 systemic resulted in a decrease in TR from severe to moderate (p = 0.02). The percentage of patients with severe TR decreased from 64% to 18% (p = 0.06). The RV sphericity index decreased (p = 0.05), and the LV sphericity index increased (p = 0.02).

- **Impact of conduit placement**: After left ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit placement, a decrease in LV pressure to ≤ 1/2 systemic resulted in an increase in TR from none to mild (p = 0.003).

In conclusion, these data indicate that LV pressure in patients with CCTGA affects the degree of TR and that septal shift caused by changes in LV and RV pressure is an important mechanism.

### Evaluation study of congestive heart failure and pulmonary artery catheterization effectiveness: the ESCAPE trial [^116kBN3W]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) have been used to guide therapy in multiple settings, but recent studies have raised concerns that PACs may lead to increased mortality in hospitalized patients.

- **Objective**: To determine whether PAC use is safe and improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with severe symptomatic heart failure.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) was a randomized controlled trial of 433 patients at 26 sites conducted from January 18, 2000, to November 17, 2003. Patients were assigned to receive therapy guided by clinical assessment and a PAC or clinical assessment alone. The target in both groups was resolution of clinical congestion, with additional PAC targets of a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg and a right atrial pressure of 8 mm Hg. Medications were not specified, but inotrope use was explicitly discouraged.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary endpoint was days alive out of the hospital during the first 6 months, with secondary endpoints of exercise, quality of life, biochemical, and echocardiographic changes.

- **Results**: Severity of illness was reflected by the following values: average left ventricular ejection fraction, 19%; systolic blood pressure, 106 mm Hg; sodium level, 137 mEq/L; urea nitrogen, 35 mg/dL (12.40 mmol/L); and creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 micromol/L). Therapy in both groups led to substantial reduction in symptoms, jugular venous pressure, and edema. Use of the PAC did not sign.

### Risk factors for progression of functional tricuspid regurgitation [^115dqzZX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) progression in a contemporary population of patients referred for echocardiography. In a case-control study, we compared 100 consecutive patients with TR progression on serial echocardiograms (trivial or mild TR on the first echocardiogram and moderate or severe functional TR on a follow-up echocardiogram) with 100 patients matched for age and gender, having mild TR at baseline and no TR progression. The mean age was 72 ± 10 years, 55% were males, and the time to TR progression was 5.3 ± 2.9 years. Less than 10% had rheumatic heart disease.

Left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved (≥ 50%) in 85% of the TR progression group and in 74% of the control group (p = 0.06). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased from 41 ± 16 to 56 ± 18 mm Hg in the TR progression group and decreased from 44 ± 13 to 41 ± 11 mm Hg in the control group (p < 0.0001). Independent risk factors for TR progression were pulmonary artery systolic pressure change during follow-up (odds ratio per 1 mm Hg 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.23, p < 0.0001), permanent atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 14.3, 95% confidence interval 4.6 to 44.2, p < 0.0001), and coronary artery disease (odds ratio 5.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 22.8, p = 0.015).

All-cause mortality at 3 years was 20% for patients without TR progression, 42% for moderate TR, and 63% for severe TR (p < 0.0001). Progression to severe TR independently predicted subsequent mortality. In conclusion, in patients with a low prevalence of rheumatic heart disease…

### The hemodynamic basis of exercise intolerance in tricuspid regurgitation [^1126MEjH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) frequently present with exertional fatigue and dyspnea. However, the hemodynamic basis for exercise limitation in individuals with TR remains unclear.

- **Methods and results**: Twelve subjects with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and grade ≥ 3 TR underwent high-fidelity invasive hemodynamic exercise testing with simultaneous expired gas analysis. These subjects were compared with 13 age- and sex-matched controls. At rest, TR subjects had lower pulmonary blood flow (3.6 ± 0.4 vs. 5.1 ± 1.9 L/min; P = 0.01), increased right atrial pressure (12 ± 5 vs. 4 ± 1 mm Hg; P = 0.0002), and higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (17 ± 5 vs. 9 ± 3 mm Hg; P = 0.0001). However, LV transmural pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure minus right atrial pressure), which reflects LV preload independent of right heart congestion and pericardial restraint, was similar in TR subjects and controls (6 ± 3 vs. 4 ± 2 mm Hg; P = 0.3).

	- With exercise, TR subjects displayed lower peak VO2 (10.3 ± 2.8 vs. 13.8 ± 4.2 mL/min per kg; P = 0.02), lower pulmonary blood flow (6.4 ± 1.3 vs. 10.3 ± 3.3 L/min; P = 0.001), and a less pronounced increase in pulmonary blood flow relative to VO2 (+4.6 ± 1.1 vs. +6.2 ± 0.7; P = 0.001). TR subjects exhibited higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with exercise, solely due to RA hypertension (27 ± 9 vs. 8 ± 3 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), as LV transmural pressure decreased with exercise in subjects with TR (-5 ± 6 vs. +3 ± 3 mm Hg; P = 0.0007), suggesting inadequate LV diastolic filling despite high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

### Revatio [^112hZadk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Revatio (SUPER-1) was conducted in 277 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of ≥ 25 mmHg at rest with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of < 15 mmHg. Patients were predominantly classified as WHO Functional Classes II-III. Allowed background therapy included a combination of anticoagulants, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and oxygen. The use of prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and arginine supplementation was not permitted, and patients who had failed to respond to bosentan were excluded. Furthermore, patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 45% or a left ventricular shortening fraction of less than 0.2 were not studied.

Patients were randomized to receive either a placebo (n = 70) or Revatio at doses of 20 mg (n = 69), 40 mg (n = 67), or 80 mg (n = 71) three times a day for a period of 12 weeks. They had either primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) (63%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (30%), or PAH following surgical repair of left-to-right congenital heart lesions (7%). The study population consisted of 25% men and 75% women with a mean age of 49 years (ranging from 18 to 81 years) and a baseline 6-minute walk distance between 100 and 450 meters, with a mean distance of 343 meters.

### Doppler trans-thoracic echocardiography for detection of pulmonary hypertension in adults [^111LL11z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to a substantial loss of exercise capacity. PH ultimately results in right ventricular overload, subsequent heart failure, and early death. Although early detection and treatment of PH are recommended, due to the limited responsiveness to therapy at late disease stages, many patients receive a diagnosis at a later stage because symptoms and signs of PH are nonspecific in early stages. While direct pressure measurement using right-heart catheterisation is the clinical reference standard for PH, its invasiveness and potential complications mean it is not routinely utilized. Trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography is less invasive, more cost-effective, and widely available compared to right-heart catheterisation; thus, guidelines recommend echocardiography as an initial diagnostic approach. However, several studies have questioned the accuracy of noninvasively measured pulmonary artery pressure, leading to substantial uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography for diagnosing PH.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography for detecting PH.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to August 2021, reference lists of articles, and contacted study authors. We applied no restrictions on language or type of publication.
