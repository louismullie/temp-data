## Question

What about in pediatrics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what special considerations are needed in pediatrics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about developmental biology and pharmacology across ages. Then, I should verify the unique evidence gaps and their impact on care. Next, I will examine pediatric-specific clinical guidelines and implementation issues. After that, I need to review decision-making, ethics, and consent in children. Finally, I will consider research methodology and systems-level implications, and synthesize a concise framework that integrates these domains with concrete examples and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: children are not just small adults; their physiology, pharmacokinetics, and developmental trajectories meaningfully alter disease expression, drug handling, and responses to interventions, so I need to ensure all decisions are age- and development-informed rather than simple adult extrapolations [^114Eb5f8] [^111g5DP8] [^116qjkic].

> Wait, let me verify the developmental domains I must cover: maturation of hepatic and renal clearance, blood–brain barrier, and coagulation pathways; the need for weight- or surface area–based dosing and often pediatric formulations; and age-stratified thresholds and equipment, which are recurrent themes across therapeutics, imaging, and critical care, including renal-excreted DOACs and liver MRI protocols that vary by age and size [^115WfuNi] [^116ZCpt6] [^117Rmhh4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "evidence-based" care being uniformly applicable; I should double-check the magnitude of the pediatric evidence gap, because systematic reviews repeatedly show fewer pediatric RCTs, delayed pediatric labeling by roughly eight years, and methodological limitations in pediatric systematic reviews that reduce confidence and usability at the bedside [^115Q1CEa] [^114zJvQM] [^114cV7fw].

> I will now examine pharmacologic considerations, especially anticoagulation, where pediatric-specific data are emerging but still sparse; let me consider that enoxaparin dosing in obesity may require lower weight-adjusted doses to avoid supratherapeutic anti-Xa levels, DOAC pediatric approvals rely on exposure-matching from adults with age-specific dose selection, and guidance remains conditional due to very low certainty, which reinforces careful selection and monitoring in children [^114xZra7] [^116ZCpt6] [^112ivh2D].

> Next, I should review guideline signals across conditions to see which pediatric-specific recommendations stand out; for pediatric VTE, the 2024 ASH/ISTH update uses conditional recommendations for anticoagulation duration and for DOACs, explicitly balancing small benefits against uncertain harms and QOL tradeoffs in children, and it calls for more pediatric-specific trials and cost-effectiveness data in diverse settings [^112ejqt4] [^112Jr9FX] [^116JmzL4].

> For respiratory and critical care, I need to check pediatric ARDS guidance: PALICC-2 recommends PEEP titration to oxygenation and compliance with explicit cautions on plateau and driving pressures, avoids routine recruitment maneuvers due to insufficient evidence, and emphasizes ECMO team competencies and simulation-based training, reflecting both physiologic differences and safety culture needs in pediatrics [^112AXsBs] [^112ansiT] [^111s5zxz].

> But wait, what about obesity-specific management; let me verify the AAP 2023 guidance: it calls for intensive, longitudinal, individualized treatment of pediatric obesity, integrating structural and contextual risk factors and aligning with a staged, chronic care approach, with emerging pharmacotherapy data suggesting modest BMI reductions and a need to balance benefits, harms, and developmental stage [^1167NgCg] [^1149kXSQ] [^115Kg33v].

> I should confirm infectious disease nuances too; in COVID-19, pediatric-specific risk stratification and therapy recommendations were derived largely from consensus and limited pediatric data, reinforcing that even during emergencies, pediatric care often relies on indirect or low-certainty evidence, which should temper strong claims and prompt careful monitoring [^117VYvEK] [^113thZNC].

> Now, decision-making and ethics require a pause; shared decision-making in pediatrics is triadic and value-laden, and clinicians should align choices with the best-interests standard while incorporating developmental capacity and family preferences, and in conditions with very low certainty, guideline panels increasingly issue conditional recommendations that require individualized judgment and documentation of values-based choices [^117Wpsbg] [^111apHpa] [^111CnThK].

> I need to ensure pediatric research methodology is not overlooked; PRISMA extensions for children, pediatric-specific CONSORT/SPIRIT items, and pediatric data elements in AI frameworks like ACCEPT-AI signal that design, analysis, and reporting must explicitly account for age subgroups, developmental validity of outcomes, and family-centered considerations to close the evidence gap responsibly [^113EAEmi] [^1125yRs7] [^115yXnK5].

> Let me think about practical, cross-cutting systems issues; device and equipment sizing, age-appropriate formulations, caregiver training, and coordination with schools and social determinants of health are repeatedly emphasized as implementation essentials, from pediatric endoscopy suites to transfusion services and community-based obesity programs, which directly affect safety, adherence, and outcomes [^114Q6pVq] [^1122agez] [^1149kXSQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the unifying clinical framework to avoid a scattered list; the recurring pillars are developmental pharmacology and physiology, the pediatric evidence gap and its consequences for conditional recommendations, age-stratified guidelines and risk tools, ethical shared decision-making with explicit uncertainty communication, and research methodology aligned to pediatric standards, which together shape bedside decisions and research priorities [^114cV7fw] [^112Jr9FX] [^111CnThK].

> To synthesize, I will now distill a practical approach: first, stratify by age and developmental stage to anticipate pharmacokinetic and disease-specific differences; second, assess whether adult-derived guidance is applicable or requires pediatric data, and if the latter is sparse, use conditional, preference-sensitive recommendations; third, apply pediatric-specific guidelines and dose adjustments, monitor closely for efficacy and safety, and adapt as new pediatric evidence emerges; fourth, engage families in shared decision-making that acknowledges uncertainty and aligns with the child's best interests and context; and fifth, contribute to the evidence base by using pediatric-concordant research methods and reporting standards whenever feasible [^115WfuNi] [^112ivh2D] [^1125yRs7].

Pediatric care requires **developmentally tailored approaches** [^111g5DP8] across pharmacology, dosing, and monitoring, with explicit attention to age, weight, and organ maturity [^115WfuNi]. Evidence is often limited, so **extrapolation from adult data** is common but must be justified and verified [^116uuG5W] [^114zJvQM]. Ethical and regulatory frameworks emphasize **assent, family-centered care, and pediatric-specific safety** [^117Wpsbg] [^115yXnK5]. Clinical guidelines and protocols should be pediatric-specific [^notfound], and clinicians must balance benefits and risks while communicating uncertainty transparently with families [^115FmJSF].

---

## Physiological and developmental considerations

- **Growth and development**: Pediatric patients undergo rapid changes in body composition, organ function, and metabolic capacity, necessitating age-appropriate dosing and monitoring strategies [^115WfuNi].

- **Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics**: Drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion differ significantly between children and adults, requiring pediatric-specific dosing regimens and careful therapeutic monitoring [^116ZCpt6].

- **Immature organ systems**: Neonates and infants have immature hepatic and renal systems, affecting drug clearance and increasing susceptibility to adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and research considerations

- **Limited pediatric data**: Many medical interventions lack sufficient pediatric-specific evidence, often necessitating extrapolation from adult studies [^114zJvQM].

- **Ethical considerations**: Pediatric research must balance scientific rigor with ethical obligations, including minimizing risk, obtaining appropriate consent/assent, and ensuring equitable representation [^115yXnK5].

- **Regulatory frameworks**: Pediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs) and Pediatric Study Plans (PSPs) are essential for systematic pediatric drug development and approval processes [^111bMDz5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and best practices

- **Pediatric-specific guidelines**: Clinical guidelines must be tailored to pediatric populations, considering developmental stages, disease prevalence, and treatment response differences [^114cV7fw].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Pediatric care often requires coordination among pediatricians, subspecialists, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers to address complex medical and psychosocial needs [^115X1kif].

- **Family-centered care**: Engaging families in decision-making and providing education and support are critical components of pediatric care [^111apHpa].

---

## Safety and monitoring considerations

- **Adverse event monitoring**: Pediatric patients may experience unique adverse effects, necessitating vigilant monitoring and reporting systems [^notfound].

- **Medication safety**: Pediatric medication errors are common, requiring robust safety protocols, standardized dosing, and clear communication [^notfound].

- **Long-term follow-up**: Many pediatric interventions have long-term consequences, necessitating longitudinal follow-up and outcome assessment [^notfound].

---

## Ethical and legal considerations

Ethical and legal considerations include **informed consent and assent**, which require age-appropriate processes and careful attention to family values and preferences [^115yXnK5]. Pediatric patients are protected by specific legal frameworks that govern medical decision-making, research participation, and child welfare [^notfound]. Equity and access remain critical, as disparities in healthcare access and outcomes must be addressed to ensure fair treatment for all children [^112Jr9FX].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Dosing and administration**: Pediatric dosing must consider age, weight, body surface area, and developmental stage, often requiring specialized formulations and administration techniques [^115WfuNi].

- **Communication strategies**: Clinicians must adapt communication styles to children's developmental levels, ensuring understanding and cooperation [^notfound].

- **Parental involvement**: Parents and caregivers play a crucial role in medication adherence, monitoring, and reporting adverse effects [^notfound].

---

Pediatric care requires **specialized considerations** due to developmental differences, limited evidence, and ethical complexities. Clinicians must apply pediatric-specific guidelines, engage families, and monitor closely to ensure safe, effective care [^112oSwRM].

### Do systematic reviews on pediatric topics need special methodological considerations? [^114cV7fw]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews are key tools to enable decision making by healthcare providers and policymakers. Despite the availability of the evidence based Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-2009 and PRISMA-P 2015) statements that were developed to improve the transparency and quality of reporting of systematic reviews, uncertainty on how to deal with pediatric-specific methodological challenges of systematic reviews impairs decision-making in child health. In this paper, we identify methodological challenges specific to the design, conduct and reporting of pediatric systematic reviews, and propose a process to address these challenges.

Discussion

One fundamental decision at the outset of a systematic review is whether to focus on a pediatric population only, or to include both adult and pediatric populations. Both from the policy and patient care point of view, the appropriateness of interventions and comparators administered to pre-defined pediatric age subgroup is critical. Decisions need to be based on the biological plausibility of differences in treatment effects across the developmental trajectory in children. Synthesis of evidence from different trials is often impaired by the use of outcomes and measurement instruments that differ between trials and are neither relevant nor validated in the pediatric population. Other issues specific to pediatric systematic reviews include lack of pediatric-sensitive search strategies and inconsistent choices of pediatric age subgroups in meta-analyses. In addition to these methodological issues generic to all pediatric systematic reviews, special considerations are required for reviews of health care interventions' safety and efficacy in neonatology, global health, comparative effectiveness interventions and individual participant data meta-analyses. To date, there is no standard approach available to overcome this problem. We propose to develop a consensus-based checklist of essential items which researchers should consider when they are planning (PRISMA-PC-Protocol for Children) or reporting (PRISMA-C-reporting for Children) a pediatric systematic review. Available guidelines including PRISMA do not cover the complexity associated with the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews in the pediatric population; they require additional and modified standards for reporting items. Such guidance will facilitate the translation of knowledge from the literature to bedside care and policy, thereby enhancing delivery of care and improving child health outcomes.

Systematic reviews on pediatric topics need special methodological considerations

Given the methodological differences identified in pediatric systematic reviews, it is evident that they require additional and modified standards with regard to design, conduct and reporting. Differences have been identified in terms of consideration of the pediatric population and targeted pediatric age group(s), intervention, comparator, relevant, valid and feasible outcomes in children. Here, decisions need to be based on the biological plausibility of differences in treatment effects across the developmental trajectory in children. Further issues specific to pediatric systematic reviews include lack of pediatric-sensitive search strategies and inconsistent choices of pediatric age subgroups in meta-analyses.

The need for pediatric-specific items in reporting guidelines was also evident in an international consensus meeting on Standard Protocol Items for Randomized Trials in Children (SPIRIT-C) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials in Children (CONSORT-C) in Toronto in 2014 that agreed on 8 and 14 pediatric-specific extension items, respectively, for the design and conduct (SPIRIT-C) and reporting (CONSORT-C) of pediatric clinical trials. In the same meeting of key stakeholders and experts of pediatric clinical trials, an urgent need of guideline to conduct pediatric-specific systematic reviews was highlighted. Therefore, as the need to enhance high quality primary research in children is more pronounced than ever, there is for a scientific and ethical obligation for standardisation of research protocols, research practice, and reporting standards for pediatric systematic reviews. In addition to the methodological considerations generic to all pediatric systematic reviews, special considerations are required for reviews in neonatology, childhood cancer, global health, community-based interventions and individual participant data meta-analyses.

To date, the available reporting guidelines, including PRISMA (and PRISMA-P), do not adequately cover the complexity associated with systematic reviews in the pediatric population. These child health unique aspects of pediatric systematic reviews, some of which have been addressed in various recent PRISMA extensions (e.g. IPD, Network Meta-Analysis and Equity) and in the SPIRIT-C 2014 Statement, are summarized in the Table 1. It has become clear that they play a decisive role throughout the design, conduct and reporting of high quality pediatric systematic reviews.

### Useful pharmacodynamic endpoints in children: selection, measurement, and next steps [^115EZFMe]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints are essential for establishing the benefit-to-risk ratio for therapeutic interventions in children and neonates. This article discusses the selection of an appropriate measure of response, the PD endpoint, which is a critical methodological step in designing pediatric efficacy and safety studies. We provide an overview of existing guidance on the choice of PD endpoints in pediatric clinical research. We identified several considerations relevant to the selection and measurement of PD endpoints in pediatric clinical trials, including the use of biomarkers, modeling, compliance, scoring systems, and validated measurement tools. To be useful, PD endpoints in children need to be clinically relevant, responsive to both treatment and/or disease progression, reproducible, and reliable. In most pediatric disease areas, this requires significant validation efforts. We propose a minimal set of criteria for useful PD endpoint selection and measurement. We conclude that, given the current heterogeneity of pediatric PD endpoint definitions and measurements, both across and within defined disease areas, there is an acute need for internationally agreed, validated, and condition-specific pediatric PD endpoints that consider the needs of all stakeholders, including healthcare providers, policy makers, patients, and families.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk pediatric patients: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112s4crk]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

This scientific statement presents considerations for clinical management regarding the assessment and risk reduction of select pediatric populations at high risk for premature cardiovascular disease, including acquired arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis. For each topic, the evidence for accelerated acquired coronary artery disease and stroke in childhood and adolescence and the evidence for benefit of interventions in youth will be reviewed. Children and adolescents may be at higher risk for cardiovascular disease because of significant atherosclerotic or arteriosclerotic risk factors, high-risk conditions that promote atherosclerosis, or coronary artery or other cardiac or vascular abnormalities that make the individual more vulnerable to the adverse effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Existing scientific statements and guidelines will be referenced when applicable, and suggestions for risk identification and reduction specific to each setting will be described. This statement is directed toward pediatric cardiologists, primary care providers, and subspecialists who provide clinical care for these young patients. The focus will be on management and justification for management, minimizing information on pathophysiology and epidemiology.

### Do systematic reviews on pediatric topics need special methodological considerations? [^115Q1CEa]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, children have been underrepresented, and often excluded, from clinical research. The studies that have been done in children have shown limited quality across the hierarchy of research evidence as compared to studies in adults. This leaves pediatric populations, and end users such as health care providers and policy makers with a knowledge gap that has led to treatments based on extrapolations of safety and effectiveness from adult data, neglecting the complexities surrounding intervention exposure in children, and leading to under- or over-treatment with potential lifelong consequences. This scarcity of research also affects evidence synthesis. A survey of the quality and quantity of evidence on child relevant Cochrane systematic reviews showed limited number of relevant systematic reviews in children and even fewer provide representative information by age-group strata.

In modern health care, systematic reviews and meta-analyses are key tools in decision making by healthcare providers and policy makers, as they guide patient management and provide insight towards further research required. However, the methodological quality of systematic reviews has been questioned, even of those published in high impact factor journal. Concerns have been raised regarding weaknesses in their design, conduct, and reporting, which impair their applicability to practice and policy guidelines. In 2009, the PRISMA statement was published to provide guidance to authors, peer reviewers, and journal editors on elements for optimal reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of treatment comparisons in order to maximize the transparency, replicability, and quality of such studies. In the 2 years following the publication of PRISMA statement, a modest improvement in completeness of reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in sub-specialty journals was reported, not surprisingly primarily in studies published in journals endorsing the PRISMA statement.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^111RsxNd]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Subsequent to the wide uptake of adult data-driven Sepsis-3 criteria, it is important to address the practical challenges in developing pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illness in a range of settings and with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. The criteria will need to be unambiguous yet flexible, capable of adapting to the widely different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. These criteria should facilitate early recognition of patients at risk, improved diagnosis, and risk stratification to enable timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression. At the same time, we must endeavor to avoid the problems associated with overdiagnosis and treatment.

In summary, there are challenges and opportunities in operationalizing sepsis in the global and diverse settings in which children present, but we present potential actionable solutions that can be applied locally to identify, manage and study children with sepsis.

### Considerations for skin and wound care in pediatric patients [^115X1kif]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Wound care in pediatrics is a specialized area of practice that requires consideration of factors unique to pediatric patients. With a slowly growing body of evidence to support treatment choices in this vulnerable population, it is critical that wound experts develop and oversee evidence-based skin care regimens and wound treatment practices. This article discusses some common issues in pediatric skin and wound care. A successful prevention or treatment plan is collaborative and addresses the developmental, physiologic, and social needs of the pediatric patient and their family. Conflicting plans of care and limited resources are frequent challenges.

Future directions

First, we recommend that the current PRISMA statement be used to systematically develop a checklist of essential items which researchers should include when designing, conducting and reporting pediatric systematic reviews. Second, it seems time to develop two versions that could be called PRISMA- PC (Protocol for Children) and PRISMA-C (Reporting for Children). The detailed protocol of the planned process for developing new PRISMA-PC and PRISMA-C statements are provided elsewhere. These "extensions" of the current PRISMA statement are aimed to improve the quality of the information reported in pediatric systematic reviews by highlighting the key elements that differ from adult reviews. The "extended" reporting items should be underpinned by evidence for their importance.

The impact of this work will be potentially large. Adherence by systematic reviewers to PRISMA and its "pediatric extensions" will facilitate clarity, completeness, and transparency of pediatric systematic reviews reporting. Explicit descriptions and transparent reporting of these minimum set of items will best serve the interests of all stakeholders and will also reveal any deficiencies in the research if they exist. It is anticipated, given the focus of knowledge synthesis and the requirement by journals for relating studies to existing evidence, that pediatric specific systematic review guidelines would in turn influence the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of primary trials in children. Finally, PRISMA-PC and PRISMA-C guidance will help facilitate the translation of knowledge from the literature to bedside care, thereby improving child health and reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

Conclusions

Systematic reviews are key tools to enable decision making by healthcare providers and policymakers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis - PRISMA-2009 and PRISMA-P 2015 - statements were developed to improve the transparency and quality of reporting of systematic reviews. The lack of guidance in these statements for pediatric-specific methodological features of systematic reviews on child health topics may impair decision-making in child health. In collaboration with members of the PRISMA Group, we will develop a consensus-based checklist of essential items which researchers should include when planning and reporting pediatric systematic reviews. PRISMA-PC (protocol-children) and PRISMA-C (reporting-children) guidance will help facilitate the translation of knowledge from the literature to bedside care and policy, thereby improving child health outcomes and enhancing delivery of care.

### Pediatric decision making: consensus recommendations [^117Wpsbg]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite apparent disagreement in the scholarly literature on standards of pediatric decision making, a recognition that similar norms underpin many of the dominant frameworks motivated a June 2022 symposium "Best Interests and Beyond: Standards of Decision Making in Pediatrics" in St Louis, MO. Over the course of this 3-day symposium, 17 expert scholars (see author list) deliberated on the question "In the context of US pediatric care, what moral precepts ought to guide parents and clinicians in medical decision making for children?" The symposium and subsequent discussion generated 6 consensus recommendations for pediatric decision making, constructed with the primary goals of accessibility, teachability, and feasibility for practicing clinicians, parents, and legal guardians. In this article, we summarize these recommendations, including their justification, limitations, and remaining concerns.

### Perioperative considerations in the management of pediatric surgical patients [^111g5DP8]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric anatomy and physiology differ significantly from those of adults and, therefore, require special considerations in evaluation and perioperative management. This article highlights the anatomic and physiologic differences that influence pediatric management. It also covers specific disease processes that are common in the pediatric population and that may involve special management strategies.

### Toward governance of artificial intelligence in pediatric healthcare [^114sXxYW]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Governance strategies for safe and equitable pediatric AI

The development and deployment of AI in pediatric healthcare demand a governance framework that ensures fairness, safety, and equity. Given the unique developmental considerations of children, governance strategies must be tailored to pediatric-specific ethical challenges, regulatory gaps, and socio-technical complexities (Fig. 4).

Adoption of a pediatric-centric ethical framework

Governance strategies should be built upon a shared pediatric-centric ethical framework that evaluates AI technologies. We recommend the three-question framework, described in depth in "Core Principles Underpinning Governance in Pediatric AI". While not all encompassing, an example of how several considerations might fall within this broad framework is laid out here:
Is it true? Is the dataset representative enough to support the proposed application? Is a plan in place to combat model drift and ensure ongoing quality? How will model uncertainty be handled?
Is it good? Does this model benefit pediatric patients? Does it minimize harm? What systems are in place to protect children's right to fairness, privacy, and well-being? Is the model sufficiently explainable to both clinicians and caregivers? Are all biases adequately considered and addressed?
Is it wise? Have all stakeholder voices been considered? How will the ongoing use of this model be evaluated? Is there a means for stakeholders to voice concerns? Does the AI tool provide answers to the right questions? How will the best interest standard be met when deploying this technology?

### Age and weight considerations for the use of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in pediatric populations: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^114zuZCg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This position statement provides guidance for age and weight considerations for using continuous positive airway pressure therapy in pediatric populations. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in pediatric sleep medicine to review the medical literature and develop a position statement based on a thorough review of these studies and their clinical expertise. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine Board of Directors approved the final position statement. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that continuous positive airway pressure can be safe and effective for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea for pediatric patients, even in children of younger ages and lower weights, when managed by a clinician with expertise in evaluating and treating pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. The clinician must make the ultimate judgment regarding any specific care in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, accessible treatment options, patient/parental preference, and resources.

### Do systematic reviews on pediatric topics need special methodological considerations? [^115tC2JK]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

For any research project, the reporting stage is too late to correct errors in design and conduct. The protocol for a systematic review serves as the foundation of the study's conduct and reporting. However, systematic review protocols are seldom published and only 1 in 10 non-Cochrane systematic review mentions working from a protocol to complete the review. Systematic review protocols permit readers to determine whether unplanned decisions, not otherwise documented in a published protocol, were introduced including change of primary outcomes or reporting of statistically significant outcomes. Unplanned reporting of systematic review results may lead to biased conclusions and inappropriate decisions by end-users. In contrast, a published or registered protocol allows a comparison of reported review methods with the planned methods. Pre-publication of protocols also avoids unnecessary duplication of efforts and provides transparency for possible publication bias in the field. To address these problems, an international Prospective Register of Ongoing Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) was launched in February 2011, and the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Protocol) statement providing an evidence-based guidance on 17 key items to be reported in systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocols was published in 2015.

Despite these positive developments, a large number of current pediatric systematic reviews lack clarity in reporting and therefore offer limited or biased evidence for recommendations, partly due to the existence of guidelines that are not specific to child health research.

Evaluations of systematic reviews in some pediatric subspecialty fields, e.g. oncology and urology, reported low quality. Furthermore, compared to adult research, a scarcity of high quality evidence in pediatric-specific research exists for both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Out of the 4520 systematic reviews that have been registered in PROSPERO in February 2015, less than 10% were on the pediatric population aged 0–18 years. An evaluation of "child relevant" systematic reviews found that only about half of the reviews intended to included data from children. Unfortunately, where data have been synthesized, results are most often uninformative and unreliable, due to a high variability in systematic reviews and meta-analytic methods applied in child health research. Cautious interpretation of inconclusive findings from such pediatric systematic reviews should be made in order to assist physicians best communicate the available evidence with their patients and make the best informed decision during routine clinical practice. While several of the limitations identified in pediatric systematic reviews might also reflect limitations of evidence in the original pediatric RCTs, nevertheless, there are also several areas of improvement for the pediatric systematic reviews per se, which we analytically discuss below.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^112ejqt4]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Other EtD criteria and considerations

Currently, screening for clinically unsuspected VTE is not recommended and therefore the reported incidence and outcomes of clinically unsuspected clots are likely underreported. The guideline panel did not consider that there were feasibility or acceptability considerations that would impair implementation of this recommendation. Evidence profiles with the characteristics of all included studies and the complete EtD framework are online for recommendation 2.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The guideline panel determined that there is a very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit or harm from using anticoagulation or no anticoagulation in clinically unsuspected VTE. New data are available to inform the recommendation presented in this guideline. However, the new data are from select subpopulations of pediatric patients with clinically unsuspected VTE that include infants and young children with congenital heart disease, neonates with short-term central venous catheters, and pediatric patients who have experienced trauma; and thus, the outcomes for other subpopulations of pediatric patients is unknown. Based on the body of available evidence, there appears to be a low risk of poor outcomes (thrombus extension, recurrence, mortality, and PTS) for these subpopulations despite no treatment. However, because of low certainty in the evidence, the fact that we did not find the evidence of an effect on these outcomes does not imply that such an effect does not exist.

The panel identified additional research questions and made the following recommendations:
1 Determining the outcomes of clinically unsuspected VTE in other subpopulations of pediatric patients such as those with cancer, children with short gut syndrome, and those with end-stage renal disease that need long-term central catheters
2 Designing future studies to present outcomes for patients with symptomatic and clinically unsuspected VTE separately so the true benefits and harms of treatment and nontreatment can be evaluated
3 Consistent use of international standard definitions of clinically unsuspected VTE across studies

For pediatric patients with provoked VTE, should anticoagulation for 6 weeks vs 3 months be used?

Recommendation 3

For select pediatric patients with provoked VTE, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests 6 weeks rather than 3 months of anticoagulation. Exclusions to this recommendation include: (1) PE, (2) recurrent VTE, (3) persistent occlusive thrombus at 6 weeks, (4) cancer-associated thrombosis, (5) patients with persistent APAs or major thrombophilia, and (6) ongoing VTE risk factors (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).

### Endoscopic considerations in children [^112VsiU4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Endoscopy often is required in the management of patients with chronic liver disease. Endoscopy in this pediatric population is a safe and effective diagnostic and therapeutic modality for the appropriate clinical situation. The clear advantage afforded by reduced-sized equipment, new anesthetic agents, better operator training, and specialized pediatric endoscopy units have resulted in better outcomes and reduced risk to the patient. Advances in technical innovations will expand the currently offered diagnostic and therapeutic options for management of pediatric with portal hypertension. This article reviews specific considerations for endoscopy in this demanding patient population.

### How I approach ethical considerations for pediatric phase I CAR T-Cell trials [^112sJoqQ]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Phase I trials of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown remarkable promise in pediatric B-cell malignancies. Such outcomes have shifted expectations for other phase I CAR T-cell trials to have high response rates. The juxtaposition of high expectations, uncertain outcomes, and potential for life-threatening toxicities raises unique ethical considerations. To aid patients and providers considering early-phase CAR T-cell trials, we discuss: (i) considerations for enrollment of pediatric patients, (ii) understanding trial intent and expectations, (iii) weighing risks and benefits, (iv) considerations for informed consent discussions, (v) post CAR T-cell therapy expectations, (vi) barriers to access, and (vii) vulnerability in decision making.

### Indications to perform damage control surgery in pediatric trauma: a scoping review-are children little adults? [^116qjkic]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiologic considerations in pediatric trauma

In pediatric trauma, the presentation and timing of shock and the lethal triad may differ due to children's enhanced compensatory capacity. It is hypothesized that this greater hemodynamic resilience may delay the onset of shock and associated physiological deterioration, causing these signs to appear later than in adults. Furthermore, the inflammatory response to shock may be less pronounced and slower to develop in pediatric patients. Although children may initially maintain hemodynamic stability during blood loss, their relatively lower blood volume can lead to rapid and severe decompensation, underscoring the need for timely intervention.

In DCS, the primary objective is to control hemorrhage and contamination. Within the context of trauma pathophysiology (Fig. 1), this approach plays a crucial role in halting progression of the lethal triad. Therefore, in cases of severe trauma, hemodynamic instability, or clear evidence of significant hemorrhage or contamination, early consideration of DCS is warranted, even if the signs of the lethal triad have not yet manifested.

### Blood banking considerations in pediatric trauma [^1122agez]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Transfusion of blood products to a hemorrhaging pediatric trauma patient requires seamless partnership and communication between trauma, emergency department, critical care, and transfusion team members. To avoid confusion and delays, understanding of blood banking principles and mutually agreed upon procedures and policies must be regularly updated as knowledge evolves. Because pediatric patients require specialized considerations distinct from those in adults, this brief review covers transfusion principles, policies, and procedures specific to the resuscitation of pediatric trauma patients.

RAI therapy in pediatric patients

Special considerations for RAI therapy in children

There are special considerations regarding RAI therapy in pediatric patients, especially in pre-pubertal children who are much more susceptible to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the developing body of pediatric patients requires consideration of body size before adapting RAI therapy concepts that were designed for fully-grown adults. The special considerations applicable to pediatric RAI therapy are discussed below:

Disease spectrum

Autonomous nodules or obstructive goiter are very rare in children; nearly all patients referred for RAI therapy have been diagnosed with GD refractory to medical therapy with ATD. Therefore, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the recommendations and considerations in this section will pertain to GD.

Age

The reluctance for employing RAI therapy in pediatric GD increases with decreasing patient's age. According to the recently published European Thyroid Association Guidelines on the treatment of Graves' disease in children and adolescents, Na[131 I]I can theoretically be used in any patient with GD. However, a very young age (< 5 years; because of a greater long-term theoretical risk of malignancy) is seen as a near-absolute contraindication. Age 5–10 years is regarded as a relative contraindication. Interestingly, an update in this guideline is a recommendation that ATD should be maintained for multiple years in pediatric GD patients so that rather than being referred for surgery, children with a near-absolute or relative age-based contraindication for RAI therapy patients can often be kept on ATD until they reach an age adequate for undergoing RAI therapy.

Patient preparation

Other than the standard preparations as described for adults (e.g. stopping ATD), no special medical preparations are necessary for pediatric patients. Of course, depending on the age of the patient and the possibilities allowed by local radiation protection regulations, it may be possible or even necessary to allow a parent to be co-hospitalized with the patient after appropriate preparation of the parent/caregiver.

### Critical procedures in pediatric emergency medicine [^1151ZHpF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Children comprise approximately one-quarter of all visits to most emergency departments. Children are generally healthier than adults, yet there are similar priorities in assessment and management of pediatric patients. The initial approach to airway, breathing, and circulation still applies and is first and foremost in the evaluation of young infants and children. There are certain anatomic, physiologic, developmental, and social considerations that are unique to this population and must be taken into account during their evaluation and treatment. In this review, we present and discuss an evidence-based approach to high-yield procedures necessary for all emergency physicians taking care of children.

### How I treat pediatric venous thromboembolism in the DOAC era [^112fgpqA]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) rivaroxaban and dabigatran are newly licensed for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children and mark a renaissance in pediatric anticoagulation management. They provide a convenient option over standard-of-care anticoagulants (heparins, fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists) because of their oral route of administration, child-friendly formulations, and significant reduction in monitoring. However, limitations related to therapeutic monitoring when needed and the lack of approved reversal agents for DOACs in children raise some safety concerns. There is accumulating experience of safety and efficacy of DOACs in adults for a broad scope of indications; however, the cumulative experience of using DOACs in pediatrics, specifically for those with coexisting chronic illnesses, is sparse. Consequently, clinicians must often rely on their experience for treating VTE and extrapolate from data in adults while using DOACs in children. In this article, the authors share their experience of managing 4 scenarios that hematologists are likely to encounter in their day-to-day practice. Topics addressed include (1) appropriateness of indication; (2) use for special populations of children; (3) considerations for laboratory monitoring; (4) transition between anticoagulants; (5) major drug interactions; (6) perioperative management; and (7) anticoagulation reversal.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^112Afw1h]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and research needs for these recommendations

The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit from using anticoagulation in pediatric patients with CSVT. Although randomized controlled trials in adults with CSVT have demonstrated a benefit of anticoagulation, there are no randomized trials in pediatric patients with CSVT. Observational studies, however, have suggested the safety of anticoagulation in the pediatric population. Based on these considerations, and the potential life-threatening complications of CSVT that warrant treatment with anticoagulation, the previous ASH 2018 guidelines made a strong recommendation for anticoagulation for CSVT without hemorrhage. However, the guideline panel reviewed new pediatric data that have emerged in the last 5 years and has recognized the heterogeneity of etiology, outcomes, and bleeding risk. These subpopulations may have different balances of harms and benefits with anticoagulation. Because of these considerations, and the very low certainty in the evidence, the panel chose to make a conditional recommendation rather than a strong recommendation.

Based on the body of available evidence, it is likely that anticoagulation reduces the risk of mortality and neurologic deficits without increasing the risk of bleeding. There is very low certainty that there is a benefit of anticoagulation on other outcomes such as thrombus resolution. The relationship between thrombus resolution and neurologic outcomes could not be assessed in the available published data. However, the fact that we did not find evidence of an effect on these outcomes does not imply that such an effect does not exist.

The panel identified the following additional research needs:
1 Further studies evaluating the impact of the degree of CSVT resolution/recanalization on neurological outcomes in CSVT
2 Further studies assessing harms and benefits of anticoagulation in subgroups with CSVT
3 Further studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of thrombolysis in the management of pediatric CSVT

### Common data elements for neuroimaging of traumatic brain injury: pediatric considerations [^117JchiW]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2012). Low credibility.

As part of the Traumatic Brain Injury Common Data Elements project, a large-scale effort to define common data elements across a variety of domains, including neuroimaging, special considerations for pediatric patients were introduced. This article is an extension of that initial work, in which pediatric-specific pathoanatomical entities, technical considerations, interpretation paradigms, and safety considerations were reviewed. The goal of this review was to outline differences and specific information relevant to optimal performance and proper interpretation of neuroimaging in pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. The long-range goal of this project is to facilitate data sharing as well as to provide critical infrastructure for potential clinical trials in this major public health area.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^1133MMAL]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The questions addressed in these guidelines were judged to be those for which there were new data available to update the questions addressed in 2018. In addition, the panel added new questions regarding the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with standard-of-care (SOC) anticoagulants for VTE treatment. The inclusion of questions in this guideline revision did not automatically mean that recommendations were expected to change from 2018 but that there were sufficient new data to warrant a renewed consideration of the question. The recommendations within the guidelines address questions predominantly of whether to treat or not to treat, and which type of treatment is optimal for a given clinical situation. The guidelines are predominantly concerned with the treatment of acute thrombosis. On occasions, thrombosis at diagnosis is believed to be chronic due to the review of previous scans or timing of likely precipitant factors (such as central venous access). The decision to treat or not treat in these situations, requires individual consideration of the risk-to-benefit ratio and is beyond the scope of these guidelines. In addition, specific information is given about the use of various anticoagulants in pediatric patients for the treatment of VTE. Apixaban and edoxaban were not considered in these guidelines because phase 3 clinical trial data regarding use of these drugs for the treatment of VTE in children are yet to be published. Subsequent guidelines related to prophylaxis for VTE in pediatric patients will include all drugs for which there are pediatric data, and further specific guidance as to the use of drugs in the prophylaxis setting may be provided with those guidelines. Of note, in 2018, there were recommendations about the management of homozygous protein C deficiency. These recommendations were not considered in this effort, in light of the recent International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) comprehensive guidance on this topic.

Throughout these recommendations, the panel, at times, considers neonates (age, birth to day 28), infants (age, day 29 to 1 year), children (age, 1–11 years), and adolescents (age, 12–18 years) separately. At times, the terms pediatric patients (encompassing all age groups) or neonates and pediatric patients (separating neonates from all other age groups) are used.

Considerations for clinical practice in pediatric stroke — "Children with acute stroke are typically treated initially with antithrombotic agents to prevent initial recurrent stroke, either an antiplatelet (aspirin) or an anticoagulant (LMWH or UFH), unless contraindications exist. For AIS resulting from cardiac and thrombophilia causes, anticoagulants are usually the preferred approach". For long-term prevention, "Long-term antithrombotic therapy may prevent recurrent strokes; this includes either antiplatelet agents (aspirin) or anticoagulants (LMWH or warfarin), depending on the pathogenesis. Preventive medications are typically maintained for at least 2 years and, in most cases, longer term. Protection of the gastrointestinal tract should be considered with long-term aspirin use".

### Assessment of dosing strategies for pediatric drug products [^115WfuNi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric drug dosing is challenged by the heterogeneity of developing physiology and ethical considerations surrounding a vulnerable population. Often, pediatric drug dosing leverages findings from the adult population; however, recent regulatory efforts have motivated drug sponsors to pursue pediatric-specific programs to meet an unmet medical need and improve pediatric drug labeling. This paradigm is further complicated by the pathophysiological implications of obesity on drug distribution and metabolism and the roles that body composition and body size play in drug dosing. Therefore, we sought to understand the landscape of pediatric drug dosing by characterizing the dosing strategies from drug products recently approved for pediatric indications identified using FDA Drug Databases and analyze the impact of body size descriptors (age, body surface area, weight) on drug pharmacokinetics for several selected antipsychotics approved in pediatric patients. Our review of these pediatric databases revealed a dependence on body size-guided dosing, with 68% of dosing in pediatric drug labelings being dependent on knowing either the age, body surface area, or weight of the patient to guide dosing for pediatric patients. This dependence on body size-guided dosing drives the need for special consideration when dosing a drug in overweight and obese patients. Exploratory pharmacokinetic analyses in antipsychotics illustrate possible effects of drug exposure when applying different dosing strategies for this class of drugs. Future efforts should aim to further understand the pediatric drug dosing and obesity paradigm across pediatric age ranges and drug classes to optimize drug development and clinical care for this patient population.

### Perioperative considerations for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease presenting for noncardiac procedures: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1113GCW9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). Medium credibility.

Continuous advances in pediatric cardiology, surgery, and critical care have significantly improved survival rates for children and adults with congenital heart disease. Paradoxically, the resulting increase in longevity has expanded the prevalence of both repaired and unrepaired congenital heart disease and has escalated the need for diagnostic and interventional procedures. Because of this expansion in prevalence, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, and other health care professionals increasingly encounter patients with congenital heart disease or other pediatric cardiac diseases who are presenting for surgical treatment of unrelated, noncardiac disease. Patients with congenital heart disease are at high risk for mortality, complications, and reoperation after noncardiac procedures. Rigorous study of risk factors and outcomes has identified subsets of patients with minor, major, and severe congenital heart disease who may have higher-than-baseline risk when undergoing noncardiac procedures, and this has led to the development of risk prediction scores specific to this population. This scientific statement reviews contemporary data on risk from noncardiac procedures, focusing on pediatric patients with congenital heart disease and describing current knowledge on the subject. This scientific statement also addresses preoperative evaluation and testing, perioperative considerations, and postoperative care in this unique patient population and highlights relevant aspects of the pathophysiology of selected conditions that can influence perioperative care and patient management.

### Selecting the proper pediatric dose: It is more than size that matters [^114Eb5f8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Appropriate pediatric dose selection remains one of the most vexing clinical problems faced by healthcare professionals who are charged to provide medical care to infants and children. While body size does reflect the ontogeny of processes that govern drug disposition, there are extremes of disease that perturb the expected relationships.

### A sponsor's view on postmarketing regulatory commitments involving human drug products [^114zJvQM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric study requirements are especially difficult to satisfy in a postmarket setting. The FDA has evaluated time from adult to pediatric approval and on average, there is an 8‐year lag between initial approval and addition of pediatric‐specific labeling (Figure 1), and it is becoming longer in recent time periods. Difficulties evaluating therapeutics in children result in challenges completing pediatric studies and may result in off‐label utilization by healthcare providers without clear dosage recommendations or understanding of safety and efficacy in pediatric populations. Although the requirements that govern pediatric investigations may be unique, points that have been raised regarding transparency, communication, and consideration of nontraditional data sources are also essential to pediatric study agreements. Discussion regarding pediatric studies and assessments generally begins early in the product development process, and as a result, it is often difficult for sponsors to provide realistic pediatric study/investigation plans at this stage of development. However, early engagement, even with the inherent uncertainties, is desirable. Further consideration of what is feasible to assess in the pediatric populations and regulator willingness to consider alternative approaches to data collection and model‐informed drug development are needed, as is more consistent consideration for extrapolation. The same should apply to other special populations (e.g. in geriatrics or those with organ compromise, etc.), as may be appropriate. Information to guide decision making for safe and effective use of medications in special populations is a largely unmet need that hinders optimal care of those patients and may foster empirical use when there are few other options for treatment. Conduct of feasible and effective PMCs will expedite completion and reporting of the findings and thereby hasten the timely provision of new and important information for prescribers and safer and more effective use of products.

### Kidney support therapy in the pediatric patient: unique considerations for a unique population [^1154s837]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of kidney support therapy (KST) for use in managing patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has expanded greatly in the last several decades. The growing use of KST modalities in children, and now in neonates, has been associated with opportunities for education, clinical research, clinical practice improvements, and outcomes research. A multitude of controversies exist in the field of pediatric KST-many of which are shared by adult critical care nephrology practice. Simultaneously, pediatric KST has led the way to a burgeoning exploration of the importance of fluid overload as it relates to KST initiation and management and also with quality improvement. In this review, we will explore and describe the paradigms contained with pediatric KST used to support children with AKI. In addition to the governing principles related to the mechanics of KST, we will describe the novel aspects of newer support machines and ethical considerations of KST provision. Anticoagulation, dose, and modality will be discussed as well as priming procedures for special considerations. The utilization of KST across pediatric populations represents the next frontier of critical care nephrology.

### Caring for critically ill children with suspected or proven coronavirus disease 2019 infection: recommendations by the scientific sections' collaborative of the European society of pediatric and neonatal intensive care [^113thZNC]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

In children, coronavirus disease 2019 is usually mild but can develop severe hypoxemic failure or a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, the latter considered to be a postinfectious syndrome, with cardiac involvement alone or together with a toxic shock like-presentation. Given the novelty of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, little is known about the pathophysiology and phenotypic expressions of this new infectious disease nor the optimal treatment approach.

Study Selection:

From inception to July 10, 2020, repeated PubMed and open Web searches have been done by the scientific section collaborative group members of the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care.

Data Extraction:

There is little in the way of clinical research in children affected by coronavirus disease 2019, apart from descriptive data and epidemiology.

Data Synthesis:

Even though basic treatment and organ support considerations seem not to differ much from other critical illness, such as pediatric septic shock and multiple organ failure, seen in PICUs, some specific issues must be considered when caring for children with severe coronavirus disease 2019 disease.

Conclusions:

In this clinical guidance article, we review the current clinical knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 disease in critically ill children and discuss some specific treatment concepts based mainly on expert opinion based on limited experience and the lack of any completed controlled trials in children at this time.

Fondaparinux — pediatric dosing, targets, and bleeding management specify extrapolated therapeutic peaks and practical considerations. A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years, with adjustment to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours; 88% achieved target concentration without dose adjustment. The adult therapeutic target peak concentration of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L has been extrapolated to children. The anticoagulant effect may persist for 2 to 4 days with normal renal function, and there is no antidote; bleeding is managed per protocols for irreversible anticoagulants.

### How I treat cytopenias after CAR T-cell therapy [^113B8K9N]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric-specific considerations for persistent cytopenias after CAR-T

In the setting of prolonged cytopenias after CAR-T, there are several etiologies and treatment considerations that are unique to, or more commonly arise in, pediatric patients. First, in young infants and other pediatric patients with certain cytogenetic drivers of B-ALL clones (eg, KMT2A rearrangements), lineage switch can occur after CAR-T. Thus, occult myeloid malignancy after lineage switch could be an underlying cause of prolonged cytopenias. Close attention to marrow morphology, including dysplastic features and fibrosis, along with broad cytogenetic, immunophenotype, and molecular screening including next-generation sequencing of B-cell receptor rearrangements for minimal residual disease tracking in ALL is warranted. Second, owing to increased thymic activity and a uniquely persistent immune environment in children, sustained immune dysregulation leading directly to hematopoietic suppression or immune-mediated mature blood cell destruction may be more likely in pediatric patients. Third, pediatric patients are more likely to have undergone previous allogeneic BMT, with special considerations described below. Whether or not a patient had an antecedent BMT, most pediatric patients would be considered candidates for BMT after CAR-T, either to consolidate B-ALL remission or to resolve cytopenias in extreme cases. Therefore, prolonged use of growth factors are often deferred in pediatric patients. Furthermore, there are concerns that myeloid growth factors might exacerbate CRS, and thrombopoietin mimetics might trigger myeloid clonal evolution in other diseases. In contrast to adults, for BMT-naïve pediatric patients with transfusion dependence or severe neutropenia requiring G-CSF therapy late after CAR-T infusion (beyond 90 days), allogeneic BMT with best available donor should be considered.

### Shared decision-making in pediatric practice: a broad view [^113jjTXN]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In 1982, the Presidential Commission published its seminal report, Making Health Care Decisions, advocating for informed medical decision-making shared between the patient and health care providers that is sensitive to patient values and goals. Over the past 2 decades, multiple professional organizations have officially supported shared decision-making (SDM); however, there remains no unified, well-accepted definition of the term. One reason for the lack of consensus is the wide array of clinical settings and patient populations. SDM in pediatric practice can be complicated because of the inclusion of the child in the decision-making team and the duties and limits of parental decision-making authority. The authors in this supplement provide a broad view of SDM in the pediatric setting. Many of the authors raise important questions and delineate some of the challenges that lie ahead. We hope that the articles foster further conversation and spur research to improve SDM and the care we provide to children and families.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^116isGyK]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations

The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends".) or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has the following interpretation:

Strong recommendation

- **For patients**: most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not.
- **For clinicians**: most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.
- **For policymakers**: the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.
- **For researchers**: the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations.

Conditional recommendation

- **For patients**: most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
- **For clinicians**: clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that they must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
- **For policymakers**: policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on whether an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented.
- **For researchers**: this recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps.

### Management of uncertainty in everyday pediatric care [^115FmJSF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Medicine is filled with uncertainty. Clinicians may experience uncertainty due to limitations in their own or existing medical knowledge. Uncertainty can be scientific, practical, or personal, and may involve issues related to probability, ambiguity, and complexity. Pediatricians face additional uncertainties related to the role of families in decision-making and limited ability to know the preferences of children. Clinicians may approach uncertainty in different ways: some choosing to embrace its presence and others attempting to avoid it. Ultimately, pediatricians must learn to navigate uncertainty together with their patients and families, minimizing it when possible while accepting that its presence is unavoidable.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: what will be their role in children? [^111Hxq41]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic events in children differ from those in adults in epidemiology, pathophysiology, and anatomical location. However, anticoagulation in children is mostly based on evidence from adults while scarce evidence exists from children. The classical anticoagulants currently used in children have several limitations, resulting in the need for regular monitoring. Several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now authorized for adults in whom they have established efficacy and safety without the need for monitoring. Given their pharmacological properties and the special characteristics of children requiring anticoagulation, the DOACs have the potential to be particularly suitable for children. All currently approved DOACs have paediatric development plans, targeting various indications for prevention and treatment of thrombosis. Paediatric formulations are being developed and systematic age-specific dosing information will be generated. Whether therapeutic drug monitoring will be necessary in certain situations in children remains to be elucidated. The results of ongoing clinical studies still need to demonstrate whether there is a positive benefit-risk balance in all targeted paediatric indications and age-groups, particularly in indications that have not been explored in adults, such as catheter-related thrombosis or congenital heart disease. If the advantages of DOACs bear out in the results of the current paediatric studies, they will likely be used widely in children. As of now, the DOACs should not be used routinely in children as there is still insufficient information on appropriate dosing, safety and efficacy. The paediatric community is encouraged to promote participation of children and adolescents into the multiple ongoing studies of DOACs.

### Developing the 2011 integrated pediatric guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction [^116gr55K]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This article reviews aspects of development of the recently released "Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents" for pediatric care providers that remain in the area of human judgment. Discussed will be the context in which the guidelines were developed, the formal evidence review process, a consideration of how quality grades were established, key social/ethical issues that the panel confronted, and a critique of the final work with recommendations for future guideline development. Lessons learned are that both a formal evidence review process is essential to developing a credible document, and human judgment is critical to producing a meaningful result. Guideline development is a dynamic process that must be continuously self-critical as new evidence is acquired and sociopolitical and environmental contexts evolve.

### Recommendations for the use of pediatric data in artificial intelligence and machine learning ACCEPT-AI [^115yXnK5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Contents and usability of ACCEPT-AI

Background

The generation of formalized guidelines, such as SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI, have laid the foundation for safe design, conduct, reporting, and early-stage evaluation of AI/ML studies. However, the lack of defined best practice standards, frameworks, or guidelines incorporating age-specific considerations for AI/ML research that involves pediatric data warrants attention. The ACCEPT-AI framework highlights fundamental ethical considerations for pediatric data use in AI/ML research. At each stage of the AI life cycle (problem selection, data collection, outcome definition, algorithm development, and post-deployment considerations), the framework promotes the evaluation and maximization of principled and ethical AI use by incorporating respect for persons, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, transparency, and explainability in its recommendations.

Structure

ACCEPT-AI (Table 1) contains six key sections: age, communication, consent and assent, equity, protection of data, and technological considerations including transparency of techniques, training, and testing. Accompanying each section are key recommendations, which allow these ethical principles to be translated into actionable tasks by researchers, regulators, and clinicians who use or evaluate AI studies to mitigate age-related algorithmic bias.

Table 1
The ACCEPT-AI framework: key recommendations for pediatric data use in AI/ML research.

Vision

The usage of ACCEPT-AI pertains to studies designed for CYP as the primary target population for which an algorithm is applied, for adult research that incorporates pediatric data as a secondary measure, and in the utilization of public AI/ML datasets that may contain labeled or unlabeled pediatric data. While ACCEPT-AI can currently be used as an independent framework, it has also been designed to integrate into existing formalized guidelines such as CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI, emerging guidelines such as TRIPOD-AI, PROBAST-AI, STARD-AI, and QUADAS-AI, and future guidelines with focus on pediatric considerations (Fig. 3) –.

### Exposure matching-based pediatric dose selection for drugs with renal excretion-lessons learned from pediatric development of direct oral anticoagulants [^116ZCpt6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

The pediatric clinical development programs of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have recently been completed, with apixaban close to the finish line. One common pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristic of these four DOACs is that renal excretion contributes 27% or more in their elimination, resulting in age-dependent drug clearance in both pediatric and adult subjects. Several lessons have been learned from adult exposure matching and pediatric dose selection for DOACs. The main goal of this tutorial is to provide an informed perspective on pediatric dose selection for renally excreted drugs, using these four DOACs as case examples. This tutorial is organized into seven steps: (1) consideration of age-related differences in disease and response to treatment; (2) consideration of age-related differences in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; (3) selection of the reference adult population and exposure for pediatric exposure matching; (4) prediction of pediatric clearance and pediatric dose selection based on data from young adults; (5) conduct and design of efficient pediatric PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies that inform dose selection; (6) assessment of exposure matching and dose adjustment using population PK simulation; (7) evaluation of the need for dose adjustment in pediatric sub-populations.

Regarding specific circumstances for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (surgical interventions), ERS 2021 guidelines recommend to take into account the following factors when considering surgery in pediatric/adolescent patients with bronchiectasis:

- age

- symptoms and disease burden

- localization of the bronchiectatic areas on chest CT

- underlying etiology (influencing recurrence of disease)

- facility where surgery is undertaken (surgical expertise and availability of pre- and postoperative care)

- optimization of the patient's clinical state.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^112aiCf9]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The guideline panel acknowledged that the Kids-DOTT trialis a landmark pediatric thrombosis trial that will have a significant impact in the field, allowing many pediatric patients with provoked VTE to receive a shorter duration of anticoagulation. Nonetheless, there remain questions in this area, including whether there are other patients who may benefit from a shorter duration, including those with occlusive thrombus at 6 weeks but who otherwise meet low-risk criteria. Whether continuing anticoagulation beyond 6 weeks for an occlusive thrombus improves thrombus resolution is unknown, and this could be an area of future investigation.

Lastly, > 85% of patients treated on the Kids-DOTT trial received LMWH. Although there was no direct evidence of shorter duration of anticoagulation therapy using DOACs, studies in pediatric patients and adults would suggest that the efficacy of DOACs for treatment of VTE is noninferior to SOC (LMWH or VKAs). Therefore, the panel felt that it was reasonable to consider DOACs in this population but also to collect additional data from cooperative cohort studies and registries that focus on the systematic, prospective collection of real-world data.

For pediatric patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, should anticoagulation for 6 to 12 months vs indefinite anticoagulation be used?

Recommendation 4

For pediatric patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation for 6 to 12 months rather than indefinite anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: Unprovoked VTE is rare in pediatrics. Although studies suggest that rates of recurrent VTE in children and adolescents aged > 1 year with unprovoked VTE are relatively high (21%-36% at age 3.5 years), there are no pediatric studies evaluating duration of therapy in this cohort. Although extrapolation of adult data might favor prolonged treatment in terms of VTE recurrence, in the absence of pediatric data, the panel felt that the impact of indefinite anticoagulation on bleeding risk and QOL would more negatively affect pediatric patients compared with adults. Patient values and preferences should be considered when making this decision.

Recommendations

Good practice statement

The panel agreed that a pediatric hematologist or a pediatrician in consultation with a hematologist will be best suited to implement these recommendations given the complexity of the care involved in children with VTE.

For pediatric patients with symptomatic DVT or PE, should anticoagulation vs no anticoagulation be used?

Recommendation 1

For pediatric patients with symptomatic DVT or PE, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: Although there remains limited direct evidence in pediatric patients, there is strong indirect evidence in adults that symptomatic VTE requires treatment. However, based on recently published observational studies in pediatric patients, there may be specific clinical scenarios such as neonatal central venous catheter–associated VTE or trauma-associated VTE in which anticoagulation may result in either no significant benefit or potentially an increased risk of harm. Outside of these specific clinical scenarios, the panel agrees that in most pediatric patients with symptomatic DVT and PE, anticoagulation is warranted. Therefore, the panel made a conditional recommendation with very low certainty in the evidence.

Table 2.
The changes in evidence per recommendation and per outcome between the updated (2024) and original (2018) guideline

Of note, one significant change was the consideration of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as therapeutic options in pediatric populations for all recommendations. In the 2018 guidelines DOACs were considered out of scope since DOAC use outside of trials could not be recommended due to lack of published pediatric specific data. In addition, in the 2024 guidelines, 2 specific recommendations related to DOAC use were included, both of which were informed by major trials that evaluated DOACs vs standard of care in VTE treatment in pediatric populations.

Overall, our results showed advancement in the evidence that informed the updated guideline iteration with an increase in the number of pediatric specific comparative studies. These studies were reported after the publication of the 2018 guideline. Additionally, although data were not formally analyzed, numerous studies included in the updated version were conducted by panel members of the 2018 guidelines. The findings from this analysis underscore the importance of continued research efforts to strengthen the evidence base for pediatric VTE management, driven by research recommendations originating from the guideline effort.

Interestingly, 2 recommendations changed from strong recommendations for the intervention to conditional recommendations for the intervention. This change occurred because of these recommendations being previously driven by adult data; therefore, when primarily pediatric data was utilized certain group/conditions that may not benefit from the intervention were identified leading to this change.

This case study had a limited scope, focusing exclusively on 1 (ASH) published guidelines. However, we believe it is applicable for all fields of guideline research and appraisal. Examining recommendations from other clinical practice guidelines could provide a more comprehensive perspective on the evolution of evidence.

The 2024 ASH/ISTH guideline update for pediatric VTE treatment demonstrated a significant shift toward incorporating more pediatric-specific data. Although a limited number of recommendations changed, this progress highlighted that even in fields with scarce evidence, updates are critical to maintain clinical utility. However, persistent research gaps remain, underscoring the importance of continued research efforts. As new research emerges, updating clinical practice guidelines is crucial to ensure that recommendations reflect the most current and reliable evidence even if they do not lead to a change in overall recommendations.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^112Jr9FX]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

With RCT data limited to 523 pediatric patients globally receiving a DOAC, the certainty in the evidence was very low to low on beneficial effects and harms/burdens. Given the fact that these agents are orally administered, thus avoiding daily injections of LMWH/UFH; have fewer drug interactions than VKAs; do not require monitoring; and, in the case of rivaroxaban, have dosage forms (oral suspension, granules) that are pediatric friendly; the panel felt that using these agents in treating pediatric VTE would be acceptable. For guidelines, ASH takes the perspective of high-income countries (HICs), and in this regard, the panel felt that it would be feasible to implement either of these agents in such settings, but the panel also acknowledges that access to these agents for pediatric patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) needs to be addressed. Indeed, even in some HIC settings, rivaroxaban suspension or granules are not approved/marketed. The resources required to implement the use of either of these agents were deemed variable in HICs, driven by insurance coverage/copayments vs out-of-pocket costs for those without insurance. This is compounded in the LMIC setting in which costs for these agents, although on average lower than in HICs, are generally higher than for SOC agents, and families having insurance to cover costs of these agents are much less prevalent. Given these latter considerations, the panel could make no judgment on the impact to equity in using either of these agents. Similarly, although there are some data from the adult setting on cost-effectiveness of using DOACs, there are (to date) no published cost-effectiveness/cost-utility studies of DOACs in the pediatric context, and the panel concurred that there are enough methodological considerations/differences in pediatric cost-effectiveness studies to not rely on indirect data from adults. At the present time, the panel could not identify any significantly different factors/drug characteristics/clinical benefits/harms that would lead to one recommending 1 of these agents being used over the other.

Enoxaparin pediatric dosing — age-based regimens and practical considerations include that existing age-related dosing recommendations and dose adjustments for enoxaparin (< 2 months of age: 1.5 mg/kg SQ injection 2 times a day; > 2 months of age: 1 mg/kg SQ every 12 hours) are based on a small prospective dose-finding study of 23 children. Prefilled syringes of LMWH use the closest dose within reason [10%-15%] and administration from multidose vials may be preferred in smaller children; a large retrospective population PK study in > 800 children aged > 1 year predicted that using 1 mg/kg, 2 times a day, had the highest probability of achieving the therapeutic anti-FXa level, and although higher dosing strategies have not been prospectively validated, if an anti-FXa range of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL is the target, higher starting doses in younger patients will achieve this target more rapidly than current recommendations; prospective evaluation of this strategy is strongly encouraged.

### Application of protection motivation theory to clinical trial enrolment for pediatric chronic conditions [^112sY3gJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Novel ATMPs lack a strong evidence base of benefit and a well-characterized risk profile. However, expectation for benefit is high and public information sources often overstate benefits relative to risks. This places an onus on clinical investigators to engage in best communications and consent practices, especially in the context of pediatric clinical trials. Our results suggest that fear of adverse events as part of threat appraisal was the predominant consideration for parents in considering whether to enroll their child living with a manageable, chronic condition in a pediatric clinical trial of an ATMP. This consideration outweighed potential benefits and severity of their child's condition. Parents called for available safety data and fulsome communication processes that would enable them to make informed decisions about clinical trial enrolment on behalf of their children.

### Anticoagulant prophylaxis and therapy in children: current challenges and emerging issues [^111VN9W1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

This review is aimed at describing the unique challenges of anticoagulant prophylaxis and treatment in children, and highlighting areas for research for improving clinical outcomes of children with thromboembolic disease. The evidence presented demonstrates the challenges of advancing the evidence base informing optimal management of thromboembolic disease in children. Recent observational studies have identified risk factors for venous thromboembolism in children, but there are few interventional studies assessing the benefit-risk balance of using thromboprophylaxis in risk-stratified clinical subgroups. A risk level-based framework is proposed for administering mechanical and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. More research is required to refine the assignment of risk levels. The anticoagulants currently used predominantly in children are unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists. There is a paucity of robust evidence on the age-specific pharmacology of these agents, and their efficacy and safety for prevention and treatment of thrombosis in children. The available literature is heterogeneous, reflecting age-specific differences, and the various clinical settings for anticoagulation in children. Monitoring assays and target ranges are not well established. Nevertheless, weight-based dosing appears to achieve acceptable outcomes in most indications. Given the limitations of the classical anticoagulants for children, there is great interest in the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), whose properties appear to be particularly suitable for children. All DOACs currently approved for adults have Pediatric Investigation Plans ongoing or planned. These are generating age-specific formulations and systematic dosing information. The ongoing pediatric studies still have to establish whether DOACs have a positive benefit-risk balance in the various pediatric indications and age groups.

Respiratory synchronization

Respiratory motion can be monitored in real-time to restrict imaging to specific phases of respiration. Respiration can be monitored using external triggers (e.g. respiratory bellows) or internal triggers (e.g. navigator echoes).
Navigator echoes more accurately track diaphragmatic motion, capturing shallow and irregular breathing more reliably than bellows.
Respiratory gating techniques can increase scan time by 2–threefold or more, depending on the breathing pattern.
Respiratory gating using adaptive intelligence is available on some modern scanners. This allows for accurate triggering without the need for respiratory bellows or an additional navigator pulse (e.g. Philips VitalEye).

Age-specific protocol optimization

The large variability in pediatric patient sizes and their ability to breath-hold complicates protocol optimization and makes the use of a single protocol for all patients inefficient.
Pediatric patients have smaller anatomical features than adults, requiring higher spatial resolution imaging that could result in unnecessarily long scan times for a one-size-fits-all FOV.
Pediatric patients of different ages also have differing abilities to perform a breath-hold and remain still during scanning, influencing the selection of motion mitigation strategies.
It is recommended to have at least two, and preferably three, pre-optimized protocols for children of different sizes and abilities to breath-hold on your scanner for technologists to choose from. Suggested protocol sets for different pediatric patient ages are listed in Table 2 along with typical FOVs.

### Antibiotics in critically ill children-a narrative review on different aspects of a rational approach [^1149f9Nn]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Antibiotics can save lives, but at the same time exert harm to the individual by multiple mechanisms, ranging from direct impairment of cellular function to disturbance of physiological homeostasis and even contributing to the development of new diseases. Awareness of these potential harms must become an essential part of physician's decision-making for or against antibiotic treatment.

Critically ill children may be a patient group that needs wise decision-making on antibiotic therapies even more than others. Important aspects to consider on the path to adequate antibiotic treatment are diagnostic approaches to identify pathogens and guide antibiotic treatment, timing of antibiotics, empiric and targeted therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring. To guide decision-making, we developed 6 key questions to answer before the initiation of antibiotic therapy in critically ill children.

### Coagulation considerations for infants and children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass [^1142h5ZM]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass imposes a significant pathophysiologic burden on patients. Pediatric patients are especially predisposed to the adverse effects of surgery and bypass on the coagulation system, with resultant bleeding, transfusion, and poor outcomes. These risks accrue to pediatric patients in inverse proportion to their weight and are attributable to hematologic immaturity, coagulation defects associated with congenital heart disease, bypass equipment, and the nature of congenital heart surgery. Standard anticoagulation does not completely inhibit thrombin generation, and continuous consumption of coagulation factor continues throughout bypass. Conventional measurements of anticoagulation during bypass poorly reflect this incomplete anticoagulation, and alternate methods may improve anticoagulant therapy. Emerging therapies for blocking the effects of bypass on the coagulation system hold promise for decreasing bleeding and related complications, and improving outcomes in congenital heart surgery.

### Guidance for prevention and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents: a consensus statement from the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society pediatric COVID-19 therapies taskforce [^117VYvEK]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Since November 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created challenges for preventing and managing COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Most research to develop new therapeutic interventions or to repurpose existing ones has been undertaken in adults, and although most cases of infection in pediatric populations are mild, there have been many cases of critical and fatal infection. Understanding the risk factors for severe illness and the evidence for safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 in children is necessary to optimize therapy.

Methods

A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacology, and pediatric intensive care medicine from 21 geographically diverse North American institutions was re-convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys and a systematic review with meta-analysis of data for risk factors, a guidance statement comprising a series of recommendations for risk stratification, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 was developed and refined based on expert consensus.

Results

There are identifiable clinical characteristics that enable risk stratification for patients at risk for severe COVID-19. These risk factors can be used to guide the treatment of hospitalized and non-hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19 and to guide preventative therapy where options remain available.

### Intestinal ultrasound for the pediatric gastroenterologist: a guide for inflammatory bowel disease monitoring in children: expert consensus on behalf of the international bowel ultrasound group (IBUS) pediatric committee [^115faqmG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition resulting in transmural inflammation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that can cause significant morbidity. In children, IBD can significantly impact growth, development, and result in a substantial psychosocial burden, particularly when diagnosis is delayed, or disease severity is inaccurately assessed. Endoscopic evaluation is the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring mucosal inflammation in pediatric IBD. However, it presents several challenges in the pediatric population and does not provide transmural assessment of inflammation. Endoscopy is less desirable for children as it is invasive, requires sedation by a pediatric anesthesiologist, requires often poorly-tolerated bowel preparations, and exhibits lower cecal and ileal intubation rates than adults.

Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is a cross-sectional imaging tool with comparable accuracy magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in assessing transmural inflammation in the entire bowel, with the advantages of being well tolerated in children, non-radiating, inexpensive, and ideal for repeated examinations. Both IUS and MRE have a high sensitivity for detecting small bowel Crohn disease (CD) activity with substantial practitioner agreement for the presence of active ileal inflammation. This suggests that both modalities are valid tools for disease activity assessment, supporting the use of IUS as an accurate tool for serial monitoring during routine exam visits. Presently, there is a lack of standardized approach to bedside IUS among gastroenterologists. There is now a formalized training program and curriculum offered through the International Bowel Ultrasound Group (IBUS), and there are several standardized scoring systems for disease activity that are in the process of validation, 2 of which are pediatric-focused.

In this article, we provide a general approach to utilizing IUS for disease monitoring in the pediatric IBD clinic, outlining patient preparation and positioning, technical considerations, an anatomical overview, and specific recommendations regarding assessing and documenting transmural features of IBD from mucosa to serosa, the mesentery, and characterization of complications such as penetrating and stricturing disease. We also provide the first proposed pediatric IUS monitoring algorithm. Please refer to Table 1 which outlines key points regarding patient preparation and positioning, technical considerations, limitations, and documentation. More detail is provided in, and in video form in.

Symbols used to designate certainty of evidence within these guidelines.

Interested readers may find more explanation about the GRADE approach to assessing and rating certainty in a body of evidence in other publications.

During a 1-day in-person meeting followed by online communication and a series of 31 conference calls, the panel developed clinical recommendations based on the evidence summarized in the EtD tables. For each recommendation, the panel took a population perspective and came to consensus on the following: the certainty in the evidence, the balance of benefits and harms of the compared management options, and the assumptions about the values and preferences associated with the decision. The guideline panel also explicitly considered the extent of resource use associated with alternative management options. The panel agreed on the recommendations (including direction and strength); remarks; and qualifications by consensus; or, in rare instances, by voting (an 80% majority was required for a strong recommendation), based on the balance of all desirable and undesirable consequences. The final guidelines, including recommendations, were reviewed and approved by all members of the panel. In the previous iteration, because of the sparsity of evidence, the panel used the expert evidence approach. In this update, and because of the new evidence, there was no need to use that approach.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations

The recommendations are labeled as either "strong" or "conditional" according to the GRADE approach. The words "the guideline panel recommends" are used for strong recommendations, and "the guideline panel suggests" for conditional recommendations. Table 3 provides the GRADE's interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations by patients, clinicians, health care policymakers, and researchers.

### Knowledge-driven approaches for the guidance of first-in-children dosing [^112nujGm]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Pediatric pharmacokinetic and pediatric safety and efficacy studies are, in most cases, a mandatory activity during the drug development process in North America and Europe. Pharmacokinetic modeling in anticipation of the pediatric clinical trial should take a data or knowledge-driven approach by employing either top-down or bottom-up approaches to assessing differential age-related dosing. These two approaches depend on different starting information and are likely to be used in conjunction with each other for the purposes of defining pediatric dosing guidelines. This review primarily focuses on the available bottom-up, mechanistic models for predicting age-dependent drug absorption, distribution and elimination, and their integration through the whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. The bottom-up approach incorporating adult and pediatric whole-body PBPK models for optimizing age-related dosing is detailed for a drug currently undergoing pediatric development.

Pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) — rivaroxaban vs standard-of-care anticoagulants: For pediatric patients with VTE, the panel suggests using rivaroxaban over SOC anticoagulants (low‑molecular‑weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, vitamin K antagonist, and fondaparinux) as a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects (⊕OOO). The panel concluded that there was a small benefit of rivaroxaban over SOC in relation to reduced thrombus recurrence and improved thrombus resolution, and undesirable effects were felt to be small with a reduction in major bleeding countered by an increase in CRNMB; these data were limited by the small number of important outcomes reported. Exclusions from EINSTEIN‑Junior included those aged < 6 months with low birth weight and those with severe liver or renal impairment, and the panel noted reports of heavier menstrual bleeding while on rivaroxaban as an important consideration when choosing an anticoagulant.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) — donor age and pediatric considerations indicate that donors "should be restricted to adults older than 18 years for medicolegal considerations". The Joint Society Consensus Recommendation (JSCR) also states that "children could also potentially serve as donors as long as both parental consent and child assent are obtained". The document explains that "the gut microbiome of pediatric subjects may behave differently in response to transplant" and highlights implications for "children with 20 to 30 additional life-years compared to adults".

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit from using indefinite anticoagulation compared with 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE in pediatric patients. Although indirect evidence from adults suggests the opposite in terms of recurrent VTE, this comes at the expense of increased major bleeding. The panel considered that the impact of prolonged anticoagulation may also more negatively affect the QOL in younger patients, particularly those involved in sports. Thus, individual values and preferences of patients and their families should be explored when making this decision. Factors associated with higher rates of recurrence include age of > 12 years at index VTE and inherited thrombophilia. There is an urgent need to prospectively evaluate long-term outcomes in pediatric patients with unprovoked VTE, including the significance of persistent risk factors such as thrombophilia, or anatomic abnormalities. Studies should seek to evaluate the impact of anticoagulation adherence, intensity and duration on recurrence, bleeding, and QOL.

For pediatric patients with CSVT, should anticoagulation vs no anticoagulation be used?

Recommendation 5

For pediatric patients with CSVT with and without hemorrhage secondary to venous congestion, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence based on pediatric data ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: Observational studies suggest lower mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in patients with CSVT treated with anticoagulation. However, the panel recognized that different populations of patients with CSVT (eg, neonates, and those with infection-associated CSVT, who have experienced trauma, have had surgery, and have cancer) may have different risks for bleeding and neurologic outcomes that should be considered in the decision to use anticoagulation. Evidence of venous congestion secondary to thrombus obstruction with or without hemorrhage should be managed with anticoagulation. The panel notes that when anticoagulation is prescribed, it is important that appropriate therapy for additional associated conditions (eg, surgical interventions for infection-associated CSVT) be used.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^116Eep3w]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric critical asthma — practice considerations for NIV and HFNC: Although HFNC is increasingly commonly used to support children with critical asthma, there remains inadequate evidence to recommend for or against its use, and HFNC may decrease work of breathing but concerns remain about possible longer hospital stay in other pediatric respiratory failure. For NIV, the guideline states these data suggest NIV is well tolerated and can decrease work of breathing, and given risks of invasive ventilation, we feel it is reasonable to trial NIV prior to escalating to more invasive options. It adds that based on the published data, it is unclear how to determine when NIV should be initiated and applying NIV in most patients with critical asthma may not be warranted, and to avoid overutilization, centers should consider developing guidelines for NIV initiation, titration, de-escalation, and discontinuation. There is little evidence comparing HFNC with NIV; therefore, we cannot judge if one modality is superior, and although we have suggested the use of NIV over conventional oxygen therapy, we could not make that recommendation based on the available evidence for pediatric critical asthma to date.

### Consider a career in pediatrics-AAP… [^1143abcL]. AAP (2020). Medium credibility.

General Pediatrics General pediatricians focus on the physical, emotional, and social health of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults from birth to 21 years. Developmentally oriented and trained in skilled assessment, their patient-care lens is focused on prevention, detection, and management of physical, behavioral, developmental, and social problems that affect children. General pediatricians diagnose and treat infections, injuries, and many types of organic disease and dysfunction. They work to reduce infant and child mortality, foster healthy lifestyles, and ease the day-to-day difficulties of those with chronic conditions. With structured evaluation and early intervention, general pediatricians identify and address developmental and behavioral problems that result from exposure to psychosocial stressors. They appreciate the vulnerability of children and adolescents, and actively advocate for measures to protect their health and safety.

The ability to communicate effectively with patients, families, teachers, and social service professionals is a key to effective pediatric care. General pediatricians collaborate with pediatric subspecialists and other medical and surgical specialists in the treatment of complex diseases and disorders. They work closely with other health professionals concerned with the emotional needs of children. Pediatricians advise educators and child-care professionals, and advocate for access to care and a medical home for all children. General pediatrics is a multifaceted primary care specialty. The general pediatrician's responsibilities include:

- Management of serious and life-threatening illnesses
- Diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic disorders
- Monitoring physical and psychosocial growth and development
- Age-appropriate screening
- Health supervision
- Anticipatory guidance. Pediatric Medical Subspecialties Pediatric residents who choose to focus on a particular aspect of child health, either exclusively or as a part of their general pediatric practice, complete a subspecialty fellowship after residency. Pediatric subspecialists are more likely to work in academic medical centers and specialty hospitals, where their responsibilities include teaching and research along with direct patient care.

Given these enhanced responsibilities, AAP data shows full-time pediatric subspecialists work, on average, more hours per week than full-time generalists. Other Training Options Some pediatric specialists do not complete their general pediatrics residency first. For example, after a surgical residency, someone might complete a fellowship in pediatric orthopedic surgery.
