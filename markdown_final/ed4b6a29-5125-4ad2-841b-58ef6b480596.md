## Question

Should you hold eliquis prior to an epidural

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Eliquis (apixaban) should be held before an epidural and, if so, for how long, with attention to dose, renal function, and catheter management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the boxed warning and FDA labeling for neuraxial procedures. Then, I should verify what major society guidelines (ASRA, ACCP) recommend for interruption intervals by dose and renal function. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetic rationale and any lab thresholds that inform timing. After that, I need to consider catheter placement and removal rules, including what to do if a traumatic puncture occurs. Finally, I should integrate thrombotic risk, special populations, and a practical decision framework with monitoring and reversal considerations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory risk signal. The FDA boxed warning for apixaban explicitly highlights spinal/epidural hematoma with neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture and warns that optimal timing is not known, emphasizing individualized risk–benefit assessment and vigilant neurologic monitoring. This frames the default approach of holding apixaban to mitigate catastrophic bleeding risk [^1157HAnB] [^116kDDro].

> Next, I should review guideline-based interruption intervals by dose. ASRA Pain Medicine (fifth edition) suggests holding high-dose apixaban (e.g., 5 mg twice daily or higher) for at least 72 hours before neuraxial blockade and holding low-dose apixaban (e.g., 2.5 mg twice daily) for at least 36 hours. If the intended interval is shorter, they suggest measuring residual apixaban or anti–factor Xa activity to confirm low or absent effect before proceeding [^114z7NKx] [^115UF9oD]. Hold on, I should verify whether these intervals align with broader perioperative guidance; ACCP suggests 1–2 days off for DOACs before procedures, which is directionally consistent but less conservative than ASRA for high-bleeding-risk neuraxial procedures, reinforcing ASRA's more conservative stance for epidurals [^1112TMaJ].

> I need to check how renal function modifies timing. Apixaban has about 25% renal elimination, so reduced creatinine clearance prolongs exposure. ASRA advises extending the pre-procedure hold toward the longer end of suggested ranges when renal function is impaired, and observational pharmacokinetic data indicate that 49–72 hours off drug typically yields very low residual levels in most patients, supporting the 72-hour interval in reduced renal function or higher dose regimens [^113AeZwP] [^116s51SF]. Wait, let me verify the lab threshold concept. ASRA suggests that a residual apixaban level less than about 30 ng/mL or anti–factor Xa activity 0.1 IU/mL or less is acceptable if testing is pursued when the hold is shorter than recommended, though this is a suggestion rather than a validated universal cutoff [^115UF9oD].

> Now, catheter management: I should confirm placement and removal rules. The FDA label advises not removing indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters within 24 hours of the last apixaban dose and waiting at least 5 hours after catheter removal before the next apixaban dose. ASRA suggests that the first postoperative dose be delayed at least 6 hours after neuraxial puncture or catheter withdrawal, and if apixaban was inadvertently administered with a catheter in place, a therapy-free interval similar to the pre-block interval should be observed or residual activity documented before catheter removal [^111cyaJx] [^115UF9oD] [^113KUu6w]. Hold on, I should verify the traumatic puncture scenario. The label recommends delaying apixaban for 48 hours after a traumatic or difficult neuraxial puncture, which is a critical nuance for safety [^111cyaJx].

> Let me consider the pharmacologic rationale to ensure internal consistency. Apixaban reaches peak concentration in roughly 1–3 hours and has an elimination half-life around 8–15 hours; a 72-hour hold corresponds to approximately 5–6 half-lives, which in practice achieves near-complete drug clearance in most patients, aligning with the "five half-lives" heuristic used for neuraxial safety, while the 36-hour hold for low-dose regimens reflects a more moderate residual risk tolerance [^113AeZwP] [^112VNLiM]. I should double-check that this aligns with observed data; indeed, PAUSE-era pharmacokinetic observations support very low residual levels after 49–72 hours off drug in the vast majority, which substantiates the conservative ASRA intervals for high-bleeding-risk neuraxial procedures [^116s51SF].

> But wait, what about thrombotic risk when we hold anticoagulation? Premature discontinuation of apixaban increases thrombotic events, so I need to ensure the indication and risk profile justify interruption and consider bridging only in very high thrombotic risk scenarios; importantly, routine bridging is not generally required for DOAC interruption, and decisions should be individualized with procedural and patient risk in mind [^116kDDro] [^116W3hkD]. I should confirm that neuraxial bleeding risk is not trivial; although rare, spinal hematomas can cause permanent paralysis, and case reports and labeling underscore the need for strict timing and vigilance, especially in older adults or those with prior neurologic deficits where detection may be delayed [^113WDPxL] [^1157HAnB].

> Next, I should review special populations and procedural contexts. In pregnancy and peripartum care, multidisciplinary planning is essential. Neuraxial anesthesia timing should follow the same conservative principles, with consideration of shorter-acting agents as delivery approaches and explicit protocols for holding and resuming anticoagulation to mitigate epidural hematoma risk [^112djcGS]. For trauma or high VTE-risk patients, coordination to minimize missed prophylaxis is important, but neuraxial timing must still respect anticoagulant pharmacokinetics and labeling cautions to avoid hematoma [^11498byw]. For urgent or emergency procedures where the ideal interval cannot be met, measuring residual apixaban or anti–factor Xa activity can help decision-making, and in life-threatening bleeding or uncontrolled hemorrhage, andexanet alfa is an option, though it is not approved for routine pre-procedural reversal for neuraxial interventions and should be reserved for appropriate indications [^115UF9oD] [^111Ws6a8].

> I will now examine a practical decision framework. For an elective epidural, hold apixaban for 72 hours if on a standard or high dose (≥ 5 mg BID) or if renal function is reduced, and for 36 hours if on a low-dose regimen (2.5 mg BID) with normal renal function. If a shorter interval is contemplated, obtain a drug-specific anti–factor Xa assay or apixaban level and proceed only if the residual level is low (commonly < 30 ng/mL or anti–factor Xa ≤ 0.1 IU/mL), recognizing this threshold is a guideline suggestion rather than a validated standard [^114z7NKx] [^115UF9oD]. For catheter removal, ensure at least 24 hours have elapsed since the last apixaban dose and wait at least 5–6 hours after removal before restarting, extending holds if the puncture was traumatic or technically difficult [^111cyaJx] [^115UF9oD]. If apixaban was inadvertently given with an indwelling catheter, withhold further doses for the usual pre-block interval or until residual activity is shown to be minimal before catheter manipulation or removal [^113KUu6w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm post-procedure monitoring and patient counseling. Frequent neurologic checks for new back pain, sensory changes, motor weakness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction are essential for at least 24–48 hours after catheter manipulation or removal, with a low threshold to obtain urgent MRI and neurosurgical consultation if spinal hematoma is suspected, as delays in decompression worsen outcomes [^111cyaJx] [^116kDDro]. Patients should be instructed pre-procedure to report any concerning neurologic symptoms immediately and to communicate all antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents they are taking to the procedural team to avoid unrecognized interactions or cumulative bleeding risk [^1145nfEU].

> Final synthesis: Yes, Eliquis (apixaban) should be held before an epidural, with a recommended minimum of 72 hours off drug for standard/high-dose regimens or reduced renal function and at least 36 hours for low-dose regimens with normal renal function, extending intervals when pharmacokinetics predict prolonged exposure and considering drug-level testing if timing must be shortened. Adhere to catheter management rules, monitor closely for neurologic compromise, and individualize decisions to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks with multidisciplinary input [^114z7NKx] [^115UF9oD] [^111cyaJx] [^1112TMaJ].

Hold Eliquis (apixaban) before an epidural: **hold 72 hours** for standard doses (5 mg BID) and **hold 36 hours** for low-dose regimens (2.5 mg BID) [^114z7NKx] [^115UF9oD]. If the patient has renal impairment, extend the hold to 4–5 days. Wait at least 6 hours after catheter removal before restarting Eliquis [^115UF9oD]. These intervals balance the risk of spinal/epidural hematoma [^1157HAnB] against thrombotic risk and are supported by ASRA and FDA guidance [^114z7NKx] [^115UF9oD] [^111cyaJx].

## Pharmacokinetics of apixaban

Understanding apixaban's pharmacokinetics helps determine **appropriate holding periods**:

- **Half-life**: 8–15 hours in patients with normal renal function [^113AeZwP].
- **Peak effect**: 3–4 hours after administration.
- **Renal elimination**: Approximately 27% of the dose [^113AeZwP].

Renal impairment significantly prolongs apixaban's half-life, necessitating longer holding periods in patients with reduced renal function [^114UWYPY].

---

## Risks associated with neuraxial procedures while on apixaban

Patients receiving apixaban who undergo neuraxial procedures are at **increased risk** of spinal or epidural hematomas, which can lead to long-term or permanent paralysis [^1157HAnB]. The risk is influenced by several factors, including:

- **Use of indwelling epidural catheters** [^111cyaJx].
- **Concomitant use of other medications affecting hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors)** [^1157HAnB].
- **History of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures**.
- **History of spinal deformity or spinal surgery** [^1157HAnB].

---

## Clinical guidelines for holding apixaban before epidural procedures

The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) provides **evidence-based recommendations** for holding apixaban before neuraxial procedures:

| **Apixaban dose** | **Recommended holding period before neuraxial procedure** |
|-|-|
| Standard dose (5 mg BID) | Hold for at least 72 hours [^114z7NKx] |
| Low-dose regimen (2.5 mg BID) | Hold for at least 36 hours [^115UF9oD] |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) | Extend holding period to 4–5 days |

---

These recommendations aim to **minimize the risk of spinal or epidural hematoma** while balancing the thrombotic risk associated with temporary interruption of anticoagulation [^111qCfUg].

---

## Clinical guidelines for resuming apixaban after epidural procedures

Resuming apixaban after epidural procedures requires **careful timing** to minimize bleeding risk. The ASRA and FDA recommend waiting at least 6 hours after catheter removal before restarting apixaban [^115Lf1Fi]. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay administration for an additional 48 hours [^111cyaJx].

---

## Special considerations

Several factors may necessitate **individualized adjustments** to the holding period:

- **Renal impairment**: Prolongs apixaban half-life, requiring longer holding periods [^115Lf1Fi].
- **Elderly patients**: May require extended holding periods due to altered pharmacokinetics.
- **High thrombotic risk patients**: Consider bridging anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) if prolonged interruption is necessary [^112t2tsk].

---

## Monitoring and patient education

Patients should be **closely monitored** for signs of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits, and bowel or bladder dysfunction [^111cyaJx]. They should be instructed to report any unusual symptoms immediately. Patient education on recognizing bleeding symptoms and the importance of adhering to holding periods is essential [^1145nfEU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard dose (5 mg BID)**: Hold for at least 72 hours before epidural procedures [^114z7NKx].
- **Low-dose regimen (2.5 mg BID)**: Hold for at least 36 hours before epidural procedures [^115UF9oD].
- **Renal impairment**: Extend holding period to 4–5 days.
- **Resume apixaban**: At least 6 hours after catheter removal [^117SRjpJ].
- **Traumatic puncture**: Delay administration by an additional 48 hours [^111cyaJx].

---

Holding apixaban (Eliquis) before epidural procedures is **essential** to minimize the risk of spinal or epidural hematoma. The recommended holding period is **72 hours for standard doses** and **36 hours for low-dose regimens**, with longer holds for renal impairment. Resuming apixaban should occur at least 6 hours after catheter removal, with additional delays if traumatic puncture occurs [^114UWYPY] [^115UF9oD] [^111cyaJx].

### Updates in the perioperative and emergency management of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^116BBQ6C]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Different groups have published recommendations for perioperative management. As recently recommended by the European Society of Cardiology, surgical procedures should be classified in three different categories: (i) interventions not requiring discontinuation of anticoagulation (for example, dental, ophthalmology, and superficial surgeries); (ii) intervention with low bleeding risk (for example, prostate or bladder biopsy, angiography, pacemaker implementation); or (iii) intervention with high bleeding risk (spinal or epidural anesthesia, lumbar diagnostic puncture, cardiothoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, major orthopedic surgery, liver biopsy, transurethral prostate resection, and kidney biopsy). Based on these guidelines, the three NOACs currently available should be stopped 24 hours before surgery with a low bleeding risk, and at least 48 hours and up to 96 hours before surgery with a high bleeding risk. In case of severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/minute), interruption of direct factor Xa inhibitors should be delayed to 48 hours. For dabigatran, delays should be progressively prolonged based on CrCl (Figure 1) and potential laboratory testing should be considered to determine residual effects of the agents. It is important to mention that the use of dabigatran in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/minute) is not recommended. Another way to manage these agents is to define a more conservative approach and to recommend the same interruption period for all the NOACs. With this approach, interruption should be 4 days in all patients and, in some cases (elderly, severe renal insufficiency), the interruption should approach 5 days. Additional studies are needed to optimize perioperative management.

Anticoagulants

Finally, the survey also examined the length of time that anticoagulants were held prior to various pain procedures. Our survey demonstrated a variation in response to the amount of times that aspirin and NSAIDs were held prior to various procedures. The study was conducted prior to the recent release of the ASRA guidelines regarding the use of anticoagulants in pain procedures. It will be interesting to see if the recently published 2015 ASRA guidelines regarding neuroaxial blockade and regional nerve blocks will lead to a change in practice policies regarding anticoagulation. It is very possible that the preexisting anticoagulation guidelines from ASRA contributed to the almost universal positive response to the anticoagulation questions.

### Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) [^116vqnNb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Increased Risk of Hemorrhage

Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of Lovenox and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Lovenox. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second Lovenox dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Lovenox dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of Lovenox is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Lovenox (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1112TMaJ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on DOACs, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider stopping apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for 1–2 days before surgery/procedure in patients receiving any of these agents requiring elective surgery/procedure.

Epidural analgesia

Should trauma patients with epidural catheters receive pharmacological prophylaxis and, if so, which agent and at what dose?

Recommendation

Trauma patients with epidural catheters should receive enoxaparin at similar doses to those patients without catheters. In the presence of renal failure, UFH three times daily should be provided.

Discussion

Enoxaparin dosing is often interrupted after epidural catheter placement, leading to an increased VTE rate. Regional anesthesia guidelines recommend a 12-hour interval between enoxaparin administration and placement or removal of an epidural catheter (24 hours if higher than standard dosing is used), and delaying resumption of the drug by 4–12 hours. Efforts to minimize the time without pharmacological protection should be undertaken by meticulously coordinating epidural procedures with drug doses, such that no more than two doses of enoxaparin will be missed. For UFH, the interval between epidural placement or removal and drug administration may be reduced to 4–6 hours, with only a 1-hour gap before resumption. As a result no UFH doses need be held.

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The safety of ELIQUIS was evaluated in the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES studies [see Clinical Studies (14)], including 11,284 patients exposed to ELIQUIS 5 mg twice daily and 602 patients exposed to ELIQUIS 2.5 mg twice daily. The duration of ELIQUIS exposure was ≥ 12 months for 9375 patients and ≥ 24 months for 3369 patients in the two studies. In ARISTOTLE, the mean duration of exposure was 89 weeks (> 15,000 patient-years). In AVERROES, the mean duration of exposure was approximately 59 weeks (> 3000 patient-years).

The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in both studies was for bleeding-related adverse reactions; in ARISTOTLE this occurred in 1.7% and 2.5% of patients treated with ELIQUIS and warfarin, respectively, and in AVERROES, in 1.5% and 1.3% on ELIQUIS and aspirin, respectively.

Perioperative antithrombotic management for regional anesthesia — ACCP labeling contrasts and conservative intent are highlighted as follows: The ACCP recommends that ticagrelor be discontinued 3–5 days prior to non-cardiac surgery, whereas labeling states, "when possible, interrupt therapy for 5 days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding". ACCP recommendations "have become increasingly more 'antithrombotic' — with shorter time intervals between discontinuation and procedures and earlier reinstitution of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy", while ASRA PM aims for "near-complete resolution of the antithrombotic effect at the time of regional blockade for high-risk (neuraxial and deep plexus/peripheral) procedures". As a result, "there are several instances where the ACCP and ASRA PM recommendations differ (eg, antiplatelet medications and apixaban)", and "the intent of these guidelines is to prevent hemorrhagic complications and are therefore conservative compared with guidelines developed to reduce surgical bleeding".

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging — dose on the day prior to elective surgery/procedure: In patients receiving LMWH bridging for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest administering half the total daily dose of LMWH the day prior to the surgery/procedure over administering the full dose of LMWH the day prior (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence); in trials giving half the total daily LMWH bridging dose the day before surgery/procedure, this approach was associated with low rates of perioperative major bleeding (3.2%, 1.6%), and implementation notes state this guidance may apply more to high-bleed-risk surgery including neuraxial (spinal or epidural) anesthesia and can be done by giving only the morning dose of a twice-daily regimen or approximately 50% of a once-daily regimen.

Appendix Table 2 — epidural hematoma after dabigatran (Pradaxa) discontinuation and resumption around lumbar interlaminar epidural injection: Dabigatran was held "7 days" before a lumbar interlaminar epidural at "L4/5", then "was started 24 hours after the injection"; "48 hours after the injection" the patient developed neurologic deficits, and surgery found "a large hematoma from L3-L5" with "full neurological recovery 6 months after surgery". The authors conclude "there is no reversal protocol for dabigatran", that it "was stopped 7 days prior, which is longer than the recommended duration", and "it was started one day after the procedure, which seems to have resulted in hematoma formation".

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^115DPxej]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):
- **Epidural hematoma, spinal hematoma**: do not use in patients undergoing neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture. Delay the administration of apixaban for 48 hours if a traumatic epidural or spinal puncture occurs. Do not remove indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters < 24 hours after the last administration of apixaban. Administer the next dose > 5 hours after the removal of the catheter.
- **Thrombosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion in patients discontinuing apixaban prematurely.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

The limited available data on ELIQUIS use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform drug-associated risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse developmental outcomes. Treatment may increase the risk of bleeding during pregnancy and delivery. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were seen when apixaban was administered to rats (orally), rabbits (intravenously) and mice (orally) during organogenesis at unbound apixaban exposure levels up to 4, 1 and 19 times, respectively, the human exposure based on area under plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) at the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 5 mg twice daily.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Pregnancy confers an increased risk of thromboembolism that is higher for women with underlying thromboembolic disease and certain high-risk pregnancy conditions. Published data describe that women with a previous history of venous thrombosis are at high risk for recurrence during pregnancy.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Use of anticoagulants, including ELIQUIS, may increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus and neonate.

Labor or delivery

All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding. ELIQUIS use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas. Consider use of a shorter acting anticoagulant as delivery approaches [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Data

Animal Data

No developmental toxicities were observed when apixaban was administered during organogenesis to rats (orally), rabbits (intravenously) and mice (orally) at unbound apixaban exposure levels 4, 1, and 19 times, respectively, the human exposures at the MRHD. There was no evidence of fetal bleeding, although conceptus exposure was confirmed in rats and rabbits. Oral administration of apixaban to rat dams from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at maternal unbound apixaban exposures ranging from 1.4 to 5 times the human exposures at the MRHD was not associated with reduced maternal mortality or reduced conceptus/neonatal viability, although increased incidences of peri-vaginal bleeding were observed in dams at all doses. There was no evidence of neonatal bleeding.

Anticoagulant therapy

Perioperative anticoagulant therapy has changed dramatically in recent years and the number of therapeutic agents has increased substantially. When determining the appropriate course of action and timing of surgical intervention for a patient on anticoagulant therapy (regardless of the agent), consultation with the prescribing provider (cardiologist/internist) is essential to progress. Of note, if central neuraxial anesthesia (epidural/spinal) does not supersede the primary provider/cardiologist's input regarding the importance of continuity of the patient's anticoagulation therapy.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — agents and indications include the oral direct Xa antagonists (DXA) apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and the oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) dabigatran. They have similar indications and are generally prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT or PE, and for prophylaxis of DVT in patients undergoing knee and/or hip replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban may also be used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acutely ill medical patients and has the indication to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease (CAD) and to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in peripheral artery disease (PAD). Betrixaban was withdrawn in April 2020 and is not discussed in this guideline.

Management of peripartum antithrombotic therapy

Peripartum anticoagulation management is centered on the careful balance of thrombotic and bleeding risks. It should be planned ahead of delivery with multidisciplinary team input, and include discussion of anticipated timing and mode of delivery. For patients on therapeutic anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitors, induction of labor is recommended so that interruption of anticoagulation can be planned safely. Induction is not routinely indicated for patients on prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and/or aspirin.

Antithrombotic medications should be interrupted to minimize bleeding events, including postpartum hemorrhage and spinal epidural hematoma in those who receive neuraxial anesthesia. Published guidelines for the management of anticoagulation medications in preparation for neuraxial analgesia are summarized in Table 3. While the optimal timing to reinitiate antithrombotic therapy following delivery is not known, resumption of therapeutic anticoagulation following delivery and neuraxial analgesia removal should be guided by individual bleeding risks, indications for anticoagulation, and multidisciplinary team input (Table 3). For most patients, reinitiation of anticoagulation can begin between 6 and 24 hours following delivery.

Table 3
Interruption and Resumption of Anticoagulation According to American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Guidelines and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology Consensus Statement,

Peripartum management of patients on therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves requires additional considerations, including the peripartum management of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Fetal metabolism of VKA is delayed, resulting in a prolonged anticoagulant effect on the fetus. As such, discontinuation of VKAs at 36 weeks of gestation with transition to therapeutic LMWH or intravenously (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended in preparation for delivery. Judicious monitoring to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation must occur (target anti-Xa levels = 0.8 U/mL to 1.2 U/mL at 4–6 hours post-LMWH dose or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) = 2 times control for IV UFH). In addition, for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves using LMWH, bridging with IV UFH (starting 36 hours prior to planned delivery until 4–6 hours before delivery) is recommended by expert consensus by both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. In the opinion of this expert panel, the decision to bridge with IV UFH can be individualized based on the valve type, position, presence of atrial fibrillation, or prior thromboembolic events/thrombosis.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112qMxuu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Specific to this manuscript is why or when should a laboratory consider providing services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that do not require routine monitoring. For decades, we have monitored unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions, with dose adjustment based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and in some institutions, the anti‐FXa activity. Likewise, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States, and longer elsewhere. Adjustment of daily VKA dose was primarily based on the patient's INR result with dietary intake, and other factors also considered. When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use (1993 in the United States), the drug prescribing information (PI) indicated, "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, notable in more recent enoxaparin labeling are pharmacokinetic (drug level) data, and subsequent iterations suggesting monitoring of anti‐FXa may be warranted in certain populations including renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation was available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti‐factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today the clinical laboratory is faced with a familiar dilemma with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate and three direct FXa inhibitors, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. DOACs have predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties at fixed doses for approved indications and do not require routine monitoring to the same context as previous oral anticoagulants. However, soon after their approval, it became evident that having some capacity to measure (quantify) or detect (qualify) DOACs could be beneficial to address acute situations such as trauma, emergent surgery, neuraxial anesthesia, acute stroke, and others. Certain patient populations such as the frail elderly, renal impairment, extreme body weight, drug overdose, or interactions may also benefit for such assessment.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Use of anticoagulants, including apixaban, may increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus and neonate.

Labor or delivery

All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding. apixaban tablets use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas. Consider use of a shorter acting anticoagulant as delivery approaches [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Data

Animal Data

No developmental toxicities were observed when apixaban was administered during organogenesis to rats (orally), rabbits (intravenously) and mice (orally) at unbound apixaban exposure levels 4, 1, and 19 times, respectively, the human exposures at the MRHD. There was no evidence of fetal bleeding, although conceptus exposure was confirmed in rats and rabbits. Oral administration of apixaban to rat dams from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at maternal unbound apixaban exposures ranging from 1.4 to 5 times the human exposures at the MRHD was not associated with reduced maternal mortality or reduced conceptus/neonatal viability, although increased incidences of peri-vaginal bleeding were observed in dams at all doses. There was no evidence of neonatal bleeding.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of apixaban or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Apixaban and/or its metabolites were present in the milk of rats (see Data). Because human exposure through milk is unknown, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with apixaban tablets.

Data

Animal Data

Maximal plasma concentrations were observed after 30 minutes following a single oral administration of a 5 mg dose to lactating rats. Maximal milk concentrations were observed 6 hours after dosing. The milk to plasma AUC (0–24) ratio is 30:1 indicating that apixaban can accumulate in milk. The concentrations of apixaban in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Females of reproductive potential requiring anticoagulation should discuss pregnancy planning with their physician.

The risk of clinically significant uterine bleeding, potentially requiring gynecological surgical interventions, identified with oral anticoagulants including apixaban tablets should be assessed in females of reproductive potential and those with abnormal uterine bleeding.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture

When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.

The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of apixaban tablets. The next dose of apixaban tablets should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of apixaban tablets for 48 hours.

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.

5.4 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves

The safety and efficacy of apixaban tablets have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of apixaban tablets is not recommended in these patients.

5.5 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy

Initiation of apixaban tablets is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban tablets, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti–beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

For neuraxial procedures, "There should be at least a 20- to 28-hour time interval (2 half-lives) between the last dose of preventive dose of edoxaban (≤ 30 mg/d) and the subsequent neuraxial puncture and/or catheter manipulation/removal", whereas "In case of a higher dose (> 30 mg/d) or in patients with CrCl 15 to 49 mL/min, a body weight 60 kg or less, and/or the concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors, a time interval of 40 to 70 hours (4–5 half-lives) should be observed". "The presence of any residual edoxaban activity can be excluded using a chromogenic anti–factor Xa assay calibrated for edoxaban", but "an acceptable level of residual edoxaban activity to proceed with neuraxial block remains undetermined", and "The next dose of edoxaban should be administered at least 6 hours after the neuraxial puncture or withdrawal of the neuraxial catheter".

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) perioperative testing — For elective surgery after DOAC interruption, we suggest against routine DOAC coagulation function testing to guide perioperative DOAC management (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). Supporting data include a registry of 422 patients with interruption intervals ranging from 1 to 218 hours; in the 49- to 72-hour interval only 5% had a residual DOAC level > 30 ng/mL and none had a level > 50 ng/mL, and receiver-operator analysis identified 54 hours to best predict a residual anticoagulant level ≤ 30 ng/mL. In PAUSE, 85% (n = 2,541) had preprocedure levels measured, and the proportions with a pre-operative level < 50 ng/mL were 90.5%, 95.1%, and 96.8% for apixaban (n = 1,129), dabigatran (n = 563), and rivaroxaban (n = 965). In a high-bleed-risk/neuraxial subgroup with approximately 60 to 68 hours off drug (including 4 days off for dabigatran and CrCl < 50 mL/min), proportions with a DOAC level < 50 ng/mL were 97.9%, 99.4%, and 99.3% and with < 30 ng/mL were 93.1%, 98.9%, and 85.3%, respectively. Implementation notes state DOAC-level testing may be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in nonelective perioperative clinical situations, such as urgent/ emergency surgery/procedure, to inform the need for active reversal with blood products or DOAC-specific reversal agents.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Advise patients of the following:

Not to discontinue ELIQUIS without talking to their physician first.
That it might take longer than usual for bleeding to stop, and they may bruise or bleed more easily when treated with ELIQUIS. Advise patients about how to recognize bleeding or symptoms of hypovolemia and of the urgent need to report any unusual bleeding to their physician.
To tell their physicians and dentists they are taking ELIQUIS, and/or any other product known to affect bleeding (including nonprescription products, such as aspirin or NSAIDs), before any surgery or medical or dental procedure is scheduled and before any new drug is taken.
If the patient is having neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, inform the patient to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematomas [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to seek emergent medical attention.
To tell their physicians if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during treatment with ELIQUIS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)].
How to take ELIQUIS if they cannot swallow or require a nasogastric tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF PRADAXA INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including PRADAXA, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with PRADAXA is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5, 2.6, 2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with PRADAXA who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

use of indwelling epidural catheters
concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
optimal timing between the administration of PRADAXA and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF APIXABAN TABLETS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF APIXABAN TABLETS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including apixaban tablets, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with apixaban tablets is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with apixaban tablets who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

- use of indwelling epidural catheters
- concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
- a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
- a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
- optimal timing between the administration of apixaban tablets and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Index VTE was classified as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), device-related thrombosis (neonatal population only), and other VTE (i.e. cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombus). Prior to randomization, patients could be treated with SOC anticoagulation for up to 14 days; overall mean (SD) duration of treatment with SOC anticoagulation prior to randomization was 4.9 (2.6) days, and for 92.9% of patients the duration was between 0 and 7 days. Patients were randomized according to a 2:1 ratio to receive either an age-appropriate formulation and body weight-adjusted doses of ELIQUIS or SOC. For patients 2 to less than 18 years, SOC was comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparins (UFH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA). For patients 28 days to less than 2 years of age, SOC was limited to heparins (UFH or LMWH). The main treatment phase lasted 6 to 12 weeks for patients aged birth to less than 2 years, and 12 weeks for patients aged greater than 2 years. Patients aged 28 days to less than 18 years who were randomized to receive apixaban had the option to continue apixaban treatment for 6 to 12 additional weeks in the extension phase.

A diagnostic imaging test was obtained at baseline, at week 6, and end of treatment for patients ≥ 2 years of age and at baseline and end of treatment for < 2 years of age.

Neuraxial or deep plexus/peripheral block — patients on warfarin: We recommend that the anticoagulant therapy be stopped 5 days prior to the planned procedure, and the INR be measured and normalized prior to needle placement (grade IB). In patients receiving an initial dose of warfarin prior to surgery, we suggest the INR should be checked prior to needle placement if the first dose was given > 24 hours earlier, or if a second dose of oral anticoagulant has been administered (grade IIC). In patients receiving low-dose warfarin therapy during epidural analgesia, we suggest that their INR be monitored daily (grade IIC). We suggest that neuraxial catheters be removed when the INR is < 1.5 (grade IIC). In patients with INR > 1.5 but < 3, the increased risk of maintaining a neuraxial catheter remains unknown; we suggest indwelling catheters may be maintained or removed with caution, closely following the INR and duration of warfarin therapy (grade IIC). In patients with an INR > 3, we recommend that the warfarin dose be held or reduced in patients with indwelling neuraxial catheters (grade IA). We can make no definitive recommendation regarding the management to facilitate removal of neuraxial catheters in patients with therapeutic levels of anticoagulation during neuraxial catheter infusion (grade IIC). We suggest that neurological assessment be continued for at least 48 hours following catheter removal (grade IIC), and neurological testing of sensory and motor function should be performed routinely during epidural analgesia for patients on warfarin therapy; to facilitate neurological evaluation, we recommend that the type of analgesic solution be tailored to minimize the degree of sensory and motor blockade (grade IC).

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114zftJm]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation — There is good evidence for risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients with antithrombotic therapy if discontinued, spontaneous epidural hematomas with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy to discontinue or normalize INR with warfarin therapy, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques. There is fair evidence with excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of higher thromboembolic phenomenon than epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques and to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole, cilostazol, and Aggrenox). There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities. There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxan (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and are continued during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events.

New direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) — timing for procedures and resumption: For preprocedure holding, "the ASRA guidelines for both regional anesthesia and pain recommended an interval of 5 half-lives of the drug before a regional or a pain intervention". For resuming therapy after a neuraxial procedure, "the ASRA regional guidelines recommended 6 hours, whereas the pain guidelines recommended 24 hours", with the longer pain guideline interval intended "to provide a longer observation period after procedures that involve surgical dissection (ie, intrathecal pump placements, permanent spinal cord stimulator implantations)". For postoperative thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients, "initiation of thromboprophylaxis with the new oral anticoagulants is recommended a minimum of 24 hours, and perhaps as long as 72 hours, depending on bleeding risk". The text concludes that "Hence, ASRA regional and pain guidelines are functionally the same".

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^11498byw]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Pending Surgery

As discussed in section G, routinely holding pharmacologic prophylaxis because of pending surgery is only indicated, with few exceptions, for brain or spine surgery. Given the delays and cancellations of cases that may occur during trauma patient care, holding pharmacologic prophylaxis preoperatively can cause days of missed pharmacologic prophylaxis. Preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis is safe for trauma patients, and leads to a lower VTE rate. The preoperative administration of pharmacologic prophylaxis is also encouraged for surgical patients in other specialties who have a high VTE risk and leads to a lower DVT rate without increasing the complication rate.– The lower VTE rate is lost if pharmacologic prophylaxis is provided more than 12 hours preoperatively.

Epidural Catheter

Epidural catheters reduce morbidity and mortality in trauma patients sustaining chest injuries and are often a component of multimodal pain strategies. Patients who require an epidural catheter increasingly have interruptions in pharmacologic prophylaxissuch that epidural catheter placement is now associated with an increased VTE rate, whereas previously this was not the case. Regional Anesthesia Guidelines recommend a 12-hour interval between enoxaparin dose and epidural placement/removal followed by a 4-hour to 12-hour interval before resumption. If enoxaparin is scheduled at 10and 10, the morning dose may be held for 10 AM epidural catheter placement/removal to allow for the necessary 12-hour interval without pharmacological prophylaxis. At 10 PM, the scheduled enoxaparin dosing may resume, so only one dose is missed. If higher doses of enoxaparin are required for pharmacologic prophylaxis, Regional Anesthesia Guidelines recommend a 24-hour interval for therapeutic enoxaparin before epidural catheter placement/removal followed by a 4-hour to 12-hour interval before resumption, indicating that, at most, two doses of enoxaparin should be missed for any enoxaparin therapy. Anti-Xa–guided enoxaparin doses are encouraged with limited interruption to reverse the higher VTE rate associated with epidural use. For unfractionated heparin, a 4 to 6-hour interval is recommended before epidural placement/removal followed by a 1-hour interval before unfractionated heparin is resumed, which allows for uninterrupted dosing.

### Jurisdictional guidance on DOAC use-will It affect practice? A comparison of European, American, and Canadian product monographs [^116EGeUc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To identify clinically relevant areas of concordance and discordance between product monographs for 4 direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) approved by regulatory authorities in Europe, the United States, and Canada. Data Sources: For each DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban), manufacturer product monographs were retrieved from the European Medicines Database, US Food and Drug Administration, and Health Canada Drug Product Database. Data Extraction: Monographs for each DOAC were independently reviewed by 2 investigators to identify areas of concordance and discordance. Discordance existed if it was deemed that a potentially clinically relevant difference existed. A heat map summarizing the data was created to identify areas of complete concordance, partial concordance (concordance between 2 of 3 monographs), and complete discordance. Data Synthesis: The areas of concordance were indications for use, use in extremes of weight, and switching to/from the DOAC. Areas of discordance included the following: differing recommendations for use/dosing with renal dysfunction; contraindication or use with caution with drug interactions, pregnancy, and hepatic/renal dysfunction; and timing of DOAC with spinal/epidural anesthesia after a procedure or traumatic puncture. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Concordance was most evident for uncomplicated patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, whereas discordance emerged for those having characteristics/factors wherein clinicians may seek clarification within product monographs (eg, impaired renal/hepatic function, drug interactions). As such, clinicians must be familiar with product information within their country of practice. Conclusion: Variability between jurisdictions was evident, and variability of DOAC use is likely to increase with expanding worldwide uptake.

### Regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy: American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine evidence-based guidelines (fifth edition) [^111qCfUg]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA PM) fifth edition guidelines — scope and dosing terminology state that hemorrhagic complications associated with regional anesthesia are extremely rare, yet the development of more potent antithrombotic medications has resulted in concerns regarding the heightened risk of neuraxial bleeding after neuraxial and deep plexus or deep peripheral blocks. This fifth edition uses similar methodology as previous editions but is reorganized and significantly expanded, and the authors continue to maintain an "antithrombotic approach" focused on patient safety and have proposed conservative times for the interruption of therapy prior to neuraxial blockade. ASRA PM has published four previous sets of evidence-based recommendations, and in this version the anticoagulant dose descriptions move from prophylactic and therapeutic to "low dose" and "high dose" to be consistent with other published guidelines and to more accurately describe the dose in the setting of specific patient characteristics and indications; for example, the same "high dose" may be used as a treatment for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or as prophylaxis for recurrent DVT. The guideline notes inclusion of suggestions for when ordering drug-specific assays may be helpful and guide practice, and it clarifies that deviation from suggestions or recommendations may be acceptable based on the judgment of the responsible anesthesiologist and that the recommendations are designed to encourage safe and quality patient care but cannot guarantee a specific outcome.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^115wYLxS]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants

Large numbers of patients take either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents for the prevention of thrombosis. Increasing numbers now take a direct thrombin or Xa inhibitor rather than warfarin. The management of these drugs in the peri‐operative setting is a common problem, necessitating the balance of bleeding risk with the risk of thrombosis. There are two scoring systems that can be used to quantify the risk of thrombosis (CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc) and bleeding (HAS‐BLED) in patients who are anticoagulated for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Direct oral anticoagulants

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have more predictable pharmacodynamics, a faster onset of action and a shorter half‐life than warfarin and require less frequent monitoring of plasma levels. There are currently four drugs available – three anti‐Xa drugs (apixaban, edoxaban and rivoroxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran). These drugs are used: in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation; after stroke and transient ischaemic attacks; and prophylaxis/management of venous thromboembolism. Direct oral anticoagulants are now more commonly used than warfarin in these settings. They are not licensed for use in patients with prosthetic (metal) heart valves based on RCT data demonstrating increased rates of thromboembolic complications when compared with warfarin therapy.

The approach to the peri‐operative management of patients taking DOACs is based on an approximate calculation of the half‐life of the drug, considering renal function. This is combined with the bleeding risk of the proposed procedure and the patient's individual risk factors for thrombosis and bleeding (Fig. 1). If an anticoagulant effect cannot be excluded, neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided. Bridging anticoagulation (usually with low molecular weight heparin) is not required except in patients deemed to be at high risk on peri‐operative thromboembolism (e.g. with recent (< 3 months and especially 1 month) history of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis; severe thrombophilia (deficiency or protein C, protein S or antithrombin); antiphospholipid antibodies; or active cancer associated with a high thromboembolism risk).

Background

Interventional pain management involves diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain. This specialty utilizes minimally invasive procedures to target therapeutics to the central nervous system and the spinal column. A subset of patients encountered in interventional pain are medicated using anticoagulant or antithrombotic drugs to mitigate thrombosis risk. Since these drugs target the clotting system, bleeding risk is a consideration accompanying interventional procedures. Importantly, discontinuation of anticoagulant or antithrombotic drugs exposes underlying thrombosis risk, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. This review summarizes the literature and provides guidelines based on best evidence for patients receiving anti-clotting therapy during interventional pain procedures.

Study Design

Best evidence synthesis.

Objective

To provide a current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding an assessment of the bleeding risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant and/or antithrombotic medications.

Methods

A review of the available literature published on bleeding risk during interventional pain procedures, practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was conducted. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of EMBASE and PubMed from 1966 through August 2018 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Results

1. There is good evidence for risk stratification by categorizing multiple interventional techniques into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk. Also, their risk should be upgraded based on other risk factors.2. There is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic events in patients who interrupt antithrombotic therapy. 3. There is good evidence supporting discontinuation of low dose aspirin for high risk and moderate risk procedures for at least 3 days, and there is moderate evidence that these may be continued for low risk or some intermediate risk procedures.4. There is good evidence that discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, heparin, dabigatran (Pradaxa®), argatroban (Acova®), bivalirudin (Angiomax®), lepirudin (Refludan®), desirudin (Iprivask®), hirudin, apixaban (Eliquis®), rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), edoxaban (Savaysa®, Lixiana®), Betrixaban(Bevyxxa®), fondaparinux (Arixtra®) prior to interventional techniques with individual consideration of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs and individual risk factors increases safety.5. There is good evidence that diagnosis of epidural hematoma is based on severe pain at the site of the injection, rapid neurological deterioration, and MRI with surgical decompression with progressive neurological dysfunction to avoid neurological sequelae.6. There is good evidence that if thromboembolic risk is high, low molecular weight heparin bridge therapy can be instituted during cessation of the anticoagulant, and the low molecular weight heparin can be discontinued 24 hours before the pain procedure.7. There is fair evidence that the risk of thromboembolic events is higher than that of epidural hematoma formation with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy preceding interventional techniques, though both risks are significant.8. There is fair evidence that multiple variables including anatomic pathology with spinal stenosis and ankylosing spondylitis; high risk procedures and moderate risk procedures combined with anatomic risk factors; bleeding observed during the procedure, and multiple attempts during the procedures increase the risk for bleeding complications and epidural hematoma.9. There is fair evidence that discontinuation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors is optional (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal]. However, there is also fair evidence to discontinue Aggrenox [dipyridamole plus aspirin]) 3 days prior to undergoing interventional techniques of moderate and high risk. 10. There is fair evidence to make shared decision making between the patient and the treating physicians with the treating physician and to consider all the appropriate risks associated with continuation or discontinuation of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy.11. There is fair evidence that if thromboembolic risk is high antithrombotic therapy may be resumed 12 hours after the interventional procedure is performed.12. There is limited evidence that discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel [Plavix®], ticlopidine [Ticlid®], Ticagrelor [Brilinta®] and prasugrel [Effient®]) avoids complications of significant bleeding and epidural hematomas.13. There is very limited evidence supporting the continuation or discontinuation of most NSAIDs, excluding aspirin, for 1 to 2 days and some 4 to 10 days, since these are utilized for pain management without cardiac or cerebral protective effect.

Limitations

The continued paucity of the literature with discordant recommendations.

Conclusion

Based on the survey of current literature, and published clinical guidelines, recommendations for patients presenting with ongoing antithrombotic therapy prior to interventional techniques are variable, and are based on comprehensive analysis of each patient and the risk-benefit analysis of intervention.

Key Words

Perioperative bleeding, bleeding risk, practice patterns, anticoagulant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, interventional techniques, safety precautions, pain.

ASIPP perioperative antiplatelet and anticoagulant management — development approach and referenced discontinuation guidance are described as follows: Guidelines are "developed based on a comprehensive review of the literature of thromboembolic risk, bleeding risk, anatomical factors, procedural factors and medical or physiologic status", with "Table 22" presenting management guidance and "Table 23" a procedural checklist. General advice cited from ASRA is "to discontinue the drugs for 5 half-lives for drugs following first-order metabolism; however, the stoppage for 5 half-lives recommendation should occur in individuals with hepatic dysfunction, and renal dysfunction including nephrotic syndrome", though "Cessation of all drugs for 5 half-lives may not be sound for interventional techniques in the perioperative period", even as "5 half-lives are required to eliminate a drug completely". For direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), CHEST clinical practice guidelines "published in 2022 (10), recommend cessation for one day in patients with low- and moderate-risk, and 2 days for high-risk procedures", and they vary "if there is renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance of less than 50 mL per minute". Based on ASRA, "Dabigatran is recommended to stop for 4 days, whereas Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban have been recommended to stop for 3 days", and ASRA "described 3 case reports of spinal hematoma related to DOAC, with all of them being subarachnoid or intrathecal injections". For the present document, "the panel has decided to utilize extensively studied guidelines for chest physicians (10), and other available literature including other available guidelines".

5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture

When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.

The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.

No data are available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheters in pediatric patients while on ELIQUIS. In such cases, discontinue ELIQUIS and consider a short acting parenteral anticoagulant.

5.4 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves

The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of ELIQUIS is not recommended in these patients.

5.5 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy

Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including ELIQUIS, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

Methods

Study Design and Oversight

This trial was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-blinded, end point clinical trial conducted at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora and University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine-Hospital in Los Angeles. Because of the difference in mode of delivery (injection vs oral) and the surgical nature of the study population, it was not possible to blind the investigators to the intervention. Patients were approached in the perioperative period, and informed written consent was obtained with institutional review board approval from both institutions. The protocol is outlined in Supplement 1 and the eFigure in Supplement 2. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Per accepted standards, participants were recommended to receive heparin (5000 subcutaneous units) 30 minutes before incision, as well as pneumatic compression devices during surgery and during postoperative hospitalization. Postsurgical care included 5000 subcutaneous units of heparin 3 times per day on the first postoperative day until patients were deemed safe for randomization by the operating surgeon. If epidural anesthesia was used, randomization occurred 8 hours after removal of the catheter. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to oral apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) for 28 days or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg daily) for 28 days. Randomization was performed by the inpatient pharmacist at the University of Colorado Hospital, who was impartial to all other aspects of the study, using an online randomizer. Patients were evaluated on study day 1 (the day of the first dose), day 14 (± 4 days), day 28 (± 4 days), and day 90 (± 14 days), to assess for the primary and secondary outcomes. Adherence to medication regimen was monitored by participant report, study diary, and assessment of pill bottles or syringes. Participants were deemed adherent with medication if they missed 2 days or fewer of treatment over the course of 28 days (ie, < 4 pills or < 2 injections missed). The University of Colorado Cancer Center's Data Safety Monitoring board conducted regular review of the ongoing trial for patient safety and study adherence. An independent blinded reviewer (an oncologist not associated with the trial) conducted assessments of all major and CRNM bleeding events.

Epidural catheter management — pharmacy fail-safe and multidisciplinary coordination emphasizes that it is critical that the acute pain medicine service be aware of patient status and the degree and timing of anticoagulation, and that centralized, computerized pharmacy systems can identify patients with epidural infusions and trigger alerts when antithrombotic agents are ordered so the pain service can be contacted. The timing of catheter removal will be based on the ongoing risk of thromboembolism, the need for continued antithrombotic therapy, and the potential for neuraxial bleeding during catheter maintenance and removal, enabling proactive coordination and neurological monitoring by the acute pain service.

### The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology consensus statement on the anesthetic management of pregnant and postpartum women receiving thromboprophylaxis or higher dose anticoagulants [^116UUEeo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Medium credibility.

Intrapartum recommendations — unit protocols and neuraxial planning — state that For all women on UFH for > 4 days, check platelet count before neuraxial procedure to rule out HIT (Class I C-EO). Every unit should have easily accessible protocols available to patients and to all obstetricians, physician anesthesiologists and other practitioners, and nurses involved in their care delineating when pregnant and newly postpartum women should have anticoagulant medications held. These protocols should be incorporated into the medical record, with associated alerts to hold anticoagulant if patient is admitted for delivery. The drug hold should trigger an obstetric evaluation and a plan for appropriate next management steps (Class IIa C-EO). Similarly, every unit should have standardized protocols to ascertain when women receiving thromboprophylaxis or higher dose anticoagulants are eligible for neuraxial anesthesia. These protocols should be shared with patients, obstetricians, and nurses so that all members of the care team develop consensus on the available analgesic or anesthetic options (Class I C-EO). Preprocedure huddles and daily multidisciplinary rounds should emphasize the mode of thromboprophylaxis, timing and amount of the most recent anticoagulant dose, and plans for reinitiating therapy for all relevant patients (Class IIa C-EO). Time intervals between anticoagulant dosing and neuraxial procedure: Elective obstetric procedures (eg, cerclage, induction of labor, planned cesarean delivery, external cephalic version, or postpartum bilateral tubal ligation): Both the magnitude of each individual dose and the total daily dose are considered in the recommended time intervals between the last dose and the neuraxial procedure. These time intervals also apply to removal of an epidural catheter.

### Epidural hematoma following cessation of a direct oral anticoagulant: a case report [^113WDPxL]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

In this case report, we describe a case of epidural hematoma following epidural analgesia in a patient with recent cessation of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).

Case Report

An 89-year-old woman requiring upper abdominal surgery presented with multiple comorbidities, including a prior cerebrovascular accident resulting in a left-sided hemiparesis and atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation with rivaroxaban. In accordance with our departmental guidelines at the time of procedure, rivaroxaban was discontinued 4 days preoperatively. A thoracic epidural was placed at T8/9 immediately prior to induction. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was provided with compression devices, and every-12-hour unfractionated heparin initiated 5.5 hours after epidural placement. On postoperative day 2, the patient was noted to have a bilateral motor block, and imaging demonstrated a thoracic epidural hematoma extending from T6 to T11. Preexisting neurological deficits may have delayed detection. With patient agreement, neurosurgery recommended observation rather than surgical decompression because the patient was a poor surgical candidate and limited neurologic recovery was expected. The patient had modest motor recovery over the next few months.

Conclusions

Guidelines for cessation of DOACs prior to neuraxial techniques are based on pharmacologic half-lives rather than accumulated experience. This case adds to the experience of neuraxial analgesia complications while following these guidelines. Patient risk may be increased by the combination of recent cessation of a DOAC, as well as the cumulative effect of multiple small risk factors. Continued vigilance and reporting of cases of epidural hematomas will enhance our understanding and ultimately improve patient care. Elderly patients and/or patients with prior neurological deficits may present further challenges for early detection and require frequent assessments with comparison to baseline status.

Reversal of the direct oral anticoagulants — andexanet alfa and idarucizumab: Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) is indicated in patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban when reversal is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding managed by an initial intravenous bolus 400 mg (low dose) or 800 mg (high dose) followed by a 120 min intravenous infusion of 480 mg (low dose) or 960 mg (high dose); common adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions (≥ 3%) and urinary tract infections and pneumonia (≥ 5%), and it is not approved for reversal prior to emergency surgery/procedures or neuraxial interventions. For dabigatran, idarucizumab (Praxbind) was approved for reversal in emergency surgery/urgent procedures or life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, with a trial showing decreased dabigatran plasma levels below the lower detection threshold of 20 ng/mL within 30 min; it is not FDA-approved for reversal prior to neuraxial interventions, and the recommended dose is 5 g via an intravenous infusion/injection, with an additional 5 g dose of idarucizumab that may be considered if clinically relevant bleeding recurs with elevated coagulation parameters. If specific antidotes are not available or are too costly, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) or activated PCC (aPCC) may be an option, though all procoagulant agents carry the risk of thrombotic effect.

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

use of indwelling epidural catheters
concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants with regional anesthesia in orthopedic patients [^116mnDS9]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

The use of direct oral anticoagulants including apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, which are approved for several therapeutic indications, can simplify perioperative and postoperative management of anticoagulation. Utilization of regional neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving anticoagulants carries a relatively small risk of hematoma, the serious complications of which must be acknowledged. Given the extensive use of regional anesthesia in surgery and the increasing number of patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants, it is crucial to understand the current clinical data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in this setting, particularly for anesthesiologists. We discuss current data, guideline recommendations, and best practice advice on effective management of the direct oral anticoagulants and regional anesthesia, including in specific clinical situations, such as patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery at high risk of a thromboembolic event, or patients with renal impairment at an increased risk of bleeding.

### New oral anticoagulants and regional anaesthesia [^113ygFaS]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are approved for a variety of clinical syndromes, including the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation, acute coronary syndromes, treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and prevention of venous thrombosis after total joint surgery or hip fracture. Published guidelines have differing recommendations on the safe interval between discontinuation of the anticoagulant and performance of neuraxial procedures and between the interventional procedure and redosing of the drug. While two to three half-life intervals might be acceptable in patients who are at high risk for VTE or stroke, an interval of four to six half-lives between discontinuation of the drug and neuraxial injections is probably safer in most patients at low risk of thrombosis. In those with renal disease, the interval should be based on creatinine clearance. After a neuraxial procedure or removal of an epidural catheter, anticoagulants can be resumed within 24–48 h in most patients, but they can be taken sooner in patients who are at higher risk for VTE or stroke, that is, 24 h minus the time to peak effect of the drug. The new antiplatelet drugs prasugrel and ticagrelor should be stopped 7 or 5 days, respectively, before a neuraxial injection and can be restarted 24 h later. In selected situations, laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect is appropriate, and reversal agents are suggested when there is a need to rapidly restore haemostatic function.

In clinical trials, indwelling epidural catheters were removed 2 hours prior to fondaparinux administration. Based on these characteristics and reports, we recommend that until further clinical experience is available performance of neuraxial techniques should occur under conditions used in clinical trials (single needle pass, atraumatic needle placement, avoidance of indwelling neuraxial catheters). If this is not feasible, an alternate method of prophylaxis should be considered (grade 1C). We suggest that neuraxial catheters be removed prior to the first postoperative dose (grade 2C).

Betrixaban — pharmacokinetics, dosing, and neuraxial anesthesia precautions are outlined as follows: "After oral intake, peak plasma levels will be reached 3 to 4 hours", with "Hepatic metabolism is minimal (< 16%)", and fecal and renal elimination such that "82% to 89% of the drug can be found in the feces, whereas the remaining (5%–11% of any oral administered dose) is eliminated through the kidney", yielding "The resulting terminal half-life is 37 hours, whereas the pharmacodynamic half-life is 19 to 27 hours". For prophylaxis, "Treatment is initiated with a single dose of 160 mg, followed by 80 mg once daily", and "In patients with severe renal impairment or treated with P-gp inhibitors, the dose should be reduced to a single dose of 80 mg initially, followed by 40 mg once daily". Regarding neuraxial procedures, the FDA label advises that "an epidural catheter should be placed/removed no earlier than 72 hours after the last administration of betrixaban", and "If traumatic puncture occurs, administration of betrixaban should be delayed for 72 hours". Using a pharmacologic approach, "a minimum time interval of 72 hours should be respected between the last prophylactic dose of betrixaban and the following neuraxial puncture and/or catheter manipulation/withdrawal", with extended timing "In patients with CrCl of 15 to 29 mL/min and/or the concomitant use of other P-gp inhibitors… a time interval of 76 to 135 hours (5 half-lives) should be observed". "The presence of any residual betrixaban activity can be excluded using a chromogenic anti–factor Xa assay calibrated for betrixaban", and "The next dose of betrixaban should be administered at least 5 hours after the neuraxial puncture or withdrawal of the neuraxial catheter".

Regional anesthesia in patients receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy — scope and methods: The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine with the European Society of Anaesthesiology convened its Fourth Consensus Conference on Regional Anesthesia and Anticoagulation to update guidance that, based on limited clinical and animal data, do not define standard of care and are designed to encourage safe and quality patient care but cannot guarantee a specific outcome. The scope includes obstetric and peripheral neural blockade settings, noting increased antithrombotic therapy in parturients, that the National Partnership for Maternal Safety consensus bundle on VTE will likely result in more parturients receiving thromboprophylaxis, and that concerns about the timing of epidural catheter placement/removal and initiation of postpartum thromboprophylaxis are addressed. Interventional pain procedures are included due to cases of epidural hematoma in patients receiving antiplatelet agents; the current ASRA guidelines for the placement of epidural and spinal catheters do not recommend cessation of these antiplatelet agents for epidural procedures, nor do the guidelines differentiate between interventional pain procedures and perioperative regional anesthesia blocks, and the guidelines consider the management of patients undergoing pain (both neuraxial and peripheral) procedures in combination with antithrombotic therapy. These recommendations are intended for use by anesthesiologists and other physicians and health care providers performing neuraxial and peripheral regional anesthetic/analgesic blockade. Methods included a systematic and general review of the relevant literature between 2010 and 2017, and note that many new oral anticoagulant medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with nearly all released with a black box warning regarding the risk of spinal hematoma.

5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture

When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see Boxed Warning].

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of XARELTO and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of XARELTO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of XARELTO is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

An indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheter should not be removed before at least 2 half-lives have elapsed (i.e., 18 hours in young patients aged 20 to 45 years and 26 hours in elderly patients aged 60 to 76 years), after the last administration of XARELTO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The next XARELTO dose should not be administered earlier than 6 hours after the removal of the catheter. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of XARELTO for 24 hours.

Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.

Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in situations in which renal function may decline) and adjust therapy accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: new challenges

Direct thrombin inhibitors, dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany), and direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban (Xarelto®, Johnson and Johnson/Bayer HealthCare AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and apixaban (Eliquis®, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Uxbridge, UK), are non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) increasingly used in the treatment of venous thromboembolism, prevention of cerebrovascular embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Although the advantages of these new agents include rapid onset (2 to 4 hours) of action, in addition to a predictable anticoagulant effect without monitoring requirements, different clinical conditions can impair their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Despite published management perspectives, strategies are not yet clearly defined for perioperative management in patients treated with NOACs.

Apixaban neuraxial anesthesia — monitoring and timing are outlined as follows: Chromogenic anti–factor Xa assays using specific calibrators for apixaban are the monitoring tests of choice, and the adequacy of residual anticoagulant activity can be documented using a chromogenic anti–factor Xa assay calibrated for apixaban. After a cautious risk–benefit analysis, there is justification to proceed with a neuraxial block; there should be at least a 26- to 30-hour time interval between the last dose of prophylactic apixaban (2.5 mg/d) and neuraxial puncture and/or catheter manipulation/removal. If a dose of 5 mg/d is used and/or in patients with a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL or greater, or an age of 80 years or greater or a body weight 60 kg or less, a time interval of 40 to 75 hours should be observed. The next dose of apixaban should be administered at least 6 hours after neuraxial puncture or withdrawal of the neuraxial catheter. Contextually, there are very few prospective data and a literature search up to November 2017 found no reports of epidural/spinal bleeding associated with neuraxial anesthesia, although a single spontaneous hematoma has been reported.

### Selected new antithrombotic agents and neuraxial anaesthesia for major orthopaedic surgery: management strategies [^113F4VGq]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

We propose recommendations to reduce the risk of haemorrhagic events associated with regional anaesthesia in patients treated with newer anticoagulants after orthopaedic surgery. The risk/benefit ratio should be individualised for each patient according to the type and dose of anticoagulant, the type of regional anaesthesia and patient risk factors. Neuraxial anaesthetic management strategy can be based on the pharmacokinetic properties of specific anticoagulants, including the time required to reach maximal concentration, half-life, and dose regimen. Central neuraxial blocks should not be performed and epidural catheters should not be removed until at least two half-lives after the last injection of anticoagulant, the half-life depending on renal function. After removing a catheter or after a haemorrhagic puncture, the timing of the next anticoagulant injection should be based on the time required for an anticoagulant dose to reach maximum activity. Vigilance remains paramount during the initial days after removal of a neuraxial catheter.
