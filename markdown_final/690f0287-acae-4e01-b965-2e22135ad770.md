## Question

Are corticosteroids effective in treating acute hives?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids are effective in treating acute hives (acute urticaria) and how to weigh benefits versus risks in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and first-line therapy. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about adding systemic corticosteroids to antihistamines. Next, I will review guideline positions and any conflicting data. After that, I need to examine safety and potential harms, including relapse risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and clarify when, if ever, steroids might be reasonable as rescue therapy [^117HD3E3] [^112sahLf].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and standard of care. Acute urticaria is defined as wheals and/or angioedema lasting less than 6 weeks, and the foundation of treatment is second-generation H1 antihistamines as first-line therapy, with dose escalation up to fourfold if needed, reserving systemic corticosteroids only for select scenarios rather than routine use [^114BMBpo] [^111G7gZs] [^113gs1cF] [^112sahLf] [^113WjKGv].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence on systemic corticosteroids in acute urticaria. A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials including 944 patients found that adding systemic corticosteroids to antihistamines likely improves urticaria activity by a modest absolute margin, with an odds ratio around 2.17 and a number needed to treat of about 7 in patients with low-to-moderate likelihood of antihistamine response, but only a tiny benefit in those with high likelihood of antihistamine response, and with a meaningful increase in adverse events, yielding a number needed to harm of about 9 [^114oHZyN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check individual randomized trials that might contradict this signal. A double-blind RCT in the emergency department showed that adding a 4-day prednisone burst to levocetirizine did not improve itch at 2 days and was associated with numerically more relapses, with no symptomatic advantage over antihistamine alone, which argues against routine steroid use in uncomplicated acute urticaria without angioedema [^1168ZE8j]. Similarly, a small ED RCT of IV dexamethasone added to antihistamine found no short-term pruritus benefit and suggested higher persistent activity at follow-up in the steroid-containing arm, reinforcing caution about routine steroid use in acute urticaria [^111rrU4R].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure consistency. Contemporary international guidelines emphasize antihistamines as first-line and discourage routine systemic corticosteroids for acute urticaria, allowing only brief rescue courses in select severe or refractory exacerbations, particularly in the context of chronic urticaria flares rather than routine acute cases, and explicitly advising against long-term systemic steroid use in chronic urticaria due to harm [^1179SnLv] [^117DXoV3] [^111x8Vnd] [^1136vkXA]. Older U.S. parameters similarly position a short oral steroid course as an option only when symptoms are severe or not resolving with antihistamines, not as standard initial therapy [^112sahLf] [^117DXoV3].

> Let me consider safety and potential harms more carefully. The meta-analysis signals a 15% absolute increase in adverse events with systemic steroids, and although short courses are often perceived as low risk, even brief systemic steroid exposure can cause mood changes, dysglycemia, hypertension, sleep disturbance, and rare but serious events, with pediatric meta-analytic data highlighting measurable short-course harms across conditions, supporting a conservative stance in children as well [^114oHZyN] [^114eRn3a]. I should also confirm relapse risk; an observational study identified corticosteroid administration as an independent risk factor for relapse within 7 days, which aligns with the concern for rebound or withdrawal flares after steroid discontinuation [^113xbSFL].

> But wait, what if the presentation is "severe" acute urticaria or includes angioedema — does that change the calculus? Guidelines allow that a short rescue course may be considered in severe cases or in acute exacerbations of chronic urticaria, yet even then the evidence base is limited and mixed, with some ED data showing no added benefit and potential for worse short-term outcomes, so any steroid use should be exceptional, brief, and paired with continued antihistamine therapy and trigger management rather than used routinely [^117HD3E3] [^112sahLf] [^111rrU4R].

> I should review topical corticosteroids briefly to ensure I'm not missing a niche role. Evidence for topical steroids in diffuse urticaria is weak; they may modestly reduce wheal size in small, selected settings but show little to no clinically meaningful itch benefit and are not recommended for routine management of diffuse urticaria, limiting their role to exceptional, localized scenarios if at all [^116rSFzH] [^1147G46J].

> Let me synthesize and make sure the conclusion matches the totality of evidence. Systemic corticosteroids are not routinely effective enough to justify their addition to antihistamines for most patients with acute urticaria, given minimal incremental benefit, increased adverse events, and signals for higher relapse risk; they may be considered as short, infrequent rescue in severe, refractory flares after antihistamine optimization and trigger mitigation, but even then the evidence is mixed and harms are nontrivial, so the default should be to avoid steroids and prioritize antihistamine therapy and supportive care [^114oHZyN] [^1168ZE8j] [^117HD3E3].

> Finally, I should translate this into a practical approach. Start with a second-generation H1 antihistamine at standard dose, escalate up to fourfold if needed, address identifiable triggers, and reserve a very short systemic steroid burst, typically no more than 3–5 days without taper at low dose, for exceptional severe cases that fail aggressive antihistamine therapy, documenting rationale and counseling on potential harms and relapse risk; in children, be particularly conservative given pediatric safety data and guideline emphasis on minimizing steroid exposure [^111G7gZs] [^113gs1cF] [^112sahLf] [^1168ZE8j] [^113yCpwb] [^114eRn3a].

---

Corticosteroids are **not first-line** for acute hives [^1168ZE8j] but may be used as a short course (≤ 5 days) [^111rrU4R] for severe or refractory cases when antihistamines are insufficient [^112sahLf]. They provide rapid symptom relief but do not shorten disease duration [^111rrU4R] and carry **risks of adverse effects and rebound** [^113xbSFL]; thus, they should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with close monitoring [^113KJSyn]. Antihistamines remain the foundation of therapy [^111G7gZs], and corticosteroids are **not recommended for routine use or long-term management** [^1136vkXA].

## Clinical evidence on corticosteroids for acute hives

### Systemic corticosteroids

- **Efficacy**: Systemic corticosteroids can provide rapid relief of acute hives symptoms, particularly in severe cases or when antihistamines alone are insufficient [^117DXoV3] [^112sahLf].

- **Limitations**: Corticosteroids do not significantly shorten the overall duration of acute hives [^111rrU4R] and may be associated with rebound symptoms upon discontinuation [^113xbSFL].

- **Adverse effects**: Short-term use can cause insomnia, mood changes, dyspepsia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and immunosuppression [^notfound]. Long-term use risks osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, cataracts, and infections [^113yCpwb].

---

### Topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids have **limited utility** in acute hives [^1147G46J] because the condition is diffuse and highly vascular; they may reduce local inflammation and itch in localized lesions [^116rSFzH], but overall efficacy is minimal [^notfound] and adverse effects such as skin atrophy and irritation can occur with prolonged use [^111wVvGA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

International guidelines consistently recommend **antihistamines as first-line therapy** for acute hives [^111ZnxyK] [^112DXkTm]. Corticosteroids are reserved for **short-term use** in severe or refractory cases, typically not exceeding 5 days, and should be tapered if used beyond this period to minimize rebound symptoms [^111rX3az] [^1169cTmD].

---

## Comparison with antihistamines

Antihistamines, particularly second-generation H1 antagonists, are the cornerstone of acute hives management due to their efficacy, safety, and minimal adverse effects [^111G7gZs]. Corticosteroids provide **rapid symptom relief** but carry a higher risk of adverse effects and rebound phenomena, making them less suitable for routine use [^114oHZyN].

---

## Clinical scenarios for corticosteroid use

Corticosteroids may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Severe symptoms**: Intense pruritus, widespread wheals, or significant angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines [^112sahLf].

- **Refractory cases**: Acute hives persisting beyond 5–7 days despite optimal antihistamine therapy [^notfound].

- **Special populations**: Patients with significant comorbidities or those requiring rapid symptom control may benefit from short-term corticosteroid use [^117HD3E3].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Short-term risks include insomnia, mood changes, dyspepsia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and immunosuppression [^113KJSyn], whereas long-term risks include osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, cataracts, glaucoma, and increased susceptibility to infections [^113yCpwb]. Rebound symptoms are common upon discontinuation, necessitating careful tapering and monitoring [^113yCpwb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Corticosteroids are **not first-line therapy** for acute hives but may be used as short-term adjuncts in severe or refractory cases [^117DXoV3]. They provide rapid symptom relief but do not shorten disease duration and carry risks of adverse effects and rebound symptoms [^114oHZyN] [^113xbSFL]. Antihistamines remain the foundation of therapy, and corticosteroids should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^111G7gZs] [^114oHZyN].

### Efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids for urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114oHZyN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Short courses of adjunctive systemic corticosteroids are commonly used to treat acute urticaria and chronic urticaria flares (both with and without mast cell-mediated angioedema), but their benefits and harms are unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating acute urticaria or chronic urticaria flares with versus without systemic corticosteroids.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM databases from inception to July 8, 2023, for randomized controlled trials of treating urticaria with versus without systemic corticosteroids. Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and appraised risk of bias with the Cochrane 2.0 tool. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of urticaria activity, itch severity, and adverse events. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Results

We identified 12 randomized trials enrolling 944 patients. For patients with low or moderate probability (17.5%-64%) to improve with antihistamines alone, add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improve urticaria activity by a 14% to 15% absolute difference (odds ratio [OR], 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43–3.31; number needed to treat [NNT], 7; moderate certainty). Among patients with a high chance (95.8%) for urticaria to improve with antihistamines alone, add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improved urticaria activity by a 2.2% absolute difference (NNT, 45; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may improve itch severity (OR, 2.44; 95% CI: 0.87–6.83; risk difference, 9%; NNT, 11; low certainty). Systemic corticosteroids also likely increase adverse events (OR, 2.76; 95% CI: 1.00–7.62; risk difference, 15%; number needed to harm, 9; moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids for acute urticaria or chronic urticaria exacerbations likely improve urticaria, depending on antihistamine responsiveness, but also likely increase adverse effects in approximately 15% more.

### Topical corticosteroids for hives and itch (urticaria): systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116rSFzH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are widely used as a treatment for itch and wheals (urticaria), but their benefits and harms are unclear.

Objective

To systematically synthesize the benefits and harms of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of urticaria.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception to March 23, 2024, for randomized trials comparing topical corticosteroids with placebo for patients with urticaria (either chronic spontaneous or inducible urticaria or acute urticaria elicited from skin/intradermal allergy testing). Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses addressed urticaria severity, itch severity (numeric rating scale; range 0–10; higher is worse), and adverse events. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed certainty of evidence ratings. PROSPERO registration: CRD42023455182.

Results

A total of 19 randomized controlled trials enrolled 379 participants with a median of mean age of 30.1 (range 21.1–44.0) years. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids may reduce wheal size (ratio of means 0.47, 95% CI 0.38–0.59; low certainty) and itch severity (mean difference -1.30, 95% CI -5.07 to 2.46; very low certainty). Topical corticosteroids result in little to no difference in overall adverse events (94 fewer patients per 1000, 95% credible intervals 172 fewer to 12 more; high certainty).

Conclusion

Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids may result in a reduction of wheal size and little to no difference in overall adverse events. Topical corticosteroids may reduce itch severity, but the evidence is very uncertain. Future large, randomized trials addressing the use of topical corticosteroids would further support optimal urticaria management.

### A randomized controlled trial of adding intravenous corticosteroids to H1 antihistamines in patients with acute urticaria [^111rrU4R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute urticaria is a common dermatological condition in emergency departments (EDs). The main therapy involves controlling pruritus with antihistamines. Although guidelines have promoted the use of corticosteroids in addition to H1 antihistamines, well-designed clinical trials evaluating this approach are scarce.

Methods

Adult ED patients with acute urticaria and a pruritus score > 5 on a visual analog scale (VAS) were randomized into three groups: (i) IV chlorpheniramine (CPM) treatment, (ii) IV CPM and IV dexamethasone (CPM/Dex) and (iii) IV CPM and IV dexamethasone with oral prednisolone as discharge medication for 5 days (CPM/Dex/Pred). The primary outcomes were self-reported pruritus VAS scores at 60 min after treatment. We also evaluated 1-week and 1-month urticaria activity scores for 7 days and adverse events.

Results

Seventy-five patients (25 per group) were enrolled. The VAS scores of all groups decreased, but no significant difference was found in the VAS scores at 60 min after treatment between patients in the CPM group (n = 25) and those who received both CPM and dexamethasone (n = 50). At the 1-week and 1-month follow-ups, active urticaria (indicated by the urticaria activity score at 7 days) was more prevalent in the CPM/Dex/Pred group (n = 25) than in the control group.

Conclusions

The present study did not find evidence that adding IV dexamethasone improves the treatment of severe pruritus from uncomplicated acute urticaria. Oral corticosteroid therapy may be associated with persistent urticaria activity. Due to the lack of clinical benefits and the potential for side effects, using corticosteroids as an adjunctive treatment is discouraged.

### Evaluation of pharmacological treatments for acute urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115a56An]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness and safety of pharmacological treatments for acute urticaria remain unclear.

Objective

To systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for acute urticaria in emergency department (ED) and non-ED settings.

Methods

We searched electronic databases and gray literature up to July 8, 2023, without language restrictions. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) relating to pharmacological interventions in patients with acute urticaria, regardless of age, were eligible for inclusion. The relevant outcomes of interest were the treatment efficacy and safety profiles. The results are presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs).

Results

We identified 8 RCTs comprising 680 patients. Regarding the ED setting (2 trials, n = 118), intramuscular first-generation H1-antihistamine (fgAH) was more efficacious in decreasing pruritus symptoms (SMD, -0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.75 to -0.02) but had higher sedative effects than H2-blockers. With comparable pruritus symptom improvement (2 trials, n = 295), intravenous second-generation H1-antihistamine (sgAH) had favorable clinical outcomes compared with intravenous fgAH in the ED setting with a lower risk of return to any ED/clinic (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12–0.83) and lower risk of any adverse event (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09–0.63). The efficacy of adjunctive therapy with a short course of systemic glucocorticosteroids in ED and non-ED settings remains unclear. No serious concerns regarding the safety profiles were observed in any of the treatment comparisons.

Conclusions

H1-antihistamine is a crucial and effective component of acute urticaria treatment, and intravenous sgAH is preferred as an initial treatment option.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117DXoV3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — oral corticosteroids — In severe cases oral corticosteroids might be necessary, and in patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course might be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing a treatment plan; a short course can be considered if symptoms are severe or not resolving with antihistamines. A randomized controlled study in adults showed that adding oral corticosteroids to antihistamines decreased time to resolution of acute urticaria symptoms in an emergency department setting, and a small study in adults and children showed more rapid resolution with oral corticosteroids than with antihistamines; however, these findings are not sufficient to warrant routine use of oral corticosteroids rather than antihistamines. Use of oral corticosteroids for acute urticaria/angioedema is common in an adult emergency department setting.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111CGBHE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### Levocetirizine and prednisone are not superior to levocetirizine alone for the treatment of acute urticaria: a randomized double-blind clinical Trial [^1168ZE8j]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the efficacy of a 4-day course of prednisone added to antihistamine for the management of acute urticaria in an emergency department (ED).

Methods

In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients were eligible for inclusion if aged 18 years or older and with acute urticaria of no more than 24 hours' duration. Patients with anaphylaxis or who had received antihistamines or glucocorticoids during the previous 5 days were not included. In addition to levocetirizine (5 mg orally for 5 days), patients were assigned to receive prednisone (40 mg orally for 4 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was itching relief 2 days after the ED visit, rated on a numeric scale of 0 to 10. Secondary endpoints were rash resolution, relapses, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 100 patients were included, 50 in each group. Seven patients in the prednisone group and 8 in the placebo group discontinued treatment. At 2-day follow-up, 62% of patients in the prednisone group had an itch score of 0 versus 76% of those in the placebo group (Δ 14%; 95% confidence interval -31% to 4%). Thirty percent of patients in the prednisone group and 24% in the placebo group reported relapses (Δ 6%; 95% confidence interval -23% to 11%). Mild adverse events were reported by 12% of patients in the prednisone group and 14% in the placebo group.

Conclusion

The addition of a prednisone burst did not improve the symptomatic and clinical response of acute urticaria to levocetirizine. This study does not support the addition of corticosteroid to H 1 antihistamine as first-line treatment of acute urticaria without angioedema.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113yCpwb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — systemic corticosteroids: Summary Statement 83 notes systemic corticosteroids are "frequently used in patients with refractory CU, but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy", and that "short-term use (eg, 1–3 weeks' duration) might be required" until other therapies control symptoms, whereas "long-term use for treatment of patients with CU should be avoided as much as possible". Short-term use guidance specifies that "Dose adjustment tapering is not necessary in patients receiving 40 mg or equivalent doses of prednisone daily for 3 weeks or less", and long-term risks include "osteoporosis with increased risk of fracture, avascular necrosis, cataracts, hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, risk of infection, and thinning of the skin". Evidence cited includes a study of "40 patients with DPUA" using a "7-week taper of prednisone" in which "Thirty percent of subjects withdrew from the prednisone treatment group because of adverse effects", and a prospective series of "17 patients… (3–30 days per month)" where "47% had a short relapse or worsening of their urticaria on withdrawal of corticosteroids".

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117Btbxz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Factors associated with relapses among patients treated for acute urticaria [^113xbSFL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The benefit of corticosteroids in acute urticaria is controversial. Our objective was to determine the factors associated with relapses in patients presenting with acute urticaria. A retrospective observational study, including all patients with acute urticaria who visited the angioedema reference center of Academic Public Hospitals - Saint-Antoine in Paris between January 2015 and June 2017, was conducted. The study inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of acute urticaria in an adult patient. The urticaria was spontaneous or inducible urticaria. The primary outcome was relapse at day 7 and the secondary outcome was relapse at week 6. A total of 184 patients with a first episode of acute urticaria were included. Most of the patients were female (66%) with a mean age of 42 ± 16 years. Corticosteroid administration for treatment of acute urticaria was used in 102 (55%) patients. Overall, 85 (46%) patients had relapses after less than 7 days whereas 168 (91%) patients had relapses after more than 6 weeks. In univariate analysis, the rate of corticosteroid administration was significantly higher in cases of relapse after less than 7 days. No difference in relapse rates after more than 6 weeks appeared. In the multivariate analysis, the independent factor associated with relapses after less than 7 days was the administration of corticosteroids as treatment of acute urticaria (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–3.57; P = 0.03). The prevalence of corticosteroid administration for patients with acute urticaria was high. Corticosteroid administration was an independent risk factor associated with relapses after less than 7 days.

Oral corticosteroids in urticaria — short-term risk and monitoring — note that adverse effects such as adrenal suppression and bone/growth effects are unlikely with short-term use (< 2 weeks), and patients receiving oral corticosteroid therapy should be clinically monitored for response to therapy, side effects, and effects on comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes.

Controlled clinical trials have not provided any evidence supporting long-term treatment with systemic steroids in CSU, and the prolonged use of steroids is not recommended due to their side-effects. Short courses of systemic steroids could be used in patients with severe exacerbation episodes, particularly when accompanied by angioedema or in patients with a minimal or partial response to antihistamine treatment. The dosages and weaning regimens of steroids for urticaria are variable, ranging from progressive reduction over 10 days to complex therapeutic regimens with alternate-day dose reduction.

Key point: Corticosteroids are not recommended as long-term CSU therapy. However, a short course of steroids might be useful to control exacerbation.

In which patients with CSU may oral calcineurin inhibitors be used as an therapeutic option in CSU? Four randomized controlled trials have reported favourable effects from the use of cyclosporine in patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema who are unresponsive to high doses of second-generation antihistamines. Treatment for 2–4 months has been used, with better results. One study noted improvement after discontinuation of cyclosporine, one-third of patients had complete remission, one-third had their disease controlled with antihistamines, and one-third returned to the severity level previous to cyclosporine therapy. However, cyclosporine has serious side-effects that may outweigh its benefits – especially the high risk of developing renal injury. Minimal data are available on the use of tacrolimus in chronic urticaria. However, the place of cyclosporine has varied as the approval of omalizumab as an indication for CSU.

### EAACI / GA2LEN / EDF guideline: management of urticaria [^1133Gurw]. Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

This guideline is the result of a consensus reached during a panel discussion at the second International Consensus Meeting on Urticara, Urticaria 2004, a joint initiative of the EAACI Dermatology Section and GA2LEN. Urticaria has a profound impact on the quality of life, and effective treatment is therefore required. The recommended first line treatment are nonsedating H1 antihistamines. They have proven to be effective in double-blind controlled studies, but dosages increased up to fourfold over the recommended doses may be necessary. However, for different urticaria subtypes and in view of individual variation in the course of the disease and response to treatment, additional or alternative therapies may be required. Immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporin A and corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term treatment due to unavoidable severe adverse effects. This guideline was, in addition, accepted by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and formally approved by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).

Chronic urticaria — cyclosporine randomized trials and internal validity concerns indicate that 4 double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in patients with CUA refractory to high-dose antihistamines were identified and appraised, but study-specific biases included imbalanced prior corticosteroid exposure (60% required corticosteroids, 78% assigned to the treatment group), early cross-over after only 2 weeks when 80% of the cetirizine arm had daily severe relapses requiring systemic steroid treatment, and one trial that randomized cyclosporine for either 1 or 3 months without a comparator group.

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach [^113qfUoj]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria (i.e., pruritic, raised wheals) and angioedema (i.e., deep mucocutaneous swelling) occur in up to 25 percent of the U.S. population. Vasoactive mediators released from mast cells and basophils produce the classic wheal and flare reaction. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially if symptoms are chronic or minimally responsive to therapy. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and methodical investigation are necessary to uncover diagnostic clues. Although serious medical illness can occur concurrently with chronic urticaria, acute urticaria generally is benign and self-limited. The mainstay of therapy for urticaria is avoidance of known triggering agents, judicious use of oral corticosteroids, and treatment with long-acting second-generation antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory leukotriene antagonists. Consultation for investigative therapy may be necessary if symptoms continue despite a stepwise approach to diagnosis and therapy.

Abstract

The global pandemic COVID‐19 has resulted in significant global morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare demands. There is now emerging evidence of patients experiencing urticaria. We sought to systematically review current evidence, critique the literature, and present our findings. Allowing PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was carried out with Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, using key MeSH words, which include "COVID‐19", "Coronavirus", "SARS‐Cov‐2", "Urticaria", "Angioedema", and "Skin rash" up to 01 August 2020. The key inclusion criteria were articles that reported on urticaria and/or angioedema due to COVID‐19 infection and reported management and outcome. Studies were excluded if no case or cohort outcomes were observed. Our search returned 169 articles, 25 of which met inclusion criteria. All studies were case reports, reporting 26 patients with urticaria and/or angioedema, COVID‐19 infection and their management and/or response. ajority of patients (n = 16, 69%) were over 50 years old. However, urticaria in the younger ages was not uncommon, with reported case of 2 months old infant. Skin lesions resolved from less than 24 hours to up to 2 weeks following treatment with antihistamines and/or steroids. There have been no cases of recurrent urticaria or cases nonresponsive to steroids. Management of urticarial in COVID‐19 patients should involve antihistamines. Low dose prednisolone should be considered on an individualized basis. Further research is required in understanding urticarial pathogenesis in COVID‐19. This will aid early diagnostic assessment in patients with high index of suspicion and subsequent management in the acute phase.

Chronic urticaria — alternative therapies and definition of refractory disease: Summary Statement 84 specifies that patients "not adequately controlled on maximally tolerated antihistamine therapy (eg, doxepin at a dose of 75–125 mg/d) might be considered to have refractory CU". Summary Statement 85 states "A number of alternative therapies have been studied for the treatment of CU; these therapies merit consideration for patients with refractory CU". The text notes that "as many as 50% of these patients might not achieve satisfactory control with antihistamine therapy", and alternatives are evaluated "to reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids". Summary Statement 86 adds that anti-inflammatory agents "including dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine, have limited evidence for efficacy… and some require laboratory monitoring for adverse effects", yet "are generally well tolerated, might be efficacious in properly selected patients, and can be considered for treatment of patients with antihistamine-refractory CU".

### Urticaria: a review [^111AUH2f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Urticaria is often classified as acute, chronic, or physical based on duration of symptoms and the presence or absence of inducing stimuli. Urticarial vasculitis, contact urticaria, and special syndromes are also included under the broad heading of urticaria. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria include the finding of autoantibodies to mast cell receptors in nearly half of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. These patients may have more severe disease and require more aggressive therapies. Extensive laboratory evaluation for patients with chronic urticaria is typically unrevealing and there are no compelling data that associate urticaria with chronic infections or malignancy. Pharmacologic therapy consists primarily of the appropriate use of first- and second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antihistamines. Additional therapy may include leukotriene receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents for severe, unremitting disease. Despite our greater understanding of the pathogenesis of urticaria, the condition remains a frustrating entity for many patients, particularly those with chronic urticaria.

### Urticaria and angioedema: an overview [^112YDWBG]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Persistent or frequent episodes of urticaria are difficult to evaluate and treat. The best test to identify most patients with a specific underlying cause (eg, physical trigger, allergen, systemic disease) likely is the taking of a careful and detailed history and performance of a physical examination by a specialist who is knowledgeable in urticarial disease. Further study of the pathogenesis and treatment of urticaria is crucial. Given the limited efficacy of presently approved antihistamine treatments and the significant side effects of steroids and cyclosporine, there is a pressing need to evaluate other anecdotally supported urticaria treatments in randomized, controlled trials.

### Adverse events following short-course systemic corticosteroids among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114eRn3a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids are immunosuppressant anti-inflammatory drugs that, over the decades, have been widely used to treat a variety of children's illnesses including asthma, croup, and urticaria. From 2012 to 2017, corticosteroid prescriptions in Canada for children between 3 and 19 years totaled 55 000, with a prevalence of 0.9%. Systematic reviews have investigated the harms of short-term use of corticosteroids in children; one studysynthesized safety outcomes of corticosteroids but restricted to specific medical conditions, such as acute respiratory conditions, while another studyrestricted to only oral routes of corticosteroids.

In adults, the treatment of corticosteroid-associated adverse events (AEs) represents a substantial financial burden to patients and health care systems. This burden is expected to be comparable in pediatric populations. To our knowledge, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis available examining the harms of short-course systemic corticosteroids in a pediatric population across different illnesses. AEs are frequently misreported and underrepresented in systematic reviews when compared with effective outcomes. Observational studies are limited by uncertainty of whether apparent AEs are actually symptoms arising from the illness or are related to the drug themselves.

A major limitation of prior individual studies, and even systematic reviews of studies of individual clinical conditions, is relatively small numbers of patients, resulting in imprecision of estimates and low certainty evidence. While effectiveness of corticosteroids is likely to differ across clinical conditions, adverse effects are likely to be very similar. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to investigate the harms of short-term use of systemic corticosteroids in patients between 1 and younger than 18 years that can be generalized across a variety of pediatric clinical conditions. We limited our population to those older than 1 year because of the rapid physiological and behavioral changes that occur before 1 year but not after that age.

Appropriate management of urticaria depends on the correct evaluation of clinical patterns and causes where these can be identified. Guidance for treatment is presented, based on the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation. As many of the recommendations relate to the off-licence use of drugs, it is particularly important that clinicians should be familiar with dosing and side-effects of treatment in the context of managing urticaria.

4.4 Patient management

Classically, the recommended algorithm for treating urticaria includes the use of second‐generation antihistamines, and if inadequate control within 2‐4 weeks, the dose can be increased up to four times the original dose. If this is still inadequate control after a further 2‐4 weeks, specialist referral should be considered, where specialists can consider prescribing omalizumab and ciclosporin to help alleviate symptoms. However, in most patients, second generation oral antihistamines provide adequate control of urticaria. The pathophysiology of COVID‐19 related urticaria demonstrates that antihistamines alone will not stop mast cell histamine degranulation but will only act to reduce the severity of urticaria.

Low systemic steroids, on the other hand, target the COVID‐19 inflammatory storm, which prevents mast cell activation, and thus histamine release. Therefore, low dose systemic steroids may be able to effectively manage urticaria in COVID‐19 through their proposed mechanism of action. Combining this with antihistamines can improve patients' clinical response to urticaria. A further benefit of low dose steroids, shown through a randomized control trial, has demonstrated an increase in survival rate in COVID‐19 patients (Randomized Evaluation of COVID‐19 Therapy [RECOVERY], ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04381936). Although corticosteroids are promising, it may increase the risk of prolonged viral replication, so it may be best to use them for the shortest duration possible until symptoms are controlled. After this, consideration should be made to promptly switch to omalizumab. Ciclosporin is currently not recommended in COVID‐19 patients.

4.5 Limitations

All included articles were case. Only three case reports detailed pathological study results. A diagnostic characteristic of urticaria is that the cutaneous lesions must be evanescent (no one lesion should last more than 24 hours), however this was only noted by Falkenhain‐López et al.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^117ViBdX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### A survey of emergency department management of acute urticaria in children [^115KdPTM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe emergency department management of acute urticaria in children and to determine factors associated with management strategies and adherence to practice guidelines.

Methods

Self-administered cross-sectional survey mailed to all Section of Emergency Medicine members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (n = 1190) and 1000 randomly selected members of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Main outcome measure was proportion of respondents adhering to published guidelines. Factors associated with management strategies were analyzed using bivariate and logistic regression analyses.

Results

Of 2190 surveys sent, 1137 (52.5%) were available for analysis. Respondents included 44.6% pediatric emergency physicians, 36.4% emergency physicians, and 15.3% pediatricians. First-generation histamine (H)1 antagonists alone were the most common therapy used on initial presentation of acute urticaria, followed by corticosteroids, H2 antagonists, and second-generation H1 antagonists, used by only 7.8%, despite their recommendation as first-line therapy. Physicians working in an emergency department as opposed to an urgent or primary care setting were less likely to use second-generation H1 antagonists (odds ratio [OR], 0.3 [0.1–0.7]). General emergency physicians were 2.6 times more likely to use H2 antagonists and more than 3 times as likely to use corticosteroids. Only 14.2% of physicians overall were familiar with guideline recommendations.

Conclusions

Minimal awareness and use of existing guidelines, and low concordance with published recommendations exist. Management practices vary and are influenced by training, practice setting, and clinical experience.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step-care antihistamine-based therapy — A "step-care approach has been developed for the management of CU", with second-generation antihistamines "considered first-line agents (step 1)". For patients not controlled on US Food and Drug Administration–approved monotherapy, "several treatment options can be used (step 2)", and "Higher doses of second-generation antihistamines might provide more efficacy, but data are limited and conflicting for certain agents". Add-on options where the "Addition of H2-antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists can be considered" and "First-generation antihistamines can also be considered" are followed by step 3, in which "Treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin can be considered". Systemic corticosteroids "are frequently used… but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy", although "short-term use (eg, 1–3 weeks' duration) might be required", while "long-term use… should be avoided as much as possible". Patients not adequately controlled "on maximal antihistamine therapy (eg, step 3 care) might be considered to have refractory CU".

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112Czzfq]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Urticaria commonly presents with intensely pruritic wheals, sometimes with edema of the subcutaneous or interstitial tissue. It has a lifetime prevalence of about 20%. Although often self-limited and benign, it can cause significant discomfort, continue for months to years, and uncommonly represent a serious systemic disease or life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria is caused by immunoglobulin E- and non-immunoglobulin E-mediated release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils. Diagnosis is made clinically; anaphylaxis must be ruled out. Chronic urticaria is idiopathic in 80% to 90% of cases. Only a limited nonspecific laboratory workup should be considered unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. The mainstay of treatment is avoidance of triggers, if identified. The first-line pharmacotherapy is second-generation H1 antihistamines, which can be titrated to greater than standard doses. First-generation H1 antihistamines, H2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, high-potency antihistamines, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. In refractory chronic urticaria, patients can be referred to subspecialists for additional treatments, such as omalizumab or cyclosporine. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within a year.

### Urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^114KLjLg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria involves intensely pruritic, raised wheals, with or without edema of the deeper cutis. It is usually a self-limited, benign reaction, but can be chronic. Rarely, it may represent serious systemic disease or a life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 20 percent in the general population. It is caused by immunoglobulin E- and nonimmunoglobulin E-mediated mast cell and basophil release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Diagnosis is made clinically. Chronic urticaria is usually idiopathic and requires only a simple laboratory workup unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. Treatment includes avoidance of triggers, although these can be identified in only 10 to 20 percent of patients with chronic urticaria. First-line pharmacotherapy for acute and chronic urticaria is nonsedating second-generation antihistamines (histamine H1 blockers), which can be titrated to larger than standard doses. First-generation antihistamines, histamine H2 blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within one year.

Chronic urticaria (CU) pharmacologic escalation — second‑generation antihistamines are considered first‑line, but monotherapy might not achieve complete control; when control is inadequate on labeled doses, higher doses, H2 antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists can be considered, and first‑generation antihistamines are also options. For persistent symptoms, treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin can be considered as part of Step 3. Systemic corticosteroids are frequently used in refractory CU, but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy; short‑term use (e.g., 1‑3 weeks' duration) might be required to gain control, and long‑term use should be avoided as much as possible. Patients not adequately controlled on maximal antihistamine therapy (e.g. Step 3 care) might be considered refractory; Step 4 options include omalizumab and cyclosporine, with omalizumab approved by the FDA at both 150 mg and 300 mg for CU patients unresponsive to H1 antagonists 12 years of age and older.

### Treatment of chronic urticaria [^111Gd1Pt]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines are unquestionably the first-line treatment for chronic urticaria and can be used at higher than licensed doses if normal doses fail to control the disease. A short course of oral corticosteroids should be considered for patients not responding to antihistamines before trying other immunosuppressive drugs. Ciclosporin is effective in most antihistamine-resistant patients who require long-term corticosteroid treatments to control their disease. Omalizumab is effective in most subsets of chronic urticaria sufferers who do not respond to other treatments but its high cost represents a limitation to its widespread use.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^112rikzV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema (DPUA) management — Management differs from other types of chronic urticaria/angioedema and is often very difficult to treat; additional pharmacotherapeutic treatment is frequently required with avoidance measures, and conventional antihistamine dosing frequently lacks efficacy. Patients should be made aware of pressure or trauma triggers and avoidance is a critical element. Antihistamines at conventional doses might be efficacious for chronic urticaria but are frequently ineffective for prevention of angioedema provoked by pressure; advancing doses beyond FDA‑approved levels might be associated with greater efficacy, including a double‑blind study of cetirizine at a dose of 30 mg/d. A short course of systemic corticosteroids might be required for ongoing episodes, although long‑term systemic corticosteroid treatment is not generally regarded as favorable. Reports on nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are mixed; no benefit was observed in a double‑blind trial of 25 mg of indomethacin 3 times daily, and COX‑1–inhibiting drugs can provoke a flare in aspirin‑exacerbated urticaria/angioedema, so prescribing aspirin or aspirin‑like drugs should be approached with caution. Uncontrolled reports describe salutary effects from agents including montelukast, sulfasalazine, chloroquine, dapsone, intravenous gamma globulin, sulindac, acitretin, and anti–TNF‑α, but randomized controlled trials are required to substantiate their utility.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria guidelines: what is new? [^1157LZBX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that can be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. Very recently, the newest update and revision of the international European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma Clinical Immunology guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria was published. It aims to help primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations approach to developing consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then discussed in a Delphi conference that included more than 250 specialists in the field, and they are endorsed by more than 50 international societies. Here, we highlight changes from previous versions of the international urticaria guideline and their impact on clinical practice.

### EAACI / GA (2) LEN / EDF / WAO guideline: management of urticaria [^111ZnxyK]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

This guideline, together with its sister guideline on the classification of urticaria (Zuberbier T, Asero R, Bindslev-Jensen C, Canonica GW, Church MK, Giménez-Arnau AM et al. EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline: definition, classification and diagnosis of urticaria. Allergy 2009;64: 1417–1426), is the result of a consensus reached during a panel discussion at the Third International Consensus Meeting on Urticaria, Urticaria 2008, a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-funded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2)LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO). As members of the panel, the authors had prepared their suggestions regarding management of urticaria before the meeting. The draft of the guideline took into account all available evidence in the literature (including Medline and Embase searches and hand searches of abstracts at international allergy congresses in 2004–2008) and was based on the existing consensus reports of the first and the second symposia in 2000 and 2004. These suggestions were then discussed in detail among the panel members and with the over 200 international specialists of the meeting to achieve a consensus using a simple voting system where appropriate. Urticaria has a profound impact on the quality of life and effective treatment is, therefore, required. The recommended first line treatment is new generation, nonsedating H(1)-antihistamines. If standard dosing is not effective, increasing the dosage up to four-fold is recommended. For patients who do not respond to a four-fold increase in dosage of nonsedating H(1)-antihistamines, it is recommended that second-line therapies should be added to the antihistamine treatment. In the choice of second-line treatment, both their costs and risk/benefit profiles are most important to consider. Corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term treatment due to their unavoidable severe adverse effects.

### Histaminergic angioedema [^117FCcej]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Angioedema is frequently categorized into histamine- or bradykinin-mediated disease. It is critical to determine the underlying mediator of symptoms as it directs treatment. Histaminergic angioedema is the most frequent cause of angioedema. It is classified as either acute (lasting < 6 weeks) or chronic (symptoms > 6 weeks). It is further classified into angioedema presenting with or without urticaria. Some patients with acute angioedema may have disease that becomes chronic. Mast cells and basophils are central to the underlying pathophysiology of histamine-mediated angioedema. The underlying treatments of histamine-mediated angioedema are antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^1124LK4j]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The working group analysed the studies (two persons independently for each intervention) by describing the effect estimates, biases and harms, then graded the level of evidence (from D – no direct research evidence, to A – several multicentric double‐blinded studies with concordant positive results and acceptable risks) after reaching unanimous consensus. The comments from the eight experts who were secondarily interviewed were incorporated into the recommendations, then the synthesis was submitted to a multidisciplinary panel of 28 reviewers, including health providers and patients, who scored each recommendation from 1 to 9.

The main points from the recommendations are as follows.
(i) A second‐generation H 1 antihistamine at a single dose is the recommended first‐line treatment for CSU. There is no evidence to favour one drug over another. Some H 1 antihistamines should be avoided in individuals who present a known increase in QT interval or those on enzymatic inhibitors.
(ii) In case of treatment insufficiency, the working group recommends a rapid increase in dosage (1 week to 2 months) until quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines, as a second‐line treatment.
(iii) The working group does not recommend the adjunction of H 2 antihistamines or montelukast to H 1 antihistamines in CSU, owing to the lack of demonstrated efficacy.
(iv) No studies assessed the efficacy or safety of systemic steroids in CSU. The working group does not currently recommend using them.
(v) As a third‐line treatment, in case of decreased QoL of individuals linked to refractory CSU, the working group recommends the adjunction of omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks)or ciclosporin (4–5 mg kg −1 per day during a 6‐month period) to H 1 antihistamines. Randomized controlled trials have shown that omalizumab is more effective than placebo, with good short‐term tolerance. No head‐to‐head trials have compared omalizumab and ciclosporin.
(vi) There is no evidence to indicate the optimal delay between the failure of quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines and initiation of omalizumab or ciclosporin; this would likely depend on the QoL of patients and the severity of the CSU.
(vii) Isolated studies of hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, high‐dose vitamin D, phototherapy and miltefosine for CSU have been published, but the working group does not recommend them because the data are too sparse.
(viii) The working group does not recommend systematic food exclusion diets because of no evidence of benefit for individuals with CSU. No prospective studies have been published to date on therapeutic education programmes and psychotherapy in CSU.
(ix) For children < 12 years old with CSU, single‐dose H 1 antihistamines can be used. The working group recommends favouring rupatadine and desloratadine in case of dosage escalation because more data are available than for other drugs. There is a real lack of evidence for third‐line treatments in paediatric populations.
(x) During pregnancy and breastfeeding, a single dose of cetirizine, levocetirizine or desloratadine is preferred because more safety data for these H 1 antihistamines are available. In case of refractory CSU, a specialized consultation is required.

### Do pediatric emergency physicians comply with guideline recommendations in management of patients with acute urticaria? [^115BjNPe]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the level of knowledge and practical preferences of pediatricians regarding acute urticaria (AU) management and to assess the effects of training provided in accordance with the current urticaria guideline recommendations on pediatricians who work in the pediatric emergency department (PED).

Methods

A theoretical training was provided to pediatricians regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AU in line with current urticaria guideline recommendations. Before the training, pediatricians completed a 10-item questionnaire. This prospective study assesses their treatment approaches in patients admitted to PED because of AU during the 6-month period before and the 1-year period after training.

Results

Four hundred seventeen children in the pretraining and 1085 children in the posttraining periods were treated for AU in PED. Forty-eight pediatricians participated in the training. According to their questionnaire responses, 35% of them used only H1 antihistamine (AH) treatment, 50% used second-generation H1 AH (2nd-GAH) as AHs, 75% preferred the oral route of administration, and 85.4% did not administer systemic corticosteroid (sCS) to all patients. Comparing the practice approaches of the pediatricians in the pretraining and posttraining periods, first-generation H1 antihistamine (1st-GAH) preference rate decreased from 68.4% to 30.3% and the sCS preference rate decreased from 58.5% to 25.7%, while the 2nd-GAH preference rate increased from 31.7% to 69.7% (P < 0.001 for all). No treatments were prescribed for 10.8% of patients before the training and 3% after the training during discharge at home (P < 0.05). Comparing the home treatment choices of the pediatricians in the pretraining and posttraining periods, 1st-GAH preference rate decreased from 11.5% to 5%, while the 2nd-GAH preference rate increased from 78.7% to 91.5% (for both parameters, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Practical treatment preferences of pediatricians in the treatment of children with AU differ considerably from both current guideline recommendations and their own theoretical knowledge, and training can enhance pediatricians' compliance with current guideline recommendations.

### Management of urticaria in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review [^111xS7n9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Urticaria is a significant manifestation of COVID‐19, notably affecting patient morbidity. As such the clinical presentation of urticaria can aid diagnostic assessment, while considering risk factors, such as G6PD deficiency and aberrant IL‐6 expression. Management of COVID‐19 patients should involve antihistamines. Low dose prednisolone should be considered on an individualized basis. Further research is required in understanding urticarial pathogenesis in COVID‐19. This will aid early diagnostic assessment in patients with high index of suspicion and subsequent management in the acute phase.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^115CLcmy]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Are corticosteroids effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendations

1 We suggest against the routine use of corticosteroids to treat anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 We suggest corticosteroids may be used as a third line intervention to treat underlying asthma or shock (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence)

(adapted from RCUK 2008 and JTFPP 2020 guidelines, in view of new data which casts further doubt on the efficacy of steroids to prevent biphasic reactions and possibility of harm (increased need for hospitalisation) in at least one study)

Rationale

The primary action of corticosteroids is the downregulation of the late (rather than early) phase inflammatory response. Given the (slow) absorption kinetics of corticosteroids and their mechanism of action (i.e. through an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB), it is theoretically unlikely that corticosteroids are of benefit in the acute treatment of anaphylaxis;, the rationale for use is therefore to prevent biphasic reactions. However, a 2012 Cochrane systematic review concluded "clinicians should be aware of the lack of a strong evidence base for the use of a glucocorticoid for anaphylaxis". Subsequent systematic reviews have confirmed the absence of evidence that corticosteroids reduce reaction severity or prevent biphasic reactions.

As with antihistamines, corticosteroids are administered far more frequently than adrenaline for the acute treatment of anaphylaxis, implying that their use may distract from the need to administer adrenaline. However, of greater concern is emerging evidence that routine use of corticosteroids for anaphylaxis may be harmful, and associated with increased morbidity even after correcting for confounding by indication. In the Canadian C-CARE registry, hospitalisation and/or admission to intensive care was associated with prehospital treatment with corticosteroids (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.55–6.97, adjusted for reaction severity and treatments administered). It is unclear why steroids might increase morbidity: the association was present even after adjusting for prehospital adrenaline.

We therefore recommend against the routine use of corticosteroids to treat anaphylaxis (weak recommendation). Corticosteroids may be of benefit in the following specific scenarios: refractory anaphylaxis (defined as anaphylaxis requiring ongoing treatment despite two appropriate doses of IM adrenaline) and anaphylaxis occurring in the context of poorly-controlled asthma. With the absence of evidence in such cases and the possibility of a different risk:benefit ratio, it is reasonable to include corticosteroids as part of the management for refractory anaphylaxis, but only as an adjunct and not in preference to adrenaline or other inotropes/vasopressor agents.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^112QZrpZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Unmet Needs, Knowledge Gaps, Future Studies

As outlined above, there are many unmet needs and knowledge gaps when it comes to the discontinuation of CSU treatment. Further studies are needed to obtain the evidence required to guide step-down decisions. Most importantly, we need to identify markers of spontaneous remission of CSU in patients with complete response to prophylactic treatment. In addition, we need to better characterize the benefits and challenges of stopping treatment all at once or by tapering, and the reasons for choosing either strategy. As the evidence and experience increase on when and how to discontinue CSU treatment, step-down recommendations should be included in future updates and revisions of the international urticaria guideline.

Chronic urticaria (CU) refractory disease (step 4) alternatives — For refractory CU, "these therapies merit consideration… (step 4)", with "Omalizumab and cyclosporine" having "the greatest published experience for efficacy". Omalizumab is supported by "large double-blind, randomized controlled trials" and "should be considered for refractory CU" when benefits, harms/burden, costs, and preferences align. Cyclosporine has observational and randomized-trial data but the latter are "low, leading to a weak recommendation for use of cyclosporine for refractory CU". Additional anti-inflammatory options (dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine) have "limited evidence" and "might be considered for properly selected patients", and other used agents include "thyroxine, attenuated androgens, anticoagulants, NSAIDs, β-agonists, cyclophosphamide, gold, plasmapheresis, cromolyn, and nifedipine".

### Chronic urticaria: a role for newer immunomodulatory drugs? [^112Xj7ff]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is now recognized as an autoreactive disorder in a substantial fraction of patients. A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50–60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs. A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night. Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7–14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20–50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111fWigc]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

There are many unsolved issues in CSU, from the underlying lack of large epidemiology studies. In the present review, practical guidance based on common questions related to the clinical management of patients with CSU is provided. We selected key questions from previously published guidelines and updated them using the most recently available evidence obtained from a careful critique of the literature. We also tried to cover a number of topics that are given less attention in current CSU guidelines, such as prognosis, severity assessment and urticaria duration.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111APzz1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Summary Statement 61 — urticaria-like dermatoses can occur at various stages of pregnancy (C) (Table VI), with gestational pemphigoid presenting with abrupt onset of pruritic papular urticarial annularity on the trunk (especially about the umbilicus) that becomes generalized and blistering then occurs; up to 10% of newborns of affected mothers can present with an eruption, ELISA to BP180NC16A has 90% sensitivity and similar specificity, initial treatment includes topical glucocorticoids (class III to class I) with ointments providing the best results, and for pemphigoid refractory to topical corticosteroids an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone that is then tapered slowly is beneficial with flares at delivery and recurrences with menstruation and oral contraceptives (in 25% of women). Prurigo of pregnancy is characterized by extremely pruritic papules and nodules predominantly on the extensor surfaces, the papules can last for weeks to months after delivery, histopathology is nonspecific with negative immunofluorescence, and treatment is mostly supportive with topical corticosteroids. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy can begin within the abdominal striae (sparing the umbilicus) during the third trimester in primigravid women, the involvement spares the face, hands, and soles and can recur with subsequent pregnancies with a higher prevalence of multiple-gestation pregnancy, and within the differential urticaria, prurigo of pregnancy, gestational pemphigoid, viral exanthems, and contact dermatitis can be considered.

### Treatment of refractory chronic urticaria: current and future therapeutic options [^113tFPLY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a distressing disease that affects up to 1% of the general population at a time point in life and may severely worsen the quality of life. First-line treatment has been based on antihistamines, and presently relies on the use of non-sedating, second-generation antihistamines; following the recommendations of the recent international guidelines, in patients who do not respond to antihistamines at licensed doses, the daily dosage of these drugs can be increased up to fourfold. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients with chronic urticaria remain poorly controlled; in these cases, alternative therapeutic approaches have to be considered. This article critically reviews all of the third- and fourth-line treatment options suggested for patients whose disease is refractory to antihistamines, including systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, several different anti-inflammatory drugs (dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine), various immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), intravenous immunoglobulin, and newer treatment options, such as omalizumab and other biologic drugs. In addition, the article examines possible future treatment options based on recent findings about pathogenic mechanisms, and considers the treatment of antihistamine-unresponsive urticaria in special conditions such as children and pregnancy/lactation. The evidence supporting the use of several of the discussed drugs is presently limited and thus insufficient to recommend their routine use; as a consequence, such compounds should be considered only in specific cases and in adequate settings.

### Chronic unremitting urticaria: is the use of antihistamines above the licensed dose effective? A preliminary study of cetirizine at licensed and above-licensed doses [^115iReEd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, several authors have suggested an off-label increase of antihistamine dosage should be given to patients with chronic urticaria (CU) not responding to the usual, recommended doses, in order to gain better control of the disease. However, this recommendation is not evidence-based. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of increased doses of antihistamines in patients with CU showing poor control at recommended doses. In total, 22 adult patients with moderate/severe CU not controlled with the usual antihistamine doses were studied. These subjects recorded urticaria severity on a visual analogue scale (range 0–10) for 2 weeks. During the first week, they were treated with cetirizine at the licensed dose (10 mg/day), and with a three-fold increased dose (10 mg x 3/day) during week 2. Only 1 patient (5%) responded satisfactorily to the increased dosage of antihistamine; in the remaining 21 subjects, urticaria scores did not change, and these patients had to be treated with steroids, ciclosporin, and in 1 case with cyclophosphamide. Disease control was eventually gained in all cases. This study suggests that the proportion of patients with severe CU that may gain a better control of their disease with high, off-label doses of antihistamines is probably small, and that most patients will eventually have to undergo more aggressive treatments.

Are there biomarkers of activity in CSU?

The severity of CSU should be evaluated based on the intensity of its clinical symptoms. Several biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein and D-dimers, metalloproteinase-9 and complement C3 and C4, have shown distinctive patterns in CSU patients, but these molecules have still not been validated as useful biomarkers.

Key point: Although several substances may show specific levels in CSU patients, they have not yet been validated as CSU biomarkers.

Does isolated angioedema have clinical, therapeutic and/or prognostic implications?

Isolated angioedema with no hives that responds to antihistamines should be explored and phenotyped. Most guidelines – include isolated angioedema as a subtype of CSU. However, this condition does not share the typical features of chronic urticaria, such as being more frequent in women or having an autoimmune profile. In certain cases, typical CSU starts with isolated angioedema that evolves into cutaneous wheals. On the other hand, histaminergic angioedema is clearly different from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids, has a different physiopathology – and requires a different treatment approach. The differential diagnosis for isolated angioedema is shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of isolated angioedema

Key point: Isolated angioedema does not share the typical features of CSU.

How should the diagnosis of CSU in children be approached?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is less frequent in children, but in general, it shares the underlying causes and physiopathology of CSU in adults. Therefore, the diagnostic approach in children and adults is the same. However, it should be noted that infants are more prone to develop acute urticaria secondary to an infection.

Key point: The diagnostic approach to CSU in children should be the same as that in adults.

### Chronic urticaria: recent advances [^113PRn5A]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is an umbrella term, which encompasses physical urticarias, chronic "idiopathic" urticaria and urticarial vasculitis. It is important to recognize patients with physical urticarias as the investigation and treatment differs in important ways from patients with idiopathic chronic urticaria or urticarial vasculitis. Although relatively uncommon, urticarial vasculitis is an important diagnosis to make and requires histological confirmation by biopsy. Underlying systemic disease and systemic involvement, especially of the kidneys, should be sought. It is now recognized that chronic "idiopathic" urticaria includes a subset with an autoimmune basis caused by circulating autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor (FceR1) and less commonly against IgE. Although the autologous serum skin test has been proven useful in prompting search for and characterization of circulating wheal-producing factors in chronic urticaria, its specificity as a screening test for presence of functional anti-FceR1 is low, and confirmation by demonstration of histamine-releasing activity in the patient's serum must be the benchmark test in establishing this diagnosis. Improved screening tests are being sought; for example, ability of the chronic urticaria patient's serum to evoke expression of CD 203c on donor human basophils is showing some promise. The strong association between autoimmune thyroid disease and autoimmune urticaria is also an area of ongoing research. Drug treatment continues to be centered on the H1 antihistamines, and the newer second-generation compounds appear to be safe and effective even in off-label dosage. Use of systemic steroids should be confined to special circumstances such as tapering regimens for acute flare-ups. Use of leukotriene antagonists is becoming popular, but the evidence for efficacy is conflicting. Cyclosporin is also effective and can be used in selected cases of autoimmune urticaria, and it is also effective in non-autoimmune cases, although less so.

EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO International Guideline: recommended treatment algorithm for urticaria. Short course (maximum of 10 days) of corticosteroids may also be used at all times if exacerbations demand this. EAACI, European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology; EDF, European Dermatology Forum; GA 2 LEN, Global Allergy and Asthma European Network; H1-AH, H1 antihistamine; WAO, World Allergy Organization

Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-IgE antibody) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for CSU and the first drug approved for use in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1-AH treatment. Omalizumab is shown to be safe and effective across randomized placebo-controlled trials and several real-world studies, with a total patient exposure of 1,328,183 patient years (Novartis data on file, Dec 2019). Omalizumab binds IgE and rapidly reduces levels of free IgE by > 90%, resulting in a subsequent reduction of FcεRI, the high affinity IgE receptor, on blood basophils and mast cells in the skin. Both of these mechanisms are thought to importantly contribute to the efficacy of omalizumab in urticaria. Additional modes of action of omalizumab may exist in urticaria and further research will be necessary to fully clarify the potential of omalizumab in CSU. The definition of response to treatment in CSU differs between clinical trials, real-world studies and daily practice of individual physicians globally, and, therefore, the response to treatment in CSU also depends upon how it is measured. Commonly used categories for complete and well-controlled disease activity for CSU include Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) over 7 days (UAS7) of 0 and of ≤ 6 respectively. Omalizumab non-responders to treatment are generally considered to be those patients whose baseline UAS7 remains unchanged after treatment or who continue to present a UAS7 > 16 after six doses of omalizumab at 300 mg every 4 weeks. Partial responders are often defined by a reduction of the UAS7 by at least 30%, but by less than 90% or by patients showing a UAS7 > 6 but with an improvement in UAS7 as compared with baseline. Using the Urticaria Control Test (UCT), the cutoff values for "controlled disease" is ≥ 12 which is often considered as a complete response to treatment (complete control = 16, controlled urticaria ≥ 12, no control < 12). As per the current EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline, the third line of treatment is recommended for the partial and non-responders to updosed AH treatment. The licensed dose of omalizumab is 300 mg in Europe and either 150 mg or 300 mg in the United States by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Some reports have shown examples of the optimization of omalizumab treatment in patients who show inadequate response by increasing the dose or decreasing the dosing intervals; a more flexible treatment regimen rather than a constant regimen including shortening dosing interval or augmenting dose based on the patient's symptoms is also likely to provide better symptom control. Although there is currently no algorithm for the individualized management of omalizumab treatment that is agreed on, treatment algorithms based on specific response profiles of patients refractory to AHs have been proposed to facilitate clinical management of omalizumab and enable clinicians to assess therapeutic strategy. The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the published real-world evidences for the updosing of omalizumab in the treatment of CSU.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1179SnLv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — antihistamines — In most cases antihistamines are effective therapy, and after eliminating identifiable triggers, high-quality evidence supports antihistamines as first-line therapy. Second-generation antihistamines are designed to limit transfer across the blood-brain barrier and have less sedating effects than first-generation agents; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills and should be prescribed with caution in older adults, and higher than FDA-approved doses of some second-generation antihistamines can cause sedation. Second-generation antihistamines are effective for acute urticaria when used regularly and titrated to an effective dose in most patients, with reassuring long-term safety, even in small children; other medications with potent antihistaminic activity, such as doxepin, might have efficacy when FDA-approved antihistamines lack sufficient efficacy, and Histamine 2 blockers, in combination with H1-antihistamines, might be considered, although the evidence supporting this combination is weak.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### Managing urticarial vasculitis: a clinical decision-making algorithm based on expert consensus [^111unexc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic Glucocorticosteroids

Systemic glucocorticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs frequently used to manage various inflammatory dermatologic conditions, including UV. They work by suppressing inflammation and modulating immune responses, thereby alleviating symptoms and improving patient outcomes. In seven studies involving 287 patients with UV treated with SGC from 2007 to 2023, a common dosage regimen was 0.5–1 mg/kg per day (Table 7 of the ESM). Treatment typically began with daily administration for 1–2 weeks, followed by gradual tapering of the dosage. Significant improvements in skin symptoms were observed across all studies that ranged from 44.8% (n = 39/87) to 100% (n = 20) of patients. Likewise, improvement in extracutaneous symptoms was noted in 32% (n = 57) to 93.3% (n = 56/60) of cases. These findings underscore their role as a cornerstone in the therapeutic armamentarium for this condition. However, because of potential side effects such as hyperglycemia, arterial hypertension, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis, long-term use of SGCs should be avoided.

Combined Immunosuppressive Treatment

Other immunosuppressive medications were used in several patients with difficult-to-treat UV including those with underlying conditions such as SLE, often in combination with SGC. Cyclosporine A, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are typically employed as second-line therapies for moderate-to-severe cutaneous vasculitis. The combined use of SGC and immunosuppressants has been shown to improve efficacy in controlling both cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations of UV compared with SGC alone, although response rates and treatment duration may vary among different agents. One study reported response rates of 74% for cutaneous symptoms and 63% for immunologic responses, defined as normalization of C3 and/or C4 levels, in cases of refractory and/or relapsing disease when SGCs are combined with conventional immunosuppressive agents. Furthermore, supplementary immunosuppressive therapy has been beneficial in reducing SGC dosages.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step‑care pharmacologic therapy (annotations 1–4) includes monotherapy with second-generation H1-antagonists that are effective in the majority of patients and are generally tolerated without remarkable untoward effects; when control is not achieved, higher doses of second-generation antihistamines, including a 2- to 4-fold increase in the FDA-approved dose, and combination strategies with an H2-antihistamine and/or an antileukotriene agent are described, with H2-antagonists having shown benefit with first-generation antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists that can be considered in patients with CU with unsatisfactory response to antihistamine therapy; a therapeutic trial of potent antihistamines (eg, hydroxyzine or doxepin) is included, with dose advancement of hydroxyzine efficacious and doxepin, advanced as tolerated, also efficacious, while first-generation antihistamines cause significantly greater impairment and should be prescribed cautiously in the elderly or in patients with occupations requiring alertness; for refractory CU, alternative agents merit consideration, with omalizumab and cyclosporine having the greatest published experience documenting efficacy, anti-inflammatory agents (dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine) that can be considered, other immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), and other biologics (intravenous or subcutaneous gammaglobulin, anti-TNF agents, IL-1 receptor antagonists, anti–B-cell therapies) that have been used.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116X2tMh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — testing recommendations and indications: Skin testing or laboratory evaluation for allergy to foods, food additives, or aeroallergens not supported by a specific history compatible with IgE-mediated pathogenesis has not been associated with improved outcomes of care and is not recommended. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness not suggested by the clinical history or physical examination and elimination diets are not recommended, and extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens (or antiviral therapy) is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. In contrast, skin testing or immunoassay to identify specific triggers for acute urticaria and angioedema can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested based on the patient's history, and skin testing in this scenario would only be done after the resolution of acute hives with suppression of antihistamines or through serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism.

Omalizumab — mechanism, dosing approach, and practical considerations in chronic urticaria: The mechanism in CU is "not clear but might entail an effect on basophil function", and efficacy has been reported "without detectable autoantibodies and low total serum IgE levels". Dosing has varied; "in some studies" it was administered per asthma guidelines based on serum IgE and body weight, yet "benefit was observed with a dose of either 150 or 300 mg every 4 weeks". Evidence quality is "of higher quality compared with that for other agents", but omalizumab is "more costly" and "might be difficult to obtain" because it is "currently FDA approved only for management of moderate-to-severe refractory asthma". Administration "entails the burden of receiving subcutaneous injections on a regular basis in a physician's office because of the risk for anaphylaxis", with a reported anaphylaxis rate of "0.09% in patients with allergic asthma" and unknown risk in CU. "Additional evidence is required" to define optimal dose, frequency, treatment duration, and step-down, and "There are no validated biomarkers or clinical markers that can predict response to omalizumab".

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^114BMBpo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria/angioedema is "acute" if it spans less than 6 weeks in duration, and in generalized cases a patient might merit administration of immediate emergency treatment (eg, epinephrine) to manage laryngeal obstruction. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be performed to identify a cause, documenting potential triggers and their timing, and a comprehensive review of systems should be carried out to assess for related disorders; physical examination should focus on lesion extent and dermatographia and include examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system. Findings from history and examination might serve to focus evaluation on a clear trigger for acute urticaria/angioedema, and a limited laboratory diagnostic evaluation might include CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TSH, and renal and liver profiles. Initial treatment is to remove or avoid factors that induce urticaria/angioedema, and once identifiable triggers have been eliminated, evidence supports the use of antihistamines as first-line therapy for persistent symptoms. Second-generation antihistamines are designed through chemical modifications.

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^113eiStZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in the adult patient is both an underappreciated and a difficult to treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch is the result of inflammatory skin disease and therefore may be responsive to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, often in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings. Skin findings, when present, can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous change, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching. Hereby, we describe our algorithm for evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus (urticarial dermatitis in particular), including evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for treatment of recalcitrant itch.

These parameters were developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP), representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI); the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI); and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The AAAAI and ACAAI have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing "The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update". This is a complete and comprehensive document at the current time. The medical environment is a changing environment, and not all recommendations will be appropriate for all patients. Because this document incorporated the efforts of many participants, no single individual, including those who served on the JTFPP, is authorized to provide an official AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Any request for information about or an interpretation of these practice parameters by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the Executive Offices of the AAAAI, the ACAAI, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The JTFPP understands that the cost of diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents is an important concern that might appropriately influence the work-up and treatment chosen for a given patient. The JTFPP recognizes that the emphasis of our primary recommendations regarding a medication might vary, for example, depending on third-party payer issues and product patent expiration dates. However, because a given test or agent's cost is so widely variable and there is a paucity of pharmacoeconomic data, the JTFPP generally does not consider cost when formulating practice parameter recommendations. In extraordinary circumstances, when the cost/benefit ratio of an intervention is prohibitive, as supported by pharmacoeconomic data, commentary might be provided. These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion. The JTFPP is committed to ensuring that the practice parameters are based on the best scientific evidence that is free of commercial bias. To this end, the parameter development process includes multiple layers of rigorous review. These layers include the workgroup convened to draft the parameter, the task force reviewers, and peer review by members of each sponsoring society. Although the task force has the final responsibility for the content of the documents submitted for publication, each reviewer comment will be discussed, and reviewers will receive written responses to comments, when appropriate. To preserve the greatest transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest, all members of the JTFPP and the practice parameter workgroups will complete a standard potential conflict of interest disclosure form, which will be available for external review by the sponsoring organization and any other interested individual. In addition, before confirming the selection of a Work Group chairperson, the Joint Task Force will discuss and resolve all relevant potential conflicts of interest associated with this selection. Finally, all members of parameter workgroups will be provided a written statement regarding the importance of ensuring that the parameter development process is free of commercial bias. Practice parameters are available online at www.jcaai.org and www.allergyparameters.org.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116NQmLv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — refractory management with omalizumab and cyclosporine states that "omalizumab should be considered for refractory CU if this is favorable from the standpoint of balancing the potential for benefit with the potential for harm/burden and cost and the decision to proceed is consistent with patients' values and preferences". For cyclosporine, observational data "suggests cyclosporine is efficacious for patients with refractory CU and capable of inducing remission", but "the quality of evidence from these randomized controlled trials supporting cyclosporine is low, leading to a weak recommendation for use of cyclosporine for refractory CU", and "Therefore clinicians need to carefully consider whether administration of cyclosporine is favorable from the standpoint of balancing the potential for benefit with the potential for harm and discuss this openly with patients to determine that the decision to proceed with a trial of cyclosporine is consistent with their values and preferences".

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^111qSgoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by Allergy and Immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach to management of patients using dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines followed by use of omalizumab and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases. In select patients (those with refractory chronic urticaria), nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals may have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often managed similar to chronic spontaneous urticaria. Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies of targeted therapies have been generally disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for management of hereditary angioedema. Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116C6tnp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step‑care algorithm — treatment proceeds from Step 1 to Step 4 with defined actions and general principles. Step 1 is monotherapy with a second‑generation antihistamine with avoidance of triggers (e.g. NSAIDs) and relevant physical factors if physical urticaria/angioedema syndrome is present. Step 2 includes dose advancement of the second‑generation antihistamine used in Step 1, adding another second‑generation antihistamine, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and adding a first‑generation antihistamine to be taken at bedtime. Step 3 is dose advancement of a potent antihistamine (e.g., hydroxyzine or doxepin) as tolerated. Step 4 adds an alternative agent such as omalizumab or cyclosporine, with other anti‑inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, or biologics as options. The figure further states to begin treatment at the step appropriate for the patient's level of severity and previous treatment history, that at each level of the step‑approach medication(s) should be assessed for patient tolerance and efficacy, and that step‑down in treatment is appropriate at any step once consistent control of urticaria/angioedema is achieved.

Omalizumab — efficacy and dosing in chronic urticaria: A single-blind proof-of-concept study in 12 patients with CUA used a 4-week placebo phase followed by omalizumab every 2 or 4 weeks for 16 weeks, with seven complete resolutions, four partial improvements, and one nonresponse. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in 90 participants with CU on an FDA-approved H1-antihistamine dose, subjects received a single dose of 75, 150, or 300 mg; both the 300- and 600-mg groups showed greater improvement than placebo with onset within 1 to 2 weeks. Another double-blind trial evaluated omalizumab versus placebo for 24 weeks in 49 patients with CU and IgE autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase, yielding 59% symptom free versus 14% with placebo. A phase III multicenter dose-ranging trial enrolled 323 subjects with moderate-to-severe CUA to receive 3 subcutaneous injections at 4-week intervals (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo), followed by a 16-week observation; the primary end point and other prespecified end points were significantly improved (P < .001) in those receiving 150 and 300 mg every 4 weeks after 12 weeks, with serious adverse events 300 mg 6% versus 150 mg 1%, 75 mg 1%, or placebo 3%. Another phase III study randomized 507 participants to 300 mg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (with a 16-week observation), where monthly 300 mg produced statistically significant benefit in itch severity scores at 12 weeks (P < .001).

### Office-based management of urticaria [^114KUtop]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common pruritic skin disorder that is often seen in the office and varies in severity and chronicity. The etiologic cause is frequently not identifiable. Urticaria may be associated with physical factors and triggers, including foods or medications. A significant percentage of patients with chronic urticaria have circulating autoantibodies directed toward immunoglobulin-E or the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin-E (FcepsilonRI), or have antithyroid antibodies that might play a role in the activation of the final common pathway in urticaria: mast cell activation and degranulation. Management begins with a careful investigation and elimination of eliciting factors when identified, followed by treatment of underlying disease. Antihistamines are the current mainstay of pharmacotherapy for urticaria, which provide symptomatic relief in most cases. In severe cases, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil; Sanofi-Synthelabo, New York, NY), and immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporin, are sometimes used by specialists.

Chronic urticaria/angioedema — cyclosporine evidence and recommendation: Randomized, controlled, double-blind studies examined cyclosporine for patients with CUA, but "it is unclear whether the likelihood of desirable effects from cyclosporine administration significantly outweighs the risk of undesirable effects". "Further studies are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment with cyclosporine", and "the quality of evidence supporting use of cyclosporine for refractory CUA is low". Accordingly, "On the basis of current evidence, this leads to a weak recommendation for use of cyclosporine in patients with CUA refractory to conventional treatment", with the caveat that "further research is very likely to have an important effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and might change the estimate", and that "The weak recommendation does not imply that cyclosporine might not be of benefit in properly selected patients with refractory CUA".

### Steroid treatment adds No benefit to antihistamines for… [^1115oS9U]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question In patients presenting with acute urticaria, is combination antihistamine/corticosteroid treatment more effective than antihistamine alone. Bottom Line The combination approach of steroids and antihista-mines offers no added benefit to antihistamines alone for the treatment of simple urticaria. Synopsis The investigators enrolled 100 adults who presented to an emergency department with a generalized rash for less than one day with fleeting wheals and itching but without angioedema or anaphylaxis. All patients were treated with the antihistamine levocetirizine, 5 mg daily for five days, and they were all randomized, using concealed allocation, to additionally receive placebo or prednisone, 40 mg daily for four days. On follow-up by telephone, 62% of patients treated with antihistamine/prednisone and 76% receiving antihistamine/placebo were asymptomatic.

Relapse of urticaria was similar in both groups. The study had 80% power to find a difference of 28 percentage points if a difference existed, and analysis was by intention to treat. Study design: Randomized controlled trial Funding source: Foundation Setting: Emergency department Reference: BarniolCDehoursEMalletJHouze-CerfonCHLauqueDCharpentierSLevocetirizine and prednisone are not superior to levocetirizine alone for the treatment of acute urticaria: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application… [^111wVvGA]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

| Cutaneous effects Atrophic changes Easy bruising Increased fragility Purpura Stellate pseudoscars Steroid atrophy Striae Telangiectasias Ulceration Infections Aggravation of cutaneous infection Granuloma gluteale infantum Masked infection Secondary infections Miscellaneous. The most common adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acneiform eruption, and purpura. 17 Mucocutaneous infections are also common with topical corticosteroid use. 20 The inflammatory suppression from topical corticosteroids can contribute to the prolongation, progression, and atypical presentation of cutaneous infections. Contact sensitization to topical corticosteroids can also occur but is rare. Differentiation from hypersensitivity to other components of the topical treatment is important if contact sensitization is suspected.

Systemic adverse effects that have been reported with topical corticosteroid use include cataracts, glaucoma, adrenal suppression, decreased growth rate, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and Cushing syndrome. 20 Adverse effects are rare with low-potency topical corticosteroids. 17 Evidence suggests that the risk of systemic adverse effects in adults is low if doses do not exceed 50 g per week, even with super-high-potency formulations. 21 Children are also more susceptible to systemic adverse effects because of their increased ratio of body surface area to weight. 22 Topical corticosteroid use has not been associated with adverse effects in patients who are lactating. 20 There is no evidence that topical corticosteroids lose effectiveness over time. 23 However, corticosteroid withdrawal can occur upon cessation after prolonged use on the face and genitals, causing erythema, scaling, stinging, burning, papules, pustules, and edema.
24.

Duration and Frequency of Treatment The duration of treatment depends on the strength of the corticosteroid and the condition being treated. In general, super-high-potency topical corticosteroids should be used for no more than three weeks at a time. High- and medium-potency corticosteroids should be used for no more than 12 weeks at a time. For treatments of longer duration, a potent corticosteroid may be used intermittently or transitioned to a milder corticosteroid for ongoing control. Lesions on the face, groin, and skinfolds may be treated in one- to two-week intervals. Therapy may be discontinued when the lesions resolve.
