## Question

Can Vyvanse 10 cause tachycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Vyvanse 10 mg can cause tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of lisdexamfetamine and whether stimulants mechanistically raise heart rate. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about tachycardia as an adverse reaction and whether it is dose-limited. Next, I will look for dose-ranging data that explicitly included a 10 mg arm with vital sign monitoring. After that, I should review pharmacokinetic and class-effect considerations to assess plausibility at low doses. Finally, I will consider patient risk factors and monitoring guidance, and then synthesize a clear answer with clinical caveats [^1145jmt3] [^1143UD34].

> Let me first consider the mechanism, because if the drug class predictably increases heart rate, tachycardia at low doses becomes physiologically plausible. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine; amphetamines increase synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine, producing sympathomimetic effects that stimulate beta-adrenergic receptors and raise heart rate and blood pressure, so tachycardia is an expected class effect rather than an outlier event [^1145jmt3] [^1167ipLe].

> Wait, let me verify what the official labeling and drug information say about tachycardia specifically. The FDA's SPL and labeling materials list tachycardia among common cardiovascular adverse reactions with lisdexamfetamine, and the Warnings and Precautions sections emphasize that CNS stimulants increase heart rate and blood pressure without restricting that risk to higher doses, which means there is no dose-based exemption in labeling language [^111rTbqP] [^1167ipLe]. I should also confirm additional warnings that explicitly mention tachycardia in the precautions language, which they do in SPL drug information advising vigilance for hypertension and tachycardia during therapy [^1153Lr1u].

> Next, I should review whether there is dose-specific evidence at 10 mg rather than inferring from higher doses alone. Hold on, I need to check the dose-ranging trials that included a 10 mg arm and collected vital signs prospectively. In a randomized, double-blind augmentation study in adults, participants were assigned to 10, 30, 50, or 70 mg lisdexamfetamine (or placebo), with structured vital sign monitoring; the program documented significant dose-response relationships for pulse and blood pressure, supporting measurable cardiovascular effects even at the lower end of the dose range and allowing down-titration for vital-sign elevations when necessary [^116b3SYf] [^113r1HhV] [^115bqyeH] [^115vnqFJ]. I should double-check that the protocol prespecified action thresholds for sustained increases in pulse, which it did, underscoring that clinically relevant heart rate increases can occur and be managed even at lower doses within the trial framework [^115t85GX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I want to ensure my pharmacokinetic reasoning is precise because I almost overgeneralized. I initially thought exposure was linear from 30–70 mg in adults, but hold on, I should verify that statement against the FDA data. The labeling indicates dextroamphetamine exposure is linear in pediatrics from 30–70 mg and in adults from 50–250 mg; so my earlier adult 30–70 mg linearity assumption was wrong, and I need to correct it accordingly, while noting that the sympathomimetic mechanism is operative across the labeled dose range and supports heart rate increases at any therapeutic dose, albeit smaller on average at lower doses [^1145jmt3] [^1167ipLe].

> I will now examine patient-level risk and monitoring guidance, because whether tachycardia emerges at 10 mg depends not only on dose but on susceptibility. Before prescribing, the FDA recommends assessing for cardiac disease and relevant family history; serious structural cardiac disease and significant arrhythmias are contraindications or situations to avoid, and ongoing monitoring of blood pressure and pulse is advised during treatment, consistent with how clinical trials permitted down-titration for sustained elevations [^115hQmw2] [^117VtbgR] [^1167ipLe] [^113r1HhV]. Let me also consider that even in controlled settings, predefined thresholds for increases in pulse could trigger intervention, reflecting that clinically meaningful tachycardia can occur and warrants proactive surveillance at all approved doses [^115t85GX].

> Let me review supportive signals from other populations to ensure consistency of the cardiovascular profile. In adolescents with ADHD and in adult controlled trials, lisdexamfetamine was associated with small mean increases in pulse and blood pressure, and tachycardia has been listed among adverse events in adult trials, further corroborating the propensity of this agent to raise heart rate across therapeutic use scenarios [^117SVgFU] [^11582Qvx]. I should confirm broader class consistency as well; tachycardia is recognized with other amphetamine products, reinforcing that this is a stimulant class effect rather than an idiosyncratic signal [^1138jGVL].

> But wait, what if concomitant conditions or drugs are driving the tachycardia rather than the 10 mg dose itself? I need to ensure I account for drug interactions and syndromes like serotonin syndrome, which can present with autonomic instability including tachycardia when stimulants are combined with serotonergic agents; this means that even a low stimulant dose may precipitate tachycardia in the wrong pharmacologic context, so medication reconciliation is essential [^116RXYMU].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, Vyvanse 10 mg can cause tachycardia; mechanistically it is a sympathomimetic, tachycardia is explicitly recognized in FDA materials without dose carve-outs, and dose-ranging data including a 10 mg arm demonstrate measurable effects on pulse with a dose-response pattern, meaning lower doses are not exempt even if mean changes are smaller than at higher doses [^1145jmt3] [^111rTbqP] [^115bqyeH]. Clinically, the likelihood and magnitude are influenced by individual susceptibility and co-medications, so baseline cardiac assessment and ongoing monitoring of pulse and blood pressure are prudent even at 10 mg, with avoidance in serious cardiac disease and consideration of dose adjustment or discontinuation if sustained tachycardia occurs [^115hQmw2] [^117VtbgR] [^1167ipLe].

---

Yes, Vyvanse 10 mg can cause **tachycardia**, though the risk is lower than at higher doses [^111rTbqP]. Clinical trials and postmarketing data show a **dose-dependent increase in heart rate** with lisdexamfetamine, and tachycardia is a known adverse effect even at low doses [^112bCrVV]. The average pulse increase at 10 mg is about **2–3 bpm** [^112bCrVV], but susceptible patients may have larger increases [^115t85GX]. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure at baseline [^115hQmw2] and during treatment, and use caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^1167ipLe].

---

## Clinical evidence of tachycardia at 10 mg dose

- **Dose-response relationship**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in adults with MDD showed a significant dose-response for pulse, with mean increases of 2.8 bpm at 10 mg, 4.2 bpm at 30 mg, 6.2 bpm at 50 mg, and 8.2 bpm at 70 mg [^112bCrVV]. This indicates even 10 mg can increase heart rate.
- **Clinical trials data**: In adult ADHD trials, tachycardia was reported in 2% of Vyvanse-treated patients versus 0% with placebo, and was a reason for discontinuation in some cases.
- **Postmarketing reports**: Tachycardia is a recognized adverse reaction [^111rTbqP] in postmarketing experience, including at lower doses [^1153Lr1u].

---

## Mechanism of tachycardia induction

Vyvanse is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine that increases norepinephrine and dopamine by promoting release and blocking reuptake, producing **sympathetic stimulation** with increased heart rate and blood pressure [^1145jmt3]. Even at 10 mg, this mechanism can trigger tachycardia, particularly in sensitive individuals.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing tachycardia risk

Several factors can **increase the risk** of tachycardia with Vyvanse 10 mg:

- **Age**: Older adults may be more susceptible to cardiovascular effects.
- **Pre-existing cardiovascular conditions**: Hypertension, arrhythmias, or structural heart disease increase risk [^1167ipLe].
- **Concomitant medications**: Other stimulants or serotonergic drugs can increase risk [^116RXYMU].
- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of cardiovascular disease or arrhythmias may increase risk [^115hQmw2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **careful monitoring** and patient selection:

- **Baseline assessment**: Evaluate cardiovascular status before starting Vyvanse, including history, family history, and physical exam [^115hQmw2].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment [^1167ipLe].
- **Dose adjustments**: Reduce dose or discontinue if clinically significant tachycardia occurs [^113r1HhV].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with serious cardiac disease, structural abnormalities, or arrhythmias [^117VtbgR].

---

## Clinical significance and management

At 10 mg, the average pulse increase is modest (~2–3 bpm) [^112bCrVV], and the risk is lower than at higher doses; however, tachycardia can still be **clinically significant** in susceptible patients who may experience larger increases. Management includes regular monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure [^1167ipLe], dose reduction or discontinuation if significant tachycardia occurs, and patient education on tachycardia symptoms and when to seek care. Clinicians should **monitor cardiovascular status** and adjust therapy as needed [^1128wf6m].

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the dose-response relationships of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate when used as augmentation for major depressive disorder in individuals exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.
- **Methods**: Eligible adults (18–65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus a lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparison procedures with modeling.
- **Results**: For the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p > 0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were −1.4 (−3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (−2.5, 2.7), −0.7 (−3.4, 2.0), and −0.9 (−3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant…

### Vyvanse [^115hQmw2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Prior to treating patients with VYVANSE, assess for the presence of cardiac disease. This includes conducting a careful history, examining any family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and performing a physical exam [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome and assess their family history before initiating VYVANSE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
- **General administration information**: Take VYVANSE orally in the morning with or without food; avoid afternoon doses because of the potential for insomnia. VYVANSE may be administered in one of the following ways:
	- **VYVANSE capsules**:
		- Swallow VYVANSE capsules whole, or
		- Open capsules, empty, and mix the entire contents with yogurt, water, or orange juice. If the contents include any compacted powder, a spoon may be used to break apart the powder. The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. Consume the mixture immediately; do not store it. The active ingredient dissolves completely once dispersed, though a film containing the inactive ingredients may remain in the container.
	- **VYVANSE chewable tablets**: They must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing. VYVANSE capsules can be substituted with VYVANSE chewable tablets on a unit per unit/mg per mg basis (e.g. a 30 mg capsule for a 30 mg chewable tablet) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not take less than one capsule or chewable tablet per day.

### Vyvanse [^1167ipLe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: Vyvanse has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of Vyvanse exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Vyvanse can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Vyvanse, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

	- Before prescribing Vyvanse, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store Vyvanse in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients not to give Vyvanse to anyone else. Throughout Vyvanse treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.
- **Risks to patients with serious cardiac disease**: Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid Vyvanse use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.
- **Increased blood pressure and heart rate**: CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase…

### Efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine for treatment of adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^116H8B4o]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is a public health problem associated with psychopathological symptoms and obesity and possibly with metabolic syndrome; it currently lacks approved pharmacotherapies.

The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a dextroamphetamine prodrug, in treating moderate to severe BED.

This research involved a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, forced dose titration, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at 30 sites from May 10, 2011, through January 30, 2012. Safety and intention-to-treat analyses included 259 and 255 adults with BED, respectively.

Participants received lisdexamfetamine dimesylate at dosages of 30, 50, or 70 mg/day, or a placebo, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The dosages were titrated over three weeks and maintained for eight weeks. A follow-up assessment occurred for a mean (standard deviation) of seven (two) days after the last dose.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: The change in binge-eating behaviors was assessed as days per week from baseline to week 11 using a mixed-effects model with transformed log (binge-eating days per week) +1. Secondary measures included binge-eating cessation for four weeks, and safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and change in weight.
- **Results**: At week 11, log-transformed binge-eating days per week decreased significantly in the 50 mg/day (least squares [LS] mean [standard error] change, -1.49 [0.066]; p = 0.008) and 70 mg/day (LS mean [SE] change, -1.57 [0.067]; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo group. However, there was no significant decrease in the 30 mg/day treatment group (LS mean [SE] change, -1.24 [0.067]; p = 0.88).

During the forced-dose titration portion of the double-blind treatment, doses were increased for participants randomized to LDX, while participants in the placebo group continued treatment as during the antidepressant lead-in phase. Participants randomized to 10 or 30 mg LDX started at these respective doses at week 8 and maintained them during weeks 9 and 10. Those randomized to 50 mg LDX started at 30 mg at week 8 and increased to 50 mg during week 9. Participants randomized to 70 mg LDX started at 30 mg at week 8 and increased to 50 mg and 70 mg during weeks 9 and 10, respectively. During the dose-maintenance portion of the double-blind treatment, participants continued at the target doses taken during week 10. Regardless of the treatment group or phase, LDX or placebo was taken once daily (at approximately 07:00 ± 2 h) along with their assigned antidepressant.

One down-titration was permitted during double-blind treatment to manage increases in blood pressure or pulse; assessments of vital signs, adverse events (AEs), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) responses were made in conjunction with any down-titration. Participants whose doses were decreased were allowed to continue the study at the lower dose; those requiring more than one dose reduction were discontinued from the study.

During the follow-up visit, which occurred 7–9 days after the last dose of the study drug, participants returned to the study site for a final evaluation.

This study was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for adults with major depressive disorder and inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy: Results from 2 phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^1128wf6m]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). High credibility.

The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) from two phase 3 studies are reported.
- **Methods**: Across study 1 (placebo, n = 201; LDX, n = 201) and study 2 (placebo, n = 213; LDX, n = 211), most participants (placebo and LDX) in the safety analysis set were female (study 1: 66.2% and 64.2%; study 2: 67.1% and 66.8%); mean ± SD ages were 41.8 ± 12.04 with placebo and 42.2 ± 12.32 with LDX in study 1 and 42.6 ± 11.41 with placebo and 42.0 ± 11.63 with LDX in study 2. Participants (18–65 years) had DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed MDD and lead-in baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores ≥ 24. Eight-week antidepressant lead-in phases prospectively assessed antidepressant response. Then, 8 weeks of randomized (1:1), double-blind treatment with dose-optimized LDX (20–70 mg) or placebo in participants exhibiting inadequate antidepressant monotherapy responses (augmentation baseline MADRS total scores ≥ 18 and < 50% MADRS total score reductions from lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline) was initiated. The primary endpoint was MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline to week 16. Safety and tolerability measures included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
- **Results**: Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences (LDX-placebo) for MADRS total score changes from augmentation baseline to week 16 were not statistically significant in study 1 (0.1 [-1.7, 2.0], P = 0.883) or study 2 (-0.5 [-2.3, 1.3], P = 0.583).

### Vyvanse [^1145jmt3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and BED is not known.
- **Pharmacodynamics**: Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The parent drug, lisdexamfetamine, does not bind to the sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Pharmacokinetic studies after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate have been conducted in healthy adult (capsule and chewable tablet formulations) and pediatric (6 to 12 years) patients with ADHD (capsule formulation). After single-dose administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, pharmacokinetics of dextroamphetamine was found to be linear between 30 mg and 70 mg in a pediatric study (6 to 12 years), and between 50 mg and 250 mg in an adult study. Dextroamphetamine pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults exhibited low inter-subject (< 25%) and intra-subject (< 8%) variability. There is no accumulation of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine at steady state in healthy adults.

Participant disposition and demographics are illustrated in Figure 3; most participants completed the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Most participants in the safety analysis set were white (72.2% (281/389)), female (67.9% (264/389)), and were allocated to receive ESC during the antidepressant lead-in phase (62.7% (244/389)). The mean ± SD age and body mass index (BMI), respectively, were 42.3 ± 11.61 years and 28.7 ± 5.49 kg/m². The mean ± SD MADRS total scores at lead-in and augmentation baseline were 33.9 ± 4.89 and 25.7 ± 5.12, respectively.
- **Participant disposition**: Figure 3 shows that some participants experienced sustained elevations in average sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) with increases of ⩾10 mm Hg from the antidepressant lead-in baseline and an average value ⩾140 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Similarly, average sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased by ⩾10 mm Hg from the antidepressant lead-in baseline, with an average value ⩾90 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Additionally, average pulse showed an increase of ⩾20 bpm from the antidepressant lead-in baseline, with an average value ⩾100 bpm on two consecutive visits.
- **Depressive symptoms**: Participants whose depressive symptoms improved but did not meet the randomization criteria were allocated to a single-blind placebo in conjunction with the antidepressant therapy assigned during the antidepressant lead-in phase.

In the controlled trial of pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years (Study 1), 8% (18/218) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 0% (0/72) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (1% or more and twice the rate of placebo) included ECG voltage criteria for ventricular hypertrophy, tic, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, insomnia, decreased appetite, and rash, with 2 instances for each adverse reaction, i.e. 2/218 (1%). Less frequently reported adverse reactions (less than 1% or less than twice the rate of placebo) included upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, weight loss, dizziness, somnolence, logorrhea, chest pain, anger, and hypertension.

In the controlled trial of pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years (Study 4), 3% (7/233) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 1% (1/77) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (1% or more and twice the rate of placebo) were decreased appetite (2/233; 1%) and insomnia (2/233; 1%). Less frequently reported adverse reactions (less than 1% or less than twice the rate of placebo) included irritability, dermatillomania, mood swings, and dyspnea.

In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), 6% (21/358) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (1/62) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (1% or more and twice the rate of placebo) included insomnia (8/358; 2%), tachycardia, and additional adverse reactions which were incompletely listed.

### Vyvanse [^116RXYMU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to the active metabolite of Vyvanse (dextroamphetamine). In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Concomitant use of Vyvanse with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Discontinue treatment with Vyvanse and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Vyvanse with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, consider the risks and monitor the patient closely.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111cwaCi]. Addiction (2025). High credibility.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using variable block randomization stratified by treatment site. A computer-generated randomization schedule was developed by an independent statistician and uploaded to the study database. Randomization was performed by site pharmacists, while all other study staff were blinded to treatment allocation and urine drug screen results.

Study visits occurred daily for the first five days, then twice weekly for the remainder of the study. At each visit, in-person supervised medication was administered, and in-person urine samples were taken. Vital signs and adverse events were recorded, unused medication was returned and reconciled, and medication adherence counseling was conducted. Self-reported methamphetamine use was recorded weekly. One urine sample per week was randomly selected for analysis by immunoassay for amphetamine-type substances (cut-off 300 ng/ml), followed by confirmation of drug type (methamphetamine, amphetamine, or other) by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (cut-off 150 ng/ml).
- **Long research visits**: Conducted at baseline (Week 1), Weeks 5, 9, and 13, and at follow-up 4 weeks after medication ended (Week 19).
- **Additional safety measures**: Administered at these visits included screening for psychosis (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scaling psychosis and hostility items), suicidality (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale), and cardiac adverse events (electrocardiogram).
- **Reimbursements**: Participants received a supermarket voucher at screening and Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 19.

All procedures aimed to gather comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the treatment.

### Vyvanse [^116XY3Pt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Animal data:

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 40 and 120 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 5.5 and 33 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 70 mg/day given to adults, on a mg/m² body surface area basis.

A study was conducted with amphetamine (d- to l- enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams. A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses. A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg/kg, which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks, such as preputial separation and vaginal opening. Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg/kg on day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks post-weaning. When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation, gestational weight gain, number of implantations, and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg/kg.

A number of studies from the literature in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine (d- or d, l-) at doses similar to those used clinically can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^1125Vpg3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

As the published LDX studies of augmentation therapy for MDD used flexible-dose designs, analyses of dose-response relationships for efficacy, safety, or tolerability were not performed. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy dose-response relationship of LDX when used as augmentation therapy for MDD in individuals who exhibited inadequate MADRS total score responses to an eight-week course of antidepressant monotherapy.

- **Secondary objectives**: The evaluation of LDX dose-response relationships on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse. Also, the assessment of the safety and tolerability of LDX based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), responses to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.

### Signifor [^116vrVMv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia and QT prolongation**: Bradycardia has been reported with the use of Signifor. Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as a history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.
- **QT prolongation**: Signifor is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with Signifor, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. Signifor should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those:

	- With congenital long QT prolongation.
	- With uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or clinically significant bradycardia.
	- On anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation.
	- With hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.

A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with Signifor, and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to Signifor administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^1114XFwv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The null hypothesis was that the mean LDX response at each dose was the same as the placebo response. Dose-response curves were tested using appropriate contrast t-statistics. If at least one candidate dose-response relationship reached a two-sided significance value of 0.10, proof of an LDX dose-response would be considered established. Dose-response models included sex and antidepressant type as explanatory categorical variables; augmentation baseline MADRS total score or vital signs were included as explanatory continuous variables for their respective analyses.

Sample size was determined based on estimates of a 40% screening failure rate, 25% withdrawal from the antidepressant lead-in phase, 50% attrition due to participants not meeting randomization criteria, and 20% withdrawal of randomized participants during double-blind augmentation. Therefore, an estimated 1,890 screened individuals were expected to yield 1,134 enrolled participants, of which 425 (85 per treatment arm) would be randomized and 340 (68 per treatment arm) would complete the study. Assuming a mean ± standard deviation (SD) maximum effect of 3.0 ± 8.1 for MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline for each candidate dose-response curve, 68 participants per treatment arm would provide 80% power. Similarly, assuming mean ± SD peak responses of 7 ± 10 mm Hg, 5 ± 10 mm Hg, and 10 ± 10 bpm for SBP, DBP, and pulse, respectively, the power for identifying dose-response relationships was approximately > 95% for SBP and pulse and 62% for DBP. Due to a lower than anticipated dropout rate, the number of participants…

### Clinical characteristics and treatment response to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate versus placebo in adults with binge eating disorder: Analysis by gender and age [^116jSMQP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to describe clinical characteristics and treatment effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), based on gender and age, in adults diagnosed with moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED).
- **Methods**: Adults diagnosed with BED, defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, of moderate to severe severity were randomized to 12 weeks of dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg) or placebo in two studies. The studies were conducted from November 26, 2012, to September 25, 2013 (study 1), and from November 26, 2012, to September 20, 2013 (study 2). These post hoc analyses pooled data by gender (men vs. women) and age (< 40 vs. ≥ 40 years) across studies. Reported P values are nominal (descriptive and unadjusted).
- **Results**: The pooled safety and full analysis sets included 745 and 724 participants, respectively (men, n = 105 and n = 97; women, n = 640 and n = 627; < 40 years, n = 398 and n = 386; ≥ 40 years, n = 347 and n = 338). Across subgroups, most participants had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² (63.0%–75.5%). The mean baseline number of binge eating days per week was comparable across gender (4.6–4.7) and age (4.6–4.9), as was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total score (gender, 20.42–21.70; age, 21.40–21.63). Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences nominally favored LDX in all subgroups (all P < .001) for changes from baseline in binge eating days per week at weeks 11–12 and in Y-BOCS-BE total score at week 12. No interactions by gender or age were reported. Consistent with the overall profile of LDX, these results indicate its potential efficacy in treating BED in varied subpopulations.

### Maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Randomized withdrawal design [^112JpdRx]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- **Method**: Adults aged 18–55 years who had ADHD meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria, baseline ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) with adult prompts total scores of < 22, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) ratings of 1, 2, or 3 were enrolled. Participants who had previously received commercially available lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) for ≥ 6 months with acceptable tolerability and maintained response during a 3-week open-label phase at a stable dose, then entered a 6-week double-blind randomized withdrawal phase on treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (same dose) or placebo. Data were collected from April 2009 to July 2010. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants experiencing symptom relapse (≥ 50% increase in ADHD-RS-IV score and ≥ 2 rating-point increase in CGI-S score).

- **Results**: A total of 116 participants were randomized (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate n = 56; placebo n = 60). At the randomized withdrawal phase baseline, mean (SD) ADHD-RS-IV scores for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo were 10.6 (4.96) and 10.6 (4.82), respectively. At endpoint, 8.9% (5/56) of adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 75.0% (45/60) taking placebo (P < .0001) showed symptom relapse. Most showed relapse after 1 and 2 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase (4 and 0 adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 26 and 10 taking placebo, respectively).

### Vyvanse [^113PXM9e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Psychiatric adverse reactions**:

	- **Exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis**: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

	- **Induction of a manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder**: CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode. Prior to initiating Vyvanse treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g. comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).

	- **New psychotic or manic symptoms**: CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Vyvanse.
- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.

	- In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of Vyvanse in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the Vyvanse groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Closely monitor growth in weight and height during treatment.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^111wNGET]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved for use in adults with moderate to severe binge‐eating disorder (BED) in the United States (Vyvanse®, 2015). In two large, identically designed, 12-week, dose-optimized, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg/day) produced statistically superior and clinically meaningful reductions in binge eating days per week at weeks 11–12 (primary efficacy endpoint) versus placebo.

- **Secondary efficacy endpoints**: Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed for LDX versus placebo at Week 12/early termination (ET) for Clinical Global Impressions — Improvement (CGI‐I) and 4‐week binge eating cessation. Additionally, improvements at Week 12 were noted for the Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y‐BOCS‐BE) and percentage change in body weight.

In a Phase 2, fixed-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, LDX (50 and 70 mg but not 30 mg) was also superior to placebo in decreasing binge eating days per week in adults with BED at Week 11. In these short‐term studies, the safety and tolerability of LDX were generally similar to its established profile for LDX treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Vyvanse®, 2015).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^117A5zp5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Mean ECG changes from the augmentation baseline were generally small, except for the RR interval, which decreased more with LDX (10 mg: −27.2 ± 97.80 ms; 30 mg: −56.6 ± 92.22 ms; 50 mg: −65.1 ± 92.76 ms; 70 mg: −56.6 ± 130.13 ms) than with placebo (−6.7 ± 117.88 ms). No participants in any treatment group experienced a shift from a normal ECG at the augmentation baseline to a clinically significant ECG at week 16/ET. The mean changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/ET for clinical laboratory parameters were generally small in magnitude, similar between placebo and LDX, and not considered clinically meaningful.

During double-blind augmentation, at least one positive suicidal ideation occurred in 11 (14.1%) participants in the placebo group and 30 (9.6%) participants across LDX groups (10 mg: seven (9.1%); 30 mg: six (7.9%); 50 mg: eight (10.3%); 70 mg: nine (11.3%)). No suicidal attempts were reported with placebo during double-blind augmentation; however, one (0.3%) suicide attempt was reported in a participant from the 70 mg LDX treatment group.

### Vyvanse [^113R1yyv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine. Based on limited case reports in published literature, amphetamine (d- or d, l-) is present in human milk at relative infant doses of 2% to 13.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, with a milk/plasma ratio ranging from 1.9 to 7.5. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from amphetamine exposure are unknown. It is possible that large dosages of dextroamphetamine might interfere with milk production, especially in women whose lactation is not well established. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, including serious cardiovascular reactions, increased blood pressure and heart rate, suppression of growth, and peripheral vasculopathy, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Vyvanse.

- **Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**: Safety and effectiveness of Vyvanse have been established in pediatric patients with ADHD aged 6 to 17 years. Safety and effectiveness of Vyvanse have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years. Safety and efficacy of Vyvanse were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in pediatric patients aged 4 to 5 years with ADHD, followed by a 1-year open-label extension study. In these studies, patients experienced elevated rates of adverse reactions, including weight loss.

The boxed warning regarding the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) highlights the risk of drug abuse, misuse, and stimulant use disorder. Extreme caution should be exercised in all patients. It is essential to assess the risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction before prescribing lisdexamfetamine. Furthermore, reassess the risk throughout treatment and frequently monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the human abuse liability of solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [^115jVovq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Although all the active treatment conditions were associated with some elevation of blood pressure (BP), both systolic and diastolic values were highest with phentermine (see Figure 4). Over the first 6 hours, the largest mean (SE) change from baseline in systolic BP occurred 1.5 hours after dosing with phentermine 90 mg, resulting in an increase of 26.6 (2.2) mmHg. In contrast, changes in systolic BP were smaller with solriamfetol, with minimal changes at 300 mg and a peak change of 8.9 (2.0) mmHg occurring 1 hour after dosing with solriamfetol 1200 mg. For diastolic BP, the largest mean (SE) change from baseline was with phentermine 90 mg at 1.5 hours, an increase of 13.9 (0.9) mmHg. There were minimal changes with solriamfetol 300 mg and a peak change of 4.2 (1.1) mmHg at 1.5 hours with solriamfetol 1200 mg, as illustrated. BP values returned to baseline by 24 hours after dosing with solriamfetol 300 mg, and by 48 hours for all other active doses.

Heart rate (HR) increased from baseline with placebo and phentermine, with the greatest mean (SE) increases 12 hours after dosing: placebo 8.2 (1.2), phentermine 45 mg 13.1 (1.4), and phentermine 90 mg 13.8 (1.7) beats per minute. Solriamfetol was associated with a dose-dependent increase in HR, peaking at 12 hours after dosing; mean (SE) changes from baseline were 13.2 (1.5), 14.3 (1.5), and 20.2 (2.3) beats per minute at doses of 300, 600, and 1200 mg, respectively. Although HR was still elevated at 24 hours with the high doses of phentermine, all measurements eventually returned to or approached baseline levels.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^116b3SYf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). High credibility.

At the end of the antidepressant lead-in phase (week 8; augmentation baseline), participants were randomized to augmentation with LDX or placebo if they met all of the following randomization criteria: (a) MADRS total score ⩾18 at augmentation baseline, (b) an improvement (reduction) in MADRS total score of less than 50% from week 0 (lead-in baseline) to augmentation baseline, and (c) no changes since lead-in baseline in physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, ECG, or vital signs that would preclude LDX treatment. Participants whose depressive symptoms improved but who did not meet the randomization criteria were allocated to the nonrandomized study arm and continued to receive single-blind placebo in conjunction with their assigned antidepressant therapy on a modified visit schedule (i.e. weeks 10, 12, and 16). Participants not demonstrating improved depressive symptoms (defined as no change or a worsening of MADRS total score from the lead-in baseline) were discontinued from the study.

During the double-blind treatment phase, participants meeting all of the randomization criteria were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to eight weeks of augmentation therapy with LDX (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or LDX-matching placebo (0 mg); all participants maintained their assigned antidepressant therapy. The LDX doses selected for use in this study were chosen based on two previously published phase 2 studies. Those studies reported that dose-optimized LDX (over ranges of 20–50 mg and 20–70 mg, respectively) significantly improved depressive symptoms when used as an augmentation strategy.

### A feasibility study evaluating lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for the treatment of adults with bulimia nervosa [^111UBF58]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

This study examined the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) as a treatment for adults with bulimia nervosa (BN).
- **Method**: An open-label 8-week feasibility study was conducted in participants with BN. Enrollment rate, dropout rate, safety outcomes, and eating disorder symptom change were examined.
- **Results**: Eighteen of 23 participants completed the study per protocol. There was no participant-initiated dropout due to adverse drug reactions, and no severe and unexpected adverse drug reactions. An average increase in heart rate of 12.1 beats/min was observed. There was a mean weight reduction of 2.1 kg, and one participant was withdrawn for clinically significant weight loss. In the intent-to-treat sample, there were reductions in objective binge episodes and compensatory behaviors from baseline to post/end-of-treatment (mean difference = -29.83, 95% confidence interval: -43.38 to -16.27; and mean difference = -33.78, 95% confidence interval: -48.74 to -18.82, respectively).
- **Discussion**: Results of this study indicate that a randomized controlled trial would be feasible with close monitoring of certain safety parameters, especially over a longer time period, as long-term safety is unknown. However, the results should not be used as evidence for clinicians to prescribe LDX to individuals with BN before its efficacy and safety are properly tested.

Trial Registration Number: NCT03397446.

### Efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^117SVgFU]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) efficacy and safety versus placebo in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Adolescents aged 13 through 17 with at least moderately symptomatic ADHD (ADHD Rating Scale IV: Clinician Version [ADHD-RS-IV] score ≥ 28) were randomized to receive either placebo or LDX (30, 50, or 70 mg/day) in a 4-week, forced-dose titration, double-blind study. The primary and secondary efficacy measures were the ADHD-RS-IV, Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I), and Youth QOL-Research Version (YQOL-R). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, laboratory findings, physical examinations, and ECG.

Overall, 314 participants were randomized; 309 were included in efficacy analyses, and 49 withdrew (11 due to TEAEs). The least squares mean (SE) change from baseline at endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were -18.3 (1.25), -21.1 (1.28), and -20.7 (1.25) for 30, 50, and 70 mg/day LDX, respectively, while for placebo, it was -12.8 (1.25) (p ≤ .0056 versus placebo for each). Differences in ADHD-RS-IV total scores favored all LDX doses versus placebo at all weeks (p ≤ .0076). On the CGI-I, 69.1% of participants were rated very much/much improved at endpoint with LDX all doses versus placebo (39.5%) (p < .0001). YQOL-R changes at endpoint scores for LDX groups versus placebo were not significant. Commonly reported LDX (all doses combined) TEAEs (≥ 5%) were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, decreased weight, and irritability. Small mean increases in pulse and blood pressure were observed, with no clinically meaningful trends.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^115vnqFJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). High credibility.

Safety and tolerability examinations included the assessment of AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory and ECG results, and C-SSRS responses. The collection of AEs occurred at screening, every study visit during the antidepressant lead-in and double-blind phases, and at follow-up. All AEs were categorized based on severity and relatedness to the study drug, as per the opinion of investigators. TEAEs were defined as AEs that started or deteriorated on or after the date of the first randomized dose and no later than three days after the last dose of the study drug. Additionally, AEs defined a priori as being of special interest to this study included psychiatric events of aggression and violent behavior, psychosis/mania, suicidal ideation and behavior, and certain weight-related clinical laboratory or vital sign AEs.

Vital sign measures, including sitting SBP, DBP, and pulse, were assessed in triplicate (at least 2 minutes between each assessment) at every study visit using automated machines. During the double-blind augmentation phase, blood pressure and pulse were collected at two time points (more than 1 hour apart) at augmentation baseline, weeks 10 and 12, and week 16/ET in randomized participants only. The average of each set of three measurements was used to determine continued study participation. The 12-lead ECGs were assessed in triplicate at screening, augmentation baseline, and week 16/ET. If more than 30 days elapsed between screening and lead-in baseline, an ECG assessment was performed at lead-in baseline. Nonfasting clinical laboratory evaluations were also conducted.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^112b6trH]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although medications other than LDX have been investigated for potential use as BED pharmacotherapy in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, LDX is the only medication currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe BED (Vyvanse®, 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first publication describing the time course analyses of treatment effects by week for the efficacy of a pharmacotherapy in individuals with BED. Based on available data from short-term studies for other potential BED therapies, numerically greater reductions in binge eating frequency and body weight for active treatment versus placebo are generally observed within 1–4 weeks of starting treatment. In one study that reported statistical analysis of treatment effects prior to the end of the study, significantly greater reductions in binge eating days/week and weight for sibutramine versus placebo were reported at treatment Weeks 2 and 4, respectively.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116kKTN7]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

The Drug Effects Questionnaire elicited higher drug-liking scores in the lisdexamfetamine group [32 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), interquartile range (IQR) 9.5–62.5 mm] compared to placebo (30 mm, IQR 0–50.8 mm; OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.31–10.87; P = 0.028). Responses to questions about similarity with methamphetamine also preferred lisdexamfetamine (15 mm, IQR 6.15–51.5 versus 0 mm, IQR 0–36.5 mm; OR 9.30, 95% CI 2.75–31.50; P < 0.001). The price participants would pay for the medication was higher (AU$20, IQR AU$0–AU$25) compared to the placebo group (AU$0, IQR AU$0–AU$10, OR 15.62, 95% CI 1.89–129.08; P = 0.011).

There were no significant between-group differences in other drug use, as assessed by self-report or urine drug screens.

Analysis of study blind revealed a statistically significant greater proportion of correct treatment allocation guesses among retained participants (143 placebo group, 155 lisdexamfetamine group). In the lisdexamfetamine group, 80% (n = 122) of guesses were correct, compared to 62% (n = 88) in the placebo group (P < 0.001).

There were eight serious adverse events reported; five occurred in the lisdexamfetamine group and three in the placebo group. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate. Nausea occurred more frequently in the lisdexamfetamine group than in the placebo group (16% versus 5%; P = 0.03). A post-hoc analysis of cardiovascular data showed no strong evidence of between-group differences in mean heart rate or systolic blood pressure at any time point during the study.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^115bqyeH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Significant dose-response relationships were observed for LDX on SBP, DBP, and pulse, with greater increases generally being observed at higher LDX doses. These findings of increased SBP, DBP, and pulse and decreased weight are consistent with previously published LDX augmentation studies for MDD and with studies of LDX in adults diagnosed with ADHD or binge eating disorder. These findings also align with the cardiovascular effects of stimulants in general. When considered in light of the cardiovascular safety concerns associated with stimulant use, these findings support the importance of regular cardiovascular monitoring when using stimulants in adults.

The overall TEAE profile of LDX in the study is consistent with previously published studies of LDX augmentation for MDD. As in these previous studies, the most frequently reported TEAEs with LDX included insomnia, dry mouth, headache, decreased appetite, and nasopharyngitis. There were no clinically important mean changes in clinical laboratory parameters or ECG reported in previously published studies.

### Vyvanse [^116JBXuF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Absorption - **Capsule formulation**: Following single-dose oral administration of Vyvanse capsule (30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg) in patients aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD under fasted conditions, Tmax of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 3.5 hours post-dose, respectively. Weight/dose normalized AUC and Cmax values were the same in pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years as in adults following single doses of 30 mg to 70 mg Vyvanse capsule.
- **Effect of food on capsule formulation**: Neither food (a high-fat meal or yogurt) nor orange juice affects the observed AUC and Cmax of dextroamphetamine in healthy adults after single-dose oral administration of 70 mg of Vyvanse capsules. Food prolongs Tmax by approximately 1 hour (from 3.8 hours in the fasted state to 4.7 hours following a high-fat meal or 4.2 hours with yogurt). After an 8-hour fast, the AUC for dextroamphetamine following oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in solution and as intact capsules were equivalent.
- **Chewable tablet formulation**: After a single-dose administration of 60 mg Vyvanse chewable tablet in healthy subjects under fasted conditions, Tmax of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 4.4 hours post-dose, respectively. Compared to 60 mg Vyvanse capsule, exposure (Cmax and AUC) to lisdexamfetamine was about 15% lower. The exposure (Cmax and AUCinf) of dextroamphetamine is similar between Vyvanse chewable tablet and Vyvanse capsule.
- **Effect of food on tablet formulation**: Administration of 60 mg Vyvanse chewable tablet with food (a high-

Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 5% or more among lisdexamfetamine-treated patients with ADHD in clinical trials include decreased appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, diarrhea, nausea, and anxiety. These reactions occurred at a rate at least twice that of placebo. Additionally, in the adult population, erectile dysfunction was observed in 2.6% of males on lisdexamfetamine and 0% on placebo; decreased libido was observed in 1.4% of subjects on lisdexamfetamine and 0% on placebo.

In a controlled adult trial of lisdexamfetamine, mean weight loss after four weeks of therapy was recorded as 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine, respectively, compared to a mean weight gain of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo.
- **Adverse reactions with other amphetamine products in pediatric patients and adults with ADHD**:
	- **Cardiac disorders**: Palpitations, tachycardia, and chest pain.
	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, nausea, and tooth disorders (e.g. teeth clenching, tooth infection).

Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated pediatric patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients ages 7 to 13 years (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.
- **Controlled trial in pediatric patients**: In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d-to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 pounds and -2.8 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
- **Weight loss in adults with ADHD**: In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), mean weight loss after 4 weeks of therapy was 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds, for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of Vyvanse, respectively, compared to a mean weight gain of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo.

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects: cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop. CNS effects include psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur. Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Overdose Management

Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. The pharmacokinetic profile of Vyvanse should be considered when treating patients with overdose. Lisdexamfetamine and d-amphetamine are not dialyzable. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^114yhwTb]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

- **1-week binge eating response**: The 1-week binge eating response distributions differed between LDX and placebo in both studies from Week 1 through Week 12 (all χ² statistics ≥ 16.66 based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests, degrees of freedom = 1, all nominal p values < .001, all Cramer's Vs ≥ .28) and at Week 12/ET (both χ² statistics ≥ 43.82 based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests, degrees of freedom = 1, both nominal p values < .001, both Cramer's Vs ≥ .40). The percentages of participants exhibiting binge eating episode reductions of 100% and 99% to 75% in the last 7 days were numerically greater with LDX than placebo from Week 1 to Week 12 in both studies.

		Figure 3 provides a visual representation: 1-week binge eating responses (reductions in binge-eating episodes/week) over time, full analysis set. Percentages of participants exhibiting reductions in binge eating episodes/week over the prior 7 days (A: Study 1; B: Study 2). a Nominal p < .001 for distribution of binge eating responses. Abbreviations: ET = early termination; LDX = lisdexamfetamine.
- **Body weight**: Mean ± SD body weight decreased with LDX but not placebo over the course of both studies (Figure 4 A, B), resulting in larger mean ± SD percentage decreases in body weight from baseline with LDX than placebo (Figure 4 C, D). In both studies, the LS mean (95% CI) treatment differences for the percentage body weight change from baseline favored LDX over placebo from Week 1 through Week 10 (all nominal p values < .001, all ES ≥ .56) and at Week 12 (both p values < .001).

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^112YdCAD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30, 50, and 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine dimesylate compared to placebo in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
- **Method**: Following a 7- to 28-day washout period, 420 adults aged 18 to 55 years with moderate to severe ADHD (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were treated with 30, 50, or 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine or placebo for four weeks (N = 119, 117, 122, and 62, respectively). The 50- and 70-mg/day groups underwent forced-dose titration. The primary efficacy measure was the clinician-determined ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) total score. The study was conducted from May 2006 to November 2006.
- **Results**: Treatment groups were well matched at baseline, including in ADHD-RS scores. At endpoint, changes in ADHD-RS scores were significantly greater for each lisdexamfetamine dose than for placebo (placebo = -8.2, 30 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -16.2, 50 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -17.4, 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -18.6; all p < .0001 vs. placebo), with no differences between doses. Significant differences relative to placebo were observed in each lisdexamfetamine group, beginning at week 1 and continuing each week throughout. The percentage of subjects who improved (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale rating ≤ 2) was significantly greater for each lisdexamfetamine dose than for placebo at each week and at endpoint (placebo = 29%, 30 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 57%, 50 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 62%, 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 61%; all p < .01). Adverse events were generally mild and included dry mouth and decrease.

### Vyvanse [^1143UD34]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Vyvanse® is indicated for the treatment of two primary conditions:

- **Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**: Suitable for use in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
- **Moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED)**: Indicated for treatment in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Limitations of use for Vyvanse include the following considerations:

- **Pediatric implications**: Pediatric patients with ADHD who are younger than 6 years of age have experienced more long-term weight loss than patients aged 6 years and older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
- **Not intended for weight loss**: Vyvanse is not indicated for weight loss purposes. The use of other sympathomimetic drugs for weight loss has been linked to serious cardiovascular adverse events. The safety and effectiveness of Vyvanse for treating obesity have not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

It is important to note these limitations to ensure appropriate and safe use of Vyvanse in various populations.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^111gBTGd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical methods and sample size

Dose-response relationships for the primary efficacy endpoint, which is the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from augmentation baseline to week 16/ET, and for vital signs (systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse) were assessed using the multiple comparisons procedure with modeling (MCP-Mod) approach. The MCP-Mod technique starts with a set of pre-specified candidate dose-response curves and uses a multiple-comparisons technique to test whether any of these curves fit the data significantly better than does a flat line, which is indicative of no dose response. If at least one of the pre-specified candidate models is significant, this indicates a dose response. Significant curves are then used to develop inferences on adequate treatment doses and for estimating the minimum effective dose. This method has been adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency as an efficient statistical methodology for the analysis of phase 2 dose-finding studies under dose-response uncertainty.

The pre-specified dose-response curves tested for the MADRS total score change (Emax, logistic, linear, and betaMod) are depicted in Figure 2, and the dose-response curves tested for vital signs were Emax, exponential, linear, logistic 1, and logistic 2. Placebo was considered 0 mg LDX.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115Ck9CU]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

There were five serious adverse events in the lisdexamfetamine group. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; nausea was more frequent in the lisdexamfetamine group. Post‐hoc analysis detected transient mild (< 4 mmHg) increases in diastolic blood pressure at two time points. Future investigation of lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily requires continued cautious cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric monitoring, given the risks of adverse outcomes associated with methamphetamine use and the known adverse event profile of prescribed psychostimulants.

The proportion of urinalyses positive for methamphetamine is the most commonly reported outcome measure in RCTs of psychostimulants for amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder. We selected a primary outcome of difference in days of use. Self-report is a sufficiently valid measure, and the combination of urine toxicology and self-report enhances the validity of self-reported substance use. The study design precluded verification of self-reported use days by weekly urinalysis results due to differences in the periodicity in the two data sources. Reduced frequency of use is a valid outcome measure associated with improved drug use, health, and wellbeing. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on clinically meaningful reduction in use. There is, however, growing recognition of participant-reported outcome measures as alternative end-points. We found positive findings regarding self-reported treatment effectiveness and drug effect. This aspect of the treatment might be important for treatment uptake and underscores an imperative for stronger evaluation.

### Edluar [^112B514c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage in adults**: Use the lowest effective dose for the patient. The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7–8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 5 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 10 mg. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The total dose of Edluar should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because zolpidem clearance is lower in women.

- **Special populations**: Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of zolpidem tartrate. Patients with hepatic insufficiency do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects. The recommended dose of Edluar in both of these patient populations is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1); Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- **Use with CNS depressants**: Dosage adjustment may be necessary when Edluar is combined with other CNS-depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Administration**: The effect of Edluar may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately following a meal. Edluar sublingual tablet should be placed under the tongue, where it will disintegrate. The tablet should not be swallowed.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^115FUiHs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated dose-response relationships of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate when used as augmentation for major depressive disorder in individuals exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.
- **Methods**: Eligible adults (18–65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparisons procedures with modeling.
- **Results**: For Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p > 0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were -1.4 (-3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (-2.5, 2.7), -0.7 (-3.4, 2.0), and -0.9 (-3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant [text cut off].

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^1134XKHo]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

This study examined the time course of efficacy-related endpoints for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) versus placebo in adults with protocol-defined moderate to severe binge-eating disorder (BED).

In two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, adults meeting DSM-IV-TR BED criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg). Analyses across visits used mixed-effects models for repeated measures (binge eating days/week, binge eating episodes/week, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating [Y-BOCS-BE] scores, percentage body weight change) and chi-square tests (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement [CGI-I; from the perspective of BED symptoms] scale dichotomized as improved or not improved). These analyses were not part of the prespecified testing strategy, so reported p-values are nominal (unadjusted and descriptive only).

Least squares mean treatment differences for change from baseline in both studies favored LDX over placebo (all nominal p-values < 0.001) starting at Week 1 for binge eating days/week, binge-eating episodes/week, and percentage weight change and at the first posttreatment assessment (Week 4) for Y-BOCS-BE total and domain scores. On the CGI-I, more participants on LDX than placebo were categorized as improved starting at Week 1 in both studies (both nominal p-values < 0.001). Across these efficacy-related endpoints, the superiority of LDX over placebo was maintained at each posttreatment assessment in both studies (all nominal p-values < 0.001).

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, forced-dose titration, dose-finding study (identifier: NCT01435759) was conducted at 76 sites across five countries (USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the UK) between 31 May 2011 and 17 January 2014. The study included a screening and washout phase (1–4 weeks), an eight-week single-blind antidepressant lead-in phase, an eight-week double-blind treatment phase (three weeks of forced-dose titration followed by five weeks of dose maintenance), and a one-week follow-up phase.
- **Study timeline**: The study timeline and dose adjustment schedule were laid out for both randomized and nonrandomized participants.

During the lead-in antidepressant phase, designed to prospectively identify inadequate responders, investigators assigned unblinded antidepressant therapy (escitalopram (ESC) or venlafaxine extended-release (VXR)) along with single-blind LDX-matching placebo to participants. Antidepressant treatment, based on investigator assessment of clinical factors (including prior antidepressant use, response, and tolerability), was initiated at the lowest dose allowed on the morning following the lead-in baseline visit if the participant was not already receiving the assigned antidepressant. If the participant was already taking one of the two background antidepressants (ESC or VXR) at study entry, the treatment regimen was maintained. Treatment assignment was monitored to ensure an adequate representation of each type of antidepressant in the overall study population.

### Vyvanse [^112VXyai]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Controlled substance**: Vyvanse contains lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, classified as a Schedule II controlled substance.
- **Abuse**: Vyvanse has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. It can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

	- Abuse is defined as the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse refers to the intentional use of a drug for therapeutic purposes in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or by individuals for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction comprises a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena, including a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g. continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, prioritizing drug use over other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

	- Misuse and abuse of lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Vyvanse, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)].

### Vyvanse [^112Jm6Vr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design analog classroom study (Study 2) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years (N = 52) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, either the combined type or the hyperactive-impulsive type. Following a 3-week open-label dose optimization with Adderall XR®, patients were randomly assigned to continue their optimized dose of Adderall XR (10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg), Vyvanse (30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg), or placebo once daily in the morning for 1 week each treatment. Efficacy assessments were conducted at 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-dose using the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M. Flynn, and Pelham Deportment scores (SKAMP-DS), a 4-item subscale of the SKAMP with scores ranging from 0 to 24 points that measures deportment problems leading to classroom disruptions. A significant difference in patient behavior, based on the average of investigator ratings on the SKAMP-DS across the 8 assessments, was observed between patients when they received Vyvanse compared to when they received placebo. The drug effect reached statistical significance from hours 2 to 12 post-dose but was not significant at 1 hour.

A second double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design analog classroom study (Study 3) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years (N = 129) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, either the combined type or the hyperactive-impulsive type. Following a 4-week open-label dose optimization with Vyvanse (30 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg), patients were randomly assigned to continue appropriate follow-up treatments.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^116ZJYHv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

In this phase 2 dose-ranging study, LDX augmentation of ESC or VXR was not statistically superior to placebo augmentation in adults with MDD who exhibited an inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy, and no dose-response relationship for efficacy was identified. In contrast, changes in SBP, DBP, and pulse from augmentation baseline to week 16/ET exhibited significant dose-response relationships across the dose range studied. All vital sign endpoints tended to increase as LDX dose increased, with a linear relationship providing the best fit.

The lack of efficacy in the study is consistent with the published literature describing the effects of stimulant augmentation for MDD in general and with the phase 3 studies of LDX augmentation for MDD. Although individual studies provided some support for the efficacy of stimulant augmentation versus placebo for some aspects of depressive symptomatology, the weight of evidence based on meta-analyses suggests there is limited evidence for additional clinical benefit with stimulant augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy. Although these results are not consistent with previously reported findings of the phase 2 clinical trials of LDX augmentation in adults with MDD, it is important to note that these studies differed in important ways. This phase 2 study and the published phase 3 studies required that participants have MADRS total scores ⩾18 at augmentation baseline and MADRS total score reductions < 50% from the antidepressant lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline.
