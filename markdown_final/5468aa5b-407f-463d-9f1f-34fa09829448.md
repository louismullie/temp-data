Albumin

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physiology, indications, dosing, and safety of intravenous albumin, with attention to evolving evidence and guideline positions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology and pharmacokinetics that underpin albumin's oncotic and pleiotropic effects. Then, I should verify which indications have the strongest evidence versus those that remain controversial. Next, I will examine dosing by indication and safety monitoring, and finally I will integrate current guideline recommendations and practical takeaways for clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental physiology. Albumin accounts for roughly three-quarters of plasma colloid oncotic pressure, which supports intravascular volume, and it also functions as a carrier protein and an antioxidant via Cys-34, while contributing to endothelial stabilization and microvascular integrity, though these nononcotic properties are complex and variably preserved in commercial preparations and disease states [^117R5jU3] [^112cZptN]. Wait, let me verify intravascular retention claims: hyperoncotic 20–25% solutions are often described as expanding plasma volume by approximately 3.5 times the infused volume within 15 minutes, but this is highly context dependent and less reliable in critically ill patients with increased capillary leak and glycocalyx disruption, so I should avoid overstating this ratio in real-world resuscitation [^117R5jU3] [^112PpVTE].

> I need to check pharmacokinetics and distribution. Albumin has a circulating half-life around 15–20 days in health, but inflammation shortens effective half-life and increases transcapillary escape, so endogenous synthesis can be increased yet serum levels still fall in critical illness. This explains why correcting hypoalbuminemia alone may not normalize physiology or outcomes [^112cZptN] [^117JAzJ2]. Hold on, I should verify intravascular fraction: about 40% of total body albumin is intravascular and more than 60% extravascular, which limits the durability of plasma expansion and supports a more targeted, indication-specific approach rather than routine supplementation [^112cZptN].

> Next, I should review indications with the strongest evidence. In cirrhosis, albumin is indicated to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction and renal injury, as adjunct therapy in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and as part of vasoconstrictor-based treatment for hepatorenal syndrome; these uses improve hemodynamics and, in some analyses, survival, though dose, frequency, and long-term strategies remain debated [^116XSSHS] [^113UPeAa]. Wait, I initially thought "universal" mortality benefit in SBP was firmly established, but I should correct that: the classic Sort study showed reduced renal impairment and improved short-term survival with albumin plus antibiotics, yet subsequent data underscore that benefits are context- and dose-dependent and that volume overload risks must be managed carefully [^113UPeAa] [^116XSSHS].

> Now, I will examine sepsis and septic shock, where the signal is mixed. Large meta-analyses and ALBIOS show no overall mortality benefit from albumin versus crystalloids, but subgroup signals suggest potential benefit in septic shock and in patients with more pronounced hypoalbuminemia. Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests considering albumin when substantial crystalloids have been given, though this remains a weak recommendation and is complicated by evolving fluid comparators and timing questions [^115orzyi] [^114PgoVQ] [^112EVfzn] [^111yuQiB]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the recent ABC-sepsis feasibility trial suggested feasibility but no signal favoring 5% albumin over balanced crystalloid, reinforcing that definitive benefit remains unproven in early sepsis resuscitation [^113aXtbk].

> I should double-check general critical care indications. Routine first-line resuscitation with albumin is not recommended in critically ill adults, and targeting serum albumin thresholds for supplementation lacks supportive outcome data; however, selected contexts such as large-volume paracentesis in cirrhosis, adjunctive therapy in ARDS with diuretics, and certain postoperative or burn settings may warrant consideration when crystalloids are insufficient or edema management is paramount [^112rFaKH] [^115VYHyv]. Let me verify the ARDS signal: studies suggest improved oxygenation and fluid balance with albumin plus diuretics in hypoalbuminemic ARDS, but patient-centered outcome benefits remain uncertain, so this should be individualized and protocolized if used [^113UPeAa].

> Burns deserve separate attention. Initially, I almost said albumin should be used early in major burns, but wait, that would contradict current practice; I should correct that: major burn resuscitation begins with crystalloids, and albumin is typically added after the initial 12–24 hours to mitigate fluid creep and reduce total fluid burden, with guideline support acknowledging limited mortality data and emphasizing urine output–guided titration and careful monitoring for compartment syndromes [^115Zg6Xs]. Hold on, I should verify dosing nuance: the ABA supports adding albumin in large burns after crystalloid start, and while meta-analyses have not shown mortality benefit, volume-sparing effects and safety within structured protocols are generally accepted [^115Zg6Xs].

> For dosing by indication, I will now examine concrete regimens. For large-volume paracentesis, 8 g of albumin per liter of ascites removed is standard, often using 25% solution to minimize sodium load. For SBP, 1.5 g/kg at diagnosis and 1 g/kg on day 3 is a commonly used regimen derived from randomized data. For hepatorenal syndrome, albumin supports vasoconstrictor therapy, typically 40 g initially with repeat dosing, individualized to hemodynamics. For septic shock as a rescue adjunct, 20% albumin 100–300 mL boluses can be used with reassessment, aiming for hemodynamic targets rather than a fixed albumin level [^115EsVvN] [^113UPeAa] [^116M95MT]. Wait, I should confirm safety ceilings: the FDA label advises not exceeding 2 g/kg/day of 25% albumin, which provides a practical upper bound for daily dosing in adults while still emphasizing clinical response over numeric targets [^113o1Cst].

> I need to ensure I address hypoalbuminemia management outside cirrhosis. Low albumin is predominantly an illness severity and inflammation marker, not a nutrition marker, so repeatedly checking albumin to guide nutrition or to "treat the number" is discouraged; albumin infusion has not consistently reduced fluid requirements, infections, or mortality in the ICU, and strategies should prioritize treating the underlying inflammatory process rather than routine albumin replacement [^112pWRHm] [^113ZeEqt] [^1158KX7a]. But wait, what if the patient is profoundly hypoalbuminemic and edematous? Even then, targeted albumin with diuretics may aid fluid mobilization in select scenarios, but sustained benefit depends on reversing the cause of capillary leak and ongoing albumin loss [^113UPeAa].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Albumin is generally safe in contemporary practice, with rare serious adverse events. However, risks include volume overload, dilutional anemia, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, and potential coagulation effects in large doses, so infusions should be titrated to clinical endpoints such as blood pressure, urine output, and oxygenation rather than serum albumin concentration alone [^113NRBMo] [^115VYHyv]. I should confirm monitoring priorities: in septic shock, reassess hemodynamics frequently; in cirrhosis, watch for pulmonary edema and abdominal compartment pressures; in ARDS, pair albumin with diuretics and track oxygenation and fluid balance; and across settings, avoid using albumin as a substitute for treating the underlying disease process [^113UPeAa] [^112oWTSw].

> Let me consider current guideline positions to synthesize practice. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines advises against routine albumin use for first-line volume replacement or to raise serum albumin in critically ill adults, reflecting limited and inconsistent outcome benefit; in contrast, Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests considering albumin in septic shock when substantial crystalloids have been administered, largely based on subgroup signals and physiologic rationale rather than definitive mortality benefit, underscoring the need for shared decision-making and cost-conscious use [^112rFaKH] [^111yuQiB]. Hold on, I should verify that both positions emphasize crystalloids first and recognize the high cost and limited supply of albumin as additional constraints to indiscriminate use [^112rFaKH] [^111yuQiB].

> Finally, I will integrate a practical approach. Use albumin when there is a clear, evidence-supported indication such as post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, SBP, HRS, selected ARDS with diuretics, and burns after the initial crystalloid phase. Use it as a rescue adjunct in septic shock after crystalloids when shock persists and as part of a protocolized hemodynamic strategy. Avoid using albumin solely to "correct the number", and always pair administration with treatment of the underlying cause of hypoalbuminemia and careful monitoring for fluid responsiveness and overload [^113UPeAa] [^116XSSHS] [^112rFaKH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check one more thing: albumin quality and functional heterogeneity may influence clinical effects, particularly in cirrhosis and oxidative stress states, which reinforces the principle of right patient, right dose, right timing rather than routine supplementation [^111AHoxM] [^116XSSHS].

Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein [^111AHoxM], synthesized exclusively by the liver, with a half-life of ~19 days and a central role in maintaining **colloid oncotic pressure** [^117R5jU3] and transporting hormones, fatty acids, and drugs [^111maLtF]. Hypoalbuminemia is common in critical illness [^112uCmJ6] and strongly predicts worse outcomes, but albumin infusion **does not consistently improve survival** outside specific indications [^111qMbfm]. The main evidence-based uses are for cirrhosis complications (post-paracentesis support, SBP, HRS) [^115SRTKk] [^116XSSHS], septic shock as an adjunct to crystalloids [^111yuQiB], and burns after initial crystalloid resuscitation [^115Zg6Xs]; routine use for hypoalbuminemia or nutrition is not supported [^112rFaKH]. Albumin is generally safe but costly [^113NRBMo] and can cause **fluid overload**; dosing should be individualized to clinical goals and monitored closely [^115VYHyv] [^113o1Cst].

---

## Physiological functions

Albumin's key roles include:

- **Colloid oncotic pressure**: Maintains intravascular volume by retaining fluid within vessels [^117R5jU3] [^112cZptN].
- **Transport and binding**: Carries hormones, fatty acids, bilirubin, metals, and drugs; alters drug pharmacokinetics and interactions [^111WsJzK] [^111nYpac].
- **Antioxidant properties**: Cys-34 scavenges free radicals and reactive oxygen species [^111AHoxM] [^111WsJzK].
- **Endothelial integrity**: Stabilizes the glycocalyx and reduces capillary leak [^117G4PQW] [^116Yv2PL].

---

## Clinical indications

Evidence supports albumin use in specific scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Cirrhosis | - Post-large-volume paracentesis <br/> - SBP <br/> - HRS | Strong (Grade A) [^115SRTKk] [^116XSSHS] |
| Sepsis/septic shock | Adjunct to crystalloids in severe sepsis | Moderate (Grade B) [^111yuQiB] [^1134kKqK] |
| Burns | After initial crystalloid resuscitation | Moderate (Grade B) [^115Zg6Xs] |
| ARDS | With diuretics to improve oxygenation | Low (Grade C) [^112oWTSw] |
| Hypoalbuminemia | Not routinely recommended | Strong against (Grade D) [^112rFaKH] [^1158KX7a] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and controversies

- **Mortality**: No consistent survival benefit in general critical illness [^114eoTJn]; possible benefit in septic shock subgroups [^111yuQiB].
- **Morbidity**: May reduce complications in hypoalbuminemic patients [^1118Hgim], but evidence is limited [^111Nt5EN].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: High cost [^115VYHyv] and limited availability restrict routine use [^115BGSxs].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Albumin is generally safe, but adverse effects include:

- **Fluid overload**: Particularly in heart failure or renal impairment [^notfound].
- **Allergic reactions**: Rare anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity [^113NRBMo].
- **Coagulation effects**: Rare dilutional coagulopathy [^113NRBMo].
- **Infection risk**: Theoretical risk of viral transmission, though rare with modern screening [^1159xHzh].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **SSC 2021**: Use albumin in addition to crystalloids for sepsis/septic shock when large crystalloid volumes are needed [^111yuQiB].
- **ICTMG 2024**: Do not use albumin for first-line volume replacement or to raise serum albumin in critically ill adults [^112rFaKH].
- **ASPEN**: Serum albumin is an inflammation marker, not a nutrition marker; do not use to guide nutrition [^112pWRHm].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

- **Personalized therapy**: Targeting "effective albumin" concentration and function in cirrhosis [^1158Jp9i].
- **Long-term therapy**: Ongoing trials of scheduled albumin in decompensated cirrhosis [^1172CSMh].
- **Formulation optimization**: Developing albumin variants with enhanced antioxidant or binding properties [^112EVfzn].

---

Albumin is a multifunctional protein with defined roles in specific clinical scenarios, particularly cirrhosis complications and sepsis, but routine use for hypoalbuminemia or nutrition is not supported. Careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize risks [^112rFaKH].

## References

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^1178u2H9]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Visceral proteins as markers of nutrition status — serum albumin and prealbumin continue to be incorrectly cited as nutrition markers; because of the strong associations between inflammation and malnutrition, visceral proteins correlate well with patient risk for adverse outcomes while not specifically reflecting a patient's current nutrition state, and inflammatory markers are useful for determining nutrition risk by identifying those patients likely to be at an increased risk of poor outcomes if adequate nutrition is not delivered. Malnutrition may be characterized by the type of inflammation present: acute illness/injury or chronic illness, and relatively few patients in developed countries have starvation-associated malnutrition. Another common misconception is that serum albumin and prealbumin are markers of protein and muscle mass in body composition; in healthy patients these levels do not decline until BMI is < 12 after ≥ 6 weeks of starvation, with the same reported in elderly patients, and serum albumin and prealbumin levels are known to correlate poorly with nutrition intake. Pediatric data show similar overall findings, and although the visceral proteins retain correlations with inflammation, there is poor correlation with muscle mass or overall malnutrition assessments.

### Albumin in critical care: SAFE, but worth its salt? [^1165JqZG]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.

### Scalable production of tissue-like vascularized liver organoids from human PSCs [^113YUekm]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The liver is the largest endocrine organ in the body and is critical for maintaining homeostasis, serving as the primary site of xenobiotic metabolism, production of coagulation factors, and removal of ammonia as well as a multitude of other essential functions. For liver failure, no other curative treatment approach besides liver transplantation (LTX) exists. Additionally, the gold standard for the evaluation of hepatic metabolism and drug toxicity, among other things, is primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). However, PHHs are extremely limited in supply and rapidly lose function in vitro. This issue indicates the need to identify potential surrogates to fill this void, providing a stable, scalable and genetically defined alternative.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-organize into organotypic structures called organoids. However, organoid models do not fully recapitulate the cellular diversity and architectural features of the organ in question. Along with this limitation, current approaches are labor intensive, highly dependent on expensive growth factors and not amenable to scaling. A lack of organotypic in vitro models has led us to develop an approach that utilizes a suspension culture system, leveraging off the ability of hPSCs to self-aggregate upon seeding as single cells. We have overcome the requirement to pattern hPSCs in a 2D format to definitive endodermby directly patterning in 3D pluripotent aggregates in suspension in an extracellular matrix (ECM)- and growth factor-independent manner. Additionally, this approach is scalable to generate mini-liver organoids that contain vasculature while recapitulating the complexity of cell types associated with the liver. The resulting organoids also replicate functional features of the liver, including cytochrome p450 activity, which is long lived, and other phase 1 metabolizing enzymes, such as carboxyl esterases, which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, as well as the ability to synthesize urea. We demonstrate that the organoids have a scavenger function via uptake of labeled substrates. We also demonstrate the utility of this platform to allow modeling of biological processes and potentially disease. An area of particular interest is the coagulation machinery. The organoids produce and secrete a myriad of functional liver-specific proteins, including albumin and serpins (alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) and antithrombin (AT), among others). Additionally, coagulation factors have post-translational modifications (PTMs) and are produced at levels comparable to those in primary hepatocytes. We demonstrate that the coagulation machinery is functional with respect to Factor VII and will provide an important model to study coagulation, characterize coagulation factor deficiencies, and set the basis for the development of cell-based therapy.

### Serum albumin and kidney function decline in HIV-infected women [^1178LJik]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Serum albumin concentrations are a strong predictor of mortality and cardiovascular disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. We studied the longitudinal associations between serum albumin levels and kidney function decline in a population of HIV-infected women.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting & Participants

Study participants were recruited from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a large observational study designed to understand risk factors for the progression of HIV infection in women living in urban communities. 908 participants had baseline assessment of kidney function and 2 follow-up measurements over an average of 8 years.

Predictor

The primary predictor was serum albumin concentration.

Outcomes

We examined annual change in kidney function. Secondary outcomes included rapid kidney function decline and incident reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Measurements

Kidney function decline was determined by cystatin C-based (eGFR(cys)) and creatinine-based eGFR (eGFR(cr)) at baseline and follow-up. Each model was adjusted for kidney disease and HIV-related risk factors using linear and relative risk regression.

Results

After multivariate adjustment, each 0.5-g/dL decrement in baseline serum albumin concentration was associated with a 0.56-mL/min faster annual decline in eGFR(cys) (P < 0.001), which was attenuated only slightly to 0.55 mL/min/1.73 m² after adjustment for albuminuria. Results were similar whether using eGFR(cys) or eGFR(cr). In adjusted analyses, each 0.5-g/dL lower baseline serum albumin level was associated with a 1.71-fold greater risk of rapid kidney function decline (P < 0.001) and a 1.72-fold greater risk of incident reduced eGFR (P < 0.001).

Limitations

The cohort is composed of only female participants from urban communities within the United States.

Conclusions

Lower serum albumin levels were associated strongly with kidney function decline and incident reduced eGFRs in HIV-infected women independent of HIV disease status, body mass index, and albuminuria.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112rFaKH]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

Intravenous albumin is a human-derived blood product manufactured from donated human plasma. It is used broadly in hospitalized patients, as well as in outpatients with complications of cirrhosis. Intravenous albumin has been studied in numerous, large, well-designed, randomized controlled clinical trials in multiple patient populations; the data show few applications of albumin that improve patient outcomes. Albumin is more expensive to manufacture and to provide to patients, when compared with crystalloids. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines undertook this guideline development process to provide clinicians with actionable recommendations for appropriate use of intravenous albumin.

1. In critically ill adult patients (excluding patients with thermal injuries and ARDS), intravenous albumin is not suggested for first-line volume replacement or to increase serum albumin levels (Conditional Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

2. In critically ill adult patients with thermal injuries or ARDS, intravenous albumin is not suggested for volume replacement or to increase serum albumin level (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

3. In critically ill adult patients, intravenous albumin in conjunction with diuretics is not suggested for removal of extravascular fluid (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

4. In pediatric patients with infection and hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not recommended to reduce mortality (Strong Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

5. In preterm neonates (≤ 36 weeks) with low serum albumin levels and respiratory distress, intravenous albumin is not suggested to improve respiratory function (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

6. In preterm neonates (≤ 32 weeks or ≤ 1,500 g) with or without hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not suggested for volume replacement (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

### Human serum albumin in the clinical syndrome of heart failure [^1123xnwu]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in patients with heart failure, and this condition becomes more prevalent with increasing age and illness. Hypoalbuminemia is thought to result mainly from malnutrition, inflammation and cachexia. Other causal factors include hemodilution, liver dysfunction, protein-losing enteropathy, increased transcapillary escape rate, and nephrotic syndrome. According to Starling's law, low plasma oncotic pressure related to hypoalbuminemia induces a fluid shift from the intravascular to the interstitial space, and there is now clinical evidence that hypoalbuminemia facilitates the onset of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Hypoalbuminemia has emerged as an independent predictor of incident heart failure in end-stage renal disease and elderly patients. Recent data also suggest that hypoalbuminemia provides prognostic information incremental to the usual clinical and biochemical variables in patients with heart failure regardless of clinical presentation. The presence of hypoalbuminemia in patients with heart failure may have potential therapeutic consequence in clinical practice. If present, subclinical excess of fluid must be removed. A dietary survey should also be performed, and renutrition may be indicated. It is unknown whether targeted nutritional intervention and albumin administration confer benefits to hypoalbuminemic patients with heart failure, and further research is warranted in this setting.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^115Sczq6]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Materials and methods

We used the Cochrane Collaborationmethodology to undertake, and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)statement methodology to report, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials. The relative effect of pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation, with or without improvement of hypoalbuminaemia, of adults in critical or intensive care with sepsis of any severity, with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia, was investigated in comparison with control crystalloid or colloid fluid. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at final follow-up, with predefined subgroup analyses of studies at high risk of bias compared with low or unclear risk of bias. The study was not registered.

Eligibility criteria

All of the following criteria were met for inclusion of a study:

1. Prospective randomised clinical trial reporting on adults in a critical or intensive care unit setting that have not been retracted
2. Trial or subgroup of patients diagnosed before or at randomisation with sepsis of any severity (including sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock), with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia, receiving intravenous fluid as part of volume expansion and resuscitation, with or without improvement of hypoalbuminaemia
3. At least one exposure group that received intravenous human albumin solution of any concentration or type in any carrier solution after randomisation
4. At least one control group that received any intravenous fluid (crystalloid or colloid) of any strength or type in any carrier solution after randomisation
5. Availability of all-cause mortality outcome data in the patients and comparison groups identified with criteria 1 to 4.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^114Y5srU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Albumin

Albumin is the only natural colloid used for intravascular volume replacement in humans. In the past, administration of albumin was thought to increase mortality. However, in 2013, a repeat Cochrane meta-analysis found no evidence of such adverse effect. The multicentre Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study performed in 2004 was probably the decisive factor in this reappraisal. In the SAFE study, no difference was found between hypovolaemic patients treated with albumin (n = 3497) or saline (n = 3500) in mortality, length of ICU or hospital stay, or organ dysfunction. The main criticisms of the SAFE study are that the presence of hypovolemia was not determined based on predetermined criteria and that the dose of fluid to be administered was not preset.

Three meta-analyses have studied whether human albumin affects mortality when administered for intravascular volume expansion to critically ill patients with sepsis. These are discussed in greater detail in the section on sepsis (see below). Taken together, it is safe to state there is no good-quality evidence regarding the value of resuscitation of critically ill patients using albumin.

Summary statements:
It remains unclear whether albumin confers either benefit or risk in terms of mortality and renal function.
Given the cost of human albumin, it should generally not be considered the first choice for fluid replacement unless there is a specific indication for its use.

### Long-term albumin treatment in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [^116XaDP1]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although proposed for the first time several decades ago, the possibility that long-term human albumin could be effective for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and ascites has become a topic of scientific and clinical discussion in the last decade. Long-term albumin administration represents a completely different treatment perspective compared to acute or short-term uses of albumin. Results from the ANSWER and the MACHT studies indicate that long-term albumin treatment can be effective, safe and able to modify the course of the disease provided that albumin is given at a sufficient dose and for a sufficient time to restore physiological levels and functions of the circulating molecule, which are compromised, at least partially, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Further clinical studies and randomised trials are warranted to confirm the clinical benefits of long-term albumin therapy. Important areas for further research include determining the precise target population, the biomarkers of response, the optimal dose and frequency of albumin infusions, the stopping rules, and the cost-effectiveness of treatment in different healthcare systems across the world, particularly in those where the logistical issues and costs related to the periodic intravenous infusions may represent an important limitation to the implementation of this innovative approach in clinical practice. In this review, we will critically analyse the available data on long-term albumin treatment, focusing on the differences that exist between studies, the controversial issues and the future perspectives.

### Morbidity in hospitalized patients receiving human albumin: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^1118Hgim]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of albumin administration on morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients.

Data Source

Computer searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library; hand searches of journals and Index Medicus; inquiries with investigators and fluid product suppliers; and examination of reference lists. No language or time period restrictions were adopted.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing the administration of albumin with that of crystalloid, no albumin, or lower-dose albumin.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data. The primary endpoint for the meta-analysis was morbidity, defined as the incidence of complications, including death. Trial quality was evaluated by blinding, allocation concealment, presence of morbidity as a study endpoint, and individual patient crossover.

Data Synthesis

Seventy-one trials were included in the categories of surgery or trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, high-risk neonates, ascites, and other indications. The 3,782 randomized patients in the included trials experienced a total of 3,287 complications, including 515 deaths and 2,772 cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, infectious, renal, respiratory, and other complications. Albumin significantly reduced overall morbidity, with a risk ratio of 0.92 (confidence interval [CI] 0.86–0.98). Control group albumin dose significantly affected the incidence of complications (p = .002). In 32 trials with no albumin administered to the control group, the risk ratio was 0.77 (CI, 0.67–0.88) compared with 0.89 (CI, 0.80–1.00) in 20 trials with control patients receiving low-dose albumin and 1.07 (CI, 0.96–1.20) in 19 trials with moderate-dose control group albumin.

Conclusions

Albumin reduces morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients. Concomitant administration of albumin in the control group can obscure the effects of albumin on clinical outcome in randomized trials.

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^113BQYWJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Use of human albumin solutions has been investigated in different phases of restrictive fluid resuscitation. Albumin administration improves fluid removal during kidney replacement therapy. Hyperoncotic human albumin solution facilitates restrictive fluid therapy and the effectiveness of de-resuscitative measures.

### A word of caution regarding proposed benefits of albumin from ALBIOS: a dose of healthy skepticism [^116Jq9k9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The recently published Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, controlled trial of 1,818 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients were randomized to receive either albumin 20% daily to maintain a serum albumin level ≥ 3 g/dl or no albumin replacement. No differences were detected in overall 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, or a number of other secondary outcomes. However, three potential benefits of albumin were proposed that deserve further scrutiny.

### Determination of effective albumin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: clinical and prognostic implications [^111AHoxM]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human albumin is the most abundant protein in the vascular compartment, representing more than half of total plasma protein content. It accounts for ~70%‐80% of total plasma oncotic pressure, thus resulting as the main modulator of fluid distribution among the body compartments. Albumin also exerts many other biological properties unrelated to its oncotic power: It binds, transports, and detoxifies many endo‐ and exogenous molecules, is the major circulating antioxidant, modulates immune and inflammatory responses, and contributes to endothelial stabilization and vascular integrity.

Whereas albumin oncotic power derives from highly conserved features across persons, such as its high molecular weight and negative net charge, the nononcotic properties are strictly related to its peculiar molecular structure, which presents a high degree of microheterogeneity and is affected by physio‐ and pathological processes.

Hypoalbuminemia has long been considered a cardinal feature of decompensated cirrhosis resulting from several events, such as reduced synthesis by hepatocytes, shorter total half‐life attributable to increased catabolism, and dilution attributable to total plasma volume expansion. Low serum albumin concentration, measured by routine laboratory methods, has been consistently shown to be a good prognostic indicator of both mortality and morbidities in decompensated cirrhosis.

In decompensated cirrhosis, besides quantitative changes, circulating albumin undergoes an extensive damage of its molecular structure because of underlying systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Reversible and irreversible oxidation of the cysteine‐34 (Cys‐34) residue, the main antioxidant site of the molecule, as well as nonoxidative alterations, including truncation of the C‐ and N‐ terminal portion of the molecule or glycation, are increased in advanced cirrhosis and correlate with disease severity and patient outcomes. Because of the accumulation of these molecular alterations, the proportion of the molecule with a fully preserved structure, the "native" albumin isoform, declines in parallel with the progression of cirrhosis. Consequently, albumin functions (i.e. binding and detoxification capacity, antioxidant function, and ability to chelate metal ions) decline in parallel with increasing severity of disease.

2.1 Dosage

General Recommendations

The concentration of the albumin preparation, dosage and the infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient's individual requirements.

The dose required depends on the body weight of the patient, the severity of trauma or illness and on continuing fluid and protein losses. Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required.

The daily dose should not exceed 2 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% per kg of body weight.

Hypovolemia

In adults, an intravenous infusion of 25 g should be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects, an intravenous infusion of 2.5 to 12.5 g or 0.5 to 1 g/kg body weight may be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

Hemodilution may follow administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25%. If hemorrhage has occurred, this may result in relative anemia. This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood.

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114EEu27]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### Albumin administration improves organ function in critically ill hypoalbuminemic patients: a prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study [^113wfyzw]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that administration of albumin to correct hypoalbuminemia might have beneficial effects on organ function in a mixed population of critically ill patients.

Design

Prospective, controlled, randomized study.

Setting

Thirty-one-bed, mixed medicosurgical department of intensive care.

Patients

All adult patients with a serum albumin concentration ≤ 30 g/L were assessed for eligibility. Principal exclusion criteria were expected length of stay < 72 hrs, life expectancy < 3 months or a do-not-resuscitate order, albumin administration in the preceding 24 hrs, or evidence of fluid overload.

Interventions

The 100 patients were randomized to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin solution on the first day, then 200 mL/day provided their serum albumin concentration was < 31 g/dL (albumin group), or to receive no albumin (control group).

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the effect of albumin administration on organ function as assessed by a delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score from day 1 to day 7 (or the day of intensive care discharge or death, whichever came first). The two groups of 50 patients were comparable at baseline for age, gender, albumin concentration, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Albumin concentration did not change over time in the control group but increased consistently in the albumin group (p < .001). Organ function improved more in the albumin than in the control group (p = .026), mainly due to a difference in respiratory, cardiovascular, and central nervous system components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Diuretic use was identical in both groups, but mean fluid gain was almost three times higher in the control group (1679 ± 1156 vs. 658 ± 1101 mL, p = .04). Median daily calorie intake was higher in the albumin than in the control group (1122 [935–1158] vs. 760 [571–1077] kcal, p = .05).

Conclusions

Albumin administration may improve organ function in hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients. It results in a less positive fluid balance and a better tolerance to enteral feeding.

### Is albumin administration in the acutely ill associated with increased mortality? Results of the SOAP study [^116AJhQz]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Albumin may indeed be safe when used as a resuscitation fluid (as shown by the SAFE study), but our results suggest that it may not be safe all of the time in all critically ill patients. We believe further studies, such as the present, are needed to generate hypotheses and encourage further research to fully clarify the role of albumin in our ICUs.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^112pWRHm]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position on visceral proteins — executive summary states that serum albumin and prealbumin are not components of currently accepted definitions of malnutrition, and that serum albumin and prealbumin do not serve as valid proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers. It adds that the serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin decline in the presence of inflammation, regardless of underlying nutrition status, and that serum albumin and prealbumin declines must be recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in the context of nutrition assessment rather than with malnutrition per se, with nutrition risk broadly defined as the risk of developing malnutrition and/or poor clinical outcomes if nutrition support is not provided. It further notes that the role of serum albumin and prealbumin in monitoring delivery and efficacy of nutrition support remains undefined and that their normalization may indicate the resolution of inflammation, the reduction of nutrition risk, a transition to anabolism, or potentially lower calorie and protein requirements.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^115Zg6Xs]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — scientific background highlights that following thermal injury involving greater than 20% of the TBSA, intravascular volume depletion and edema threaten perfusion, and recognition of "fluid creep" over 2 decades ago underscored that provision of excessive resuscitation fluid leads to increased morbidity and mortality in major burn patients. Both historically and currently, urinary output (UOP) has been the primary guide to the titration of resuscitation fluids, though alternative approaches using malperfusion markers, hemodynamic endpoints, or algorithm-based and computer supported decisions have been considered. Virtually all resuscitation formulae specify that colloids should be started at some point during resuscitation; albumin data suggest that early addition of albumin reduces total resuscitation volumes, while two study level meta-analyses of the 4 RCTs found no effect of albumin on mortality and reports note no effect of albumin on compartment syndrome development, renal function, or respiratory complications. For adjuncts, in humans the infusion 66 mg/kg/hour of ascorbic acid has been examined with mixed findings regarding reduction in resuscitation fluid volumes, and concerns have been raised about a possible association with oxalate nephropathy and development of AKI.

### Albumin and fibrinogen kinetics in sepsis: a prospective observational study [^117JAzJ2]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The measurement of the plasma transport protein albumin has been traditionally used to monitor protein and energy deficits in humans. Although plasma albumin concentration may not detect short-term changes in nutritional status, it serves as a consistent marker of chronic protein-calorie malnutrition. The half-life of albumin, the most abundant plasma protein in humans, is 17–19 days. Intravascular albumin reflects approximately 30–40% of the total body albumin, whereas the remainder resides in the extravascular pool, i.e. skin, muscle, gut, liver, and subcutaneous tissue. Albumin also plays important regulatory roles in the body's fluid distribution and acid–base physiology. Hypoalbuminemia can be caused by reduced synthesis, either because of impaired liver function and/or inadequate nutritional protein-energy supply. It also can be the result of enhanced spillover into the extravascular space or excretion via the kidney.

Fibrinogen is a so called positive acute phase protein, i.e. its blood levels rise in response to systemic inflammation, tissue injury, and various types of cancer. Elevated levels of fibrinogen have been suggested to be the cause of thrombosis and vascular injury, i.e. complications that are sometimes associated with these conditions.

The measurement of circulating substrate concentrations does not provide information about the underlying changes in substrate kinetics. It, therefore, remains unclear if, for example, a decrease in plasma albumin, as seen during critical illness, is a consequence of suppressed production or increased loss. In fact, according to the results of previous studies in patients suffering from inflammation, sepsis, head injury, or burns albumin synthesis rates have been shown to be increased.

As there are no comprehensive studies on albumin and fibrinogen kinetics in the critically ill, we measured synthesis rates of both proteins in septic patients and in a control group.

Recent randomized controlled trial results

Following the results of the SAFE study suggesting a benefit of albumin administration in patients with sepsis, several groups designed RCTs to further evaluate albumin use in this specific group of patients.

In the ALBIOS study, conducted in 100 ICUs in Italy, 1,818 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were randomized either to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin plus crystalloid or to receive crystalloid alone initially to achieve the target resuscitation goals of the early goal-directed therapy protocol used by Rivers and colleagues. Over the subsequent 28 days, albumin infusions were adjusted to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l; crystalloid solutions were given when considered clinically indicated by the attending physician. More patients in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group reached the target mean arterial pressure within 6 hours after randomization (86% versus 82.5%, P = 0.04), and during the first 7 days the mean arterial pressure was higher and the net fluid balance lower in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group, despite similar amounts of fluid being administered to the two groups. There were, however, no overall differences in 28-day mortality rates (32% albumin vs 32% crystalloid; relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.14; P = 0.94) or 90-day mortality rates (41% albumin vs 44% crystalloid; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P = 0.29) between the groups. Of the 1,818 patients, 579 (31.8%) were randomized within 6 hours and 1,239 (68.2%) more than 6 hours after meeting the clinical criteria for severe sepsis; there were no significant differences in outcomes according to the interval between meeting clinical criteria and randomization. In the subgroup of patients with septic shock at enrollment (n = 1,121), however, those who received albumin had significantly lower 90-day mortality rates than those who received saline (44% versus 50%; relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99; P = 0.03).

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^113Am6W5]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Visceral proteins and nutrition risk — The visceral proteins albumin and prealbumin must be correctly recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in nutrition assessment. The concepts of malnutrition and nutrition risk are distinct concepts that are often inappropriately interchanged in application. Serum albumin and prealbumin levels do not, however, serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and are not useful monitoring parameters to guide nutrition support therapy. To identify these as markers of malnutrition is an oversimplification that should be avoided.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^113ZeEqt]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Inflammation and visceral proteins — critical illness is characterized by severe acute inflammation, whereas chronic illness has a relatively lower but more prolonged or intermittent inflammatory state, and the acute-phase response in either condition changes serum protein concentrations via cytokines. Affected proteins are divided into 2 categories: positive acute-phase proteins that increase (including complement factors, proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis, and C-reactive protein [CRP]) and negative acute-phase proteins that decrease, including visceral proteins such as serum albumin, serum prealbumin (transthyretin), α2-macroglobulin, and transferrin. Early trauma and sepsis studies showed rises in positive acute-phase proteins and declines in negative acute-phase proteins. The decrease in visceral proteins has generally been attributed to hepatic reprioritization of protein synthesis, though CRP has pleiotropic proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles and evidence suggests the fractional albumin synthesis rate in the plasma may actually be increased during the acute-phase response. Additionally, albumin is the most abundant protein in human plasma.

### Is albumin administration in the acutely ill associated with increased mortality? Results of the SOAP study [^112aeXhm]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Albumin administration in the critically ill is controversial and hotly debated, despite having been accepted and widely used for more than 50 years. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane group published 5 years ago first put light to this fire, showing an increased mortality in patients treated with albumin in their analysis of 30 randomized controlled trials including 1,419 randomized patients. An accompanying editorial even suggested that, based on these results, "the administration of albumin should be halted". The Cochrane analysis was criticized by a later meta-analysis because it excluded, for various reasons, several trials that had shown reduced mortality rates with albumin administration. When more studies were included into the meta-analysis, an adverse effect of albumin on mortality could no longer be demonstrated. Both analyses, however, have the limitation that the inclusion criteria were very broad and the fluid regimen very different among the included trials. In a recent randomized controlled study (the Saline versus Albumin fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study) providing data on nearly 7,000 patients randomized to receive either albumin or normal saline as resuscitation fluid, there was no difference in outcome between the two groups.

While randomized controlled trials such as the SAFE study provide strong evidence for or against an intervention, epidemiological studies allowing for multivariable analyses can provide useful additional information on the current use of albumin and on associated outcomes. The Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely ill Patients (SOAP) study did exactly this to determine current intensive care unit (ICU) practice and the effects of that practice on outcomes for various topics, including administration of albumin.

### Renal handling of albumin: a critical review of basic concepts and perspective [^114WgVFF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Biochemical and physiological processes that underlie the mechanism of albuminuria are completely reassessed in this article in view of recent discoveries that filtered proteins undergo rapid degradation during renal passage and the resulting excreted peptide fragments are not detected by conventional urine protein assays. This means that filtered protein and/or albumin levels in urine have been seriously underestimated. The concept that albuminuria is a result of changes in glomerular permeability is questioned in light of these findings and also in terms of a critical examination of charge selectivity, shunts, or large-pore formation and hemodynamic effects. The glomerulus appears to function merely in terms of size selectivity alone, and for albumin, this does not change significantly in disease states. Intensive albumin processing by a living kidney occurs through cellular processes distal to the glomerular basement membrane. Failure of this cellular processing primarily leads to albuminuria. This review brings together recent data about urinary albumin clearance and current knowledge of receptors known to process albumin in both health and disease states. We conclude with a discussion of topical and controversial issues associated with the proposed new understanding of renal handling of albumin.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^114Nt2hB]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position paper — visceral proteins and nutrition assessment states that serum albumin and prealbumin characterize inflammation rather than describe nutrition status or protein-energy malnutrition, and that there is an association between inflammation and malnutrition, not between malnutrition and visceral-protein levels. These proteins correlate with patients' risk for adverse outcomes rather than with protein-energy malnutrition. Therefore, serum albumin and prealbumin should not serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.

### Hypoalbuminaemia and heart failure: a practical review of current evidence [^111jbf2V]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminaemia (serum albumin levels ≤ 3.5g/dl) is associated with poor outcomes among patients with heart failure (HF). This narrative review includes original articles and reviews published over the past 20years and retrieved from PubMed using the following search terms (or their combination): 'heart failure', 'hypoalbuminaemia', 'heart failure with reduced ejection fraction', 'heart failure with preserved ejection fraction', 'all-cause mortality', 'in-hospital mortality', 'hospitalization', 'prognosis'. The aims of this review are to provide an overview on the prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia in HF, its impact on clinical outcomes, and potential mechanisms that may suggest future therapeutic strategies. Hypoalbuminaemia is frequent in HF patients, especially among the elderly. However, data about the exact epidemiology of hypoalbuminaemia are scant due to different definitions, and prevalence is estimated between 5% and 70% across the whole spectrum of ejection fraction. Current evidence points to hypoalbuminaemia as a marker of poor outcomes in HF, irrespective of the ejection fraction, and in other cardiovascular diseases. Among patients who suffered from acute coronary syndrome, those with hypoalbuminaemia had an increased risk of new-onset HF and in-hospital mortality. Albumin, however, might also play a role in the natural history of such diseases due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic properties. Whether albumin supplementation or nutritional support in general would be beneficial in improving clinical outcomes in HF is not completely clear and should be evaluated in adequately designed studies.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1172CSMh]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany published perioperative fluid guidelines for children in 2017. They recommended that colloids, including albumin, be used during surgery where crystalloids alone are not sufficiently effective and blood products are not indicated. In 2021, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended the use of albumin in the fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock when patients required large volumes of crystalloids.

Five RCTs that will enroll an additional 4,864 patients are ongoing and are expected to provide additional clarity on the role of albumin (Table 2). These trials will add clarity to the ICTMG recommendations for intensive care patients with infection, high-risk adult cardiac surgery, patients with acute kidney injury receiving kidney replacement therapy, and outpatients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Table 2
Ongoing, Large Randomized Clinical Trials Comparing IV Albumin With Alternative Treatments

This guideline is limited by the uncertainty in the evidence identified in the literature search for many different patient populations and the limitation of the search to the English language. The lack of comparative dosing strategies leaves uncertainty on the choice between 4% to 5% and 20% to 25% albumin formulations, the dose for each indication, the risk of fluid overload, and the dosing schedules. The guidelines are limited to common uses of albumin and cannot address every possible patient scenario where albumin has been used in RCTs. The published studies often did not collect or did report adverse reactions from IV albumin, or both, limiting the conclusions regarding the potential risks of albumin. These guidelines improve on those previously published because of the rigorous methodology, broad scope of the recommendations, inclusion of a patient representative in the guideline process, and broad community consultation process. The guidelines will be supported by tools developed by the ICTMG Dissemination and Implementation Committee to assist hospitals with aligning practice with the evidence.

Future research is needed in multiple clinical settings including: (1) the role and timing of albumin in patients with sepsis or other conditions with insufficient response to crystalloids, (2) the role of albumin in patients undergoing surgery, (3) the role of albumin for intradialytic hypotension, and (4) the role of albumin in all indications for patients with cirrhosis. Research also is needed to understand therapeutic targets of albumin resuscitation (hemodynamic, urinary output, laboratory), the optimal formulation, and the dosing strategy. The risk of IV albumin infusions needs further investigation to allow clinicians to weigh the risk to benefit profile appropriately. Studies should include patient-important outcomes, rather than focusing on short-term physiologic outcomes.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^116kJiEp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Albumen is doubtless one of the most important of the animal proximate principles.

(Henry Ancell)

Albumin solutions have been used worldwide for the treatment of critically ill patients since they became commercially available in the 1940s. However, driven largely by the results of a widely publicized meta-analysis in 1998 that reported increased mortality rates in patients who received albumin solutions, the role of albumin administration in critically ill patients became highly controversial. It is well known that albumin has multiple physiological effects, including regulation of colloid osmotic pressure (COP), binding and transportation of various substances (for example, drugs, hormones) within the blood, antioxidant properties, nitric oxide modulation and buffer capabilities, which may be of particular relevance in critically ill patients. It is also well established that low serum albumin levels, a common occurrence in critically ill patients, are associated with worse outcomes. There would therefore seem to be a good rationale for use of albumin infusions in critically ill patients. However, albumin solutions also have limitations, including high costs relative to possible alternatives, notably crystalloids, and potential (rare) risks of transmission of microorganisms, anticoagulant, and allergic effects. Because there are no definitive randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating an outcome benefit of albumin in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients, routine administration of albumin for fluid resuscitation is not warranted in all patients, but there is evidence to support its use in some patient populations.

The purpose of this article is not to review in detail the multiple functions and roles of albumin or the many comparative studies and meta-analyses that have now been performed, although we will briefly summarize this information to provide some context. Rather, we wish to provide some clear suggestions and guidance for albumin use based on the current available evidence and highlight important areas for future research.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^117G4PQW]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antioxidant and binding abilities

In addition to regulating oncotic pressure, albumin has the ability of a "sponge" to bind to many endogenous and exogenous substances, including different radicals (reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl, etc.), thereby ameliorating the deleterious effect that these substances have on the organism. It must be mentioned that, in situations of high oxidative stress or in the presence of other toxins as present in decompensated cirrhosis, the quality of albumin is reduced because of posttranscriptional abnormalities of the molecule, such as cysteinylation or sulfinylation of the cystein-34 residue, truncations at the amino terminus or carboxy terminus, and glycosylation, which is compounded by low albumin levels due to liver dysfunction. –

Endothelial stabilization and coagulation

Albumin plays a role in endothelial stabilization, as well as in decreasing endothelial permeability probably by means of its interactions with interstitial matrix. In diseases with higher endothelial leakage, higher albumin levels are needed since albumin is uptaken by cells especially after the degradation or oxidation of albumin. The antioxidant properties of albumin protect endothelium and improve vascular integrity. In addition, hyperaggregation of platelets related to hypoalbuminemia may lead to procoagulant tendency, which has been shown to occur in kidney diseaseand can be extrapolated to cirrhosis. Finally, the interaction of albumin with nitric oxide and eicosanoids promotes vasodilation. – In cirrhosis, both vascular dysfunction and coagulation system play a pathogenic role, therefore low albumin levels aggravate the outcome in these patients as reflected in the Child-Pugh score.

Anti-inflammatory

Albumin influences several immunological pathways. In experimental studies, human albumin inhibits TNFα-mediated inflammation and monocyte adherence to endothelial cells. In patients with infections, albumin administration decreases circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Another study demonstrated that albumin could bind and neutralize proinflammatory lipids (prostaglandin E2), and could improve anti-infective B-cell function. Finally, albumin reprograms immune cells toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Systemic inflammation is the key pathogenetic step in the development of organ dysfunction and failure in decompensated cirrhosis. Low levels and quality of albumin in cirrhosis cannot counteract the gradual increase of systemic inflammation and cannot halt the vicious cycle of complications. Although not proven, exogenous albumin administration could theoretically restore the equilibrium of proinflammation and anti-inflammation in cirrhosis.

Recommended indications of albumin

In the following paragraphs, we describe the clinical settings in which there is evidence for or against the use of albumin in patients with cirrhosis and the resulting recommendations that are endorsed by national and international societies (Figure 2).

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^112EVfzn]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115VYHyv]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is administered in a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios including complications of cirrhosis, intradialytic hypotension, volume resuscitation, and priming of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Iso-oncotic albumin often is used to maintain intravascular volume in patients with hypovolemia, assuming that crystalloid resuscitation will be ineffective given its shorter intravascular half-life. Hyperoncotic albumin is used to correct low serum albumin levels or to mobilize extravascular fluid.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in acute and chronic illness. Hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia have been described as having greater morbidity compared with patients with preserved albumin levels, promoting the use of IV albumin. In the postoperative period, serum albumin levels decreases precipitously by 10 to 15 g/L; hypoalbuminemia is thought to be the result of suppressed synthesis by inflammatory cytokinesand transcapillary loss. In addition to its use in patients with hypoalbuminemia, edema, or both, albumin also is used for the prevention and treatment of hypovolemia, particular after administration of large volumes of IV crystalloid solutions.

Practice audits describing the use of albumin show highly variable practice among regions. Albumin is manufactured from large volumes of plasma and is expensive (approximately $130/25 g United States dollars; warehouse acquisition cost of albumin), with the acquisition cost likely a fraction of the total health care expenditure. Albumin also can be associated with adverse consequences, including fluid overload, hypotension, hemodilution requiring RBC transfusion, anaphylaxis, and peripheral gangrene from dilution of natural anticoagulants. Because potential benefits and risks are associated with its use, a multidisciplinary, international guideline panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of albumin in patient populations where it is prescribed commonly. These guidelines are designed to assist clinicians in their decisions on the use of albumin for its most common uses.

For resuscitation in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients

Although albumin solutions were first introduced in the 1940s, the first RCT of albumin administration was only published some 30 years later in 1975 (Table 1). This early RCT, conducted in just 16 patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, compared the effects of intraoperative use of albumin solution with those of a sodium-rich fluid during surgery and showed that albumin infusion led to less extracellular fluid expansion. Other relatively small studies followed, so that by the time the Cochrane meta-analysis was published in 1998 the average sample size of the 32 included studies was just 46 patients. Although the results of many studies take years to be published and to change clinical practice – if indeed they ever do – this Cochrane report influenced practice rapidly around the world, especially in the UK where use of albumin decreased by 40 to 45% in the 6 months after publication. An Expert Working Party of the Committee on Safety of Medicines in the UK highlighted the thoughts of many in the medical community that there was an urgent need to conduct large multicenter RCTs to determine whether albumin administration did indeed worsen outcomes. In 2004, the results of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) RCT in almost 7,000 critically ill patients were published, showing that a 4% albumin solution was as safe as normal saline when used as a resuscitation fluid.

Key points in the albumin story so far

For resuscitation in patients with sepsis

Subgroup analysis of the SAFE study suggested there may be a benefit in patients with severe sepsis (35% of whom had septic shock), with an adjusted odds ratio for death of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97; P = 0.03) for albumin compared with saline. A subsequent meta-analysis that included 17 RCTs comparing albumin solutions with other fluids for fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis reported that albumin use was associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.0; P = 0.047). Guidelines currently suggest (grade 2C) that albumin use should be considered as a resuscitation fluid in patients with severe sepsis, particularly if those patients are not responding to crystalloid infusion, based on data from the meta-analysis and preliminary data from a multicenter study in France that suggested a nonsignificant reduction in mortality in patients with septic shock who received albumin.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^114PgoVQ]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials, with trial sequential analysis, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses.

Data sources PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science (includes Medline, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Data Citation Index, Chinese Science Citation Database, CAB abstracts, Derwent Innovations Index), OvidSP (includes Embase, Ovid Medline, HMIC, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Transport Database), Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, controlled-trials.com, online material, relevant conference proceedings, hand searching of reference lists, and contact with authors as necessary.

Eligibility criteria Prospective randomised clinical trials of adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critical or intensive care who received pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of hypoalbuminaemia) compared with those who received control fluids (crystalloid or colloid), were included if all-cause mortality outcome data were available. No restriction of language, date, publication status, or primary study endpoint was applied.

Data extraction Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion, extracted data to assess risk of bias, trial methods, patients, interventions, comparisons, and outcome. The relative risk of all-cause mortality was calculated using a random effects model accounting for clinical heterogeneity.

Primary outcome measure All-cause mortality at final follow-up.

Results Eighteen articles reporting on 16 primary clinical trials that included 4190 adults in critical or intensive care with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. A median of 70.0 g daily of pooled human albumin was received over a median of 3 days by adults with a median age of 60.8 years as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation, with or without correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The relative risk of death was similar between albumin groups (that received a median of 175 g in total) and control fluid groups (relative risk 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.01; P = 0.11; I² = 0%). Trial sequential analysis corrected the 95% confidence interval for random error (0.85 to 1.02; D² = 0%). Eighty eight per cent of the required information size (meta-analysis sample size) of 4894 patients was achieved, and the cumulative effect size measure (z score) entered the futility area, supporting the notion of no relative benefit of albumin (GRADE quality of evidence was moderate). Evidence of no difference was also found when albumin was compared with crystalloid fluid (relative risk 0.93; 0.86 to 1.01; P = 0.07; I² = 0%) in 3878 patents (GRADE quality of evidence was high; 79.9% of required information size) or colloid fluids in 299 patients (relative risk 1.04; 0.79 to 1.38; P = 0.76; I² = 0%) (GRADE quality of evidence was very low; 5.8% of required information size). When studies at high risk of bias were excluded in a predefined subgroup analysis, the finding of no mortality benefit remained, and the cumulative z score was just outside the boundary of futility. Overall, the meta-analysis was robust to sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses.

Conclusions In this analysis, human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation for critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) were not robustly effective at reducing all-cause mortality. Albumin seems to be safe in this setting, as a signal towards harm was not detected, but this analysis does not support a recommendation for use.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^113NRBMo]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Is albumin cost-effective?

Albumin solutions have a good safety record. The large SAFE study reported that 4% albumin was as safe as normal saline in a heterogeneous group of ICU patients and meta-analyses have noted that albumin has a better safety profile than other colloid solutions. Reports of adverse events, including anticoagulant and allergic effects and transmission of microorganisms, are rare. In a study evaluating adverse event reporting between 1998 and 2000, the incidence of all reported serious nonfatal and fatal adverse events was just 5 per million doses, and no patient death was classified as probably related to albumin administration.

Albumin is, however, more costly than all other resuscitation fluids, although prices have decreased relative to other fluids over the last 10 years. Nevertheless, if shown to reduce morbidity and mortality even by a small amount, it is likely that the cost-effectiveness ratio would favor albumin because so many ICU interventions are very costly. There have been very few cost-effectiveness evaluations of albumin use in the ICU. Guidet and colleagues assessed the cost-effectiveness of albumin as given in the SAFE study on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock admitted to one of 35 French ICUs. Based on a presumed 4.6% reduction in mortality associated with albumin therapy (as shown in the SAFE study), 513 lives were saved among the 11,137 patients included, with an estimated life expectancy for each life saved of 9.8 years. The cost per life saved was estimated at €6,037 and the cost per life-year saved as €617. The authors therefore concluded that albumin administration was a cost-effective intervention in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Most recently, a cost-effectiveness analysis in severe sepsis and septic shock using an advanced Bayesian approach observed life-years gained with albumin relative to crystalloid therapy, and concluded that albumin may be the most cost-effective intravenous solution in this patient population.

### Albumin versus balanced crystalloid for the early resuscitation of sepsis: an open parallel-group randomized feasibility trial-the ABC-sepsis trial [^113aXtbk]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

International guidelines recommend IV crystalloid as the primary fluid for sepsis resuscitation, with 5% human albumin solution (HAS) as the second line. However, it is unclear which fluid has superior clinical effectiveness. We conducted a trial to assess the feasibility of delivering a randomized controlled trial comparing balanced crystalloid against 5% HAS as sole early resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis presenting to hospital.

Design

Multicenter, open, parallel-group randomized feasibility trial.

Setting

Emergency departments (EDs) in 15 U.K. National Health Service (NHS) hospitals.

Patients

Adult patients with sepsis and a National Early Warning Score 2 greater than or equal to five requiring IV fluids withing one hour of randomization.

Interventions

IV fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloid or 5% HAS for the first 6 hours following randomization.

Measurements and Main Results

Primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate and 30-day mortality. We successfully recruited 301 participants over 12 months. Mean (sd) age was 69 years (± 16 yr), and 151 (50%) were male. From 1303 participants screened; 502 participants were potentially eligible and 300 randomized to receive trial intervention with greater than 95% of participants receiving the intervention. The median number of participants per site was 19 (range, 1–63). Thirty-day mortality was 17.9% (n = 53). Thirty-one participants died (21.1%) within 30 days in the 5% HAS arm, compared with 22 participants (14.8%) in the crystalloid arm (adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CIs, 0.84–2.83).

Conclusions

Our results suggest it is feasible to recruit critically ill patients to a fluid resuscitation trial in U.K. EDs using 5% HAS as a primary resuscitation fluid. There was lower mortality in the balanced crystalloid arm. Given these findings, a definitive trial is likely to be deliverable, but the point estimates suggest such a trial would be unlikely to demonstrate a significant benefit from using 5% HAS as a primary resuscitation fluid in sepsis.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^116APA1a]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Albumin solutions have been used worldwide for the treatment of critically ill patients since they became commercially available in the 1940s. However, their use has become the subject of criticism and debate in more recent years. Importantly, all fluid solutions have potential benefits and drawbacks. Large multicenter randomized studies have provided valuable data regarding the safety of albumin solutions, and have begun to clarify which groups of patients are most likely to benefit from their use. However, many questions remain related to where exactly albumin fits within our fluid choices. Here, we briefly summarize some of the physiology and history of albumin use in intensive care before offering some evidence-based guidance for albumin use in critically ill patients.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^111yuQiB]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic analysis demonstrated that colloids are more efficient than crystalloids in reaching hemodynamic goals. However, colloids are significantly more expensive than crystalloids, and there are no large-scale studies convincingly demonstrating a beneficial effect of colloids on patient-centric outcomes. It may not be fair to generalize amongst colloids, where the type of colloid also impacts outcome. The most straightforward example is hydroxyethyl starches, which are associated with a higher degree of renal injury and possible risk of death, without any clear benefits and, are therefore, not recommended for use in sepsis.

There is a robust body of evidence evaluating the effects of albumin administration in critical illness in general and, more specifically, in sepsis and septic shock, either as a primary comparison or as a subset analysis of a larger trial. This has resulted in a suggestion from SSC to use albumin in addition to crystalloids for initial resuscitation and subsequent intravascular volume replacement in patients with sepsis and septic shock when patients require substantial amounts of crystalloids. This recommendation is largely based on 1) the ALBIOS trial which reported albumin may be associated with decreased mortality in the subgroup of patients with septic shock and hypoalbuminemia and 2) the SAFE trial which showed no benefit to albumin in overall survival in critical illness but a decreased mortality in the subgroup of patients with sepsis. Importantly, in the ALBIOS trial, albumin was administered in hypoalbuminemic septic patients in an attempt to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more. In addition, albumin was given as a daily dose (up to 300 mL of 20% albumin) for 7 days. In contrast, a recent single-center trial of 360 septic patients with cancer failed to show beneficial effects for the addition of albumin on 30-day mortality. Notably, studies comparing colloids with crystalloids used saline as a comparator. If buffered solutions are indeed superior to saline, the potential benefits of colloids reported in previous trials may have been related to disadvantages related to the saline comparator and should be investigated further, perhaps in the setting of a three-armed trial with a saline arm, a buffered solutions arm, and an albumin arm. Studies evaluating albumin primary test albumin as a maintenance fluid rather than a resuscitation fluid in the stages of initial resuscitation, primarily after crystalloids, have proved ineffective. There may be a role to evaluate albumin as a supplemental resuscitation fluid following initial resuscitation with crystalloids. Finally, there are no large-scale studies evaluating albumin as a resuscitation fluid, triggered by hemodynamic endpoints.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^116XSSHS]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the human body and is synthetized exclusively by the liver. Therefore, serum albumin levels are reduced in acute and/or chronic liver disease. In cirrhosis, low levels of albumin predict the outcome. In advanced cirrhosis, the quality of albumin is decreased due to high oxidative stress and a proinflammatory state. Therefore, the administration of i.v. albumin would seem to be of pathophysiological relevance and benefit. Yet, the questions that remain are who, when, how much, and how often. While albumin infusion is recommended after large-volume paracentesis, at diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, in acute kidney injury, and in hepatorenal syndrome, the amount and schedule of albumin to be administered require refinement, particularly given complications related to volume overload that have become increasingly apparent. Other indications for albumin such as infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hyponatremia, HE, prevention of poor outcomes in hospitalized, and in outpatients with cirrhosis are still debated. The results of studies in these settings are either negative, controversial, or inconclusive. This sheds some doubts regarding the use of albumin as a "one size fits all" strategy. The indication and patient selection are crucial and not always intuitive. The amount and frequency also seem to play a role in the success or failure of albumin. This review will critically discuss the evidence and underline areas where there are indications for albumin use and others where evidence is still insufficient and will have to await the development/results of randomized controlled trials.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^112uCmJ6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia (generally defined as a serum albumin concentration ≤ 30 g/l) is very common in critically ill patients, the main reasons probably being increased albumin losses from bleeding and via the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to a redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space (previously called third-spacing), and dilution from intravenous fluid administration Moreover, in some patients – particularly older patients – baseline albumin levels may already be low as a result of poor nutritional status or altered liver function. Although animal models suggested that albumin synthesis may be reduced in critical illness, synthesis appears to be increased in critically ill humans.

Importantly, whatever the underlying mechanisms, hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse outcomes including increased complications and reduced short-term and longer-term survival in critically ill patients. In a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that had evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/l decrease in serum albumin concentration was associated with a 137% increase in the odds of death, an 89% increase in morbidity, and a 71% increase in length of hospital stay. There is therefore a clear association between the albumin level and the severity of the insult, but it remains uncertain whether the effect of hypoalbuminemia on outcome is a cause–effect relationship or whether hypoalbuminemia is rather a marker of serious disease.

### Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients [^1136hYw8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Human albumin solutions are used in a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, burns, and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase and BIDS Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted. The search was last updated in November 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin/PPF with no albumin/PPF, or with a crystalloid solution, in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 31 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 177 deaths among 1519 trial participants. For each patient category the risk of death in the albumin treated group was higher than in the comparison group. For hypovolaemia the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 2.22), for burns the relative risk was 2.40 (1.11 to 5.19), and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.38 (0.94 to 2.03). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.52 (1.17 to 1.99). Overall, the risk of death in patients receiving albumin was 14% compared to 9% in the control groups, an increase in the risk of death of 5% (2% to 8%). These data suggest that for every 20 critically ill patients treated with albumin there is one additional death.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence that albumin administration reduces the risk of death in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia, and a strong suggestion that it may increase the risk of death. These data suggest that the use of human albumin in critically ill patients should be urgently reviewed and that it should not be used outside the context of a rigorously conducted randomised controlled trial.

### Glycated albumin: an overview of the in vitro models of an in vivo potential disease marker [^115q4GeT]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Glycation is a general spontaneous process in proteins which has significant impact on their physical and functional properties. These changes in protein properties could be related to several pathological consequences such as cataract, arteriosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Among the proteins, glycation of Human serum albumin (HSA) is of special interest. Human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the plasma and because of its high sensitivity for glycation, undergoes structural and functional changes due to binding of reducing sugars in vitro. The glycation process occurs by plasma glucose in vivo which has great impacts on the three dimensional structure of protein. These changes are efficient and stable enough which makes the protein to be considered as a new special disease marker instead of HbA1C for diabetes. In some cases, glycated albumin was used as an alternative marker for glycemic control. Glycated albumin reacts with glucose ten times more rapidly than HbA1C and has shorter half-life which makes it more reliable for indicating glycemic states. In this review, glycation of Human Serum Albumin has been overviewed, starting from overall concepts of glycation, followed by some Examples of pathological consequences of protein glycation. The BSA aggregation was reviewed in terms of structural and biological impacts of glycation on the protein followed by reporting documents which indicate possibility of glycated albumin to be used as specific marker for diabetes. Finally, some of the studies related to the models of glycated albumin have been briefly described, with an emphasis on In vitro studies. It is interesting to note the relationship found between in vitro glycation experiments and the propensity of proteins to form amyloid structures, a point that could be further explored as to its significance in hyperglycemic states.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^1159xHzh]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Safety of pooled human albumin solutions has not been definitively proven in our analysis. However, trial sequential analysis with data of moderate or high GRADE quality of evidence (table 5) showed that for further studies to eventually show human albumin to be harmful the cumulative z score would have to cross the futility boundary and then the conventional boundary of harm before touching the corrected monitoring boundary of harm (figs 4and 6). Supporting this notion of likely safety, SAFE recruited 6997 heterogeneous patients and reported overlapping Kaplan-Meier survival curves; and further reassurance comes from EARSS and ALBIOS. Furthermore, reassurance of the long term safety of pooled human albumin solutions comes from serious adverse event reporting and epidemiology data, which found no deaths or transmission of viral or prion diseaseattributed to human albumin. However, the possibility cannot be completely excluded.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: new concepts and perspectives [^1158Jp9i]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Future perspectives

The past 20 years have seen a huge change in our understanding, both of the biology of cirrhosis, its complications and also of albumin biology. The central feature, hitherto unrecognised is that cirrhosis is a state of systemic inflammation, which is heightened in patients with complications and in particular in those with ACLF. The above sections clearly highlight the importance of albumin therapy in patients with liver disease, which acts to correct both the circulatory dysfunction and also modulates inflammation. In addition to the use of albumin to prevent postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction, treat SBPand HRS, the recent suggestion that long-term outpatients albumin therapy may improve their survival provides the impetus to develop a personalised approach to albumin replacement, optimise the albumin solution that is being administered, better understand albumin biology and await results of ongoing clinical trials.

Personalised approach to albumin therapy: the concept of 'effective albumin concentration'

At present, the target for albumin therapy is not clearly defined. The data from the two long-term infusion studies have shown different results partly explained by the amount of albumin that was administered. In the ANSWER study,40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks, and then 40 g weekly of 20% albumin was administered for up to 18 months whereas in the Barcelona study,40 g albumin was administered every 15 days for a median follow-up of 80 days. In the former case, a significant reduction in mortality was observed, but in the latter, no differences in survival was found. One could interpret the data as suggesting that the amount of albumin administered matters. An alternative hypothesis may be that the lack of survival benefit in the Barcelona study is related to the inclusion of sicker patients. It is well known that these patients have worse albumin function in all its domains, bringing into discussion about the concept of 'effective albumin concentration', which is based on measurement of function rather than just the concentration. All the three main functional domains, that is, the metal binding domain, the Cysteine-34 domain and the binding sites are now possible to be assessed easily using a cobalt binding assay, high-performance chromatography or electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. It should therefore be possible to generate models whereby the 'effective albumin concentration' can be targeted rather than trying to achieve a given concentration. This sort of approach is likely to improve the efficacy and also significantly reduce the cost of albumin infusions.

### Binding and detoxification efficiency of albumin decline after haemodialysis [^111maLtF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Human serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein. It is necessary for maintaining oncotic pressure and serves as a transport protein for a variety of substances, such as fatty acids, hormones and drugs. In addition, albumin can be used therapeutically in various ways, e.g. as infusion or in extracorporeal procedures. Albumin is specifically used in albumin dialysis procedures, such as the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), to remove albumin-bound toxins, which is an established treatment in liver failure.

In contrast to patients with liver failure, findings on albumin structure and function in haemodialysis patients are rare so far, even though there is a similarly large therapeutic potential. Albumin is an important scavenger of protein-bound uraemic toxins, including indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid. Due to its multifaceted binding properties, albumin represents a target structure for both drug and physicochemical therapeutic approaches to eliminate uraemic toxins more efficiently and to better understand drug pharmacokinetics. Also, albumin is a target structure to control inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The potential of targeted removal of albumin-bound substances has been little exploited in CKD in general and in relation to haemodialysis in particular. A prerequisite for this is the understanding of albumin structure and function in haemodialysis patients, and whether and how these properties of albumin are affected by the treatment or treatment modalities in particular. Current knowledge of these aspects is limited by the small number of investigated patients and variation of the techniques used, resulting in less comparability and difficulties in interpreting the results in terms of their clinical relevance.

The aim of this study was to characterize binding and detoxification efficiency of albumin in maintenance haemodialysis patients and potential alterations by haemodialysis treatment by using a spin-labelled fatty acid ligand.

### Serum albumin: its significance in patients with ESRD [^115CQM5m]. Seminars in Dialysis (2000). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the ESRD population. The Core Indicators Project notes that the serum albumin value is a measure of the patient's nutritional status. Since 1994 every outcome parameter of the Core Indicators Project has shown improvement except for the serum albumin measurement. While the serum albumin level is a measure of the visceral protein pool size, a decrease in albumin synthesis is due to more than poor nutritional intake (in part related to inadequate dialysis). Acute-phase reactants and the plasma volume status are other major factors that impact on serum albumin determination. Plasma volume expansion, albumin redistribution, exogenous loss (in peritoneal dialysis patients), and decreased albumin synthesis all contribute to hypoalbuminemia. Understanding the cause (s) of hypoalbuminemia will allow us to target treatment modalities directed at correcting the hypoalbuminemia. It is still unknown if the serum albumin can be effectively raised in the chronic dialysis patient. Also unknown is whether an increase in the serum albumin level can alter long-term morbidity and mortality. We should not be using serum albumin as an indicator of adequate dialysis or nutritional status since the causes ofhypoalbuminemia are multifactorial. It is recommended that the serum albumin level be eliminated as an indicator of nutritional status in the ESRD patient.

### Albumin use in brain-injured and neurosurgical patients: concepts, indications, and controversies [^111PbSdB]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human albumin has been used extensively for decades as a nonwhole blood plasma replacement fluid in the perioperative and critical care setting. Its potential advantages as a highly effective volume expander must be weighed, however, against its potential harm for patients in the context of various neurological states and for various neurosurgical interventions. This narrative review explores the physiological considerations of intravenous human albumin as a replacement fluid and examines the extant clinical evidence for and against its use within the various facets of modern neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care practice.

### Differentiation and transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes [^111fB5YW]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The ability to obtain unlimited numbers of human hepatocytes would improve the development of cell-based therapies for liver diseases, facilitate the study of liver biology, and improve the early stages of drug discovery. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, potentially can differentiate into any cell type, and therefore could be developed as a source of human hepatocytes.

Methods

To generate human hepatocytes, human embryonic stem cells were differentiated by sequential culture in fibroblast growth factor 2 and human activin-A, hepatocyte growth factor, and dexamethasone. Functional hepatocytes were isolated by sorting for surface asialoglycoprotein-receptor expression. Characterization was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, immunoblot, functional assays, and transplantation.

Results

Embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes expressed liver-specific genes, but not genes representing other lineages, secreted functional human liver-specific proteins similar to those of primary human hepatocytes, and showed human hepatocyte cytochrome P450 metabolic activity. Serum from rodents given injections of embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes contained significant amounts of human albumin and alpha1-antitrypsin. Colonies of cytokeratin-18 and human albumin-expressing cells were present in the livers of recipient animals.

Conclusions

Human embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into cells with many characteristics of primary human hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-like cells can be enriched and recovered based on asialoglycoprotein-receptor expression and potentially could be used in drug discovery research and developed as therapeutics.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^115orzyi]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials, with trial sequential analysis, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses.

Data Sources

PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science (includes Medline, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Data Citation Index, Chinese Science Citation Database, CAB abstracts, Derwent Innovations Index), OvidSP (includes Embase, Ovid Medline, HMIC, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Transport Database), Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, controlled-trials.com, online material, relevant conference proceedings, hand searching of reference lists, and contact with authors as necessary.

Eligibility Criteria

Prospective randomised clinical trials of adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critical or intensive care who received pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of hypoalbuminaemia) compared with those who received control fluids (crystalloid or colloid), were included if all-cause mortality outcome data were available. No restriction of language, date, publication status, or primary study endpoint was applied.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion, extracted data to assess risk of bias, trial methods, patients, interventions, comparisons, and outcome. The relative risk of all-cause mortality was calculated using a random effects model accounting for clinical heterogeneity.

Primary Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality at final follow-up.

Results

Eighteen articles reporting on 16 primary clinical trials that included 4190 adults in critical or intensive care with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. A median of 70.0 g daily of pooled human albumin was received over a median of 3 days by adults with a median age of 60.8 years as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation, with or without correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The relative risk of death was similar between albumin groups (that received a median of 175 g in total) and control fluid groups (relative risk 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.01; P = 0.11; I² = 0%). Trial sequential analysis corrected the 95% confidence interval for random error (0.85 to 1.02; D² = 0%). Eighty eight per cent of the required information size (meta-analysis sample size) of 4894 patients was achieved, and the cumulative effect size measure (z score) entered the futility area, supporting the notion of no relative benefit of albumin (GRADE quality of evidence was moderate). Evidence of no difference was also found when albumin was compared with crystalloid fluid (relative risk 0.93; 0.86 to 1.01; P = 0.07; I(2) = 0%) in 3878 patents (GRADE quality of evidence was high; 79.9% of required information size) or colloid fluids in 299 patients (relative risk 1.04; 0.79 to 1.38; P = 0.76; I(2) = 0%) (GRADE quality of evidence was very low; 5.8% of required information size). When studies at high risk of bias were excluded in a predefined subgroup analysis, the finding of no mortality benefit remained, and the cumulative z score was just outside the boundary of futility. Overall, the meta-analysis was robust to sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses.

Conclusions

In this analysis, human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation for critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) were not robustly effective at reducing all-cause mortality. Albumin seems to be safe in this setting, as a signal towards harm was not detected, but this analysis does not support a recommendation for use.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1158KX7a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^113UPeAa]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of albumin administration may also depend on the simultaneous use of diuretics to prevent an albumin infusion-induced increase in hydrostatic pressure, which may increase (rather than decrease) edema formation. Some studies have suggested that the concurrent use of albumin may increase furosemide-induced diuresis in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury and cirrhosis-induced ascites, although not in all critically ill patients; whether this strategy has any effect on patient-centered clinical outcomes is unclear.

In 1999 Sort and colleagues published the results of a RCT in 126 patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis comparing treatment with intravenous cefotaxime or cefotaxime plus intravenous albumin for plasma volume expansion. Renal impairment developed in fewer patients in the patients who received albumin (P = 0.002) and these patients also had reduced hospital and 3-month mortality rates (both P = 0.01). A more recent RCT reported beneficial effects of albumin plus antibiotic on renal and circulatory function in 110 patients with cirrhosis and infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; treatment with albumin was an independent predictive factor of survival. A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs also suggested that albumin use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.86) and renal impairment (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.75) in patients with cirrhosis and any infection. Two small RCTs have also demonstrated improved renal function in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome treated with albumin and terlipressin.

### Using albumin to improve the therapeutic properties of diabetes treatments [^111nYpac]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Achieving tight glycaemic control remains an unmet need for many patients with type 2 diabetes, despite improved treatments. To meet glycaemic targets, attempts have been made to improve existing drugs and to develop new classes of drugs. Recent advances include insulin analogues that more closely mimic physiologic insulin levels, and incretin-based therapies, which capitalize on the glucoregulatory properties of native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Although promising, these agents are associated with limitations, including hypoglycaemia with insulin, gastrointestinal adverse events with GLP-1 receptor agonists and frequent dosing with both classes. Albumin is an abundant natural drug carrier that has been used to improve the half-life, tolerability and efficacy of a number of bioactive agents. Here, we review the physiologic roles of albumin and how albumin technologies are being used to prolong duration of action of therapies for diabetes, including insulin and incretin-based therapies.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^114sHcK1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Which concentration of albumin solution?

Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20 to 25% or 4 to 5%, and which concentration should be used has generated some debate. Direct blood volume measurements in humans have revealed that the intravascular volume effect of isooncotic preparations of human albumin solutions is much higher than that of crystalloids (> 80% vs < 20%). However, the albumin concentration chosen largely depends on whether other fluids, especially crystalloids, are administered simultaneously – a 20% (20 g in 100 ml) albumin solution given simultaneously with 500 mL of normal saline solution is equivalent to a 3.3% (20/600) albumin solution. Nevertheless, hyperoncotic albumin may be a better choice if edema is already present, avoiding excessive sodium and chloride loads and their attendant complications.

Which dose of albumin?

Determining the ideal dose or volume of albumin that should be used is difficult. Early physiological studies demonstrated that administration of 5% albumin to septic patients expanded the plasma volume by an amount equivalent to the volume infused. Different studies have used different doses, and perhaps the dose should be adjusted according to a target serum albumin concentration, as in the ALBIOS study. The dose chosen by Mira and colleagues in the EARSS study (100 mL of 20% albumin 8 hourly for 3 days) achieved an increase in serum albumin to 25 to 29 g/l, raising the possibility that the albumin dose used may have been too low to show definite benefit – although this increase was similar to that reported in the SAFE study subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis, in whom a benefit was reported.

### Glycated albumin: an overview of the in vitro models of an in vivo potential disease marker [^111WsJzK]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Albumin is one of longest known proteins of plasma. Normal concentration of albumin is 35–50 g/l, which makes it the most abundant protein in plasma with a wide variety of physiological functions. Human albumin presents 50% of the normal individual's plasma protein. The protein is organized into three domains, I, II and III, each subdivided into two subdomains, A and B, with 17 intramolecular disulfide bonds which makes it suitable for a wide variety of modifications including response to pH and other biophysical compounds. Due to its low molecular weight (67 kDa), albumin contributes in osmotic pressure maintenance of plasma, compared with other plasma globulins, and also because of its weak isoelectric point, the protein has a global negative charge at physiological pH. Albumin structure allows protein to bind and transport diverse metabolites such as metal ions, fatty acids, bilirubin and drugs. Indeed, conjugation of drugs with this protein with long half-life, improved their pharmacokinetic properties.

There are three main binding sites on the protein; two of them (site I and site II) are located on subdomains IIA and IIIA, respectively and have been found to bind specifically aromatic and heterocyclic ligands. Flexibility of human serum albumin (HSA) enables interaction of the protein with numerous compounds, by contrast, site II, which is less flexible, has not same property. As examples, paracetamol, a commonly used analgesic drug, binds to residues located in the subdomain IIIA and other metabolites such as fatty acids bind to other locations, whose seven binding sites are localized in subdomains IB, IIIA, and IIIB. In addition, some residues, such as cysteine, lysine, serine and arginine, have found to covalently bind to many drugs.

When protein modification induced by physiological or pathological changes occurs, an alteration of the native conformation and efficiency of these binding sites can be expected. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE), which could bind to plasma proteins, were considered as a novel class of uremic toxins, and besides ceruloplasmin and other plasma compounds such as ascorbic acid, the role of albumin has been highlighted as an antioxidant, having a part in keeping the body safe in cases of oxidative stress which is due to availability of several residues to work as antioxidant. Cys-34 is one of the powerful residues involved in disulfide bond and in a healthy person 70–80% of albumin Cys-34 is in its reduced form and is able to scavenge hydroxyl radicals when the protein is in native conformation.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1134kKqK]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

A substantial amount of evidence from RCTs in critically ill adult patients across a wide range of patient subgroups provides little supportive evidence for the use of albumin as fluid replacement to reduce mortality, the need for kidney replacement therapy, or other outcomes considered important or critical for decision-making by the panel. Given the wide CIs for the estimates from the systematic reviews, all recommendations were considered conditional because of the residual uncertainty.

In systematic reviews evaluating the role of albumin in patients with sepsis, the use of albumin has not been found to be associated with improved outcomes, although a benefit has not been excluded because of the wide CI in the most recent systematic review. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines published in 2021recommend albumin in addition to crystalloids when patients require large volumes of crystalloids (Weak Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence). Specific formulations of albumin (4%-5% or 20%-25%), volumes or doses, serum albumin targets, or a combination thereof were not described. The guidelines state, "The lack of proven benefit and higher cost of albumin compared to crystalloid contributed to our strong recommendation for the use of crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock". More studies will be needed to evaluate the role and timing of albumin as a rescue fluid in patients with sepsis failing front-line crystalloid resuscitation, particularly given the considerably higher cost of albumin compared with crystalloids, the risks of albumin, and the lack of benefit shown in RCTs.

Clinical Setting 2: Critically Ill Pediatric Patients With Severe Infection

Recommendation

Recommendation 4: In pediatric patients with infection and hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not recommended to reduce mortality (Strong Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

### The glycocalyx as a permeability barrier: basic science and clinical evidence [^1153cbtL]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The endothelial glycocalyx has long been hypothesized to be a major component of the microvascular permeability barrier in humans. In fact, almost every published paper on the glycocalyx includes "permeability barrier" as one of its major functions. The data, however, for such a conclusion are scarce. The basic science and preclinical evidence for the glycocalyx as a primary permeability barrier will be reviewed.

The primary pathway for fluid and solute movement across the endothelium is through the intercellular junction (Fig. 1). In mammals, the intercellular junction is a long and tortuous cleft held together by the adherens junction (AJ), a complex of proteins that create focal areas of tight membrane apposition. The AJ complex is, in turn, connected to the endothelial cytoskeleton via an array of signaling molecules and adhesion proteins that, during inflammation, can disassemble leading to an increase in junctional permeability. Vesicular transport, via caveolae, participates in albumin transport in the continuous-type endothelium but remains an unsettled issue in fenestrated endothelium.

Fig. 1
A Historical model of the glycocalyx (left), based on electron micrographs, proposed that the endothelial glycocalyx covered the cell surface including the luminal opening of the intercellular junction and the neck of caveolae. B The contemporary model (right) suggests that the glycocalyx residing over the cell body is much thicker than originally proposed but does not appreciably cover the junctional opening or caveolae neck. In the contemporary model, junctional complexes like the adherens junction limits protein permeability rather than the glycocalyx.

Modified from Reference

Early electron micrographs yielded images of a compact endothelial surface layer, while more recent images presented a thick bush-like layer covering the cell surface. Based on these images, the glycocalyx has been widely depicted a formidable layer covering the cell surface including overlying the luminal opening of the intercellular junction and the caveolae neck. In both instances, the glycocalyx has been presumed to function as a molecular filter for junctional and vesicular transport (Fig. 1). Regarding caveolae, recent evidence suggests that PV1, a caveolae diaphragm protein, is the principal determinant of caveolae albumin loading. Conditional knockdown of PV1 dramatically increases caveolae albumin loading and transcytosis, leading to a significant loss of plasma albumin, increased tissue albumin concentrations and extensive interstitial edema.

### Albumin human (Albuminex) [^112cZptN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Human albumin accounts for more than half of the total protein in the plasma and represents about 10% of protein synthesis activity by the liver.

The primary physiological function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, and capillary membrane integrity.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Albumin is distributed throughout the extracellular space and more than 60% of the body albumin pool is located in the extravascular fluid compartment. Albumin has a circulating life span of 15–20 days, with a turnover of approximately 15 g per day. The balance between synthesis and breakdown is normally achieved by feedback regulation. Elimination is predominantly intracellular and due to lysosome proteases.

In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume.

In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours. In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate.

### Albumin in advanced liver diseases: the good and bad of a drug! [^115SRTKk]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, and it regulates diverse body functions. In patients with advanced and decompensated cirrhosis, serum albumin levels are low because of a reduction in the hepatocyte mass due to disease per se and multiple therapeutic interventions. Because of their oncotic and nononcotic properties, administration of human albumin solutions (HAS) have been found to be beneficial in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or who have hepatorenal syndrome or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Albumin also improves the functionality of the immune cells and mitigates the severity and risk of infections in advanced cirrhosis. Its long-term administration can modify the course of decompensated cirrhosis patients by reducing the onset of new complications, improving the quality of life, and probably providing survival benefits. There is, however, a need to rationalize the dose, duration, and frequency of albumin therapy in different liver diseases and stages of cirrhosis. In patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, potentially toxic oxidized isoforms of albumin increase substantially, especially human nonmercaptalbumin and 2, and nitrosoalbumin. The role of administration of HAS in such patients is unclear. Determining whether removal of the pathological and dysfunctional albumin forms in these patients by "albumin dialysis" is helpful, requires additional studies. Use of albumin is not without adverse events. These mainly include allergic and transfusion reactions, volume overload, antibody formation and coagulation derangements. Considering their cost, limited availability, need for a health care setting for their administration, and potential adverse effects, judicious use of HAS in liver diseases is advocated. There is a need for new albumin molecules and economic alternatives in hepatologic practice.

### Use of albumin in the NICU: an evidence-based review [^114nsCiB]. NeoReviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood with distinctive functions throughout the human body.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^111WFDyx]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations and conclusions

Many changes within intensive care medicine have come as the result of the realization that traditional practices once thought to be therapeutic were in fact detrimental. Human albumin solutions have been available for almost 60 years and provide effective resuscitation with less fluid required than for crystalloid solutions; for many years, however, albumin was widely and perhaps nondiscriminantly used as a resuscitation fluid with little realization that it may not be appropriate in all patients. Although criticized for its methodology and the heterogeneity of the studies included, the 1998 Cochrane meta-analysis brought this possibility to the attention of the wider community and stimulated the conduct of large, multicenter RCTs. As the results of these studies become available, the role of albumin in today's critical care unit is becoming clearer and several recommendations can be made:

- Albumin administration, although unlikely to cause harm in most patients, is not necessary in all critically ill patients and should be reserved for use in specific groups of patients in whom there is evidence of benefit.

- A hypotonic albumin solution should be avoided as a resuscitation fluid in patients with traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the SAFE subgroup analysis.

- There is now enough evidence – albeit largely from subgroup analyses – and plausible biological rationale to support use of albumin in patients with septic shock when a colloid is considered.

- Albumin administration should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but possibly also other infections; in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; and also in patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

Future research should be focused on patients who are most likely to benefit from albumin administration in whom the evidence is inadequate or controversial because of conflicting study results. In addition to observational cohort studies and RCTs focusing on specific patient groups, mechanistic studies are necessary to further elucidate the molecular and physiologic rationale for the beneficial effects of albumin and explore how albumin's pleiotropic actions may be important in specific groups of critically ill patients. Such studies also need to better elucidate the mechanisms of development of hypoalbuminemia. Studies also need to clarify issues of dosage and appropriate targets and whether different albumin solutions have unique differential effects on patients' responses and outcomes to albumin administration. The effects of albumin infusions on drug (especially antimicrobial) dosing also need clarification.

Intravenous fluid selection for sepsis resuscitation is outlined, with two categories and explicit recommendations. The 2 major categories of resuscitation fluids are isotonic crystalloids and colloids. Among crystalloids, the primary choices are saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride, or "normal saline") and balanced crystalloids; saline contains chloride at 154 mmol/L, which can lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may increase renal inflammation. Figure guidance states "We recommend balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary fluid type for resuscitation in sepsis" and "We do not recommend using colloids", with colloid examples including albumin (4%, 5%, 20%).

### Serum albumin levels: who needs them? [^117PNnGq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this critical narrative review is to discuss common indications for ordering serum albumin levels in adult critically ill patients, evaluate the literature supporting these indications, and provide recommendations for the appropriate ordering of serum albumin levels.

Data Sources

PubMed (1966 to August 2020), Cochrane Library, and current clinical practice guidelines were used, and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for additional articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Current clinical practice guidelines were the preferred source of recommendations regarding serum albumin levels for guiding albumin administration and for nutritional monitoring. When current comprehensive reviews were available, they served as a baseline information with supplementation by subsequent studies.

Data Synthesis

Serum albumin is a general marker of severity of illness, and hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor patient outcome, but albumin is an acute phase protein, so levels vacillate in critically ill patients in conjunction with illness fluctuations. The most common reasons for ordering serum albumin levels in intensive care unit (ICU) settings are to guide albumin administration, to estimate free phenytoin or calcium levels, for nutritional monitoring, and for severity-of-illness assessment.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Because hypoalbuminemia is common in the ICU setting, inappropriate ordering of serum albumin levels may lead to unnecessary albumin administration or excessive macronutrient administration in nutritional regimens, leading to possible adverse effects and added costs.

Conclusions

With the exception of the need to order serum albumin levels as a component of selected severity-of-illness scoring systems, there is little evidence or justification for routinely ordering levels in critically ill patients.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^115bjssd]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of individual studies, and with bias domains across studies, using the Cochrane collaboration tool. RevMan version 5.2.9 (Java 6) was used to construct summaries. The domains of assessment for the outcome of all-cause mortality were selection (sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance, detection, attrition, selective reporting, research misconduct or duplicate publication, and other bias. Blinding (for performance bias assessment) of intervention fluid was considered to confer low risk of bias if healthcare staff and patients were blind to group allocation and efforts had been made to conceal fluids and administration equipment. The risk of performance bias was considered unclear if a fixed albumin dose schedule was used without blinding, or if blinding was reported but to a lesser degree than required for low risk of bias. Otherwise, if a variable albumin dose schedule was reported, the risk of bias was considered high without adequate blinding. The other bias category included a bias of any potential source. A trial was considered as high risk of bias overall if one or more individual bias assessment domains were judged to be at high risk. If all individual bias domains were judged to be low risk, a study was considered low risk of bias overall. If one or more individual bias assessment domains was judged to be of unclear risk of bias, the overall trial risk of bias was considered low (if reviewers judged that key domains were at low risk and the unclear risk domains were unlikely to seriously alter the results) or unclear (if key domains were judged to be at unclear risk of bias, raising some doubt about the results). Publication bias was assessed by visual judgement of a funnel plot and by Egger's regression.

Grading the quality of evidence

The quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology by a panel of four reviewers with experience of critical/intensive care medicine, haematology, anaesthesia, and general (internal) medicine. Quality of evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the judgements for the outcome of all-cause mortality regarding risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations (publication bias).GRADE was applied to each human albumin fluid comparison, then to each predefined risk of bias subgroup. Summary tables were constructed with GRADEpro version 3.6.

### Hypoalbuminaemia and heart failure: a practical review of current evidence [^111BAU13]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hypoalbuminaemia is common in HF patients and is explained by multiple pathophysiological processes. Several studies showed that hypoalbuminaemia could be used as a prognostic biomarker for patients hospitalized due to HF or to predict HF events across the full spectrum of ejection fraction, irrespective of potential confounders. In the opinion of the authors, this is the current and more helpful role of albumin in such patients. Whether albumin supplementation in ADHF or chronic HF patients would be beneficial to improve outcomes is not known. Indeed, adequately designed, multicentre randomized clinical trials, as done for iron supplementation in HF, are warranted to fill this knowledge gap, considering the beneficial properties of albumin that have been demonstrated in other settings. In this view, it would be helpful to consider both inpatients and outpatients, different HF phenotypes, and acute versus chronic HF in order to gather information about the best time, if any, to supplement albumin.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^117R5jU3]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies with ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% have been conducted.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Albumin is responsible for 75–80% of the colloid osmotic pressure of normal plasma. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins. [3]

Albumin is a protein with a total extravascular mass of approximately 160 g and an intravascular mass of about 120 g. [3]

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The colloid osmotic effect of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 20% and 25% is approximately 5 times the volume administered. When injected intravenously, it will increase circulating plasma volume by approximately 3.5 times the volume infused within 15 minutes if the patient is adequately hydrated. This extra fluid reduces hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. The degree and duration of volume expansion depends upon the initial blood volume. When treating patients with diminished blood volume, the effect of infused albumin may persist for many hours. The hemodilution lasts for a shorter time when albumin is administered to individuals with normal blood volume. [4]

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^1165gYhj]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Serum albumin and prealbumin as perioperative risk markers — serum albumin has historically been established as a marker of surgical risk, and some surgical guidelines recommend delaying surgery to allow time for nutrition support; a serum albumin level < 3.5 g/dL is associated with increased postoperative morbidity, and a serum prealbumin level < 10 mg/dL is associated with more complications after free-flap surgery, with surgical-site infection in particular associated with hypoalbuminemia. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism recommends delaying elective surgery when serum albumin level is < 3 g/dL, and delaying surgery to allow the resolution of inflammation with the use of sufficient nutrition support may be the key factor; when possible, patients should receive nutrition support and surgical treatments directed at inflammation and infection prior to surgery.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^112KP8xn]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction

For each study, data extraction was undertaken independently by two reviewers using a pre-made extraction form. Data on the following study characteristics were collected if available: centres, countries, dates of patient study, number of randomised patients with sepsis of any severity, trial primary reported endpoint, and time of final mortality assessment. To assist comparison between studies, patients were reclassified into "sepsis", "severe sepsis", and "septic shock" clinical severity diagnostic groups. Sufficient data to calculate baseline (comparison group) all-cause mortality, observed power, relative and absolute risk reductions, were also collected.

Baseline patient characteristics of the albumin intervention group were collected on sex, age, illness severity (SOFA, APACHE II, SAPS II), vasopressor use and lactate level (markers of septic shock), albumin level, pulmonary infection focus, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal replacement therapy, and medical/surgical case mix. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was reclassified according to the Berlin definitionwhere possible to facilitate comparison between trials.

Intervention details were extracted. The indication, intervention method, timing of intervention initiation, desired intervention targets, intervention exposure time, types of interventions (concentration of human albumin with brand and manufacturer; comparison fluid type), intervention dose (to calculate daily and total dose, total and volume), were also recorded. If more than one suitable randomised comparison group was reported, these were combined as appropriate into comparison fluid categories: control (all non-human albumin groups), crystalloid, or colloid.

Data on the predefined primary outcome of all-cause mortality were collected in relation to the patients enrolled at baseline. When mortality was reported at different follow-up intervals, data from the longest complete follow-up was used. For published studies, we contacted the corresponding author for clarification of specific sepsis mortality data for individual intervention group if required, if this had not been attempted by a previous systematic review. We also contacted the lead investigators of unpublished registered trials that had not presented data of their final mortality outcome. Data on early (≤ 24 hour) and post-intervention albumin levels in the pooled human albumin groups were collected, and their difference from pre-intervention baseline calculated. If these data were not reported in the text of articles, we estimated values from their figures if available.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^1118qHgZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Are there individual patient populations in which saline should be avoided entirely? Testing types of fluids in subgroups of patients to detect the likelihood of adverse effects would be useful.
2) Are there differences between buffered solutions? Is lactated Ringers superior to acetated/gluconated buffered solution or vice versa?
3) What are the implications of acetate and gluconate contained in some balanced solutions? In cardiac surgery patients, an acetate-based balanced solution had similar hemodynamic effects compared with lactated ringers. However, significant infusion of acetate may contribute to vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction in patients with kidney dysfunction.
4) Recent data suggest that maintenance fluids and fluids used in diluting drugs may provide significant amount of chloride and have a major impact on fluid balance. Data suggest that selecting sodium/chloride poor maintenance fluids may improve fluid balance and chloride load in postoperative patients, but data in septic patients are still lacking. As such, should chloride containing solutions (including balanced solutions) be minimized or entirely avoided? Notably, this question is especially pertinent given recent instances of supply chain interruption, resulting in shortages of critical fluids and necessitating therapeutic substitutions at the individual patient level.
5) Are the beneficial renal outcomes associated with buffered solutions compared with saline due to the reduction in chloride content? In other words, is chloride toxic in itself, so that toxicity occurs even in absence of obvious hyperchloremia/acidosis (in which condition chloride-free solutions should be favored and saline-based dilution of drugs should be avoided whenever possible) or is it deviation of chloride/pH that generates the toxicity of high volumes of NaCl 0.9% (in which context closer monitoring of these variables may limit the toxicity)? Can lactated sodium solutions serve as a substitute for saline to minimize renal injury?
6) Is albumin superior to buffered crystalloid solutions? If used, when should albumin be administered? Ideally, this comparison of albumin with balanced crystalloid solutions would include subgroups of patients of particular interest (chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis).
7) Should albumin be initiated in an attempt to correct hypoalbuminemia or as a volume replacement fluid? Given the colloidal qualities of albumin, would albumin be of greater benefit in cases of severe shock, necessitating greater amounts of fluid resuscitation? Or should it be used to correct hypoalbuminemia? If there is a benefit to albumin administration as a fluid resuscitation therapy, where does it provide the greatest benefit in light of its cost?
8) What is the optimal concentration of the albumin solution (4–5% or 20%)? Studies of albumin have evaluated various concentrations of albumin. Contingent on its proposed mechanism of benefit in fluid resuscitation (correction of hypoalbuminemia vs intravascular fluid expansion), studies comparing the various albumin concentrations are necessary.
9) Should severity of sepsis play a role in determining which fluid to use for resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, would patients specifically with more severe forms of shock benefit from a combination approach of crystalloids and colloids to fluid resuscitation?
10) Does resource setting play a role in determining the efficacy of which fluid is chosen? Studies outlined above were performed in resource-intensive environments. Considering data demonstrating that outcomes to fluid resuscitation are disparate between resource-intensive environments and resource-limited environments, it is possible that the type of fluid might also impact outcomes, understanding that fluid choices will likely be significantly more limited in resource \-constrained locations and in the face of unpredictable supply.

### Defining the black box: a narrative review of factors associated with adverse outcomes from severeinfection [^111PzW2k]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum albumin

Interpretation of a serum albumin concentration in a patient who presents acutely ill can be challenging as a clinician. This challenge arises because the measured serum albumin can result from the interaction of several different causal pathways. Hypoalbuminemia can be chronic, resulting from malnutrition or liver disease. Alternatively, hypoalbuminemia can also occur acutely – albumin is a negative acute phase reactant and its level can drop in the setting of acute inflammation, and it can be excreted after renal injury or with protein-losing enteropathy. Therefore, conceptually it makes sense that serum albumin would be useful in predicting outcomes from severe CDI, because it is simultaneously a potential marker of acute inflammation and the baseline health status of an individual.

Although the predictive utility of serum albumin is not well defined, in some studies hypoalbuminemia (defined as < 25–35 g/L) alone or as part of various clinical prediction rules has been found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality.,

Level of care

Level of care has been described in several studies, including a systematic review, as a factor that associates with increased risk of mortality, particularly for in-hospital mortality. Similar to albumin, however, level of care – specifically ICU level of care – has been used by many studies in the definition for severe CDI. Studies including ICU admission in the definition of severe CDI have demonstrated a significantly increased risk of 90 day mortality. One study found that ICU level of care was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. However, this finding was confounded by the primary treatment, which was metronidazole, and therefore it is difficult to extrapolate that finding to a population in an ICU receiving the current standard of care. Ultimately, since patients receiving a higher level of care are typically those with more severe illness, it is not surprising that a higher level of care is associated with adverse outcomes. However, care should be taken when interpreting this, because the level of care itself resulted from numerous preceding factors, and including these factors alongside the level of care itself can count the same risk twice and bias results due to this collinearity.

### The revised starling equation: the debate of albumin versus crystalloids continues [^112PpVTE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives: The purpose of this critical narrative review is to discuss the revised Starling equation for microvascular fluid exchange and the associated implications for intravenous fluid administration. Data Sources: PubMed (1946 to December 2019) and EMBASE (1947 to December 2019) were used, and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for additional articles. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles pertaining to the revised Starling equation and microvascular fluid exchange. Additionally, prospective human studies involving the disposition and oncotic action of radiolabeled albumin and large randomized trials comparing fluid requirements associated with isotonic crystalloid and albumin administration were included. Data Synthesis: In the revised Starling equation, oncotic forces act across the endothelial cell layer, more specifically between the fluid in the vessel lumen and the protein-sparse subglycocalyx space. The revised Starling equation and radiolabeled investigations of albumin necessitate a reconsideration of conventional views of the plasma-expanding properties of exogenous albumin. Large clinical trials demonstrate that the administration of iso-oncotic or hyper-oncotic albumin solutions in patients undergoing resuscitation does not have the reductions in fluid requirements anticipated from a traditional understanding of the oncotic actions of albumin. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: When used as a resuscitation fluid, albumin does not have the degree of plasma expansion or intravascular retention commonly used to justify its use. Conclusions: The principles underlying the revised Starling equation in conjunction with data from radiolabeled studies of albumin and large clinical trials demonstrate that albumin does not have the perceived degree of plasma expansion or duration of intravascular retention beyond crystalloid solutions predicted by the classic Starling equation.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^116Yv2PL]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Physiological properties

Albumin is a natural plasma protein synthesized exclusively by the liver at a rate of 9 to 14 g/day in healthy individuals, with a median half-life of about 18 to 19 days (Figure 1). Albumin is catabolized in most organs of the body at a similar rate of about 9 to 14 g/day, by uptake into endocytotic vesicles on the endothelial surface; the final breakdown products are amino acids.

Figure 1
Schematic illustration of metabolism of albumin in healthy adults. GI, gastrointestinal.

Albumin has well-known effects on maintaining fluid balance, being responsible for 75 to 80% of COP in the basal physiological state. In critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis, the relationship between COP and the albumin concentration is complex, being influenced by altered permeability and increased transcapillary escape rates. Moreover, improved understanding of the endothelial glyocalyx has altered our comprehension of the role of COP in fluid balance. Numerous experimental studies have confirmed that the traditional understanding of an inwards-directed oncotic gradient between a protein-low interstitial space and a protein-rich plasma, as suggested by Ernest Starling more than 100 years ago, is not correct; indeed, the interstitial compartment has high protein concentrations. Nevertheless, there is a functional vascular barrier, created by the endothelial glycocalyx layer, a skeleton of glycoproteins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, and its interaction with plasma constituents, including albumin, to form the endothelial surface layer, which is positioned on the luminal side of the endothelium with a thickness of up to 1 μm in humans. A small space, situated on the luminal side of the endothelium beneath this protein sponge, is permanently cleared of passing protein molecules by a protein-low resting flux through small breaks in the intercellular junction strands towards the tissues. Accordingly, an inwardly-directed oncotic force, quantitatively opposite to the hydrostatically driven fluid filtration, develops exclusively across the small space beneath the glycocalyx and the protein-loaded endothelial surface layer (Figure 2).

Figure 1
Schematic representation of albumin flux, synthesis, and degradation.

Solid arrows: transmembrane transport. Dashed arrows: Synthesis in liver; Degradation: intracellular proteolysis. Gain: Increase in total body albumin. Loss: decrease in total body albumin. Reduction: reducing oxidized total boyd albumin. The length of the black oval represents albumin mass, which is diminished due to more rapid intracellular breakdown in liver and proliferating cells. It is uncertain, whether cell volume is stable, while it is certain that cell solids are decreased in inflammatory conditions. Fluxes are represented by the size of arrows crossing the cell walls between liver, plasma, interstitium, and cell. They are larger (higher transmembrane flux) in inflammation than in health. It is possible that only a part of the flux entering the interstitium enters the cell, but rather (especially in inflammation after oxidation or scavenging) turns back to the plasma and is then reduced or degraded in the liver. The size of the quadrangles represents the volume of the different compartments and their grey intensity, the concentration of serum albumin. The size of cell mass in health and inflammatory states have been depicted to be identical although this is uncertain; cell mass may be increased, while cell solids are decreased. In health, net hepatic albumin output enters the plasma, and from there, it gets limited access to the interstitium at a low rate and, subsequently, to the cells. In these compartments, albumin serves as antioxidant and scavenger and to a very limited degree as supplier of amino acids for cell proliferation. Oxidized and otherwise damaged albumin is broken down in the liver or reduced for renewed antioxidation or scavenging. In inflammatory states, these functions are upregulated depending on the severity of the inflammatory insult, increasing fluxes from plasma to interstitium by increased capillary permeability. Albumin synthesis may increase, but oxidation of and scavenging by albumin will be upregulated. Similarly, albumin serves as intracellular amino acid donor for cell proliferation at a much higher rate than in health. Consequently, breakdown of albumin is higher in inflammatory states than in health, leading to decreased albumin mass despite potentially increased synthesis. These processes have been described in the literature, but have not been quantified. Transport into the cell as depicted in Figure 1 may be exaggerated and reentry of serum albumin from the interstitium into the plasma underestimated.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^114LpzTy]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients [^114eoTJn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Human albumin solutions are used for a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, such as in burns and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 31 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to week 3 May 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 21 2011), CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to May 2011), PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/) (searched 10 June 2011, limit: last 60 days). Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin or PPF with no albumin or PPF or with a crystalloid solution in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 38 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 1,958 deaths among 10,842 trial participants. For hypovolaemia, the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.13). This estimate was heavily influenced by the results of the SAFE trial, which contributed 75.2% of the information (based on the weights in the meta-analysis). For burns, the relative risk was 2.93 (95% CI 1.28 to 6.72) and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.26 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.88). There was no substantial heterogeneity between the trials in the various categories (χ² = 26.66, df = 31, P = 0.69). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.05 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.16).

Authors' Conclusions

For patients with hypovolaemia, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline. There is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with burns and hypoalbuminaemia. The possibility that there may be highly selected populations of critically ill patients in which albumin may be indicated remains open to question. However, in view of the absence of evidence of a mortality benefit from albumin and the increased cost of albumin compared to alternatives such as saline, it would seem reasonable that albumin should only be used within the context of well concealed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials.

### Serum albumin and β-amyloid deposition in the human brain [^115WGKR3]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular deposition of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Because Aβ deposition is the earliest pathology of AD and begins ≈10 to 15 years before the onset of the cognitive symptoms, identification of factors affecting cerebral Aβ deposition may facilitate the development of strategies for preventing AD dementia.

Serum albumin, which is the most abundant protein in human plasma, is regarded as one of the most potent Aβ sequestering systems in that it binds 90% to 95% of the Aβ in blood plasma. The dynamic equilibrium of Aβ between brain and blood plasma may be shifted toward the bloodstream by peripheral serum albumin that binds the Aβ. Therefore, a reduction in Aβ binding to serum albumin in the blood may lead to a decrease in the capacity for Aβ excretion from the brain to the blood, resulting in Aβ deposition in the brain.

Preclinical studies suggested that serum albumin may inhibit Aβ fibril formation by binding Aβ monomersor oligomers. Several human studies have indicated that a low serum albumin level is associated with cognitive impairmentand AD dementia. However, little information is available on whether serum albumin is related to Aβ deposition in the living human brain. Therefore, the present study was performed to examine the relationships of serum albumin and in vivo cerebral Aβ deposition in older adults without dementia. We additionally investigated the associations of serum albumin with AD-signature neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as a measure of cerebrovascular injury. While some human studies have reported an inverse association of serum albumin and cerebrovascular disease, few studies have investigated the relationships of serum albumin with neurodegenerative changes in the brain.

### Drug insight: the role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^114xAjJj]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiologic function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. Better understanding of albumin's other physiologic functions has expanded its application beyond maintenance of intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction developing after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies. The use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy; its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute on chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, dose of albumin required and predictors of response, so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^11788bEW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half‐life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### Aberrant Co-localization of synaptic proteins promoted by Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β peptides: protective effect of Human serum albumin [^1131QbQe]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

One of the early events in neurodegeneration associated with AD is synaptic disarrangement, a phenomenon that presumably precedes Aβ plaque formation. Indeed, Aβ preferentially accumulates in synapsis, which can result in the decrease in neuronal interconnections. In agreement with this, it has been described that Aβ caused morphological and functional changes in synapsis and inhibited neuronal plasticity.

Monomeric and oligomeric Aβ can be transported from brain interstitial compartment to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and from this to peripheral blood circulation. Most of the Aβ in CSF and blood is associated with serum albumin, which that may prevent Aβ polymerization. Moreover, it has been proposed that serum albumin plays an important role in Aβ clearance and elimination. Aβ concentrations in the blood correlated with those observed in the brain, leading to the proposal of the "peripheral sink hypothesis" for disposal of the peptides. According to this hypothesis, the "peripheral sink" would drive Aβ efflux from the brain. Indeed, serum albumin can play an important role in this process because Aβ is transported as Aβ-albumin complex by body fluids. In addition, Aβ disposal by the kidney may be mediated by serum albumin because megalin, i.e. a serum albumin receptor in the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells, has shown a protective effect promoting Aβ disposal. Thus, Aβ would be transported by serum albumin from the brain to the kidney where its disposal is facilitated by the albumin-megalin endocytosis mechanism. It should be mentioned that neprilysin, a putative Aβ-protease, is abundant in the kidney brush border membrane, suggesting the occurrence of a convenient allocation of Aβ disposal machinery. In agreement with the role played by serum albumin in Aβ clearance from the brain, treatment of AD patients by repeat plasma replacements with Aβ-free human serum albumin decreased brain Aβ accumulations and ameliorated cognitive test results.

In a previous work, we showed that the presence of serum albumin promoted neuronal survival in the presence of Aβ 25–35, which can be explained because serum albumin prevented amyloid entry into neurons. In this work, we have studied the protective effect of human serum albumin on the changes caused by Aβ 25–35, Aβ 40, and Aβ 42 in neuronal viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and synaptic protein expression and localization in neurons in primary culture.

### Use of albumin: an update [^115U7qte]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Human albumin (HA) is widely used for volume replacement or correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The value of HA in the clinical setting continues to be controversial, and it is unclear whether in today's climate of cost consciousness, there is still a place for such a highly priced substance. It is therefore appropriate to update our knowledge of the value of HA. With the exception of women in early pregnancy, there appears to be few indications for the use of HA to correct hypovolaemia. Some studies of traumatic brain injury and intensive care patients suggest negative effects on outcome and organ function of (hyperoncotic) HA. Modern synthetic colloids appear to be a cheaper alternative for maintaining colloid oncotic pressure. The value of using HA to correct hypoalbuminaemia has not been clearly justified. Theoretical and pharmacological benefits of HA, such as oxygen radical scavenging or binding of toxic substances, have not as yet been shown to have beneficial clinical consequences. Experimental data from cell lines or animals do not appear to mimic the clinical setting. Convincing data justifying the use of HA either for treating hypovolaemia or for correcting hypoalbuminaemia are still lacking. A restricted use of HA is recommended.

### Why Do the mechanistic actions of albumin not translate into tangible clinical benefits? [^111qMbfm]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Albumin has only reduced crude mortality in one randomized controlled trial conducted to date. This raises the question as to why potentially beneficial oncotic and pleiotropic properties of albumin do not consistently translate into clinically important outcomes. Four postulated explanations are provided as to why the theoretical advantages of albumin are not apparent in clinical trials: diminished oncotic action due to leakage of albumin from the intravascular compartment, modification of the pleiotropic properties of albumin both in vitro and in vivo, the ability of other plasma proteins to take over the major functions of albumin, and possible adverse effects.
