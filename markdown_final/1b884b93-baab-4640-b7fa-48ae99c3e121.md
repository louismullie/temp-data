## Question

Explain vaginal spotting

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of vaginal spotting, including definition, etiologies, evaluation, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define spotting and distinguish it from bleeding. Then, I should categorize causes by life stage and pathophysiology. Next, I will outline a risk-stratified diagnostic approach, especially for postmenopausal patients. After that, I should review management strategies tailored to etiology and patient goals. Finally, I will synthesize red flags and counseling points, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and labeling as I go [^113abpTx] [^114WRQ4V].

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Spotting is light vaginal bleeding that does not require sanitary protection, whereas bleeding necessitates pads or tampons; this distinction is used consistently in contraceptive and menopausal studies and helps standardize patient-reported outcomes across trials and clinical encounters [^113abpTx] [^116yTi7a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benignity; I need to consider life stage and context. In reproductive-age patients, spotting can be physiologic or iatrogenic, but in postmenopausal patients any bleeding is abnormal and warrants evaluation for endometrial pathology, so I should keep that triage front and center as I proceed [^114WRQ4V] [^1139NJK9].

> I will now examine hormonal contraception as a common cause of spotting. Combined hormonal contraceptives frequently cause unscheduled bleeding or spotting, especially in the first 3–6 months; counseling should emphasize expected patterns, correct use, and that these changes are generally not harmful but may be bothersome, with improvement over time or with method adjustments [^114V2e71] [^117LhHN2]. Wait, let me verify the ring data specifically: etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring labeling reports breakthrough bleeding/spotting in roughly 7–12% of cycles early on, aligning with counseling guidance that irregularities often resolve with continued use or a short hormone-free interval if needed [^111z4MAE] [^114V2e71].

> Next, I should review progestin-only methods. With implants, injectables, and progestin-only pills, spotting and light bleeding are common, particularly in the first year; counseling and reassurance reduce discontinuation, and NSAIDs can be used short term for bothersome spotting or light bleeding, though heavy or prolonged bleeding warrants evaluation for underlying pathology [^113UhAA6] [^111XEQbt] [^115Hr3n5]. I should double-check LNG-IUD specifics: labeling notes increased bleeding/spotting early that tends to improve over time, and NSAIDs are a reasonable first-line for light bleeding or spotting, with careful assessment if patterns change significantly [^115ig1Ri] [^112qgRC9].

> Let me consider pregnancy-related etiologies. In early pregnancy, spotting is common and often benign, but I need to correlate with timing and associated symptoms; spotting alone in the first trimester is not strongly associated with miscarriage, whereas heavy bleeding with pain confers higher risk, and bleeding without nausea between 6 and 8 weeks carries the greatest risk of loss, so I should tailor counseling accordingly and avoid over- or under-calling risk [^112zUSiF] [^1147cU8g]. But wait, what if the patient used emergency contraception? Spotting after emergency contraception is not unusual and does not reliably predict success or failure, so I should not overinterpret it [^112xQpxE].

> I need to check menopausal and genitourinary syndrome of menopause contributions. GSM can present with spotting, especially post-coital, due to atrophic mucosa; low-dose vaginal estrogen is effective, and importantly, any postmenopausal bleeding or spotting warrants prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology with ultrasound and/or biopsy rather than empiric treatment [^117T3jjC] [^114WRQ4V]. Hold on, I should verify the guidance on progestogen with low-dose vaginal estrogen: the Endocrine Society advises against routine progestogen coadministration with low-dose vaginal estrogen, but still mandates evaluation if spotting or bleeding occurs [^117UbMqL] [^115uU3Kh].

> Let me review iatrogenic and procedural causes. Energy-based vaginal devices can cause immediate post-procedure spotting and discharge, and vaginal rings may rarely adhere or cause local erosion or ulceration with spotting; I should counsel on expected effects and red flags for complications requiring removal or further care [^115GfMSw] [^1147XtUN] [^116rKhrt]. I should confirm that most EBD-related adverse effects are minor and short-term, though long-term data are limited, which shapes consent and follow-up planning [^115GfMSw].

> Next, I should review structural and pathologic causes that can masquerade as "just spotting". Cervical polyps, ectropion, and friable lesions can bleed lightly; cesarean scar defect (niche) can cause postmenstrual spotting and may respond to LNG-IUS or surgical repair; and rare vaginal masses or vascular lesions can present with intermittent spotting, so persistent or unexplained spotting deserves targeted exam and imaging [^114izaKn] [^111EXkGA] [^1154m1Uy] [^111Z9Cda]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost attributed all postmenstrual spotting to niche, but I should remember endometrial polyps and fibroids as well, especially in patients with risk factors or abnormal patterns [^111XEQbt].

> I will now examine special populations. In prepubertal girls, any vaginal bleeding is abnormal and warrants evaluation for trauma, sexual abuse, foreign body, or rare vaginal lesions; case series document benign entities like Müllerian papilloma or cysts presenting with spotting, reinforcing the need for careful exam under anesthesia when indicated [^116Xsdp4] [^114boAKM] [^115nsHY7]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent spotting in adolescents can also reflect foreign bodies or nontraditional menstrual products, which have been reported as causes of ongoing bleeding [^116TTn1m].

> Let me first confirm the postmenopausal evaluation pathway. Any spotting or bleeding mandates transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling if indicated; tamoxifen users require heightened vigilance given increased endometrial cancer risk, and rapid evaluation of spotting is specifically recommended in this group [^114WRQ4V] [^116EQNV5]. I should double-check that routine screening ultrasound or biopsy in asymptomatic tamoxifen users is not advised, but symptomatic bleeding triggers evaluation [^116EQNV5].

> Next, I should review management principles by etiology. For contraceptive-related spotting, reassurance, correct use counseling, and time often suffice; a short hormone-free interval of 3–4 days can help with breakthrough bleeding on extended or continuous regimens, and NSAIDs can reduce bleeding days in some contexts, though I must balance this against contraceptive effectiveness and avoid frequent interruptions [^114V2e71] [^117LhHN2]. For GSM-related spotting, treat atrophy with moisturizers, lubricants, or low-dose vaginal estrogen while still evaluating any postmenopausal bleeding per protocol; for niche-related postmenstrual spotting, LNG-IUS has durable superiority over hysteroscopic resection at 36 months in randomized data, which can guide shared decision-making [^115uU3Kh] [^114izaKn]. I need to ensure I also address modifiable contributors like STIs, thyroid dysfunction, or medication interactions when patterns change unexpectedly [^111XEQbt].

> I should confirm red flags and thresholds for escalation. Heavy bleeding, bleeding with pain, persistent spotting beyond 3 weeks, or new-onset postmenopausal bleeding warrant prompt evaluation; in pregnancy, heavy first-trimester bleeding with pain increases miscarriage risk, and in the third trimester any bleeding, including spotting, with pain or contractions requires urgent obstetric assessment for placenta previa or abruption [^112zUSiF] [^115cRe12] [^114VzY9J]. Let me reconsider early pregnancy nuances: spotting alone is common and not strongly predictive of loss, but bleeding without nausea between 6 and 8 weeks is a high-risk signal that justifies closer follow-up and counseling [^1147cU8g].

> Finally, I need to ensure counseling is concrete and reference-aligned. Patients should track bleeding days and characteristics, understand expected patterns with their method, and know when to contact a clinician; standardizing how we ask about pattern, flow, and duration improves communication and aligns with research conventions, facilitating better longitudinal care and method satisfaction [^113abpTx] [^114V2e71]. Hold on, I should verify that enhanced counseling about expected bleeding changes reduces discontinuation across several hormonal methods, which supports proactive education at initiation and follow-up visits [^117LhHN2] [^113nifKt].

Vaginal spotting is **light bleeding** that does not require sanitary protection and is common in early pregnancy, with hormonal contraception, or during perimenopause. It is usually benign but can signal **early pregnancy, hormonal fluctuations, or cervical irritation**. Persistent, heavy, or postmenopausal spotting warrants evaluation to exclude infection, cervical or endometrial pathology, or malignancy [^114WRQ4V]. Management is cause-specific: reassurance for early pregnancy or hormonal contraception, treat infections, and investigate persistent or postmenopausal cases with exam, Pap, STI testing, ultrasound, and endometrial biopsy as indicated [^1139NJK9].

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A thorough evaluation includes **history, physical examination, and targeted testing** to identify the cause and guide management [^114fDRGz].

---

### History

History should document the **onset, duration, and frequency** of spotting; associated symptoms such as pain, fever, or discharge; menstrual history, including cycle regularity and contraceptive use; pregnancy status and related symptoms; and any recent sexual activity, trauma, or procedures. Also review medical history, including medications, comorbidities, and prior gynecologic conditions [^113abpTx].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a **speculum examination** to assess the cervix and vagina for lesions, polyps, or infection, and a bimanual examination to evaluate uterine size, tenderness, and adnexal masses [^notfound].

---

### Diagnostic tests

- **Pregnancy test**: Rule out pregnancy in all reproductive-age patients [^notfound].
- **Cervical cytology (Pap smear)**: Screen for cervical dysplasia or cancer [^notfound].
- **STI screening**: Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis [^notfound].
- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Evaluate endometrial thickness, polyps, fibroids, or structural abnormalities [^1139NJK9].
- **Endometrial biopsy**: Indicated for postmenopausal spotting or persistent irregular bleeding to exclude hyperplasia or malignancy [^114WRQ4V].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Physiological spotting**: Reassurance and observation [^notfound].
- **Hormonal contraception**: Adjust dosage, switch formulation, or add estrogen if needed [^1146yokm].
- **Infections**: Antibiotic or antifungal therapy [^notfound].
- **Structural lesions**: Polypectomy, fibroid removal, or surgical intervention [^114izaKn].
- **Persistent or postmenopausal spotting**: Endometrial biopsy, imaging, and specialist referral [^114WRQ4V] [^116EQNV5].

---

## Potential complications and risks

While often benign, vaginal spotting can signal **serious conditions**:

- **Early pregnancy loss**: Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy [^112zUSiF] [^115yjFPR].
- **Infections**: PID, infertility, chronic pelvic pain [^113sdd9D].
- **Malignancy**: Cervical or endometrial cancer [^114WRQ4V] [^112UFtEB].
- **Anemia**: Chronic or heavy spotting [^113fAe6H].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Effective counseling should explain normal versus abnormal spotting, highlight red flags (heavy bleeding, pain, fever, or postmenopausal bleeding), and reinforce adherence to contraceptive regimens. It should also emphasize **prompt medical evaluation** for persistent or concerning symptoms [^114V2e71] [^114fDRGz].

---

Vaginal spotting is **common and usually benign**, but persistent, heavy, or postmenopausal spotting requires evaluation to exclude serious pathology. A structured approach — history, exam, and targeted testing — enables accurate diagnosis and appropriate management, with counseling to set expectations and ensure timely care.

### Is the female G-spot truly a distinct anatomic entity? [^115vTT1m]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The existence of an anatomically distinct female G-spot is controversial. Reports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth.

Aim

The aim of this article was to provide an overview of the evidence both supporting and refuting the existence of an anatomically distinct female G-spot.

Methods

PubMed search for articles published between 1950 and 2011 using key words "G-spot", "Grafenberg spot", "vaginal innervation", "female orgasm", "female erogenous zone", and "female ejaculation". Clinical trials, meeting abstracts, case reports, and review articles that were written in English and published in a peer-reviewed journal were selected for analysis.

Main Outcome Measure

The main outcome measure of this article was to assess any valid objective data in the literature that scientifically evaluates the existence of an anatomically distinct G-spot.

Results

The literature cites dozens of trials that have attempted to confirm the existence of a G-spot using surveys, pathologic specimens, various imaging modalities, and biochemical markers. The surveys found that a majority of women believe a G-spot actually exists, although not all of the women who believed in it were able to locate it. Attempts to characterize vaginal innervation have shown some differences in nerve distribution across the vagina, although the findings have not proven to be universally reproducible. Furthermore, radiographic studies have been unable to demonstrate a unique entity, other than the clitoris, whose direct stimulation leads to vaginal orgasm.

Conclusions

Objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for the existence of an anatomical site that could be related to the famed G-spot. However, reliable reports and anecdotal testimonials of the existence of a highly sensitive area in the distal anterior vaginal wall raise the question of whether enough investigative modalities have been implemented in the search of the G-spot.

### Who's afraid of the G-spot? [^113K7R5d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

No controversy can be more controversial than that regarding the existence of the G-spot, an anatomical and physiological entity for women and many scientists, yet a gynecological UFO for others.

Methods

The pros and cons data have been carefully reviewed by six scientists with different opinions on the G-spot. This controversy roughly follows the Journal of Sexual Medicine Debate held during the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Congress in Florence in the February of 2009.

Main Outcome Measure

To give to The Journal of Sexual Medicine's reader enough data to form her/his own opinion on an important topic of female sexuality.

Results

Expert #1, who is JSM's Controversy section editor, reviewed histological data from the literature demonstrating the existence of discrete anatomical structures within the vaginal wall composing the G-spot. He also found that this region is not a constant, but can be highly variable from woman to woman. These data are supported by the findings discussed by Expert #2, dealing with the history of the G-spot and by the fascinating experimental evidences presented by Experts #4 and #5, showing the dynamic changes in the G-spot during digital and penile stimulation. Experts #3 and #6 argue critically against the G-spot discussing the contrasting findings so far produced on the topic.

Conclusion

Although a huge amount of data (not always of good quality) have been accumulated in the last 60 years, we still need more research on one of the most challenging aspects of female sexuality.

### Bleeding patterns associated with oral contraceptive use: a review of the literature [^1128VF59]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

The regulation of vaginal bleeding is an important effect impacting the choice of contraceptive methods. However, comparing vaginal bleeding control and disturbance between various contraceptive studies is often limited by the lack of uniformity in the analysis and reporting of the bleeding patterns. In 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for the standardized collection, analysis and reporting of bleeding associated with contraceptives based on 90-day reference periods. We systematically reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE for all articles reporting bleeding data by reference periods in healthy women using oral contraception. Overall, 17 publications between 1986 and September 2006 were included for review. There was marked variability in the reporting of bleeding data with most studies reporting a few selected bleeding parameters. However, these studies showed, in general, that oral contraceptive users have the greatest bleeding (i.e., results in the highest number of bleeding/spotting days) during the first reference period which decreases by Reference Period 4. Reporting of the bleeding/spotting data using the WHO recommendations may be useful in objectively comparing vaginal bleeding patterns among different oral contraceptive products.

### The G-spot: a modern gynecologic myth [^113fJxZa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

The G-spot is an allegedly highly erogenous area on the anterior wall of the human vagina. Since the concept first appeared in a popular book on human sexuality in 1982, the existence of the spot has become widely accepted, especially by the general public. This article reviews the behavioral, biochemical, and anatomic evidence for the reality of the G-spot, which includes claims about the nature of female ejaculation. The evidence is far too weak to support the reality of the G-spot. Specifically, anecdotal observations and case studies made on the basis of a tiny number of subjects are not supported by subsequent anatomic and biochemical studies.

### Endometrial safety of ospemifene: results of the phase 2 / 3 clinical development program [^112A2sBu]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding

Vaginal bleeding or spotting was reported in 10 of 851 women (1.2%) with an intact uterus in the ospemifene 60 mg/day group (incidence rate, 2.17 per 100 patient-years) and in 5 of 543 women (0.9%) in the placebo group (incidence rate, 2.72 per 100 patient-years; P = 0.7; Table 3). One of 391 women who had had a hysterectomy in the ospemifene 60 mg/day group experienced a TEAE related to vaginal spotting; this event occurred on day 56 of treatment and was not associated with vaginal lesions on visual inspection on day 79. None of the vaginal bleeding or spotting TEAEs led to discontinuation.

TABLE 3
Incidence rates of vaginal bleeding for ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo

Endometrial thickness

The mean (SD) increase in endometrial thickness based on TVUS was 0.51 (1.5) versus 0.06 (1.2) mm at 12 weeks, 0.56 (1.6) versus 0.05 (1.3) mm at 6 months, and 0.81 (1.5) versus 0.07 (1.2) mm at 12 months for participants in the ospemifene and placebo groups, respectively. The differences between participants receiving ospemifene and participants receiving placebo were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.001, Welch's test) at all three evaluations.

We assessed for a possible association between endometrial thickness and vaginal bleeding, which demonstrated no statistically significant correlation (ospemifene 60 mg/day: Spearman ρ = 0.0625, P = 0.2527; placebo: Spearman ρ = 0.3152, P = 0.0847; Table 4). One woman with vaginal bleeding and endometrial thickness greater than 10 mm had a diagnosis of endometrial polyp with simple hyperplasia without atypia.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol [^115vMtSk]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

What should I know about my period when using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring?

When you use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unplanned bleeding. Unplanned bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Unplanned bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use, but may also occur after you have been using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue using the ring on schedule. If the unplanned bleeding or spotting is heavy or lasts for more than a few days, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider.

What if I miss my regular scheduled period when using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring?

Some women miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. Consider the possibility that you may be pregnant if:

you miss a period and etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring was out of the vagina for more than 3 hours during the 3 weeks (21 days) of ring use
you miss a period and waited longer than 1 week to insert a new ring
you have followed the instructions and you miss 2 periods in a row
you have left etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in place for longer than 4 weeks (28 days)

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring.

### Association between first-trimester vaginal bleeding and miscarriage [^112zUSiF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between first-trimester bleeding and miscarriage, setting aside bleeding at time of loss.

Methods

Women enrolled in a community-based pregnancy cohort study before or during early pregnancy. Detailed first-trimester bleeding data were collected by telephone interview. Bleeding episodes proximal to miscarriage (within 4 days) were excluded. We used discrete-time hazard models to evaluate the association between bleeding and miscarriage. Models were adjusted for maternal age, prior miscarriage, and smoking. Exploratory regression tree analysis was used to evaluate the relative importance of other bleeding characteristics (duration, associated pain, color, timing).

Results

Of the 4,510 participants, 1,204 (27%) reported some first-trimester vaginal bleeding or spotting, and 517 miscarriages were observed. Eight percent of those with bleeding reported heavy bleeding episodes. When we evaluated any bleeding, including episodes of only spotting, the unadjusted relative odds ratio (OR) of miscarriage for women with bleeding (n = 1,204) was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.3). However, women who reported heavy bleeding (n = 97) had nearly three times the risk of miscarriage compared with women without bleeding during the first trimester (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.9–4.6). Adjustment for covariates had little effect on estimates. Further analyses suggested that women with heavy bleeding accompanied by pain were the group accounting for most of the elevated risk.

Conclusion

Heavy bleeding in the first trimester, particularly when accompanied by pain, is associated with higher risk of miscarriage. Spotting and light episodes are not, especially if lasting only 1–2 days.

### Clinical consensus statement: vaginal energy-based devices [^1147XtUN]. Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

Vaginal energy-based devices (EBD) — safety considerations: All 6 drafted statements on the safety of vulvovaginal EBD therapy achieved consensus, and although serious adverse events have been reported, these incidents are relatively infrequent in the short term for menopausal dyspareunia, VVA, or vaginal dryness; based on short-term data, EBD therapies have a favorable safety profile, but long-term sequelae are unknown, with potential adverse events including increased vaginal discharge, spotting, bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infection, and rarely scarring or burning, and the effects on existing cervical pathology or development of cervical stenosis are unknown with no evidence supporting EBD for pelvic irradiation–induced vaginitis.

5.9	Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while the vaginal system is inserted is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding/spotting that occurs during the dose-free week when the vaginal system is out is considered "scheduled" bleeding.

Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Females using ANNOVERA may experience unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first month of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on ANNOVERA, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Based on subject diaries from the two clinical efficacy trials of ANNOVERA [see Clinical Trial Experience (6.1)], 5–10% of females experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. The average number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, in Treatment Cycles 1 to 13 for those females who experienced unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, was 1 day or less per cycle. A total of 41 subjects (1.7%) discontinued use due to menstrual disorders including metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, and abnormal withdrawal bleeding.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Females who are not pregnant and use ANNOVERA may experience amenorrhea. Based on subject diary data from two clinical trials for up to 13 cycles, amenorrhea occurred in 3–5% of females per cycle using ANNOVERA and in 0.9% of females in all 13 cycles.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (removed vaginal system for > 2 hours during the first 21 days or does not replace after 7 days of vaginal system- free period), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform a pregnancy test. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses 2 consecutive periods, perform a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy.

Some females may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping ANNOVERA, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.10	Depression

Carefully observe females with a history of depression and discontinue ANNOVERA if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of CHCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL DOSING REGIMENS

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Early pregnancy loss — confirmation and management states that early pregnancy loss during the first trimester is commonly known as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion; because many are unable to establish prenatal care until after the first trimester, providers of SRH care should be able to identify signs and symptoms of early pregnancy loss and be equipped to provide appropriate treatment or referrals, and all pregnant persons should receive information about signs and symptoms and be given instructions to report concerns for further evaluation; providers can confirm early pregnancy loss by reviewing medical history, identifying signs and symptoms such as vaginal spotting or bleeding with or without pain and bleeding and/or passage of tissue, and/or by conducting a physical exam that may include a pelvic ultrasound and quantitative β-hCG testing; pregnancy loss can be managed expectantly, with medications, or with uterine aspiration, with expectant management essentially "wait and watch" with no medical interventions; persons experiencing pregnancy loss may benefit from additional social support and providers can assess need and refer to appropriate counseling or supportive services.

PET/CT revealed focal hot F-FDG uptake in the fundus portion of the uterine cavity, and pathology of hysteroscopic dilation and curettage showed endometrioid intraepithelial neoplasia of uterine endometrium, an endometrial precancer. This case points to the significance of F-FDG PET/CT in determining the dilation and curettage site for the postmenopausal women with abnormal vaginal spotting. Increased F-FDG activity in the region of the uterus must be investigated to determine the possibilities of primary malignancies, metastases, and benign diseases.

### Recommendations for standardization of bleeding data analyses in contraceptive studies [^113abpTx]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

To address limitations that exist with existing definitions of menstrual bleeding changes that occur with contraceptive methods, we assembled a panel to develop new recommendations for standardization of bleeding data analyses associated with contraceptive use to better inform users, clinicians, investigators, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies. We propose three criteria for assessing bleeding outcomes: pattern, flow, and duration. The descriptors within each criterion depend on whether the contraceptive is designed to result in a predictable or unpredictable bleeding pattern. Predictable pattern outcomes quantify days of scheduled, unscheduled and no bleeding, while unpredictable pattern outcomes assess frequency. Flow is quantified based on patient comparisons to their typical flow when not using contraception, with spotting representing no menstrual products use. Duration of a prolonged bleeding and/or spotting episode is more than 7 days. Studies should assess bleeding characteristics for a minimum of 12 months for 21/7, 24/4, extended cycle or continuous regimens, two years for injectables, and the full duration of use for long-acting contraceptives. Describing pattern, flow and duration as independent categories allows a fuller understanding of the bleeding outcomes and better future assessments of acceptability and continuation. Standardization of outcomes permits better comparison between studies and data synthesis; standardization will also improve the ability of clinicians and patients to understand differences between products.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) management — For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly, and for women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. For women without a history of hormone-(estrogen) dependent cancers whose GSM symptoms, including vulvovaginal atrophy, persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, we recommend low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer whose symptomatic GSM does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop GSM symptoms that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest adding low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, and for women using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, we suggest against adding a progestogen (ie, no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). For women using vaginal estrogen therapy who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, we recommend prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology.

Table 1
Types of bleeding episodes experienced from menarche to menopause

Definition of adequate menstrual hygiene management

Women and adolescent girls are using a clean menstrual management material to absorb or collect menstrual blood, that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of a menstrual period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and having access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials. They understand the basic facts linked to the menstrual cycle and how to manage it with dignity and without discomfort or fear.

The types of bleeding experienced over the life course

There are numerous types of vaginal bleeding experienced by girls and women. Some are part of a healthy reproductive cycle over the life course, and others are linked to specific disease conditions. The majority of girls and women will experience monthly menstruation. Given the declining age of puberty (and menarche) and decreasing fertility rates in many parts of the world, the number of years during which a girl or woman will experience monthly menstrual bleeding has expanded along with the number of episodes. If the average girl reaches menarche around age 12, and the average age of menopause is 51–52 years old, that is over 40 years of monthly bleeding (480 months, estimated 2400 menstrual-related bleeding days for average cycle length of 5 days), with exceptions for disrupted menstruation due to stress, travel, nutrition, pregnancy and breast feeding (although many pregnancies include spotting). A proportion of those will experience some form of menorrhagia or abnormal bleeding, which can include spotting throughout the month, episodes of very heavy and painful bleeding or months with no bleeding. Women are likely to experience episodes of bleeding for 4–6 weeks after a miscarriage and 4 weeks postpartum. This has particular significance for those in LMIC with high fertility rates (ie, multiple pregnancies and/or miscarriages). In addition, it is estimated that 5%–15% of women of reproductive age globally have abnormal uterine bleeding. Episodes of vaginal bleeding may occur prior to menarche, occur during perimenopauseand may occur postmenopause due to illness conditions.

### The influence of vaginal bleeding on the sexual behavior of urban, hispanic women and men [^113235te]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

Irregular menstrual bleeding associated with use of hormonal contraceptives is a leading cause of contraception discontinuation. If bleeding disrupts sexual activity, this could contribute to contraceptive discontinuation. The impact of bleeding on sexual activities other than intercourse is unknown. A self-administered questionnaire in Spanish or English was used to collect information on demographics and the practice of various sexual behaviors during times of vaginal bleeding or spotting. The questionnaire was offered consecutively to 86 men and 75 women attending urban family-planning and young men's clinics. The men and women were approached individually, not as couples. Women reported a mean age of 25 years, a wide range of educational attainment, described themselves as mostly Hispanic (89%), and most chose the Spanish version of the questionnaire (67%). Men also described themselves as mostly Hispanic (80%), and reported a similar range of educational attainment, but were younger (mean age of 21, p < 0.001), and were less likely to choose the Spanish version of the questionnaire (23%, p < 0.001). Kissing, breast touching, and receiving non-genital touching did not change during bleeding or spotting. Forty-five percent of women reported usually receiving genital touching, which declined to 6% during bleeding and to 10% during spotting (p < 0.001). Similar proportions of women reported usually giving genital touching to their partner (50%) during bleeding (41%) or spotting (44%). Men also reported usually giving less genital touching to their partner, but no change in receiving genital touching during bleeding or spotting. Forty percent of women reported usually receiving oral sex, which declined to 4% during spotting or to 0% bleeding (p < 0.001). Forty-two percent of women reported usually giving oral sex, which declined to 23% during bleeding and to 35% during spotting (p = 0.06). Fifty percent of women and 68% of men reported engaging in vaginal intercourse. Among women, reported intercourse declined to 7% during bleeding and to 26% during spotting (p < 0.001). Among men, reported intercourse declined to 19% during bleeding and to 23% during spotting (p < 0.001). The presence of vaginal bleeding or spotting is associated with decreases in genital sexual behaviors among urban, Hispanic women and men. Such disruptions in sexual behavior could contribute to contraceptive discontinuation.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using ZAFEMY. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding.

In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of ZAFEMY in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)] in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued ZAFEMY at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Table 2 summarizes the proportion of subjects who experienced unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding/spotting by treatment cycle.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

In the event of amenorrhea, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one patch or started the patch on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of hormonal contraceptive use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.10 Hormonal Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue ZAFEMY use if pregnancy is confirmed.

Administration of CHCs should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Vaginal bleeding

Participants with any of the following terms were included in the statistical analysis for vaginal bleeding: coital bleeding, postmenopausal hemorrhage, genital hemorrhage, vaginal hemorrhage, uterine hemorrhage, metrorrhagia, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, bleeding anovulatory, menorrhagia, and polymenorrhagia. Cases having a higher-level group term of "menstrual cycle and uterine bleeding disorders" were also included.

For all adverse events (AEs), if a woman had more than one TEAE that coded to the same preferred term, the woman was counted only once for that preferred term. Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency in the ospemifene group. Post–endometrial biopsy bleeding/spotting cases (with the preferred term "postprocedural hemorrhage") were not included.

### Effect of hormonal emergency contraception on bleeding patterns [^112xQpxE]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

Spotting following the use of emergency contraception is not unusual, nor is anxiety in women waiting to see if the treatment has worked. It is not known whether such spotting should bring worry or relief. We, therefore, wished to see if there was any correlation between bleeding pattern and treatment outcome. Using data from a large multicenter efficacy trial, we examined bleeding patterns post-emergency contraception. The earlier in the cycle the pills were taken, the more likely the next bleed was to be early and the less likely it was to be on time. There was no observable difference in spotting rates between women who got pregnant and those who did not. The occurrence of spotting did not influence whether the next period was lighter or heavier.

### The "G-spot" is not a structure evident on macroscopic anatomic dissection of the vaginal wall [^116Hk6BT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists in the literature regarding the presence or absence of an anatomic "G-spot". However, few studies have examined the detailed topographic or histologic anatomy of the putative G-spot location.

Aim

To determine the anatomy of the anterior vaginal wall and present detailed, systematic, accessible findings from female cadaveric dissections to provide anatomic clarity with respect to this location.

Methods

Systematic anatomic dissections were performed on 13 female cadavers (32–97 years old, 8 fixed and 5 fresh) to characterize the gross anatomy of the anterior vaginal wall. Digital photography was used to document dissections. Dissection preserved the anterior vaginal wall, urethra, and clitoris. In 9 cadavers, the vaginal epithelial layer was reflected to expose the underlying urethral wall and associated tissues. In 4 cadavers, the vaginal wall was left intact before preservation. Once photographed, 8 specimens were transversely sectioned for macroscopic inspection and histologic examination.

Outcomes

The presence or absence of a macroscopic anatomic structure at detailed cadaveric pelvis dissection that corresponds to the previously described G-spot and gross anatomic description of the anterior vaginal wall.

Results

Deep to the lining epithelium of the anterior vaginal wall is the urethra. There is no macroscopic structure other than the urethra and vaginal wall lining in the location of the putative G-spot. Specifically, there is no apparent erectile or "spongy" tissue in the anterior vaginal wall, except where the urethra abuts the clitoris distally.

Clinical Implications

The absence of an anatomic structure corresponding to the putative G-spot helps clarify the controversy on this subject.

Strengths and Limitations

Limitations to this study include limited access to specimens immediately after death and potential for observational bias. In addition, age, medical history, and cause of death are not publishable for privacy reasons. However, it is one of the most thorough and complete anatomic evaluations documenting the anatomic detail of the anterior vaginal wall.

Conclusion

The G-spot, in its current description, is not identified as a discrete anatomic entity at macroscopic dissection of the urethra or vaginal wall. Further insights could be provided by histologic study. Hoag N, Keast JR, O'Connell HE. The "G-Spot" Is Not a Structure Evident on Macroscopic Anatomic Dissection of the Vaginal Wall.

### The use of "Natural" substances for menstrual hygiene: a case report of an embedded vaginal sea sponge [^116TTn1m]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In early adolescence, irregular menstrual bleeding patterns are common and are frequently due to anovulatory cycles or bleeding disorders. As such, the diagnosis of a vaginal foreign body might initially be missed.

Case

We describe a 14-year-old adolescent female presenting with ongoing irregular menstrual spotting despite reassuring laboratory workup and ultrasonography. She was found to have an embedded vaginal sea sponge eroding through the vaginal wall. On further discussion, she reported using a natural sea sponge for menstrual blood absorption.

Summary and Conclusion

In cases of persistent vaginal spotting, vaginal foreign body should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Use of nontraditional menstrual hygiene products could lead to medical complications and negative health outcomes in adolescents.

### Vaginal bleeding and nausea in early pregnancy as predictors of clinical pregnancy loss [^1147cU8g]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although nausea and vaginal bleeding are commonly experienced in early pregnancy, their prognostic value in predicting clinical pregnancy loss is not well understood.

Objective

This study aimed to understand whether timing of bleeding and nausea symptoms can be used to predict risk of pregnancy loss among women with ultrasound-confirmed pregnancies.

Study Design

A cohort of 701 women with clinically confirmed pregnancies and 1 to 2 previous pregnancy losses were preconceptionally enrolled in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial (2006–2012). Participants completed daily symptom diaries from 2 to 8 weeks' gestation and were prospectively monitored for detection of pregnancy loss. The risk of pregnancy loss was estimated for each observed bleeding and nausea pattern, and positive and negative predictive values for each pattern were calculated.

Results

Among 701 women, 211 (30.1%) reported any vaginal bleeding, and 639 (91.2%) reported any nausea. Most bleeding experienced by women was spotting and contained within a single episode. Within 2 to < 4, 4 to < 6, and 6 to 8 weeks' gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred in 5.9% (41) (5.7% live birth, 7.1% clinical pregnancy loss), 14.6% (102) (13.9% live birth, 18.6% clinical pregnancy loss), and 20.8% (146) (18.4% live birth, 32.4% clinical pregnancy loss) of women, respectively. Within the same gestational periods, nausea was reported in 22.7% (159) (23.2% live birth, 20.4% clinical pregnancy loss), 65.9% (462) (67.5% live birth, 58.4% clinical pregnancy loss), and 87.0% (610) (90.6% live birth, 69.0% clinical pregnancy loss) of women. Women who had bleeding without nausea between 6 and 8 weeks' gestation (3.6% prevalance) had the greatest risk of clinical pregnancy loss (risk difference = 56.1%; 95% confidence interval, 37.6–74.7), a positive predictive value of 68.0% (49.7%, 86.3%), negative predictive value of 85.8% (83.2%, 88.4%), positive likelihood ratio of 11.1 (2.04, 20.1), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.86 (0.79, 0.93). Nausea and bleeding are clinical factors that predicted clinical pregnancy loss (area under the curve, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.88) similar to age, body mass index, blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio (area under the curve, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.88) measured preconceptionally.

Conclusion

Women experiencing bleeding without nausea between 6 and 8 weeks' gestation had an increased risk of clinical pregnancy loss. Bleeding and nausea were not predictive risk factors of clinical pregnancy loss prior to 6 weeks' gestation.

5.11 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N = 1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1–13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N = 1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N = 512).

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.

If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.12 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion

There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal (Enilloring) [^1144nNWt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you have breast cancer now or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use hormonal birth control methods may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What should I know about my period when using EnilloRing?

When you use EnilloRing you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unplanned bleeding. Unplanned bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Unplanned bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of EnilloRing use, but may also occur after you have been using EnilloRing for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue using the ring on schedule. If the unplanned bleeding or spotting is heavy or lasts for more than a few days, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider.

What if I miss my regular scheduled period when using EnilloRing?

Some women miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. Consider the possibility that you may be pregnant if:

1. you miss a period and EnilloRing was out of the vagina for more than 3 hours during the 3 weeks (21 days) of ring use

2. you miss a period and waited longer than 1 week to insert a new ring

3. you have followed the instructions and you miss 2 periods in a row

4. you have left EnilloRing in place for longer than 4 weeks (28 days)

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop using EnilloRing whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop using EnilloRing.

### Extended regimens of the vaginal contraceptive ring: cycle control [^111LobMb]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Oral contraceptives used for extended periods of time have been extensively studied because of their potential benefits; however, there have been few publications on extended regimen of vaginal rings. The aim of this study was to compare the bleeding patterns of women using extended regimens of the vaginal ring or oral contraceptives.

Study Design

Prospective cohort involving 150 women: 75 used vaginal rings that release 120 mcg of etonogestrel and 15 mcg of ethinyl estradiol daily, and 75 took oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol 0.3 mcg and desogestrel 150 mcg. Both groups used their respective contraceptive method over continuous periods of 84 days, followed by a 7-day pause, during 1 year.

Results

The total number of scheduled bleeding and spotting days decreased significantly during the 1-year period of the study for both methods (p = .001), and this decrease was significantly higher for oral contraceptive users. Similarly, during the study period, there was a significant reduction in the total number of unscheduled bleeding and spotting days for both methods (p = .01), but this decrease was significantly higher among vaginal ring users (p = .003).

Conclusion

Vaginal ring used on an extended regimen is a contraceptive method that offers good cycle control.

### Unscheduled vaginal bleeding with progestin-only contraceptive use [^1129TPXU]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Nearly 20% of women using contraception are using progestin-only contraception, including progestin-only pills, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, subdermal etonogestrel implants, and levonorgestrel intrauterine devices. This number will continue to grow with the increased provision of long-acting reversible contraception. Although overall satisfaction among women using progestin-only contraception is high, dissatisfaction and discontinuation may be associated with unscheduled bleeding and spotting. The exact etiology of irregular bleeding associated with progestin-containing contraceptives is not completely understood, yet several mechanisms have been suggested. Several therapies targeting these mechanisms have been evaluated with mixed results. This paper will review the physiology and management of unscheduled bleeding with progestin-containing contraceptives.

### Randomized comparison of bleeding patterns in women using a combined contraceptive vaginal ring or a low-dose combined oral contraceptive on a menstrually signaled regimen [^113X6iC8]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare bleeding patterns for 12 months continuous use of a contraceptive ring [contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR)] and pill [combined oral contraceptive (COC)] on a menstrually signaled regimen and the effectiveness of 4 days "treatment withdrawal" to stop bleeding.

Study Design

Women, 66 to each group, were randomized to continuous use of a CVR (15 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg etonogestrel) or a low-dose pill (20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/100 mcg levonorgestrel) for 360 days on a menstrually signaled regimen. Bleeding/spotting days, daily use of ring or pill, was recorded. Endpoint was the total number of bleeding/spotting days for each method over four 90-day reference periods (RP) plus the analysis of bleeding patterns using modified World Health Organization criteria.

Results

There was a reduction in the mean (± S.D.) number of bleeding/spotting days from RP1 (CVR 14.2 ± 10; pill 16.6 ± 10.9) to RP4 (CVR 8.8 ± 9.6; pill 8.8 ± 9.1). Fifteen percent of CVR and 4% COC users experienced amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding throughout the study. Amenorrhea increased over time (RP1 vs. RP4: CVR 10% vs. 21% and COC 2% vs. 30%). Compliance with the menstrually signaled regimen was poor. Ceasing hormones for 4 days stopped a bleeding episode within 5 days in the majority of episodes and many stopped spontaneously.

Conclusion

Bleeding patterns with continuous use of the CVR and COC are similar and improve over 1 year of use. The unpredictability, but short duration, of bleeding episodes should be stressed during counseling.

Implication

This information for clinicians and women about breakthrough bleeding patterns with use of a CVR or combined pill over 12 months using a menstrually signaled regimen will give women an indication of what to expect with continuous use.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Daysee) [^117BukHA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Women using Daysee may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

When prescribing Daysee, the occurrence of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N = 1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of Daysee subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.

Figure 2: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding

If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Daysee may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

After discontinuation of Daysee, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

### Cavernous hemangioma of the cervix: a rare cause of vaginal bleeding [^111Z9Cda]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Cavernous hemangiomas of the cervix are extremely rare, benign lesions. To date, fewer than 50 cases have been reported. Here reported is a case of cavernous hemangioma of the cervix in a 53-year-old patient with the complaint of postcoital spotting. Most of these lesions are asymptomatic incidental findings, but sometimes, they may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding in the form of menometrorrhagia and postcoital spotting. They should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with vaginal bleeding.

### Efficacy, cycle control, and user acceptability of a novel combined contraceptive vaginal ring [^11148NAP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the contraceptive efficacy, cycle control, tolerability, and user acceptability of a novel combined contraceptive vaginal ring for up to 13 cycles.

Methods

Healthy women requesting contraception were enrolled in this 1-year multicenter study. Each ring released 120 microg of etonogestrel and 15 microg of ethinylestradiol daily, and was used for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week ring-free period.

Results

A total of 2322 women started treatment and so formed the intent-to-treat population. Subjects were followed for 23,298 cycles, equivalent to 1786 woman-years. Compliance was good with 85.6% of cycles in full compliance with specified criteria. In the intent-to-treat population, 21 pregnancies occurred, giving a Pearl Index of 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.73, 1.80). Eleven of the pregnancies were attributable to noncompliance; the Pearl Index for the per-protocol population was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.37, 1.40). The mean incidence of withdrawal bleeding was 98.5% in all cycles. Irregular bleeding occurred in 5.5% of all cycles, and in most women, early or late withdrawal bleeding was restricted to spotting. The ring was well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events; only 2.5% of all discontinuations were device related. The ring was easy to insert and remove and did not interfere with intercourse. Eighty-five percent of women were satisfied with the ring, and 90% would recommend its use to others.

Conclusion

The ring is an effective contraceptive with excellent cycle control that is convenient, well tolerated, and highly acceptable to users.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^113nifKt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Contraceptive implant — counseling and evidence on bleeding patterns states that during contraceptive counseling and before placement, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding and amenorrhea, especially during the first year of use, should be discussed, and that a pooled analysis of data from 11 clinical trials indicates that a significant proportion of ENG implant users had relatively little bleeding. It notes that bleeding or amenorrhea is generally not harmful but might be bothersome, and that enhanced counseling and reassurance have been demonstrated to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives.

### Effects of ospemifene on the female reproductive and urinary tracts: translation from preclinical models into clinical evidence [^116ePCo5]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Treatment of menopausal symptoms by compounds with tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist effects, often called selective estrogen receptor modulators, has been researched as an alternative to the use of estrogen therapy. These structurally diverse molecules elicit tissue-dependent responses in hormone-responsive tissues and organs, exhibiting variations in estrogenic activity in preclinical models of postmenopausal reproductive tissues that may improve postmenopausal women's health (eg, prevention and treatment of breast cancer, osteoporosis, and vulvar and vaginal atrophy).

Methods

This literature review investigates whether preclinical data predicted the clinical effects of ospemifene on female reproductive and urinary tract tissues and compares these findings with the specific vaginal effects of other estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists (tamoxifen, raloxifene, and bazedoxifene) in preclinical and clinical studies. Lasofoxifene, although not currently available, is included because of its unique effects on vaginal tissue.

Results

The response of endometrial and vaginal tissues to estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists can be differentiated using transvaginal ultrasound, endometrial histopathology, cytologic examination of vaginal smears, assessment of physical changes in the vagina, and relief of symptoms associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy (such as dyspareunia).

Conclusions

Available evidence indicates that ospemifene has unique effects on tissue, leading to a favorable long-term profile for the relief of vulvar and vaginal atrophy compared with other estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists (eg, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and bazedoxifene) with no short-term concerns about endometrial safety (based on endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma, endometrial spotting, and endometrial bleeding).

### Vaginal repair of cesarean section scar diverticula that resulted in improved postoperative menstruation [^111EXkGA]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Owing to the increase in cesarean sections (C-sections) worldwide, long-term complications such as postmenstrual spotting, chronic pelvic pain, and C-section scar ectopic pregnancies have created a new medical era of gynecologic disease. A new type of vaginal repair is evaluated to repair C-section diverticulum (CSD) and rebuild the muscular layer to improve symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding and decrease the risk of uterine rupture.

Design

Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

Setting

University hospital.

Patients

A total of 121 patients with CSD diagnoses by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) presented with postmenstrual spotting between June 2012 and March 2015. All patients had undergone at least 1 C-section delivery and had no history of postmenstrual spotting before undergoing C-section.

Intervention

Vaginal excision and suture of CSD.

Measurement and Main Results

The mean duration of menstruation was 14.87 ± 3.46 days preoperatively and decreased to 8.22 ± 2.73 days at 1 month after surgery, 8.89 ± 2.67 days at 3 months after surgery, and 9.02 ± 2.47 days at 6 months after surgery (p < .01). The length, width, depth, and thickness of the remaining muscular layer (TRM) at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months assessed by TVU also improved significantly after surgery (p < .05). However, postoperative menstruation and imaging data did not differ markedly between 3 months and 6 months, suggesting that follow-up at 3 months represents an adequate endpoint for evaluating the effectiveness of surgery. At 6 months, 80.3% of patients (94 of 117) reached ≤ 10 days of menstruation. Further study revealed that a TRM at 6 months of ≥ 8.5 mm measured by TVU (relative risk [RR], 6.418; 95% confidence interval, 1.478–28.443) and an interval between CS and vaginal repair of ≤ 2.5 years (RR, 12.0; 95% CI, 1.541–93.454) were good prognostic factors associated with surgery.

Conclusion

Vaginal repair of CSD improved the symptoms of postmenstrual spotting and anatomically corrected the scars. An interval between C-section and a surgery of ≤ 2.5 years was optimal for vaginal repair, and a TRM at 6 months of ≥ 8.5 mm represented the standard healing of CSD.

### Frequency and management of breakthrough bleeding with continuous use of the transvaginal contraceptive ring: a randomized controlled trial [^1153KtVs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess bleeding patterns with continuous use of the transvaginal contraceptive ring.

Methods

We did a prospective analysis of daily menstrual flow during a 21/7 cycle followed by 6 months of continuous use and institution of a randomized protocol to manage breakthrough bleeding/spotting. Seventy-four women completed the baseline 21/7 phase and were randomized equally into two groups during the continuous phase. Group 1 was instructed to replace the ring monthly on the same calendar day with no ring-free days. Group 2 was instructed to use the same process, but if breakthrough bleeding/spotting occurred for 5 days or more, they were to remove the ring for 4 days, store it, and then reinsert that ring.

Results

Sixty-five women completed the continuous phase with reduced average flow scores in the continuous phase compared with the 21/7 phase (P < .02). Most patients had no to minimal bleeding during continuous use, with group 2 experiencing a statistically greater percentage of days without breakthrough bleeding or spotting (95%) compared with group 1 (89%) (P = .016). Instituting a 4-day hormone-free interval was more (P < .001) effective in resolving breakthrough bleeding/spotting than continuing ring use.

Conclusion

A reduction in bleeding occurred during continuous use with replacement of the transvaginal ring compared with baseline 21/7 use. Continuous vaginal ring use resulted in an acceptable bleeding profile in most patients, reduction in flow, reduction in pelvic pain, and a high continuation rate.

Complete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper pill usage may be found in the Detailed Patient Labeling (" How to Take the Pill " section).

The use of WERATMfor contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers .) The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

(See Discussion of Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease from Oral Contraceptives .)

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Vaginal Müllerian papilloma: an unusual cause of vaginal bleeding in a toddler [^114boAKM]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal bleeding is a rare occurrence in infancy and childhood. It is usually due to trauma, child abuse, foreign bodies, and rarely, a friable botryoid tumor.

Case Summary

We discuss a case of a vaginal müllerian duct papilloma in a 2 year old infant that presented with vaginal bleeding.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the second case reported in the literature of a vaginal müllerian duct papilloma presenting in a toddler. This rare type of tumor has an excellent prognosis when completely excised.

Summary

A 2-year-old female that presented with bloody spotting in the diaper was found to have a vaginal.

### Beyond the G-spot: clitourethrovaginal complex anatomy in female orgasm [^113HfQn9]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

The search for the legendary, highly erogenous vaginal region, the Gräfenberg spot (G-spot), has produced important data, substantially improving understanding of the complex anatomy and physiology of sexual responses in women. Modern imaging techniques have enabled visualization of dynamic interactions of female genitals during self-sexual stimulation or coitus. Although no single structure consistent with a distinct G-spot has been identified, the vagina is not a passive organ but a highly dynamic structure with an active role in sexual arousal and intercourse. The anatomical relationships and dynamic interactions between the clitoris, urethra, and anterior vaginal wall have led to the concept of a clitourethrovaginal (CUV) complex, defining a variable, multifaceted morphofunctional area that, when properly stimulated during penetration, could induce orgasmic responses. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the CUV complex might help to avoid damage to its neural, muscular, and vascular components during urological and gynaecological surgical procedures.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^112yfVyH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance. º If a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated.
If the patient desires LNG-IUD removal, remove the LNG-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the LNG-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. Approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been reported to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review summarized the current body of evidence for treating bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUD use (Supplementary Appendix). RCTs of tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, and UPA for the treatment of bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUDs observed no differences between the treatment and placebo groups in bleeding or spotting over 90 days. A prospective cohort study examining oral estradiol demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding days after 3 months of treatment compared with baseline; however, 68% of patients experienced side effects (e.g. painful or swollen breasts, headache, weight gain, and vaginal complaints) (Certainty of evidence: moderate to high for RCTs and very low for the observational study).

### Levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol (jolessa) [^114oHd3g]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bleeding
Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended-cycle regimen is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven white inert tablets is considered "scheduled" bleeding.

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Females using JOLESSA may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

Before prescribing JOLESSA, advise the woman to weigh the occurrence of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting.

The clinical trial of the efficacy of JOLESSA (91-day cycles) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users. Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding/spotting ≥ 10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study. More JOLESSA subjects, compared to subjects on the comparator 28-day cycle regimen, discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding (7.7% [JOLESSA] vs. 1.8% [28-day cycle regimen]).

### Association between the occurrence of adenomyosis and the clinical outcomes of vaginal repair of cesarean section scar defects: an observational study [^115zj3Wv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Vaginal repair is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that can reduce postmenstrual spotting and repair the uterus to preserve fertility in patients with CSD. Based on the findings of this study, we are cautiously optimistic that adenomyosis might be an adverse factor for the healing of uterine incisions. Randomized double-blind controlled studies are needed to verify the positive correlation between myometrial repair and adenomyosis treatment.

### Bleeding after medication-induced termination of pregnancy with two dosing schedules of mifepristone and misoprostol [^116wUeUz]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examines bleeding pattern following medication-induced termination of pregnancy, comparing two different dosing schedules of mifepristone and misoprostol.

Study Design

Diary information was analyzed from a randomized, multicenter trial in which women used vaginal misoprostol 800 mug either 6–8 or 24 h following 200 mg of oral mifepristone.

Participants and Methods

One thousand eighty women with pregnancies up to 63 days' gestation were recruited for the study; 540 were randomized to the 6- to 8-h dosing schedule, and 540 were randomized to the 24-h dosing schedule. Subjects recorded daily bleeding in a diary over 5 weeks.

Results

Total duration of bleeding ranged from 1 to 54 days, with a median of 7 days. Duration of spotting ranged from 1 to 80 days, with a median of 5 and 6 days (NS) in each of the two groups. Neither duration of bleeding nor duration of spotting were related to interval between mifepristone and misoprostol. Bleeding and spotting durations were not correlated with maternal age or smoking. Increased gestational age was correlated with longer bleeding and spotting times. Nulliparity was associated with longer bleeding time.

Conclusion

Varying the interval between mifepristone and misoprostol in medication abortion does not affect duration or quantity of bleeding.

### Vaginal Müllerian cyst: an unusual cause of vaginal bleeding in a 16-month-old girl [^115nsHY7]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal bleeding in premenarchal girls is always abnormal and its source must be identified for appropriate management. Examination under anesthesia and vaginoscopy are commonly employed for evaluation of the vagina as a source of bleeding, and the examination may occasionally reveal vaginal pathology.

Case

A 16-month-old otherwise healthy girl presented with spotting. Exam under general anesthesia and vaginoscopy revealed a 1-cm polypoid-like lesion overlying the posterior vaginal wall which was excised using the hysteroscope. Pathology revealed a benign Müllerian cyst.

Summary and Conclusion

Vaginal findings of causes of premenarchal bleeding such as Mullerian cysts may be diagnosed and treated with the vaginoscopic approach.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (bekyree) [^116VYX3g]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DAY 1 START

Counting the first day of menstruation as "Day 1", tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 yellow (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days. For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day after taking the last yellow tablet. [If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first white tablet should be taken on the first day of menstruation which begins after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product.]

If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills.

ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, non-functional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If both pregnancy and pathology have been excluded, time or a change to another preparation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.

Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N = 1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1–13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N = 1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N = 512).

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.

If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.12 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion

There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.

5.13 Depression

Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if depression recurs to a serious degree.

### Naproxen or estradiol for bleeding and spotting with the levonorgestrel intrauterine system: a randomized controlled trial [^117M34Lc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether oral naproxen or transdermal estradiol decreases bleeding and spotting in women who are initiating the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.

Study Design

We conducted a randomized controlled trial of naproxen, estradiol, or placebo that was administered over the first 12 weeks of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system use. Participants completed a written bleeding diary. We imputed missing values and performed an intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

There were 129 women who were assigned randomly to naproxen (n = 42 women), estradiol (n = 44 women), or placebo (n = 43 women). The naproxen group was more likely to be in the lowest quartile of bleeding and spotting days compared with placebo (42.9% vs 16.3%; p = 0.03). In the multivariable analysis, the naproxen group had a 10% reduction in bleeding and spotting days (adjusted relative risk, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–0.97) compared with placebo. More frequent bleeding and spotting was observed in the estradiol group (adjusted relative risk, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–1.34).

Conclusion

The administration of naproxen resulted in a reduction in bleeding and spotting days compared with placebo.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117LhHN2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding irregularities usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method. To avoid spotting or bleeding, counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing; for users of contraceptive pills, emphasize consistent pill use. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations that addressed treatments for breakthrough bleeding among women using extended or continuous CHCs. In two separate RCTs in which women were taking either contraceptive pills or using the contraceptive ring continuously for 168 days, women assigned to a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding. Although they noted an initial increase in flow, this was followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later with eventual cessation of flow 11–12 days later. These findings were compared with those among women who continued to use their method without a hormone-free interval, in which a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women with breakthrough bleeding among women using 84 days of hormonally active contraceptive pills, oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) initiated the first day of bleeding and taken for 5 days did not result in any improvement in bleeding compared with placebo (Level of evidence: I, fair, direct).

ADVERSE REACTIONS

See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the two ESTRING controlled studies, discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event was required by 5.4 percent of patients receiving ESTRING and 3.9 percent of patients receiving conjugated estrogens vaginal cream. The most common reasons for withdrawal from ESTRING treatment due to an adverse event were vaginal discomfort and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The adverse events reported with a frequency of 3 percent or greater in the two pivotal controlled studies by patients receiving ESTRING or conjugated estrogens vaginal cream are listed in Table 4.

Postmarketing Experience

Cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body.

Vaginal erosion, vaginal ulceration, adherence of the vaginal ring to the vaginal wall:

Cases of ring adherence to the vaginal wall, making ring removal difficult, have occurred. Some cases have required surgical removal of vaginal rings.
Cases of vaginal erosion and vaginal ulceration that may manifest as vaginal irritation, erythema. abrasion or spotting have occurred.

Vaginal wall ulceration or erosion should be carefully evaluated. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete in order to prevent the ring from adhering to the healing tissue.

Cases of bowel obstruction and vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated.

Cases of hypersensitivity have been reported.

The following additional adverse events were reported at least once by patients receiving ESTRING in the worldwide clinical program, which includes controlled and uncontrolled studies. A causal relationship with ESTRING has not been established.

Body as a Whole: allergic reaction

CNS/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness

Gastrointestinal: enlarged abdomen, vomiting

Metabolic/Nutritional Disorders: weight decrease or increase

Musculoskeletal: arthropathy (including arthrosis)

Psychiatric: depression, decreased libido, nervousness

Reproductive: breast engorgement, breast enlargement, intermenstrual bleeding, genital edema, vulval disorder

Skin/Appendages: pruritus, pruritus ani

Urinary: micturition frequency, urethral disorder

Vascular: thrombophlebitis

Vision: abnormal vision

### Benign vaginal bleeding in 24 prepubertal patients: clinical, biochemical and imaging features [^116Xsdp4]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Premature menarche is an uncommon, benign condition characterized by isolated or recurrent menstrual bleeding in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics.

Methods

We performed an observational retrospective study to further characterize the clinical, biochemical and imaging features of benign prepubertal vaginal bleeding (BPVB). Out of 1037 girls evaluated for precocious puberty over a 5-year period, 24 girls with BPVB were identified based on ≥ 1 episodes of vaginal bleeding, Tanner I or non-progressive Tanner II breast development, and lack of physical findings suggesting genital infection, trauma or foreign body.

Results

Age at presentation ranged from 3 years 2 months to 9 years 11 months. Ten patients (42%) had one episode of vaginal bleeding, six (25%) had two episodes and eight patients (33%) had three or more. First bleeding episode lasted 3 days (range; 1–30 days). Six girls had intermittent spotting for up to 1 year. No breast development was noted in 19 (79%) patients. Minimal breast was present in five girls; early pubic hair was present in 2. LH and FSH were prepubertal; estradiol was > 20 pg/mL in two girls. Pelvic ultrasound, performed in 11 patients, showed pre-pubertal uterus and ovaries without adnexal masses.

Conclusion

Isolated prepubertal vaginal bleeding is typically benign and self-limited, in the absence of sexual precocity signs or other vaginal pathology. Laboratory and imaging studies are generally unrevealing.

### Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: endometrial hyperplasia and irregular bleeding [^117T4GoG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The decline in circulating oestrogen around the time of the menopause often induces unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well being of women. Hormone replacement therapy (both unopposed oestrogen and oestrogen and progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms. In women with an intact uterus, unopposed oestrogen may induce endometrial stimulation and increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The addition of progestogen reduces this risk but may cause unacceptable symptoms, bleeding and spotting which can affect adherence to therapy.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess which hormone replacement therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma with a low rate of abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2003), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003), Current Contents (1993 to January 2003), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2002), Social Sciences Index (1980 to January 2003), PsycINFO (1972 to February 2003) and CINAHL (1982 to January 2003). The search strategy was developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorder and Subfertility Group. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data. In most cases, the corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of unopposed oestrogen therapy, combined continuous oestrogen-progestogen therapy and sequential oestrogen-progestogen therapy with each other and placebo administered over a minimum treatment period of six months. Trials had to assess which regimen was the most protective against the development of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma and/or caused the lowest rate of irregular bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Sixty RCTs were identified. Of these 23 were excluded and seven remain awaiting assessment. The reviewers assessed the thirty included studies for quality, extracted the data independently and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes were estimated. Outcomes analysed included frequency of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, frequency of irregular bleeding and unscheduled biopsies or dilation and curettage, and adherence to therapy.

Main Results

Unopposed moderate or high dose oestrogen therapy when compared to placebo was associated with a significant increase in rates of endometrial hyperplasia with increasing rates at longer duration of treatment and follow up. Odds ratios ranged from (1 RCT; OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 20.9) for 6 months of treatment to (4 RCTs; OR 9.6, 95% CI 5.9 to 15.5) for 24 months treatment and (1 RCT; OR 15.0, 95% CI 9.3 to 27.5) for 36 months of treatment with moderate dose oestrogen (in the PEPI trial, 62% of those who took moderate dose oestrogen had some form of hyperplasia at 36 months compared to 2% of those who took placebo). Irregular bleeding and non adherence to treatment were also significantly more likely under these unopposed oestrogen regimens that increased bleeding with higher dose therapy. Although not statistically significant, there was a 3% incidence (2 RCTs) of hyperplasia in women who took low dose oestrogen compared to no incidence of hyperplasia in the placebo group. The addition of progestogens, either in continuous combined or sequential regimens, helped to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and improved adherence to therapy. At longer duration of treatment, continuous therapy was more effective than sequential therapy in reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. There was evidence of a higher incidence of hyperplasia under long cycle sequential therapy (progestogen given every three months) compared to monthly sequential therapy (progestogen given every month). No increase in endometrial cancer was seen in any of t in any of the treatment groups during the duration (maximum of six years) of these trials. During the first year of therapy irregular bleeding and spotting was more likely in continuous combined therapy than sequential therapy. However, during the second year of therapy bleeding and spotting was more likely under sequential regimens.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is strong and consistent evidence in this review that unopposed oestrogen therapy, at moderate and high doses, is associated with increased rates of endometrial hyperplasia, irregular bleeding and consequent non adherence to therapy. The addition of oral progestogens administered either sequentially or continuously is associated with reduced rates of hyperplasia and improved adherence to therapy. Irregular bleeding is less likely under sequential than continuous therapy during the first year of therapy but there is a suggestion that continuous therapy over long duration is more protective than sequential therapy in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is more likely when progestogen is given every three months in a sequential regimen compared to a monthly progestogen sequential regimen.

### International society for the study of vulvovaginal disease recommendations regarding female cosmetic genital surgery [^1138KHzK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Female genital cosmetic surgeries (FGCSs) and procedures are increasingly being advertised as common, simple, and complication-free, capable of not only improving aesthetic appearance but also increasing self-esteem and sexual pleasure. Guidelines for physicians and clear, scientifically correct information for patients must be made available, to minimize the number of ineffective or deleterious procedures. The International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease positions/recommendations regarding FGCS are as follows:1. There is a wide variation regarding genital normalcy; providers must be able to explain this to women.2. There are no data supporting FGCS including, G-spot augmentation, hymenoplasty, vulvar and perianal bleaching/whitening, vaginal tightening procedures, and other procedures aimed at increasing sexual function.3. Women should not be offered FGCS before the age of 18 years.4. Women undergoing FGCS should be evaluated by a provider with expertise in vulvovaginal diseases, including attention to their psychological, social, and sexual context. Evaluation by an experienced mental health provider should be considered when the motivation for seeking surgery and/or expectations are not clear or realistic.5. Female genital cosmetic surgery is not exempt from complications.6. Informed consent must always be obtained.7. Surgeons performing FGCS should refrain from solicitous advertising or promoting procedures without scientific basis, including on Web sites.8. Surgeons should not perform surgery that they do not agree with and explain their rationale/position when pressured by patients.9. The genital surgeon must be adequately trained in performing FGCS including knowledge of the anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology of the vulva, vagina and adjacent organs.

### The use of hormonal contraceptives in fertility treatments: a committee opinion [^115Hr3n5]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Progestin-only pill (POP) as an alternative — risk profile and reproductive effects indicate that one alternative to combination hormonal contraception in those patients with risk factors for use is the progestin-only pill (POP), and available evidence demonstrates that POP use does not increase the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with menstrual migraines and may be an acceptable alternative. Women with hypertension using a POP have a slightly increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those not using this method, and it is also contraindicated in patients with active or recent (< 5 years) breast cancer. Disadvantages in reproductive medicine include a higher risk of irregular vaginal bleeding and functional ovarian cysts, with approximately 20%-30% of users experiencing intermenstrual bleeding or spotting, which is a common reason for discontinuation and is most frequent on initiation. In a study of 21 women using a POP for at least 6 months, functional cysts were noted in 8 on initial examination, and four of the 13 women without cysts at baseline subsequently developed new functional cysts associated with symptoms in 2; the use of POP before IVF is less likely to suppress cyst formation or premature follicular development.

Bleeding irregularities during injectable use — before DMPA initiation, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during DMPA use. Amenorrhea and spotting or light bleeding are common with DMPA use, heavy or prolonged bleeding can occur, these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome, and spotting, light bleeding, and heavy or prolonged bleeding might decrease with continued DMPA use. For spotting or light bleeding, if clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions including polyps or fibroids.

Spotting or Light Bleeding

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued DMPA use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or discontinuation of DMPA. If the patient wants to continue DMPA use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient wants to discontinue DMPA at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option during days of bleeding may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: º NSAIDs: short-term treatment, 5–7 days

Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding

### Protein expression patterns in primary carcinoma of the vagina [^111rgGLF]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Classification of vaginal and cervical cancer

A total of 23 protein spots were significantly differentially expressed between pairs of 2-DE gels from only vaginal and cervical cancers using both the Mann–Whitney and the t -test (P < 0.05). The expression level of this set of 23 protein spots was used to classify all the samples. Interestingly, all the samples could be correctly classified into three distinct groups (normal tissue, vaginal and cervical cancer), Figure 4

Figure 4
(A) Cluster analysis of normal, vaginal cancer and cervical cancer samples using expression data set from 23 polypeptides. (B) Correspondence analysis plot of same data set; Blue = normal, red = vaginal cancer and green = cervical cancer.

Identification of differentially expressed polypeptides by mass spectrometry

Protein spots with statistically significant variability in the expression pattern between normal vaginal epithelium, cervical and vaginal cancers were selected for identification. Some of these proteins were identified through matching with 2-DE maps of proteins already identified, using bench top MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. One obvious limitation of working with clinical samples is getting sufficient material for detailed analysis. Therefore, the majority of the protein spots in the data sets for cluster analyses could not be easily identified.

Among the protein spots so far identified are high molecular weight Tropomyosin 1, cytokeratins 5, 15 and 17, Apolipoprotein A1, Annexin V, Glutathione- S -transferase. Others are the stress-related proteins, calreticulin, HSP 27 and HSP 70. Some of the identified protein spots are shown in Figure 1.

Case presentation

A 34-year-old nulligravid woman was referred to our academical medical centre with a large vaginal mass. She was seen in the emergency room 1 month earlier with a newly self-discovered mass in the vagina, an incidental finding while showering. She mentioned only a slight feeling of pressure in the vagina before discovering the mass but denied any symptoms of pain or abdominal swelling. She stated to have had intermittent vaginal spotting over the last few weeks.

The patient had no remarkable medical or surgical history, apart from a laparoscopically removed benign ovarian cyst. There was no family history of breast, ovarian or endometrial cancer.

### Differential tissue-specific protein markers of vaginal carcinoma [^111HqTNu]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Fresh-frozen tissue biopsies were subjected to 2-DE and analysed for both qualitative and quantitative differences in the expression of multiple proteins. An average total of 1373 spots were resolved on 25 × 20 cm 2-DE gels, and between 75 and 82% of the spots were matched among all gels. Silver stain was used to visualise gel spots (Figure 1).

Using PDQuest, the protein expression pattern in the different tissue specimens (normal vaginal tissue, vaginal cancer and cervical cancer) was analysed.

Mann–Whitney statistical analysis (P < 0.05) revealed 67 proteins that were differentially expressed in normal vaginal tissue, vaginal cancer and cervical cancer. A similar analysis was carried out on these three groups of samples using Student's t -test, and 94 protein spots differed significantly. The differential analysis takes into consideration both the qualitative and quantitative changes observed between these sets of samples. Furthermore, these two separate datasets correctly classified the three groups of samples using hierarchical cluster analysis.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive counseling for transgender and gender diverse people who were female sex assigned at birth [^114NS38b]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Estrogen-containing contraceptives in TGD individuals, including those on testosterone therapy — anticipated effects, risks, and dosing: Estrogen-containing products, such as oral contraceptive pills, the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring, can be used cyclically or continuously; when used in a cyclic fashion, with 21 or 24 days of hormones followed by a hormone-free interval, most cisgender women will have a withdrawal bleed in the hormone-free interval, whereas continuous or extended cycle use does not have a scheduled withdrawal bleed, and those who use these products continuously may have fewer total days of bleeding or spotting compared to cyclic use. Expert clinical experience suggests that bleeding is unlikely to occur if amenorrheic on testosterone therapy and the products are used continuously [GRADE 2C]. Estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) production from the liver, which binds circulating free testosterone, and combined hormonal contraceptives can also block androgen receptors; use of combined hormonal contraception also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism by three to six times in presumed cisgender women compared to non-use, but the absolute difference is small and has not been considered clinically significant in the absence of other risk factors. Given the lack of data specific to TGD individuals using gender-affirming testosterone in combination with estrogen-containing contraceptives, it is reasonable to consider avoiding these products unless there is a clear benefit for the patient or strong patient preference; if used, providers can consider products with a lower estrogen dose, for example a combined oral contraceptive that contains ethinyl estradiol with a lower daily dose (10–20 μg), although there are no published data to support this decision and lower estradiol doses may lead to increased unscheduled bleeding and it is unclear if there are clinically significant benefits to this approach.

Instructions For Use

Tri-VyLibra Lo

(norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP)

Important Information about taking Tri-VyLibra Lo

Take 1 pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your pill blister pack.
Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) you could get pregnant. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.
If you have trouble remembering to take Tri-VyLibra Lo, talk to your healthcare provider. When you first start taking Tri-VyLibra Lo, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.
You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking Tri-VyLibra Lo. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.
Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see What should I do if I miss any Tri-VyLibra Lo pills? below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.
It is not uncommon to miss a period. However, if you miss a period and have not taken Tri-VyLibra Lo according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Tri-VyLibra Lo.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, take another pill of the same color from your extra pill blister pack. If you do not have an extra pill blister pack, take the next pill in your pill blister pack. Continue taking all your remaining pills in order. Start the first pill of your next pill blister pack the day after finishing your current pill blister pack. This will be 1 day earlier than originally scheduled. Continue on your new schedule.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea for more than 1 day, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use an additional birth control method, like condoms and a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.
Stop taking Tri-VyLibra Lo at least 4 weeks before you have major surgery and do not restart after the surgery without asking your healthcare provider. Be sure to use other forms of contraception (like condoms and spermicide) during this time period.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

In a 12-week clinical trial, 209 postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms were treated with ENJUVIA. Adverse events that occurred in the study at a rate greater than or equal to 5% and greater than placebo, regardless of relationship to study drug, are summarized in Table 8.

In a second 12-week clinical trial, 310 women with symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy were treated (154 women with ENJUVIA 0.3 mg tablets and 156 women with placebo). The only adverse event that occurred at a rate of > 5% was headache; seven patients (4.55%) with ENJUVIA and twelve patients (7.69%) with placebo.

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogen and/or progestin therapy:

Genitourinary system

Changes in vaginal bleeding pattern and abnormal withdrawal bleeding or flow; breakthrough bleeding; spotting; dysmenorrhea; increase in size of uterine leiomyomata; vaginitis, including vaginal candidiasis; change in amount of cervical secretion; changes in cervical ectropion; ovarian cancer; endometrial hyperplasia; endometrial cancer.

### A comparison of 2 methods of vaginal cuff closure during robotic hysterectomy [^111jHhTK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 2 methods of vaginal cuff closure with regard to safety, ease of use, and postoperative outcome.

Methods

All patients undergoing robotic-assisted total hysterectomy by a gynecologic oncologist from July 1, 2010, to July 1, 2011, at Northwestern Memorial Prentice Women's Hospital were included in a retrospective analysis. Providers used either 2–0 monofilament synthetic absorbable suture to close the vaginal cuff in a running fashion, secured with an absorbable suture clip at the angles and then knotted in the middle, or 2–0 absorbable unidirectional barbed suture with a welded-loop closure in a running fashion.

Results

A total of 134 patients underwent robotic-assisted total hysterectomy. The 2–0 tied monofilament closure was used in 58 patients, and the 2–0 barbed knotless closure was used in 76 patients. There were no instances of vaginal cuff dehiscence or vaginal cuff cellulitis. Rates of vaginal spotting and bleeding were comparable between the groups (12.0% spotting in the monofilament suture group vs 13.0% spotting in the barbed suture group). All vaginal cuff bleeding resolved on its own without significant intervention.

Conclusion

The use of either a 2–0 welded-loop unidirectional barbed suture or a 2–0 monofilament absorbable suture to close the vaginal cuff is safe and well tolerated.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114V2e71]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — counseling and management of bleeding irregularities emphasize that bleeding changes generally decrease with continued CHC use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition and, if found, treat the condition or refer for care. If the patient wants treatment, advise the patient to discontinue CHC use (i.e., a hormone-free interval) for 3–4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended CHC method, and a hormone-free interval is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome and usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method, and counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing and, for users of contraceptive pills, consistent pill use.

### Estradiol and levonorgestrel (climara pro) [^113zeCfB]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms in Postmenopausal Women

The efficacy of 0.045 mg estradiol/0.03 mg levonorgestrel administered weekly versus placebo in the relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women was studied in one 12-week clinical trial (n = 183, average age 52.1 ± 4.93, 82 percent Caucasian). The 0.045 mg estradiol/0.03 mg levonorgestrel dosage strength was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the number and severity of moderate to severe hot flushes. See Tables 3 and 4. Climara Pro and the 0.045 mg estradiol/0.03 mg levonorgestrel dosage strength are bioequivalent in terms of estradiol delivery [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

14.2 Effects on the Endometrium in Postmenopausal Women

In a 1-year clinical trial of 412 postmenopausal women (with intact uteri) treated with a continuous regimen of Climara Pro or with an continuous estradiol-only transdermal system, results of evaluable endometrial biopsies show that no hyperplasia was seen with Climara Pro. Table 5 below summarizes these results (Intent-to-Treat populations).

14.3 Effects on Uterine Bleeding or Spotting in Postmenopausal Women

The effects of Climara Pro on uterine bleeding or spotting, as recorded using an interactive voice response system, were evaluated in one 12-month clinical trial. Results are shown in Figure 3.

### Pharmacokinetics and ovarian suppression during use of a contraceptive vaginal ring in normal-weight and obese women [^114Lni28]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Many observational studies indicate higher oral contraceptive failure among obese women, but most clinical trials and physiologic studies do not support these differences. Limited data indicate higher failure rates among obese contraceptive patch users. Data regarding contraceptive vaginal ring performance in obese women are needed.

Study Design

Twenty normal weight (body mass index [BMI] 19.0–24.9; median, 21.65) and 20 obese (BMI 30.0–39.9; median, 33.7) women enrolled in a prospective study of ethinyl estradiol (EE(2)) and etonorgestrel pharmacokinetics and of ovarian follicle development, endometrial thickness, and bleeding patterns, all measured biweekly during the second cycle of contraceptive vaginal ring use.

Results

Thirty-seven women completed follow-up. Mean day 0–21 EE(2) concentrations were lower among obese vs normal weight women (15.0 vs 22.0 pg/mL, respectively, P = .004), whereas etonorgestrel concentrations were similar (1138 vs 1256 pg/mL, respectively, P = .39). Follicular development was minimal in both groups, with only 5 women achieving a maximum follicle diameter > 13 mm at any time during 3 weeks follow-up (3 normal weight and 2 obese women); these women had serum progesterone levels < 1.0. Obese women reported more bleeding or spotting than normal weight women (3.6 vs 1.4 days, respectively, P = .01).

Conclusion

Although obese women had lower EE(2) levels during contraceptive vaginal ring use, they had excellent suppression of ovarian follicle development, similar to normal weight women. This predicts that contraceptive vaginal ring effectiveness will be similar in women with a BMI up to 39.9. The lower serum EE(2) levels in the obese women may explain the greater reported bleeding or spotting days.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Volnea) [^115Sd3Co]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

12. Bleeding irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non-hormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

13. Ectopic pregnancy

Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.

### Levonorgestrel intrauterine system vs hysteroscopic niche resection for postmenstrual spotting: a 3-year randomized trial follow-up [^114izaKn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Building on previous findings demonstrating that both the 52-mg levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and hysteroscopic niche resection significantly reduced niche-related postmenstrual spotting, with over 70% of patients achieving ≥ 50% reduction at six months and LNG-IUS showing superior efficacy beyond 9 months, this study evaluates the long-term effectiveness of both treatments in reducing niche-related postmenstrual spotting over36 months.

Study Design

This three-year follow-up stems from a single-center randomized trial. Women experiencing postmenstrual spotting after cesarean delivery, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -confirmed niche depth ≥ 2.0 mm and residual myometrium ≥ 2.2 mm, and without plans to conceive within one year, were randomized to receive either the 52-mg LNG-IUS or hysteroscopic niche resection. Main outcome of this long-term follow-up was the proportion of women achieving ≥ 50% reduction in spotting from baseline at 36 months. Secondary outcomes, including menstrual patterns, spotting discomfort, chronic pelvic pain, and satisfaction with treatment, were assessed at 18, 24, 30, and 36 months.

Results

A total of 208 women were randomized (104 in each group), with 93 (89.4%) in the LNG-IUS group and 89 (85.6%) in the hysteroscopic niche resection group completing the three-year follow-up. At 36 months, 98.9% of women in the LNG-IUS group and 51.7% in the hysteroscopic group achieved a 50% reduction in spotting (RR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.56–2.34]; p < 0.001). Spotting decreased progressively over time in the LNG-IUS group through 36 months (P trend = 0.001), whereas the hysteroscopic group showed reduction only until 24 months (p = 0.007), followed by a slight increase. A significant time-treatment interaction was observed (p = 0.007), with LNG-IUS demonstrating superior spotting reduction from 24 months onward Additionally, the LNG-IUS group had fewer postmenstrual spotting days, total bleeding days (p < 0.001), and less pelvic pain (p < 0.010) from six months onward, with the difference widening over time. During the follow-up, 20 women in the LNG-IUS group reported hormone-related side effects, and two experienced partial expulsions. In the hysteroscopic group, five pregnancies were reported (three unintended, two planned) CONCLUSION: Over36 months, the 52-mg LNG-IUS was superior to hysteroscopic niche resection for reducing postmenstrual spotting, pelvic pain, and discomfort, while also offering contraceptive benefits in women with symptomatic niche. We recommend LNG-IUS as a first-line treatment for niche-related spotting in reproductive-age women with no fertility desire for at least the next year.

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^115ig1Ri]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.8 Bleeding Pattern Alterations

LILETTA can alter the bleeding pattern and result in spotting, irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea. During the first three to six months of LILETTA use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may increase and irregular bleeding patterns may develop. Thereafter, the number of bleeding and spotting days usually decreases but bleeding may remain irregular.

Contraception Study

The amenorrhea rates observed in the LILETTA clinical study on contraception are shown in Table 2. The bleeding and spotting days, based on 28-day cycle equivalents, are shown in Table 3. In this study, 2.5% of participants discontinued LILETTA due to bleeding complaints.

*Amenorrhea is defined as no bleeding and/or spotting.

*N includes all LILETTA participants in the clinical study on contraception.

Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Study

The amenorrhea rates observed in the LILETTA clinical study on heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) are shown in Table 4. Amenorrhea developed in 19% of LILETTA study participants by Cycle 6.

*Amenorrhea is defined as no bleeding and/or spotting. Percentages within each cycle are based on the number of participants who completed the cycle.

The bleeding and spotting days, based on 28-day cycle equivalents, are shown in Table 5. In this study, 3.8% of LILETTA participants discontinued due to bleeding complaints.

*N includes participants with at least one complete 28-day cycle of product-use. Calculations are based on complete 28-day cycles (at least 23 days in length).

Resumption of Menses After Discontinuation

In the LILETTA clinical study on contraception, 651 of 652 (99.8%) participants 16–35 years of age at enrollment that were evaluated resumed menses after LILETTA removal. This excludes twelve participants (9 became pregnant, 2 had a hysterectomy, and 1 had ovulatory dysfunction).

Other Bleeding Pattern Changes

If a significant change in bleeding develops during prolonged use, conduct diagnostic tests to assess possible endometrial pathology. Consider the possibility of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, if menstruation does not occur within six weeks of the onset of a previous menstruation. After excluding pregnancy, repeat pregnancy tests are generally not necessary in amenorrheic patients unless indicated by other signs of pregnancy or pelvic pain.

### Protein expression patterns in primary carcinoma of the vagina [^112gCzrN]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Cluster analysis of differentially expressed proteins in normal vaginal tissue, vaginal cancer and cervical cancer

A total of 67 proteins were differentially expressed in normal vaginal tissue and vaginal/cervical cancers. The differential analysis takes into consideration both qualitative and quantitative changes observed between two sets of samples. This difference was statistically significant using Mann–Whitney analysis (P < 0.05). A similar analysis was carried out for the three groups of samples using Student's t -test analysis, and 94 protein spots differed significantly.

We have used two simple methods of statistical analysis to select the variables that may discriminate the three groups of samples, and proceeded to use these two separate data sets for possible classification of the samples into their respective groups. The samples were correctly classified using the hierarchical cluster analysis (data not shown).

In an effort to reduce the data set to a reasonable number, we further examined how many protein spots fall in the intersection of the two data sets, resulting in 33 spots common to both data sets. Of these 33 protein spots, only 11 were upregulated in both cervical and vaginal cancers, whereas the remaining 22 spots were downregulated compared with normal vaginal tissue samples. The differential expressions of some of these protein spots are shown in Figure 2

Figure 2
Global analysis of normal vaginal tissue, vaginal cancer and cervical cancer samples using expression data set from 33 polypeptides. Expression levels in all the samples are measured as ppm. Blue = normal, red = vaginal cancer and green = cervical cancer.

The 33 spots were used in the cluster analysis of all the samples. As shown in Figure 3a

Figure 3
(A) Cluster analysis of normal, vaginal cancer and cervical cancer samples using expression data set from 33 polypeptides. (B) Correspondence analysis plot of same data set; Blue = normal, red = vaginal cancer and green = cervical cancer. all the samples were correctly classified.

Owing to the small sample size of this study, we have used correspondence analysis to evaluate the same data sets used in hierarchical cluster analysis. We have used this as a means to test if the observed set of genes can indeed discriminate the sample groups. As shown in Figure 3b, the samples clustered distinctively, and the relatedness of each sample to each other was presented in a two-dimensional correspondence analysis plot.

This type of analysis allows the identification of potential protein spots that contribute to the overall clustering of the samples.

### Endometrial safety and bleeding profile of a 17 β-estradiol / progesterone oral softgel capsule (TX-001HR) [^116yTi7a]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample size for the ES population was calculated assuming that active treatment would achieve a ≤ 1% incidence rate of endometrial hyperplasia at 12 months, with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of ≤ 4%. Therefore, with 250 women in each active treatment arm completing 12 months of treatment (and having an end-of-study biopsy readable for endometrial hyperplasia), 2 or fewer cases of endometrial hyperplasia would result in an annual incidence of ≤ 1%, with an upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI of ≤ 2.5%. CIs were used to determine whether the rate of endometrial hyperplasia was acceptable. An incidence rate of ≤ 1% with an upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI being ≤ 4% was considered acceptably low and in accordance with FDA guidance.

A Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the relationship between baseline E2 level and baseline endometrial histology.

Bleeding

All women were required to complete a daily bleeding/spotting diary. Spotting was defined as not requiring sanitary protection, while bleeding required sanitary protection. Amenorrhea was defined as the absence of bleeding or spotting. Data for bleeding/spotting and amenorrhea were based on participants in the safety population who had at least one post-baseline bleeding/spotting diary entry. The number of days with bleeding and/or spotting was summarized by cycle and treatment group. Percentages of women with no bleeding or amenorrhea were calculated by cycle, consecutive cycles, and trimester for all treatment groups. Fisher exact tests were used to compare each E2/P4 group with the placebo group.

Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were identified in the overall safety population (all women who took at least one capsule of treatment) using the AE case report forms. Treatment emergent AEs were summarized by System Organ Class and preferred term using MedDRA version 18.0 to identify bleeding-related AEs: metrorrhagia, postmenopausal hemorrhage, uterine hemorrhage, and vaginal hemorrhage.

Predictors of amenorrhea

The impact of age, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking, time since last menstrual period (LMP), age at LMP, tubal ligation, parity, baseline E2 concentration, and baseline frequency and severity of VMS (mild = 1 to severe = 3) was assessed on the cumulative incidence of amenorrhea after three cycles in participants of the safety population who provided bleeding/spotting diary data for more than three cycles. Logistic regressions were used to calculate odds ratio (OR) estimates.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^113mXMCa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding irregularities with extended or continuous use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — before initiation of CHCs, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous CHC use. Extended contraceptive use has been defined as a planned hormone-free interval after more than 28 days of active hormones, and continuous contraceptive use has been defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval. Spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use.

### One-year long-term safety extension study of ospemifene for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with a uterus [^111bysFm]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the safety of ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with a uterus.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term safety extension study, nonhysterectomized women aged 40 to 80 years (n = 180) received daily oral doses of placebo, ospemifene 30 mg/day, or ospemifene 60 mg/day for 40 weeks (continued as blinded treatments from the initial 12-week pivotal efficacy study of ospemifene). The total treatment period was 52 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse events, cervical Papanicolaou tests, endometrial histology, endometrial thickness, gynecological examination, breast palpation, mammography, physical examination, and clinical safety laboratory assessments.

Results

No clinically significant adverse changes in safety assessments were observed in any treatment group. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Hot flushes, the most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse event related to the study drug, had a low discontinuation rate (1.6%). No study participants discontinued because of endometrial or cervical pathology; no endometrial findings were clinically meaningful. On week 52, more than 95% of endometrial biopsy samples either were classified as atrophic or inactive or had insufficient tissue for diagnosis. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events of pelvic organ prolapse or venous thromboembolism. No cases of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma were observed. Only three participants (1.7%) taking ospemifene experienced vaginal bleeding or spotting, which was self-limiting.

Conclusions

Daily doses of ospemifene 30 mg and ospemifene 60 mg yielded few treatment-emergent adverse events and demonstrated no significant endometrial changes during the 1-year treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with a uterus.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^1146yokm]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Bleeding Irregularities (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued implant use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or implant removal. If the patient wants to continue implant use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient desires implant removal at any time, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: * º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use; bleeding is likely to recur after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. * Hormonal treatment (e.g. 20–30 µ g ethinyl estradiol [EE] combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or estrogen) * Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. tranexamic acid), 5 days * º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use and whose effects might persist for some time after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. celecoxib, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), 5–7 days * Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g. tamoxifen), 7–10 days *

Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance. º If a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. º If the patient desires implant removal, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

### Outcomes of subchorionic hematoma-affected pregnancies in the infertile population [^116NapbK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include the examination of all infertile patients regardless of fertility treatment type. This allows for increased generalizability to the diverse infertile population and may aid counseling when SCH is detected incidentally on first trimester ultrasound in the fertility clinic. We also examined the role of concurrent symptoms with the finding of SCH, which allows for more targeted counseling for patients.

This study may be limited by a retrospective chart review design, which has inherent risk of bias and errors in data collection. Because we relied on sonographer inquiry of patient symptoms recorded in a categorical (yes/no) fashion, we are unable to discern the nuances of a miscarriage risk with heavy vaginal bleeding versus simply spotting. Additionally, the evaluation of secondary outcomes has limited statistical power, owing to the rarity of these events. Thus, continued data collection and evaluation of pregnancies affected with SCH is necessary to better assess these outcomes.

The detection of an SCH on an early ultrasound is often distressing for patients. The findings of this study are thus helpful in informing a diverse, infertile patient population on the potential adverse outcomes of SCH. Patients with incidental SCH can be comforted that they are not at increased risk of miscarriage, while patients with both vaginal bleeding and cramping should be considered at higher risk for miscarriage and more thoroughly counseled. Furthermore, patients with SCH can be reassured that there did not appear to be associated adverse maternal or obstetrical outcomes. These findings should inform more focused counseling for highly anxious patients and providers. Future research is needed to examine the impact of these symptoms on SCH‐affected pregnancies, with more attention to detail regarding the severity of symptoms.

In conclusion, risk factors for SCH in the infertile population include male factor infertility and aspirin use, but not fertility treatment type or embryo grade. There is no increased risk of miscarriage among pregnancies impacted by SCH, but if patients with SCH report both vaginal bleeding and cramping, their probability of miscarriage is increased. There are no differences in pregnancy outcomes for patients with SCH. These findings should reassure patients and providers with asymptomatic SCH and improve counseling for patients with symptomatic SCH.

### Vaginal candidiasis (yeast… [^116qikYb]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of candidiasis depend on what part of the body is infected.
- Infections and symptoms can affect the vagina, the mouth and throat, or the esophagus.
- Invasive candidiasis causes fever and chills and can cause different symptoms if it spreads to organs, bones, or joints. Symptoms Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Different types of infections can cause similar symptoms. Healthcare providers can test to see if you have candidiasis. Vaginal candidiasis The symptoms of vaginal candidiasis include:

- Vaginal itching or soreness
- Pain during sexual intercourse
- Pain or discomfort when urinating
- Abnormal vaginal discharge Vaginal candidiasis is often mild. However, some women can develop severe infections involving redness, swelling, and cracks in the wall of the vagina.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat and esophagus Candidiasis in the mouth and throat can have many different symptoms, including:

- White patches on inner cheeks, tongue, roof of the mouth, and throat.
- Redness or soreness
- Cotton-like feeling in the mouth
- Loss of taste
- Pain while eating or swallowing
- Cracking and redness at the corners of the mouth Symptoms of candidiasis of the esophagus include pain and difficulty swallowing. Most people who get candidiasis of the esophagus also have mouth and throat infections. Invasive candidiasis Most people are not at risk for invasive candidiasis, including candidemia. People who develop invasive candidiasis are often already sick from other medical conditions, so it can be difficult to know which symptoms are related to a Candida infection. The most common symptoms of invasive candidiasis are fever and chills that don't improve after antibiotic treatment for suspected bacterial infections.

Other symptoms can develop if the infection spreads to other parts of the body, such as the heart, brain, eyes, bones, or joints.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. AND

Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Diagnostic Considerations A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. 1146). Recurrent VVC can be either idiopathic or secondary. The pathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the majority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent predisposing or underlying conditions. C.

glabrata and other non– albicans Candida species are observed in 10%–20% of women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic therapies are not as effective against these non– albicans yeasts as against C. albicans.
