## Question

One afternoon, Rachelle, Gretchen and Rocky threw pennies into the fountain and made wishes.  Rachelle threw 180 pennies into the fountain.  Gretchen threw half as many pennies into the fountain as Rachelle and Rocky threw in one-third as many pennies as Gretchen.  What was the total number of pennies thrown into the fountain by the three of them?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the total number of pennies thrown into the fountain by Rachelle, Gretchen, and Rocky, given Rachelle's count and the fractional relationships for the others. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact quantities for each person. Then, I should verify the arithmetic operations and intermediate results. Finally, I will sum the individual totals and double-check the final answer to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the base quantity and the relationships. Rachelle threw 180 pennies, Gretchen threw half as many as Rachelle, and Rocky threw one-third as many as Gretchen. So, Gretchen's amount is 180 divided by 2, and Rocky's amount is Gretchen's amount divided by 3, which I should calculate explicitly to avoid errors.

> I will now examine Gretchen's count. Half of 180 is 90, so Gretchen threw 90 pennies. Wait, let me verify that: 180 divided by 2 equals 90, which checks out.

> Next, I should review Rocky's count. One-third of Gretchen's 90 pennies is 30, so Rocky threw 30 pennies. Hold on, I should verify: 90 divided by 3 equals 30, which is correct.

> Now, I need to sum the individual contributions to get the total. Rachelle's 180 plus Gretchen's 90 plus Rocky's 30 equals 300 pennies. Let me double-check the addition: 180 + 90 = 270, and 270 + 30 = 300, so the total is 300 pennies.

> Final answer: The three of them threw a total of 300 pennies into the fountain.

---

The total number of pennies thrown into the fountain is **300**. Rachelle threw 180 pennies, Gretchen threw half of that (**90 pennies**), and Rocky threw one-third of Gretchen's amount (**30 pennies**). Adding these together gives 180 + 90 + 30 = **300 pennies**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Person** | **Number of pennies thrown** |
|-|-|
| Rachelle | 180 |
| Gretchen | ½ × 180 = 90 |
| Rocky | ⅓ × 90 = 30 |
| Total | 180 + 90 + 30 = 300 |

---

Therefore, the total number of pennies thrown into the fountain is **300**.

Pennies are among the most common foreign objects ingested by children. This occurrence has traditionally been managed conservatively. However, more recent studies indicate that the higher zinc composition of pennies produced after 1982 may be more dangerous than previously believed. We reported earlier the in situ reaction of such pennies following immersion in hydrochloric acid at gastric pH. The present study examines the utility of radiographic examination of such pennies.

### Let us stop throwing out the baby with the bathwater: towards better analysis of longitudinal injury data [^d7e256da]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The problem

Longitudinal sports injury data are often analysed in one of the three ways:
A risk,
A rate,
Time to first injury (hazard).

All three approaches have profound limitations.

Some studies report injury incidence in terms of the number of injured players divided by the number of players on the team at pre-season (far right hand side, figure 2). This is the average probability of injury, which is a risk. A risk answers a question often voiced by players and/or their families at pre-season: What is the probability that I will be hurt this season? To compute a one-season risk, the data for each player is reduced to a binary outcome: yes—sustained ≥1 injury, and no—remained injury free. Such analyses ignore how many injuries people sustain, as well as ignore the timing between subsequent injuries. In our figure, players 1 and 3 contribute the same information to a risk, despite of the fact that player 3 has three injuries and player 1 has one injury.

Figure 2 
Common approach to reporting injury incidence in terms of injured athletes.

An alternative approach is the injury rate. The rate (or ‘incidence density’) is the number of injuries divided by the total person-time at risk (far right hand side, figure 3). Scientists use rates because, unlike risks, they use more of the injury information and account for variation in follow-up between respondents. However, rate does not have an obvious interpretation for non-scientists. A problem with rates is that the measure still ignores the length of time between injuries and inherently assumes that multiple injuries to the same person were unrelated. Thus, three non-TL injuries to three different players followed for 3 weeks each yields the same rate as three non-TL injuries to the same player followed for 9 weeks. However, these are two different situations from clinical and resource allocation standpoints.

Figure 3 
Common approach to reporting injury incidence in terms of injury counts.

The third approach is to use simple survival analysis to compute time to first injury (bold lines, figure 4). This quantity is known as initial hazard and it is equivalent to a rates analysis in which all respondents are censored after their first injury. But by limiting analysis to time to first injury only, this approach also excludes information about subsequent injuries. Thus data on only one injury is included for player 2 and data on two subsequent injuries is excluded from the player 3's injury profile.

“The man sure had a palate covered o’er / With brass or steel, that on the rocky shore / First broke the oozy oyster’s pearly coat / And risk’d the living morsel down his throat,” wrote John Gay (1685–1732), one of many poets since antiquity who became fascinated with the subject. More recently, Irish bard Seamus Heaney after enjoying fresh oysters with some friends, was so moved that he wrote a poem, “Laying down a perfect memory / In the cool of thatch and crockery,” and affirming the general idea that those of us who have never swallowed an oyster may not have lived life to the fullest. “Our shells clacked on the plates. / My tongue was a filling estuary, / My palate hung with starlight: / As I tasted the salty Pleiades / Orion dipped his foot into the water.”

### 'The few cubic centimetres inside your skull': a neurological reading of george orwell's [^ffbd84ec]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), George Orwell's political satire on state surveillance and mind control, was written between 1946 and 1948, at a time when new thinking in forensic psychiatry coincided with scientific breakthroughs in neurology to bring questions of criminality, psychotherapy and mental health to the forefront of the popular imagination. This paper examines how Nineteen Eighty-Four inverts psychiatric paradigms in order to diagnose what Orwell sees as the madness of totalitarian regimes. It then goes on to place the novel's dystopian vision of total surveillance and mind control in the context of the neurological research and brain scanning techniques of the mid-20th century. Not only does this context provide new insight into the enduring power of Orwell's novel, it also locates it within a historical moment when technological interventions into the brain seemed to offer a paradigm of mental health and illness as a simple, knowable binary. Nineteen Eighty-Four complicates this binary, and deserves to be acknowledged as an early example of what might be called 'electric shock' literature, within a mid-20th century canon that includes Harold Pinter's The Caretaker (1960), Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1962), and Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar (1963).

The legacy of the homunculus

It is difficult to guess what expectations Penfield and Boldrey had for their creation. In the original paper, the reader comes face-to-face with the homunculus after 42 pages and 27 figures, introduced with only a few lines of text and a single figure. Such modest presentation was followed by more than 10 years of silence from the authors, after which Penfield decided to replace the older homunculus with a new one, deemed to be of better proportions. But even for the second version of the homunculus Penfield did not have encouraging words: ‘[…] such drawings may easily become confusing if too much significance is attributed to the shape and comparative size’. Still the homunculi multiplied in a rapid progression and were described in different regions of the human brain and in other species. The homunculus attracted also harsh criticism. Sir Francis Walshe, Consulting Physician to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, reading from his paper given at the Anglo-American Symposium in London stated: ‘[…] nor are the moderns content with maps, for homunculi and simiusculi have now made their horrid appearance, lineal descendants of Lewis Carroll’s Jabberwock, purporting to depict the fair face of nature, but in fact achieving something quite unnatural’. Penfield himself was in the audience and it must have been painful to hear Walshe addressing his creature in those terms. I am not aware of any debate that might have taken place at the symposium but it is evident from Penfield’s publications prior and after this meeting that he never tried to promote his homunculus as the bearer of a new principle of brain organization. Instead, in his centrencephalic theory he proposed a central role of the thalamus in all brain functions while referring to the pericentral cortices as the ‘primary motor and sensory transmitting areas […] an arrival platform and a departure platform. Its function is to transmit and possibly transmute, with the aid of secondary motor areas, the patterned stream of impulses which arises in the centrencephalic system and passes on out to the target in voluntary muscles’. Clearly for Penfield the homunculus was not the puppeteer but simply the hand controller that allowed the thalamus to transmit its motor commands to the peripheral body. This was not a new concept as early researchers already recognized that brain stimulation activates not only the nearby neurons, but also an extended network of neurons sharing connections with those directly stimulated. For this reason, brain stimulation has been seen as a method for probing network anatomy and function rather than cortical localization.

Applying for a grant seems like an enormous challenge, sometimes akin to Sisyphus' task of rolling the boulder up the hill. In many ways, obtaining funding can be challenging, yet year after year, new investigators do obtain funding, even though there are times when the funding percentage can be low. This review offers some suggestions of what to do after the first or second round of critiques are back. There are some relatively straightforward steps one can take to improve one's chances of success. The joy of funding is worth it!

### "The rainbow at the edge of the shadow of the egg" [^2c5a2d2f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

He studied at the Chase Art School and then went on to the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, where he worked under Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent Dumond. “In those days there wasn’t the cleavage between fine arts and illustration that there is today,” Rockwell wrote. “It was the end of what you might call the golden age of illustration.” Frederick Remington had just died, and photographs were crowding the magazine and book publishing scene. Perhaps people had stopped demanding fine illustration, he thought; “You can’t conduct a golden age with a heart of copper”.

Rockwell was scorned for becoming an illustrator, even by his fellow students. “You know, if I worked as hard as you do, I could be as good as Velásquez,” one of them would joke. “Why don’t you?” Rockwell would respond and return to some vexing problem at hand, how to draw an eye for instance so it did not look “like a fried egg.”

“I can’t say who has influenced me really. Or at least I can’t say how the artists I have admired have influenced me…. Ever since I can remember, Rembrandt has been my favorite artist. Vermeer, Breughel, Velásquez, Canaletto; Dürer, Holbein, Ingres as draftsmen; Matisse, Klee―these are a few of the others I admire now. During my student days I studied closely the works of Edwin Austin Abbey, J.C. and Frank Leyendecker, Howard Pyle, Sargent, Whistler”.

“I had a secret ambition: a cover on the Saturday Evening Post. In those days the cover of the Post was the greatest show window in America for an illustrator…. ‘Must be two million people look at that cover.’” After the Post, offers came from other magazines: Life, Judge, The People’s Popular Monthly. “One of the most difficult problems in painting magazine covers is thinking up ideas which a majority of the readers will understand…. And it’s darned hard to be universal, to find some situation which will strike the farmer, the housewife, the gossip…”.

### Sick individuals and sick populations by geoffrey rose: cardiovascular prevention updated [^68828c39]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, is a risk‐only strategy, even with a lowered threshold for medical intervention, the most effective approach to primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? Using Down syndrome as an example, Rose illustrated the distinction between the risk of a group of individuals and the number at risk within a group as determinants of the total number of clinical events. 1 Thus, far more children with Down syndrome are born to younger women than to older women because far more pregnancies occur in younger women than older women. His example has a striking parallel in cardiovascular disease prevention. The risk of cardiovascular disease increases dramatically after the age of 60 years. 11 Therefore, the great majority of those eligible for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease on the basis of risk are aged >60 years. However, almost half of cardiovascular events in men and almost one third in women occur before the age of 60 years. 11 This discrepancy between total number of cardiovascular events and risk has the same explanation as Down syndrome. The number of those aged <60 years is much greater than the number of those aged >60 years. The problem is that risk is a standardized estimate: the number of cases per a standard number of the population. Expressing risk as a ratio with a constant denominator is what allows the relative rates of cases at different ages to be compared. The relative rates are important but so are the absolute rates. Premature cardiovascular events cut short lives during the life periods of greatest personal contributions and responsibilities. Because risk is, with few exceptions, the criterion to select individuals for preventive therapy, the present higher‐risk strategy disadvantages those who are younger. To be more effective, medical prevention of cardiovascular disease will need to start earlier than presently, and none of the present guidelines deals adequately with this challenge.

### Raccoon roundworm eggs near homes and risk for larva migrans disease, California communities [^c4014e23]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A key feature of the epidemiology of baylisascariasis is the behavior of raccoons. Raccoons habitually defecate in communal sites called latrines. The locations of latrines are associated with various natural and human-made structures. In urban and suburban areas, raccoons establish latrines on rooftops, in attics, in and around chimneys, and on other roof protrusions, stumps, woodpiles, decks, and lawns, especially near trees (Figure 2). Where raccoon densities are high, substantial amounts of feces containing large numbers of resistant B. procyonis eggs accumulate at latrines, which become long-term focal sources of infection for humans and other animals. Thus, humans may become infected accidentally by coming into contact with active or abandoned latrine sites and inadvertently ingesting eggs containing infective B. procyonis larvae (Figure 3). Young children are especially at risk for infection because of their propensity to handle objects and put them in their mouth.

Figure 2 
Typical raccoon latrines found in urban/suburban environments. (A) Latrine on a chimney ledge, illustrating the climbing abilities of raccoons and their tenacity in maintaining latrines. (B) Large latrine in the crotch of an oak tree approximately 3.5 m (15 feet) above ground. The sides of the tree were visibly stained with fecal residue that rain had washed down the trunk, contaminating a child’s play area below with Baylisascaris procyonis eggs. (C) Large latrine, in use for years on a house roof, unknown to the home owner. (D) Latrine site on the ground near downed timber and rocks in a suburban yard. Note the variety of fecal materials (including seeds, crustacean shells, and human refuse), reflecting the diversity of the raccoon diet. The homogenous-appearing fresh scat in the center is composed of digested pet food. (E) Latrine on a stump in a suburban park with plants sprouting from seeds in the scat. Granivorous birds and mammals are attracted to such locations, as are curious children. (F) Raccoon scat hidden in leaf litter in a suburban back yard, indicating how occult contamination may be.

### A bony-crested jurassic dinosaur with evidence of iridescent plumage highlights complexity in early paravian evolution [^021ec5f3]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Large pennaceous tail feathers (eg, 112 mm length and 16 mm width in a posterior caudal) attach to all but the most anterior caudal vertebrae, contributing to a robust and broad tail with a sub-rectangular outline (Fig. 1a–c). Feathers attaching to the most anterior caudals are less well-organized and there is no clear evidence for the presence of closed vanes. However, in some cases, closely spaced parallel barbs are visible, which suggest that these feathers may have also been pennaceous. As preserved, feathers attaching to middle and posterior caudal vertebrae are clearly pennaceous, and each caudal vertebra has approximately four associated feathers comprising rectrices and covert feathers. These feathers display well preserved closed vanes (Fig. 4g–i ; Supplementary Fig. 5), which are indicated by densely spaced parallel barbs orienting in opposite directions on either side of the rachis that often results in a crossing pattern between the neighbouring feathers. In some cases, barbules are visible in these feathers. For example, some barbules preserved in a middle rectrix are up to 2 mm long and they are parallel to each other and set an acute angle to the barbs (about 15°). These rectrices are among the largest feathers preserved on this specimen. For example, one rectrix attaching to a middle caudal measures about 80 mm in length and 9 mm in maximum width, and one rectrix attaching to the second last caudal measures about 110 mm long and 15 mm wide. Rachises in all these feathers are extremely thin. For example, the rachis of a rectrix attaching to the second last caudal, one of the largest rectrices, measures about 1 mm in diameter about its mid-length. The exceptionally preserved rectrices display proximodistal variation in barb density and angle from fewer higher-angled barbs to more numerous and elongate lower-angled barbs (Fig. 4i). There are four barbs within a length of about 1 mm close to the tip of a feather attaching to a middle caudal, and the same barbs from the leading vane set an angle of about 15 degrees to the rachis and those from the trailing vanes set an angle of about 25°. The posterior rectrices have larger barbs (eg, four barbs within a length of 1.8 mm close to the tip of a rectrix attaching to the second last caudal), which seem to set a larger angle with the rachis (eg, 25° for the leading barbs and 30° for the trailing barbs). Anterior and mid-series rectrices have asymmetrical vanes (eg, mid-series rectrix with the inner vane about twice as wide as the outer vane; Fig. 4g) and attach to the bony tail at a higher angle than the posterior rectrices. Vane asymmetry decreases in the posteriorly directed terminal rectrices, which show nearly symmetrical vanes (Fig. 4h).

### Vespers: a nursing origin story set in the dawn of the HIV pandemic [^5a43080a]. AIDS (2024). Medium credibility.

Mark and I were married a year after both his father and Penny died, and by then, it was clear that caring for families affected by HIV would be the north star that would guide our major life decisions. I studied HIV at Yale and became a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and later a Nurse-Midwife. Many children with HIV born in the early days did not make it to adulthood, but the ones that did are now in their 30s and 40s with miraculous second-chance stories. They find themselves navigating stigma, disclosure, sex, and parenting. Many struggle with engaging in care, taking medicine, managing mental health, finishing school, and keeping jobs. Recently, I learned that Ellie, a young woman, I cared for since she was 11, died. Ellie loved dancing and baseball and, unfortunately, shared her brain with coccidioidomycosis. She was born with HIV around the same time Penny died. Through tears, her aunt explained, ‘We never thought Ellie would live past five. Even still, we are stunned to lose her just a few months before her 30 th birthday. We had the biggest party planned’.

There are many reasons to celebrate our strides in HIV research, like long-acting therapy, Undetectable=Untransmittable, and pre-exposure prophylaxis, yet our work is not done. Forty years in, and AIDS remains the leading cause of death for younger women (15–49 years) globally. Stunningly, every 2 minutes, a young woman (15–24 years) acquires HIV, and in 2022 130 000 infants and young children, like Penny, acquired HIV with 84 000 HIV-related deaths occurring worldwide. Furthermore, almost half of US youth with HIV (13–24 years) are undiagnosed, and those in care are less likely than adults to have an undetectable HIV viral load.

The goal to ‘End the HIV Epidemic’ by 2030 is unlikely to be met, especially for those at higher risk. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has set us back in testing, treatment, and prevention. Although it is critical to address HIV decriminalization, youth-friendly HIV education, and parental consent as a barrier to testing and treatment, threats to global funding for HIV treatment and prevention persist.

### A mesozoic bird from gondwana preserving feathers [^5b58c545]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A large number of Early Cretaceous basal pygostylians preserving feathers (that is, confuciusornithids, enantiornithines) show an enigmatic kind of tail formed by a pair of elongate rectrices known as ‘ribbon-like' or ‘rachis-dominated' feathers, which are unknown in living birds. These feathers consist on a rachis-dominated proximal half with a barbed distal portion. In contrast, Sapeornis, basal ornithuromorphs and a single possible enantiornithine, have a fan-shaped morphotype made up by a series of short rectrices, resembling that present in most living birds.

Basic anatomy of rachis-dominated feathers remains difficult to interpret for two reasons: the absence of this kind of feather among living birdsand the two-dimensional preservation of available specimens. This has lead to contradicting interpretations among authors. For example, Zhang et al. thought that the obscure longitudinal stripe represents a thin rachis, the lighter regions on each side of the ‘ribbon' constitutes undifferentiated vanes and the distal pennaceous portion forms a tapering extension of the ribbon-like rachis. Prum, in contrast, hypothesized that the ribbon-like basal portion of the feather is formed by the dorsoventrally depressed and laterally expanded rachis. In the later context, some authorsinterpreted that the midline stripe of the scapus constitutes the longitudinal groove present on the ventral surface of rachis, and the flat regions of the sides of the stripe represent an expanded rachis.

### What type of tremor did the medieval'tremulous hand of worcester' have? [^9a729ef3]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Previous work on the tremor

Franzen’s discussion of the tremor comprises just one and a half pages, and no other scholars have discussed it in detail. Franzen eliminated Parkinson’s disease, citing general practitioner and medical historian Dr Irvine Louden’s statement that it would produce ‘erratic and uneven writing’ rather than the ‘fine, regular tremor’ seen here (: p. 198) and there was no micrographia. This warrants clarification, as Parkinson’s disease tremor frequency is typically regular and micrographia not universal.

Louden also advised: ‘the progressive lean to the left, the “splayed” look, the failure to join up strokes, and the exaggerated size of the writing are all characteristics of a congenital tremor in the later stages’ (: p. 198). ‘Congenital tremor’ is ambiguous, as dystonic, essential, and cerebellar tremors, amongst others, could all be considered congenital. Therefore, the ‘evaluating the handwriting’ section below augments these assertions with an exhaustive study of the features that indicate a more precise tremor classification.

### Youth baseball pitch counts vastly underestimate high-effort throws throughout a season [^61ae3ec1]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The primary purpose of this study was to compare the number of pitches thrown by youth baseball players under the official league guidelines versus the number of "high-effort" throws recorded by a validated digital sensor worn by the players during a season.

Methods

In total, 11 and 12-year-old youth baseball players from a single league were provided an elbow sleeve and sensor to wear each time they threw a baseball for an entire baseball season. The sensor tracked total throws and pitch-equivalent high-effort throws for the season. Official pitch counts were collected at each game from the official scorekeepers.

Results

A total of 19 players participated in the study. The sensor-determined mean total throw count (1666.2±642.2) and mean high-effort throw count (576.9±329.3) per player were both significantly higher, P<0.0001 and P=0.02, respectively, than the mean official pitch count (168.1±122.4).

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that youth players make significantly more total throws and high-effort, or pitch-equivalent, throws, than what is recorded by the official pitch counts. Further research is needed to determine a safe annual "throw count" for young throwing athletes and to determine which types of throws, in addition to pitches, put youth throwers at risk for injury.

### How many innings can we throw: does workload influence injury risk in major league baseball? An analysis of professional starting pitchers between 2010 and 2015 [^2b58dfe6]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There has been increasing interest regarding the association between pitch counts, as well as total workload per season, and the risk of injury among Major League Baseball (MLB) starting pitchers.

Methods

We used publicly available databases to identify all MLB starting pitchers eligible for play who made at least 5 starts in seasons between 2010 and 2015. For all included pitchers, annual pitching statistics (number of starts, total season pitch counts, total season inning counts, and average pitch count per game started) and annual disabled list (DL) information (time on DL for any reason and time on DL related to upper extremity, lower extremity, or axial body injury) were collected. A multiple logistic regression analyzed games started, pitch counts, innings pitched, and pitches per start during all previous seasons as a risk factor for injury in the current season, controlling for previous injury.

Results

A total of 161 starting MLB pitchers met the inclusion criteria. With the exception of total innings pitched from 2010-2011 being significantly associated with DL placement in 2012 (no DL, 310.5±97.5 innings; DL, 344.7±85.9 innings; P=.040), no other finding for starts, pitch counts, innings, or pitches per start in the cumulative years from 2010-2014 had a significant association with pitcher placement on the DL for any musculoskeletal reason or for an upper extremity reason between 2011 and 2015.

Conclusions

In this study, we demonstrate that there is no association between preceding years of cumulative pitches, starts, innings pitched, or average pitches per start and being placed on the DL for any musculoskeletal reason.

### 'Between-time stories': waiting, war and the temporalities of care [^724bf4c3]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Thinking time

Virginia Woolf’s essay, ‘Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid’, was published in October 1940, but it gestated just a little earlier, during the final weeks of the Battle of Britain and on the eve of the London Blitz. Woolf writes, there, of what waiting for a bomb to drop might do to thinking:

It is a queer experience, lying in the dark and listening to the zoom of a hornet which may at any moment sting you to death. It is a sound that interrupts cool and consecutive thinking about peace. Yet it is a sound—far more than prayers and anthems—that should compel one to think about peace. Unless we can think peace into existence we—not this one body in this one bed but millions of bodies yet to be born—will lie in the same darkness and hear the same death rattle overhead. Let us think what we can do to create the only efficient air-raid shelter while the guns on the hill go pop pop pop and the searchlights finger the clouds and now and then, sometimes close at hand, sometimes far away a bomb drops. 86

### From henry shrapnel (1761-1842) to today's neurosurgery: how antipersonnel weapons have laid the foundation of clinical and surgical management of head injury fractures and penetrating brain injuries [^64e9d844]. Neurosurgical Focus (2022). Medium credibility.

Henry Shrapnel invented an antipersonnel weapon capable of defragmenting with the explosion of charge. Modern grenades or improvised explosive devices may be seen as an evolution of Shrapnel's ammunition. Starting by analyzing the ballistics of these weapons, it is possible to understand the historical evolution of the management of skull fractures and penetrating brain injuries (PBIs). A circular crack line with a splinter at the center, depressed in bone, was a characteristic feature of fractures due to Shrapnel's bullet. Three longitudinal fissures, one medial and two lateral, may be present due to tangential blows. Craniectomy and/or fracture reduction were almost always necessary in these cases. The first document describing medical examination and therapeutic strategies for head-injured patients dates back to 1600 bc (the Edwin Smith Papyrus). Several doctors from the past century, such as Puppe, Matson, and Cushing, proposed different theories about skull fractures and the management of craniocerebral injuries, paving the way for diagnosing and treating these injuries. Shrapnel fractures required wider craniotomies and in the past surgeons had to deal with more severe injuries. Based on past military experiences during what could be called the postshrapnel age, guidelines for the management of PBIs were introduced in 2001. In these guidelines various concepts were reviewed, such as the importance of antibiotics and seizure prevention; included as well were prognostic factors such as hypotension, coagulopathy, respiratory distress, and Glasgow Coma Scale score. Furthermore, they highlight how it has not been possible to reach a common viewpoint on surgical management. Nevertheless, in contrast with the past, it is preferable to be less aggressive regarding retained fragments if there is no intracranial mass effect. Although military situations were useful in building basic principles for PBI guidelines, civilian PBIs differ noticeably from military ones. Therefore, there is a need to review modern guidelines in order to apply them in every situation.

### Extortion can outperform generosity in the iterated prisoner's dilemma [^b20b8359]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and experimental setting

The data was generated from our laboratory experiments which were conducted at The Experimental Social Science Laboratory of Zhejiang University. The experiments were implemented in accordance with standard social science experiment ethical guidelines and regulations.

Before the formal experiment, the subjects practiced with a matching pennies game against a computer to get acquainted with the laboratory setting. They were then assigned a set of materials including an instruction manual, an informed consent form and a recording chart for their use, and they played the game in a small isolated room with a computer. Oral instructions were also given. Subjects made decisions by clicking the option ‘C' or ‘D' on the screen. No communication was allowed during the experiment, and the subjects were asked to put their mobile phones in mute and sealed in an envelope until the end of the session. Considering the complexity of the ZD strategies, we provided human subjects with paper and pen to record their decision choices and scores round by round. In the awareness treatments, the human subjects were told that they would play a game with a fixed computer program. On the contrary, in the unawareness treatments, the human subjects were only told that they would play a game with a fixed opponent, which is similar to the implementation by Hilbe et al. The instruction manual of 500A is provided as an example in Supplementary Note 2. To obtain the desired number of rounds of data (500 or 60) for each subject while avoiding end-of-game effects, human subjects were informed that the game would end with probability 0.1 in each round after the desired number of rounds (500 or 60) is reached.

During the experiments, the player earned scores according to the payoff matrix (see Fig. 1) and their choices. After the experiment, the sum of scores were converted to cash according to an exchange rate and paid to the subjects. For more details, see Supplementary Notes 1, 2 and 3.

Statistical methods

Throughout the paper, we used the Mann–Whitney's test for the comparison between treatments, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the comparison within a treatment, and the Spearman's rank correlation test for detection of trends. In addition, we used the binomial probability test for comparison of the number of the Extortionate strategists who obtained an average score higher than the score from mutual cooperation, and the number of the extortionate strategists who obtained an average score less than or equal to the score from mutual cooperation.

### Flat square knots: are 3 throws enough? [^b21be78c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the integrity of flat square knots.

Study Design

Three sutures were used in both 0 and 2-0 suture gauges: poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl), polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), and silk. For each, flat square knots were tied with either 3 or 5 throws. Knots were tested to failure. The major outcome measured was the proportion of 3 throw knots untying, compared with that of 5 throw knots.

Results

There were high rates of untying for the poliglecaprone 25 and for the polyglactin 910 with both suture gauges when tied with only 3 throws. The failure rate decreased significantly when the throws were increased. There was no statistical benefit to increasing the number of throws for silk.

Conclusion

Knot failure is decreased by increasing the number of throws for poliglecaprone 25 and polyglactin 910. However, there is no advantage to increasing the number of throws from 3 to 5 for silk.

### A man for all seasons: W.W. keen [^8ee27bac]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

William Williams Keen was the catalyst for the advent of neurosurgery in the United States. He served in the Civil War and collaborated with Silas Weir Mitchell in studying injuries sustained to the nervous system. These studies culminated in the publication in 1864 of "Gunshot Wounds and Other Injuries of the Nerves and Reflex Paralysis," which first described causalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and secondary paralysis. His most monumental accomplishment undoubtedly was being the first surgeon in the United States to successfully remove a primary brain tumor (1887) and have the patient survive for more than 30 years. As the editor of "Surgery, Its Principles and Practice," Keen invited Harvey Cushing to write the section on surgery of the head, which propelled Cushing to international recognition and provided a foothold for the new specialty of neurosurgery. Multiple sources were reviewed to prepare this comprehensive biographical account of Keen's contributions. Emphasis is placed on those achievements that furthered the discipline of neurosurgery. Although a general surgeon, Keen had a special interest in the nervous system. He treated patients with trigeminal neuralgia, performed cortical excisions for patients with epilepsy, and devised the procedure of posterior upper cervical root sections for spasmodic torticollis. He was the first surgeon to perform and advocate ventricular punctures. He served as a consultant and surgeon to both Grover Cleveland and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Dissemination, implementation and policy (slides 35–43)

I am the worst guy in the world on policy, it is not my forte at all, but I know it is really important. You can do all this work in the front, but you must back it up with paperwork, the systems, and all those things that happen behind the scenes. The JTS was first described in 2003, and while research was part of the JTS at the beginning, today it currently does not have a research arm. But, COL Jennifer Gurny is fixing that. Hopefully, in another 6 months, we will be able to put the research arm next to the performance improvement registry and operations so there will be a comprehensive military trauma system. Whole blood was the first JTS clinical practice guideline that was described in 2004 and has been the recommended fluid of choice in the military; civilian adoption is coming. The military blood community has written more about this as opposed to some of the other blood communities in the USA. The military is fully on board with providing whole blood as far forward as possible.Medics are carrying whole blood in their rucksacks down range and transfusing while wearing night vision goggles so that in the middle of the night, in the middle of a firefight, whole blood can be given. If the military can do that, we can do it in the civilian world with paramedics, do it safely, and keep track of all the paperwork. We have heard already about the experience down in San Antonio. It is this unique environment where they created a comprehensive system for blood. Level 4 trauma centers have whole blood available in the ED. It is on ground ambulances. It is on helicopter ambulances, and it is, of course, in the level 1 and level 2 centers. They have hundreds of units of whole blood moving around that region at all times. Cross-leveling between centers enables them to rapidly move units in the case of a mass casualty event.Hazelton’s paper was discussed this morning and is the second-best paper, in my opinion, of the prospective randomized papers coming down the pike. Presented to the American Surgical Association and published in the Annals of Surgery, they presented a large number of patients who received whole blood versus components. The whole blood patients did dramatically better. They were sicker, got whole blood, and yet had dramatically improved outcomes compared with the component group.

 Important: Do not press the injection button while setting your dose.

What should I do if I cannot set the dose I need?

If your dose is more than 12 mg you will need to split your dose into more than 1 injection.
You can give from 0.2 mg to 12 mg in a single injection.
Use a new needle for each injection (See Step 4: Attach needle).
If you normally need to give 2 injections for your full dose, be sure to give your second dose.

What should I do if I do not have enough medicine left in my pen?

If your pen contains less than 12 mg of medicine, the dose knob will stop with the remaining amount of medicine shown in the dose window.
If there is not enough medicine left in your pen for your full dose, you may either:
Inject the amount left in your pen, then prepare a new pen to complete your dose in full. Remember to subtract the dose you have already received. For example, if the dose is 3.8 mg and you can only set the dose knob to 1.8 mg, you should inject another 2.0 mg with a new pen.
Or get a new pen and inject the full dose.

Only split your dose if you have been trained or told by your healthcare provider on how to do this.

### Nonlinear engagement of action observation network underlying action anticipation in players with different levels of expertise [^cdbda818]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Task

In each trial, after viewing the video of a pitcher throwing a strike or a ball, the participants were asked to decide whether they would swing the bat or not at the pitch by pressing one of three buttons to signal the response of “swing,” “no swing,” or “I don't know” (uncertain). The optimal decisions would be “to swing at strikes” and “not to swing at balls”. The participants were asked to make their decision on each pitch as if the match were in a tie with a critical situation (full count of two strikes and three balls, two players out, and the bases loaded in the last inning) to maximize the importance of the decision. After viewing a control video, the participants had to press another button. The four response buttons were marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4 under the right index, middle, ring, and little fingers of the participant, respectively, and the assignment of button numbers to answers was counterbalanced across participants. Participants had to give a response within 2.5 s; otherwise, the trial was skipped and regarded as an error trial.

### Neurocomputational mechanisms involved in adaptation to fluctuating intentions of others [^de0923de]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Behavioral signature of tracking intentions

In the Mixed-intentions task, participants were led to believe that they were interacting with another participant, in fact, they were interacting with an artificial agent (AA). Participants were asked to choose one of two cards to match the other participant’s choice. Unbeknownst to the participant, the AA tried to match the two cards (coordination game) or to mismatch them (matching pennies game). To assess the degree of participant’s cooperation, we used their probability of staying on the same target as the previous trial. Indeed, there is one unique Nash equilibrium for the matching pennies which is to randomly switch target half the time, whereas less than 50% of switch signal cooperation. We assessed how participants used the history of previous interactions to make their choices to switch target. We used logistic regression to examine whether participants selected the same target as that from the previous trial (“Stay”) or chose the other target (“Switch”), depending on whether the previous three trials (at t-1, t-2 and t-3) had been won or lost, whether the previous decisions had been to Stay or Switch, and whether the previous interactions from those trials indicated cooperation (Eq. 1). We also added sex, age and the rank of each trial (first, second or third trial etc. i.e. time indicator) as control variables. All trials except the first 5 trials were included in this analysis. Cooperation was defined as the binomial variable representing the interaction between the last action of the Artificial Agent (AA) and the participant’s own previous outcome (”Cooperativity signature of AA”). This variable was set to 1 if either the participant had won on the previous trial and the AA stayed on the same target in the next trial, or if the participant lost on the previous trial and the AA switched to the other target in the next trial. Otherwise, the variable was set to 0. Indeed, if the AA is a cooperative partner, both players should choose to keep the same target after winning to be more predictable. Note that this definition needs to be distinguished from the degree of participant’s cooperativity as defined by its probability to stay on the same target than on the previous trial. No multicollinearity was found between the regressors.

### Cushing, penfield, and cortical stimulation [^1d33aa37]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Harvey Cushing and Wilder Penfield enjoyed a unique professional and personal relationship. Shortly before his retirement from Harvard University in 1933, Cushing sent Penfield 8 sketches that he drew in 1902 and 1903 while he was at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The first series of 3 sketches illustrate the relationship between a cortical hemorrhagic lesion and the motor strip in a patient with focal motor seizures. The second series also comprises 3 sketches. These depict the operative findings in a patient in whom Cushing had electrically stimulated the precentral gyrus, before resecting the cortex subserving motility of the upper extremity to control painful dyskinetic movements. The third series consists of 2 sketches that illustrate the results of stimulation of the motor strip as an aid in the safe resection of an epileptogenic focus in a patient with Jacksonian seizures. These sketches are the subjects of this paper. They add to the relatively sparse record of Cushing's activities in cortical stimulation and in the treatment of functional disorders.

### Hitler's parkinsonism [^863568bb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

Of the multitude of medical and psychiatric conditions ascribed to Hitler both in his lifetime and since his suicide in April 1945, few are more substantiated than parkinsonism. While the timeline of the development of this condition, as well as its etiology, are debated, there is clear evidence for classic manifestations of the disease, most prominently a resting tremor but also stooped posture, bradykinesia, micrographia, and masked facial expressions, with progression steadily seen over his final years. Though ultimately speculation, some have suggested that Hitler suffered from progressive cognitive and mood disturbances, possibly due to parkinsonism, that affected the course of events in the war. Here, the authors discuss Hitler's parkinsonism in the context of the Third Reich and its eventual destruction, maintaining that ultimately his disease had little effect on the end result.

### Catching the tide at the flood or being in the right place at the right time [^8fe667a9]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

After a 1 year post doc in the Biochemistry department at UCL, I moved to the London School of Hygiene, (LSHTM) in 1970 with John Waterlow after his appointment to the departmental Chair on the death of Ben Platt in 1969. There Waterlow established through the Wellcome Trust, the Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism Unit (CNMU) at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases at St Pancras in London which was formally opened in 1973 by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, (aged 90), who, in 1955 as Chancellor of the University of West Indies had opened the TMRU in Jamaica. This new unit provided some continuity for Waterlow’s work and soon became another internationally-recognised centre of excellence. As recently described, working initially under Waterlow with Peter Garlick and then establishing my own group we adopted the precursor-product approach to study protein turnover in vivo, initially with tail-vein tracer infusions of U- 14 C tyrosine, and then with a single flooding dose of [3 H] phenylalanine. This allowed rates of tissue protein synthesis to be measured accurately, and allowed turnover to be calculated from comparison of the synthesis rate with the rate of changes in tissue protein content in response to interventions, with a step change in the range and volume of studies in animal models. By the time of my move to Surrey to take the Chair in Human Nutrition in 1992, we had a complete description of protein turnover in murine muscle during development, in response to dietary and hormonal manipulations and infection, and in response to stretch-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy in an adult avian model as well as an account of the extent of muscle-bone interactions in response to dietary protein and energy deficiency. In parallel with this animal work, starting in the late 1970s, we applied stable isotope tracer kinetic approaches with [13 C-1] leucine, [15 N]glycine, [2 H 5]phenylalanine and [2 H 2]tyrosine to human studies of protein synthesis in muscle, to whole body protein homoeostasis in response to varying protein intakes and to post prandial protein utilisation(PPU), initially in collaboration with Mike Rennie and Dave Halliday and then with Paul Pacy. This work allowed the first formulation of the protein stat model for growth regulation in 1995, which has recently been updated. The studies of PPU were especially important for the development of the adaptive metabolic demand model for protein requirements during maintenance. At Surrey my research diversified up to my full retirement in 2009 after which I maintained consultancy work for Public Health England writing much of the 2011 Energy Requirements Report and continued to teach, as a visiting Professor of Medical Nutrition, at St Georges University Medical School, Grenada till 2017 and at the LSHTM, UCL and at Surrey, up to the present time.

### The need to separate chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathology from clinical features [^52134b50]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ARE THE CLINICAL FEATURES PROGRESSIVE?

In 1928, Martland reported that some cases remain mild and do not progress, and other cases progress to advanced Parkinsonism and dementia. Carroll, in 1936, described the punch-drunk syndrome as evolving during one’s boxing career, progressing for a year or so after, and then becoming stationary. He noted that some boxers, however, deteriorated and needed to be institutionalized. In contrast, in 1957 Critchley emphasized that the condition is gradually progressive. Similarly, in 1963, Mawdsley and Ferguson reported 10 cases of boxers, some of whom noticed the onset of neurological problems, such as slowing down and have slurred speech, while still actively fighting. Others noticed neurological deterioration years after they retired. These cases had a progressive course. In Roberts’ large-scale study of more than 200 boxers in the 1960s, he reported that most with the syndrome had a static course, there were anecdotal cases of improvement after retirement from boxing, and a small subgroup appeared to have a progressive course greater than expected from aging. Decades later, in 2000, Jordan reviewed the literature and reported that it was unclear whether clinical worsening in boxers reflected a progressive neurodegenerative disease, the aging process superimposed on a fixed neurological injury, or both. At present, it remains inconclusive as to whether the neuropathology or the clinical features of CTE are inexorably progressive. It also remains inconclusive as to whether p-tau causes specific static or progressive clinical features.

### In memoriam: michael B. gregg (1930-2008) [^dc3c9e93]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

“Quick and dirty,” one of his favorite terms, was how he described much of what we epidemiologists did, and not in a pejorative sense of the word but with genuine affection for the game of hide-and-seek he never tired of playing. In epidemiologic investigations, there was no time for elegance and perfection. Epidemiology helped real people with real problems. As Michael O’Leary, another of Mike’s former epidemiology students, paraphrased him: “It’s better to be approximately right today than exactly right tomorrow.” Were Mike Gregg standing in Golden Square in 1854, he would have been impressed less by John Snow’s brilliant reasoning than by Snow’s ability to get the Broad Street pump handle removed quickly, thereby saving more lives.

Avuncular, almost fatherly at times, Mike clearly enjoyed mentoring young colleagues, and in doing so he revealed to us a broader view of a bigger, more complicated world into which we might one day be admitted. His door was always open, no matter how low on the totem pole you might be; but if he needed to see you, he popped into your office rather than asking you to come to his. In conversation he valued and respected the ideas of even the newest of neophytes. He listened more than he spoke; and when he did speak, it was softly and courteously, tentatively offering up his own thoughts on the subject, as if this were a democratic effort, rather than the boss telling you how things really were. He embraced teamwork as the professional norm and ignored, without discounting or disparaging it, individual accomplishment. His modesty was genuine; his gentleness, memorable. He walked the halls with his head aimed shyly down, moving so close to the cinderblock wall that you expected him to bump into it at any moment, occasionally lifting his shoulder to avoid just such an accident, dressed casually and in a manner that never telegraphed his stature, his slightly battered Hush Puppies pressing silently on linoleum floors. Had you passed Mike in the cafeteria, or even sat down next to him at a meeting, you might have mistaken him for a visitor who had accidentally wandered into Building 1.

### Controlling the motion of multiple objects on a chladni plate [^19119dc3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Avoiding proximity of objects during manipulation

When two objects come too close to each other, their movement becomes coupled, and the controller may have difficulties in separating them. We have measured the minimum distance that the controller can separate two adjacent objects (Supplementary Fig. 5). The controller was 100% successful at separating two objects when the initial centre-to-centre distance was 2.5 mm, but the success rate dropped to 30% when the two objects started at a distance of 0.8 mm. The critical distance for the object motions to become coupled is related to the wavelength of the vibration. For the highest manipulation notes A # 10 (29.83 kHz), the wavelength is 16 mm; for a one-dimensional wave, this means that the node–antinode distance is 4 mm, which corresponds well to the observed drop in the success rate. During the manipulation experiments, we avoid the coupling of motion by attempting to keep objects from becoming closer than 5 mm to each other, which is two times the distance at which the separation success rate started to drop. Below the threshold distance, the distance penalty is added to the cost function of the controller, which tries to move the objects away from each other (see sections Control algorithm and Manipulation experiments in Methods).

Transport mechanism and simulations

To understand the underlying transport mechanism, we observed the particle movement from side with a high-speed video camera (Supplementary Movie 10). The recording shows that the object spends much of its time in free flight between collisions with the plate. The collisions have a rocking pattern, where a collision on the left edge of the object is usually followed by a collision on the right edge (left and right as seen in the video). However, the rocking motion is not purely periodic: occasionally, collision on the left edge is followed by another collision on the same edge, and the durations between the collisions vary, without any definite pattern.

The object transport mechanism can be understood in terms of rigid body dynamics with impulse collisions. We have developed a computer simulation model that is based on two-dimensional rigid body dynamics on a one-dimensional standing wave (see Methods for details of the model). A simulated experiment is shown in Supplementary Movie 11. The object is transported towards the node and the quasi-periodic rocking motion is qualitatively similar to the experiment in Supplementary Movie 10. As expected, objects in general move towards the nearest node, finally settling at the node (Fig. 6a).

### The crippled brain that prolonged the civil war: general joseph hooker's concussions at chancellorsville [^94746a0f]. Neurosurgical Focus (2022). Medium credibility.

President Lincoln appointed General Joseph Hooker to command the Army of the Potomac in January 1863. In April 1863, Hooker had 130,000 men compared to the Confederate Army's 60,000. The Union forces had more food, clothing, and ammunition. On a decisive day of the Chancellorsville campaign, as Hooker stood on his headquarters porch, a cannonball struck the pillar against which he was leaning. He was hurled to the floor, stunned and senseless. Unconsciousness followed a lucid interval, requiring rest, when another cannonball struck near him. Half of the army was not thrust into battle, resulting in retreat, because Hooker was not capable of commanding. Hooker's army missed the opportune time to attack; the order was never received because Hooker suffered a traumatic brain injury. Under current military protocol, Hooker would not be allowed to return to participation. During this crucial period a reporter stated, "the precious hour passed, while our army was without a head." The Chancellorsville campaign resulted in Union retreat. Hooker's disabling traumatic brain injury prevented him from giving orders and changing the battle's outcome. Had the general not sustained a concussion, the Civil War probably would have ended earlier.

This article profiles 6 notable female scientists who have had eponyms named after them, highlighting their significant contributions to various medical fields and whose scientific endeavors have influenced our practice and understanding of otolaryngology. We discuss Łucja Frey Gottesman and her description of Frey's syndrome; Margaret Dix and the Dix-Hallpike test; Lotte Strauss and her work defining Churg-Strauss disease; Dorothy Reed Mendenhall's discovery of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma; Edith Louise Potter defining Potter sequence in utero; Denise Louis-Bar originally characterizing the condition now known as ataxia-telangiectasia or Louis-Bar syndrome. Despite the challenges these women faced as pioneering female physicians as well as personal and political turmoil, their contributions greatly advanced the fields of otolaryngology, neurology, neuropathology, perinatology, and pediatric pathology. We aim to honor their stories and medical legacies.

### The global extent and severity of operational interactions between conflicting pinnipeds and fisheries [^aef75755]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To obtain comparable observations for meta-analyses, we retained only temporally-explicit reports of operational interactions. The most widely reported proxy of effort across studies was fishing time, number of trips, or number of sets. We therefore normalised effort by fishing days to describe the total sampling time, i.e. the amount of effort that occurred in one day. For example, if there were 2 fishing events per day (e.g. trips or sets), then the effort normalisation value would be 0.5. For both effect sizes, the sample size used in meta-analyses estimates was the number of fishing days. The rationale for this measure as opposed to using fishing trips or sets was that trips or sets vary substantially between fisheries and gear type, and more generally the reporting of fishing effort varied between studies. While fishing days may also be biased where fishing activities are not constant throughout each fishing event, they provide a more comparable quantitative measure of the temporal component of fishing activities. Ideally, observations would be standardised using explicit metrics of effort such as catch per unit effort (CPUE), but this was not available for the majority of studies (but see ref.). For two studies,, we used (spatially) neighbouring studies, with similar fishery scale and practises to normalise fishing trips into fishing days. Furthermore, we primarily used studies in which independent observations were made on board fishing vessels, which reduced potential reporting biases. We assumed that observation effort was consistent across fishing days for each study.

The first effect metric we calculated was the proportion of fishing days that had interactions with a pinniped species. An interaction in this context was broadly defined as the presence or activity of pinnipeds near vessels when fishing operations were taking place. These interactions ranged from observations of pinnipeds swimming near fishing operationsto direct observations of pinnipeds damaging catch. Thus, the effect size of interest was the proportion of reported fishing days in which interactions were observed. The second effect metric we calculated was the proportion of catch damaged by pinnipeds for a specific fishery and associated number of fishing days. This effect size provided a more explicit measure of pinniped-fishery impacts than interaction frequency, as observers provided quantitative estimates of the proportion of catch lost to pinnipeds either through direct observations of damage, reporting the amount of catch damaged (e.g. with bite marks), or through counterfactuals comparing sites with and without pinniped activity.

### A film of patients with movement disorders made in queen square, london in the mid-1920s by samuel alexander kinnier Wilson [^2f280d52]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Through Edward Reynolds' collaboration with Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson's (SAKW) son, James, on Babylonian neurology and psychiatry, and his contact with James' nephew, Jim, grandson of SAKW, a remarkable film of patients with movement disorders, made by SAKW in the mid-1920s, has come to light.

Methods/Results

The 20-min silent film with captions by SAKW includes patients with senile tremor, Parkinson's disease and postencephalitic parkinsonism, hemiballismus, Huntington's chorea, Sydenham's chorea, hysterical palsy and tremor, multiple sclerosis, and progressive lenticular degeneration. Most of the patients are filmed in the square outside the National Hospital. The British Film Institute dates the film to 1924 and the captions to 1925. The case records of 6 of the 14 patients, who were admitted to the National Hospital, Queen Square, under the care of Dr. SAKW have been identified and summarized.

Discussion

SAKW may have been stimulated and facilitated to make this film through his personal contact with Charlie Chaplin with whom he stayed at his Californian estate, probably in the summer of 1924. The first films of neurological patients were made in Europe and USA at the beginning of the 20th century, although most have perished. This may be one of the oldest examples from UK. It is also notable for the inclusion of Wilson's disease and a brief shot of SAKW himself.

### All monofilament knots assume sliding conformation in vivo [^016991d5]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Surgeons are not always cognizant of the knots they tie. It has been thought that suture material does not determine what types of knots are tied.

Design

Experienced surgeons were asked to tie square monofilament knots that were salvaged and microscopically evaluated.

Results

Tightly cinched monofilament knots assume sliding conformation in vivo regardless of configuration, instrumentation, suture polymer, or surgeon.

Conclusions

When monofilament suture is securely cinched in vivo, kinetic energy forces even a flat throw into sliding conformation. A well-crafted, intentionally sliding square knot appears compacter than any other monofilament knot.

### How do socioeconomic attainment gaps in early mathematical ability arise? [^b88008e1]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

Counting was measured using a forward enumeration task where children were asked to count out loud as high as they could, starting from one (up to a maximum of 42). The task was ended if the child gave the wrong number or skipped a number in the count sequence. The total score was the highest number correctly counted to from 1 (ranging from 0 to 42).

Cardinality was measured using the Give‐a‐Number task adapted from Wynn. Children were given a basket of 15 toy strawberries, and were told they were the shopkeeper and the experimenter was the customer with an empty basket. The experimenter asked for n strawberries to be placed in their basket. N followed the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10. If the child did not place the correct number of strawberries in the basket, the trial was repeated a second time. The task ended if the child did not place the correct number of strawberries in the basket on the second repeated trial. Total scores were calculated by adding up the scores for each correct trial (ranging from 0 to 7).

Mathematical ability was assessed using the standardized TEMA‐3 (Form A; Ginsbery & Baroody,). The TEMA‐3 measures a range of early mathematical skills including numeracy, number comparison, numeral literacy, mastery of number facts, calculation skills, and understanding of concepts, in children aged 3–8 years. One point was awarded for each correct answer, and the task ended when five incorrect answers in a row were given. Total scores were calculated by adding up the scores for each correct trial (ranging from 0 to 72). The TEMA‐3 has high reliability and validity (Bliss,).

Processing speed was included as a control variable, measured using a computerized ‘bubble‐popping’ task. Children were instructed to ‘pop’ bubbles as fast they could by touching bubbles that appeared on a touchscreen computer (Blakey & Carroll,). Bubbles stayed on the screen until the child had touched them; when children ‘popped’ the bubble, a burst bubble appeared on the screen. Between trials there was an interval varying between 800 and 1200 ms. Children completed a short practice block, followed by eight test trials. Children's median reaction time was calculated.

### Fear of large carnivores causes a trophic cascade [^df98c286]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Raccoon long-term response to the fear of large carnivores

The month-long playback manipulations were conducted on Coal Island in 2013 (10 May to 13 July) and Penelakut Island in 2014 (28 June to 25 August). On each island, we chose two shoreline sites separated by sufficient distance (1.2 km on Coal and 2.7 km on Penelakut) that sounds were not detectable between sites. We used a repeated measures design, presenting both predator and non-predator treatments at all sites and alternating the order of treatment presentation between sites on each island, allowing us to control for the effects of site and seasonality on raccoon behaviour and intertidal community data. On a given island, each site received either the predator or non-predator treatment for 28 days (treatment period 1), followed by the opposite treatment for a subsequent 28 days (treatment period 2), with <1 week separating the two treatment periods. Starting treatment (predator or non-predator) was randomly assigned. Throughout each treatment period, we monitored raccoon behaviour (Penelakut), the abundance of intertidal prey (Coal) and subtidal prey (Coal and Penelakut), and the survival and abundance of marine species not directly eaten by raccoons (Penelakut).

### The jew's penis: circumcision and sexual pathology in eighteenth-century england [^723c2e28]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The Doctors will not leave a Stump:

I shall be Circumcis’d i’th’ ----

Tho’ I am neither Jew nor Gentile (, 47).

The excised rhyme word here links the ‘Gentile’ with the ‘penile’, pairing non-Jewish status with healthy male genitalia and Jewishness with ‘a Stump’. The hero equates circumcision with a full-scale penectomy, concluding that the surgical treatment for his infection will leave him impotent and sexless.

Similar logic runs through the attacks on Christian Englishmen accused of prostituting themselves to Jewish men in business or in politics. In Alexander Pope’s Strange but True Relation How Mr. Edmund Curll, of Fleet Street, Stationer, Out of an Extraordinary Desire of Lucre, went into ‘Change-Alley, and was Converted from the Christian Religion by Certain Eminent Jews 1732), for example, a bookseller’s mercenary dealings with Jewish business associates result in brutal penile disfigurement and long-term sexual dysfunction. In this deeply offensive pamphlet—written in revenge against one of Pope’s long-standing enemies, the bookseller Edmund Curll—Pope imagines the avaricious Curll agreeing to convert to Judaism in exchange ‘for the filthy Prospect of Lucre’, only to discover that he must seal the bargain by undergoing a violent and disfiguring sexual assault posing as circumcision (, 30). 24 The prologue to the tale aligns Jewishness not just with avarice, but also with old age and impotence, as Pope rails against those young Englishmen who, like Curll, choose wealth over virility, Jewish over Christian values: ‘the Concupiscence of Youth is converted into the Covetousness of Age, and those Appetites are now become Venal which should be Venereal’, he laments (, 28). Pope’s clever play on words here opposes the ‘venal’ to the ‘venereal’, describing Curll’s greed as a kind of disease—a ‘pecuniary Contagion’—that damages his sexual appetites and potency (, 29). And, rather predictably, it is this same ‘pecuniary Contagion’ that provides Curll’s entrée into a world inhabited by sexually deviant Jewish men.

### The unprecedented pacific northwest heatwave of June 2021 [^b8132861]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Estimates of barnacle deaths were obtained from random quadrat sampling (100 cm 2 quadrats, n = 25) of barnacles (B. glandula) at a gently sloping cobble and boulder shore (1001 Steps Park, 49.0306°N, −122.8752°W). Unlike mussels, which gape very soon after death, barnacles can retain their opercular plates for a few weeks after they have died, making mortality more difficult to discern visually. The barnacle mortality surveys reported here were conducted on 25 July 2021, which allowed sufficient time for opercular plates of recently-deceased barnacles to detach and wash away. Barnacles lacking opercular plates were recorded as dead; barnacles with opercular plates held in their natural position were assumed to be alive, which was confirmed by prodding the opercular plates of a subset of these individuals with a pencil to verify the presence of a living animal holding them closed. Sampling revealed 80.6 ± 5.7% mortality (mean ± s.e.), which far exceeds the pre-heatwave background frequency of standing dead measured at this site (7.9 ± 1.2%). The absolute number of excess dead barnacles per 100 cm 2 quadrat was 54.8 ± 9.4 (equivalent to 5480 per m 2). Scaling up to the entire barnacle zone at this site (18 m wide in the cross-shore direction) suggests this heatwave killed roughly 10 million barnacles along a single 100 m stretch of cobble shoreline. Qualitative surveys of barnacle and mussel mortality at other sites in BC and Washington State suggest that these high rates of mortality were experienced throughout much of Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia, with lower but still noticeable mortality further north along the BC Central Coast.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^56711b98]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning position for imminent strikes—the lightning position involves sitting or crouching with knees and feet close together to create only one point of contact with the ground; if standing, have feet touching, and if sitting, lift feet off the ground; take this position only when a lightning strike is imminent and when all other lightning prevention strategies have failed, attempt to minimize ground current injury by insulating from the ground by sitting on a pack, a dry coiled rope, or a rolled foam sleeping pad; this is a strategy of last resort and should not be relied on as primary prevention but may reduce injury risk (Recommendation grade: 2C).

### A kidney from hell? A nephrological view of the whitechapel murders in 1888 [^c937e244]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

In the poor Whitechapel district of the East End of London in the fall of 1888, at least five prostitutes were brutally murdered, and in all but one case, also mutilated. The murderer was never caught and became known by his nickname 'Jack the Ripper'. The left kidney and the uterus were cut out and taken away from one of the victims named Catherine Eddowes. A kidney was also cut out of the body from another victim, but not taken away. Two weeks later, George Lusk, president of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, received a small cardboard box with half of a longitudinally divided kidney and a letter entitled 'From hell' claiming that the kidney inside the box was taken from the victim. The kidney was brought to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw, the Curator of the London Pathological Museum, where the kidney could be microscopically examined. The press jumped on the topic and made a circumstantial case that this kidney had been indeed torn from the body of Catherine Eddowes. According to the later memoirs of Major Henry Smith of the City Police published more than 20 years after the incident, the kidney left in the corpse of Catherine Eddowes was in an advanced stage of Bright's disease and the kidney sent to George Lusk was in exactly a similar stage. Today, the majority of criminologists believe that the kidney sent to Mr Lusk was a hoax as were other letters signed with Jack the Ripper. However, the murderer took organs from his victims, and in the case of Catherine Eddowes, the kidney. Serial killers often mutilate their victims and abscond with the removed body parts as trophies. By removing the kidney from Catherine Eddowes, Jack the Ripper may have tried to take possession of the conscience, emotions and desires of one of his victims, attributes residing in the kidney as described in the Bible. Jack the Ripper was never caught; many suspects have been suggested, and the murder series ended as suddenly as it had begun. We will never know who this mentally disturbed 'nephrophilic' was. Today, the story of Jack the Ripper is part of contemporary culture.

### Should we limit innings pitched after ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction in major league baseball pitchers? [^3c91b9dd]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (UCLR) has become a common procedure among Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. It is unclear if a limit on innings pitched after UCLR should be instituted to prevent revision UCLR.

Hypothesis

Number of innings pitched and number of pitches thrown after UCLR will not affect whether a pitcher requires a revision UCLR.

Study Design

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods

All MLB pitchers between 1974 and 2015 who pitched at least 1 full season after UCLR were included in this study. Pitch counts and innings pitched for the first full season after UCLR as well as total pitch count and total innings pitched were recorded. Pitch counts and innings pitched were compared among players who required revision UCLR and those who did not.

Results

Overall, 154 pitchers were included. Of these, 135 pitchers did not require revision UCLR while 19 underwent revision UCLR. No significant difference existed between pitchers who underwent revision UCLR and those who did not when comparing number of innings pitched in the season after UCLR (79.4 ± 46.7 vs 90.1 ± 58.6; P = .9016), number of pitches thrown in the season after UCLR (1233.2 ± 710.4 vs 1449.2 ± 904.1; P = .7337), number of innings pitched in the pitcher's career after UCLR (357.4 ± 312.0 vs 399.3 ± 446.4; P = .6945), and number of pitches thrown in the pitcher's career after UCLR (5632.7 ± 4583.9 vs 5674.7 ± 5755.4; P = .4789), respectively. Furthermore, no difference existed in revision rate between pitchers who pitched more or less than 180 innings in the first full season after UCLR (P = .6678).

Conclusion

The number of innings pitched and number of pitches thrown in the first full season as well as over a player's career after UCLR are not associated with an increased risk of a pitcher requiring revision UCLR.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^80ce04aa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) laboratory findings—The total white blood cell count is typically normal or slightly increased in patients with RMSF, with increased numbers of immature neutrophils. Thrombocytopenia, slight elevations in hepatic transaminases (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), and hyponatremia might be present, particularly as the disease advances; however, laboratory values cannot be relied on to guide early treatment decisions because they are often within or slightly deviated from the reference range early in the course of illness. Indicators of diffuse tissue injury, such as elevated levels of creatine kinase or serum lactate dehydrogenase, might be present later in the course.

### A task-invariant prior explains trial-by-trial active avoidance behaviour across gain and loss tasks [^a2312360]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Robber task

This task was described as an encounter with a robber. Participants were asked to imagine being a server at a bar. They were told that at the end of the night, they were on their way home with their tips from the night in hand (the offer) when they encountered a robber. Participants could choose to relinquish their money (passive) or try to fight the robber (active). If they handed over the money, they would be missing out on their potential reward. If they tried to fight the robber, they incurred the cost of fighting. If successful, they kept the offer minus the cost, but if unsuccessful, they missed out on the reward associated with the offer and incurred an additional loss amounting to the cost of fighting. On each trial, t, the offer (o) was sampled from the 20-element array presented in Eq. (1):and then rounded to the nearest whole number. Each offer was presented 3 times within a block in a randomised order. In this task, the action cost was described as the cost of fighting. Crucially, this cost was related to the size of the tip by constructing the cost as a sum of a percentage of the offer and a set cost. In the robber task, the set costs were 10, 40, or 75 points, and the concomitant percentages of the offers were 15, 5 and 0%. This resulted in 60 unique offer-cost combinations, with the majority of these combinations resulting in small differences between the values of the active and passive options two options (see Fig. 1C). The order of the combination of offers and costs was shuffled across trials. Participants were told that they were supposed to try to get as many points as possible and that one of their trials would be randomly selected, and they would gain a bonus based on their performance on that trial.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^4dffb5e5]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Ceasing water-based rescue and resuscitation efforts highlights that “the most important predictor of outcome is duration of submersion.” “Available evidence shows that prognosis is poor with submersion times greater than 30 min, regardless of water temperature.” While “there are also case reports of survival with good neurologic outcome despite prolonged submersion, predominantly in children aged ≤ 6 y in water <6°C (43°F) and with use of advanced treatment modalities, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,” the evidence base notes: “A literature review of 43 cases serves as the evidence for water-based rescue.” The report concludes “that there is minimal chance of neurologically intact survival with submersion time > 30 min in water > 6°C (43°F) or > 90 min in water ≤ 6°C (43°F).”

### Guns in intimate partner violence: comparing incidents by type of weapon [^76840ede]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Behaviors and outcomes

Aggressive offender behavior—pushing and shoving, grabbing, pulling hair, slapping, punching, kicking, biting, stabbing, and strangling—generally was more common when hands, fists, or feet or a nongun weapon rather than a gun was used. As shown in Table 2, sometimes the differences were substantial. For example, offenders who used a nongun weapon or a bodily weapon only were one-and-a-half to two times as likely to have punched the victim than when a gun was used (34.0% and 46.1%, respectively, vs. 21.0%). When demographic and incident characteristics were taken into account (see lower half of Table 2), the general pattern of findings became more pronounced. For example, continuing with “punched,” we see that offenders who used their hands, fists, or feet were nearly three-and-a-half times as likely and those who used a nongun external weapon were more than twice as likely to have punched their victims as did offenders who used a gun.

2 

Table 3, which reports findings for all four weapon use categories, documents that all of the listed offender behaviors—threatened, stalked, imprisoned, injured children, broke in, threw objects, damaged property, and violated a protection from abuse order—differed statistically among the four groups. When demographic and incident characteristics were taken into account, the comparisons between no weapon and gun were statistically significant: offenders who did not use a weapon were substantially less likely to have engaged in the behaviors. These analyses also indicated that there were no statistical differences by the four types of weapon use as to whether the offender violated a protection from abuse order. Offenders who used a bodily weapon (vs. a gun) and a nongun external weapon (vs. a gun) largely did not differ in the listed behaviors, either.

### Interval throwing programs at distances beyond 150 feet can Be equivalent to pitching over five innings [^1e650346]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the cumulative elbow varus torque (EVT) experienced during created interval throwing programs (ITP) and derive innings pitched equivalent for each step.

Methods

High school pitchers wearing the motusBASEBALL sensor who had at least 50 throws at 90, 120, 150, and 180 ft and game pitches were included in this analysis. Means for EVT per throw and torque per minute were calculated at each distance. Three throwing programs were created using a template of 1 phase at each distance with 2 steps per phase. Programs varied only by number of throws per set (20, 25, and 30 throws for Program A, B, and C, respectively). Total EVT for each step, phase, and program were calculated using mean EVT per throw at each distance. Total EVT for each step and program were converted to a mean inning pitched equivalent (IPE) and maximum pitch count equivalent (MPE), respectively, using in-game pitching torque values and expected mean pitch counts (15 pitches/inning and maximum 105 pitches/game).

Results

In total, 3,447 throws were analyzed from 7 subjects (16.7 years ± 0.8 years). EVT per throw increased at each distance (range 36.9-45.5 N·m), comparable to game pitches (45.7 N·m). Mean EVT per minute was highest for 90 ft throws (193.4 N·m/min) and lowest for game pitches (125 N·m/min). Throwing Program A had the lowest range of IPE (Step 1: 2.0 and Step 8: 3.7), and Program C had the highest range (Step 1: 3.0 and Step 8: 5.6). The phases of Program A never exceeded 1MPE. Program B exceeded this threshold after Phase 1, and Program C exceeded 1MPE at every phase. Total program MPE ranged from 3.5 to 5.2 (Program A and C, respectively).

Conclusions

Programs requiring 25 or more throws per set reached approximately 5 IPE per day. Increasing throwing repetitions by 10 throws resulted in a nearly 50% increase in IPE and MPE.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) things come to those who wait: 60 years of progress in the treatment of adult ALL [^864c7d29]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the beginning

In 1957, the Medical Research Council (MRC) set up a steering committee to evaluate different forms of treatment in cancer. The first ‘Working Party’, which included Dr (later Sir) Richard Doll, set up a factorial trial to elucidate the efficacy of mercaptopurine and different doses of corticosteroids in acute leukaemias of both myeloid and lymphoid origin, which showed that adult leukaemia was typically a rapidly fatal disease that was not greatly influenced by those methods of treatment. 1 Trials in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), in particular, began in earnest in the early 1970s and continued to be developed by MRC ‘Working Parties’. For some years, the MRC ‘brand’ of trials was internationally respected, being synonymous with high‐quality leukaemia trials from the UK. The early studies, of course, long preceded the requirement for a trial sponsor, but were administered by the Clinical Trial Service Unit (CTSU) and Epidemiological Studies Unit at Oxford, an intellectual powerhouse of statistical and trial design expertise, with input from relevant physicians. Up until the 1970s, haematologists were generally trained as pathologists, but a change in emphasis was required as it became increasingly possible to treat diseases such as leukaemia. Anthony (Tony) H. Goldstone exemplified this new breed of professional, having trained in general medicine and haematology in Edinburgh and Cambridge, as opposed to training in ‘pathology’. He was appointed to a consultant haematology post at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) in 1976, by the departmental lead Professor Tom Prankerd, a ‘physician haematologist’ within the Department of Medicine, who underscored the importance of haematologists as general physicians and had been visionary in establishing a separate department of clinical haematology. In a key opinion piece for The Lancet, Prankerd made clear that ‘interests (of the patient) can be adequately served only by providing a cadre of haematological physicians – doctors who should have a wide background of general medical training as well as a special interest in blood disease.’ 2 Along with Tony, Alan Burnett, H. Grant Prentice, Ian Franklin, and I. Jill Durrant were key ‘haematological physicians’ working on the MRC trials for Adult ALL. Susan M. Richards, Senior Research Fellow at CTSU was a critical statistical and intellectual contributor to both adult and childhood ALL trials, working alongside her colleague Georgina Buck, medical statistician.

### Barbed suture as a treatment approach in complex degloving injuries [^34f05834]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In the late 19th century, French physician Morel-Lavallée was challenged with a group of patients who sustained similar patterns of degloving injuries, which today carry his eponym. In 1853, he reported a series of cases as well as proposed strategies for the management of these complex degloving injuries. Treatment strategies have not varied significantly over the years, and these lesions continue to plague surgeons today with failure rates in excess of 50%. We present 2 case series using barbed suture in the management of these complex injuries.

### Prevention of drowning [^f6e1e01d]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

AAP—swimming lessons, water competency, and safe rescue: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports swimming lessons for children older than 1 year, and decisions about timing should be individualized while considering that toddlers aged 12 to 36 months are at highest risk of drowning. Swimming lessons, in isolation, will not drown-proof a child, and swim ability must be considered as only one part of water competency and of a multilayered protection plan involving effective pool barriers, constant and capable supervision, life jacket use, and lifeguards. Untrained rescuers often die attempting rescue; because rescuer safety must be the priority, only people trained in the advanced skills of water rescue should enter the water. Water rescue techniques should be taught to children and their parents during swim lessons and involve reaching with an object or throwing something that floats to avoid water entry (“Reach, throw, or row; don’t go”).

### Severity and pattern of injuries caused by the traditional Swiss team sport' hornussen': first retrospective study at a level I trauma centre in Switzerland [^e090d25b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hornussen is an indigenous national team sport originating in the Central Swiss Plateau. A small plastic disk (the ‘Nouss’ or ‘Hornuss’) is placed on a launching ramp (the ‘Bock’) and struck with a small block made of compressed hardwood (the ‘Träf’), which is fixed at the end of a special elastic racket (the ‘Stecken’) by a member of one team (figure 1) and then intercepted (‘abgetan’) in the field (‘Ries’) with special wooden shields (the ‘Schindeln’) by members of the other team (figure 2).During the match, both teams play both parts of the game. The team with the better intercepting performance wins the match. If the interception results are identical, the team with the greater total flight distances of the Nouss wins. Thus, in Hornussen, ‘defence’ is more important than ‘attack’.

The exact roots of Hornussen are unknown. It may have emerged from the heathen custom of hitting burning logs from the mountain to the valley to cast out demonsor perhaps from medieval war games.Hornussen was officially documented for the first time in 1625, when four men were reprimanded by the consistory of Lauperswil for playing Hornussen during ‘catechisation and prayer service’.Interestingly, the first Hornussen accident was reported as early as 1738, after a player had been fatally wounded to his carotid artery by a broken Stecken.

### Number needed to treat and number needed to harm are not the best way to report and assess the results of randomised clinical trials [^f243221a]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The inverse of the difference between rates, called the 'number needed to treat' (NNT), was suggested 20 years ago as a good way to present the results of comparisons of success or failure under different therapies. Such comparisons usually arise in randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis. This article reviews the claims made about this statistic, and the problems associated with it. Methods that have been proposed for confidence intervals are evaluated, and shown to be erroneous. We suggest that giving the baseline risk, and the difference in success or event rates, the 'absolute risk reduction', is preferable to the number needed to treat, for both theoretical and practical reasons.
