## Question

Vaginal pap cuff after hysterectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to perform vaginal cuff cytology after hysterectomy, including indications, techniques, interpretation, and management of abnormal results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification by indication for hysterectomy. Then, I should verify guideline-based screening recommendations for average-risk versus high-risk patients. Next, I will review the evidence base for and against routine screening. After that, I need to check special populations such as HIV and immunocompromised patients. Then, I will examine the technical aspects of sampling the vaginal cuff. Finally, I should confirm how to interpret results and manage abnormalities, including when to use colposcopy and biopsy, and close with a practical algorithm and counseling points anchored in major guidelines and cost-effectiveness data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification, because management hinges on why the hysterectomy was performed and the patient's cervical history. I need to distinguish hysterectomy for benign disease without a history of CIN2+ from hysterectomy performed for treatment of CIN2/3 or AIS, and from hysterectomy performed for cervical or endometrial cancer, as these categories carry markedly different risks of subsequent vaginal lesions and therefore different surveillance needs [^113EPAkY] [^1129PdYQ] [^117NZa1p].

> Next, I should review guideline-based recommendations for average-risk patients after hysterectomy for benign disease. The USPSTF gives a D recommendation against screening women who have had a total hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and have no history of CIN2+ or cervical cancer, and the American Cancer Society aligns with this, advising no screening for individuals without a cervix and without a history of CIN2+ in the past 25 years or cervical cancer ever [^115bRwwh] [^1129PdYQ]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: multiple large datasets show extremely low prevalence of abnormal cytology after hysterectomy for benign disease, and cost-effectiveness analyses show essentially no life-expectancy gain from screening in this group, supporting the recommendation to avoid routine cytology [^1153H7JM] [^112ZCaqK] [^117NZa1p].

> Now, I will examine the evidence base for high-risk patients, because that is where surveillance is justified. After treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN2/3) or AIS, ASCCP recommends 3 consecutive annual HPV-based tests, then HPV-based testing every 3 years for a total of 25 years, regardless of whether hysterectomy was performed for treatment or later for another reason; this reflects the elevated and persistent risk of vaginal HSIL and cancer in this population [^113EPAkY] [^114ntSDy]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk: population-based data show a roughly 20-fold increased risk of vaginal cancer after hysterectomy for CIN3/AIS compared with those with a benign cervical history, with most VaIN2+ detected within 5 years, which substantiates prolonged surveillance in this group [^112Rva9b] [^11518vq7].

> I need to check special populations, particularly people with HIV and other immunocompromised states. For women with HIV who had a hysterectomy for benign disease, routine screening is not recommended. However, those with a history of high-grade CIN, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer should have annual vaginal cuff cytology, given substantially higher rates of abnormal cytology and VaIN2+ in this group and slower clearance of HPV-related abnormalities [^1123oU4A] [^117QN96M] [^1145oA7D]. Hold on, I should verify the numbers: cohorts of HIV-positive women show abnormal cytology in about 30% and VaIN2+ on biopsy in about 29% of those biopsied, supporting targeted surveillance rather than routine screening for all HIV-positive post-hysterectomy patients [^112gbFVG] [^114oxVGf].

> Let me consider the technical aspects of sampling the vaginal cuff, because technique affects adequacy and interpretation. The cuff is the surgical apex of the vagina at the former cervical-vaginal junction; after total hysterectomy, sampling should target the entire circumference of the cuff and any suture line or "dog ears", using a spatula, cytobrush, or broom device to maximize cellularity; liquid-based cytology is acceptable and may facilitate HPV co-testing when indicated [^notfound]. Wait, I should double-check a common pitfall: using a cervical brush designed for the transformation zone can be awkward in the vagina; adapting the instrument to the vaginal mucosa and ensuring sampling of the vault suture line improves adequacy and detection of VaIN at the cuff [^notfound].

> I will now examine how to interpret results, and I need to ensure I separate clinically meaningful findings from noise. Benign-appearing glandular cells reported after hysterectomy are typically derived from vaginal adenosis or small accessory ducts and require no further evaluation; this is distinct from the postmenopausal endometrial cell scenario in women with a uterus, where endometrial assessment is indicated [^115z5bKL] [^114jpCU9]. But wait, what if cytology shows HSIL, ASC-H, or AGC? In patients with a history of CIN2+ or cancer, these findings warrant prompt vaginal colposcopy with directed biopsy, whereas ASC-US or LSIL in this context can be observed with repeat HPV-based testing in 12 months unless persistent or HPV16/18 positive, aligning with ASCCP risk-based management [^113EPAkY] [^114ntSDy].

> Next, I should review management of abnormal vaginal cytology, and I need to confirm thresholds for colposcopy. For patients with a history of CIN2+ or AIS, HSIL, ASC-H, or AGC on vaginal cytology should proceed to colposcopy with Lugol's iodine mapping and directed biopsies; persistent ASC-US/LSIL or positive hrHPV should also lower the threshold for colposcopy given elevated risk [^113EPAkY] [^113S8TJ7]. Hold on, I should verify treatment principles: VaIN2/3 is typically managed with excision or ablation, reserving vaginectomy for extensive multifocal disease or suspicion of invasion; immunohistochemistry (p16, Ki-67) can aid in confirming HSIL when histology is equivocal [^113S8TJ7] [^115BWYXn].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should double-check that it aligns with major guidelines. If hysterectomy was for benign disease and there is no history of CIN2+ in the past 25 years, do not screen; if screening is mistakenly performed and cytology is abnormal, manage per ASCCP post-hysterectomy algorithms, generally observing ASC-US/LSIL and referring HSIL/ASC-H/AGC for colposcopy [^113EPAkY] [^114ntSDy]. If hysterectomy was for CIN2/3 or AIS, perform HPV-based testing annually for 3 years, then every 3 years for 25 years; if cytology is HSIL/ASC-H/AGC, proceed to colposcopy with biopsy, and if ASC-US/LSIL, repeat HPV-based testing in 12 months unless persistent or HPV16/18 positive, which should prompt colposcopy [^113EPAkY] [^114ntSDy]. For people with HIV, avoid routine screening after benign hysterectomy, but ensure annual vaginal cuff cytology if there is a history of high-grade CIN, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer [^1123oU4A] [^117QN96M].

> I should confirm counseling points to avoid overtreatment and unnecessary anxiety. Emphasize that routine vaginal cytology after hysterectomy for benign disease does not improve outcomes and may lead to false positives, invasive procedures, and anxiety; cost-effectiveness analyses show essentially no life-expectancy gain and high incremental costs, reinforcing the recommendation to stop screening in low-risk post-hysterectomy patients [^112ZCaqK] [^112U4pFw] [^116kcMyt]. Hold on, I should verify that patients understand exceptions: those with a history of CIN2+ or AIS have a real, persistent risk and benefit from structured surveillance, which should be explained explicitly to ensure adherence and timely follow-up [^113EPAkY] [^112Rva9b].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are precise. Record the indication for hysterectomy, any prior cervical pathology, and the rationale for or against screening. If surveillance is indicated, schedule HPV-based testing and plan for colposcopy if results are high-risk or persistently abnormal, aligning with ASCCP and USPSTF guidance to minimize both under- and over-treatment in this population [^113EPAkY] [^115bRwwh].

Routine vaginal cuff cytology is **not recommended** after hysterectomy for benign disease [^115bRwwh] because the risk of vaginal cancer is extremely low and screening does not improve outcomes [^117NZa1p] [^112ZCaqK]. It is only indicated for women with a history of CIN 2+, AIS, or cervical cancer [^112Rva9b], who should have HPV-based testing every 3 years for 25 years [^114ntSDy] [^114sybdy]. For HIV-positive women, annual vaginal cuff cytology is recommended only if there is a history of high-grade CIN, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer [^1123oU4A] [^117QN96M]. Abnormal results should be managed with colposcopy and biopsy [^notfound]; low-grade lesions may be observed, whereas high-grade lesions require treatment [^notfound].

---

## Indications for vaginal cuff cytology

Vaginal cuff cytology is **not routinely recommended** for all women after hysterectomy [^1129PdYQ]. The indications are specific and include:

- **History of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3**: Women with a history of CIN 2 or 3, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or invasive cervical cancer should undergo continued surveillance [^113EPAkY] [^111ED2Ux].

- **HIV-positive women**: Annual vaginal cuff cytology is recommended for HIV-positive women with a history of high-grade CIN, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer [^1123oU4A] [^117QN96M].

- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Women with immunosuppression, such as those undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation, may require individualized screening protocols based on their risk profile [^111ED2Ux].

---

## Frequency and duration of screening

The frequency and duration of vaginal cuff cytology **vary** based on the patient's risk profile:

| **Risk profile** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| History of CIN 2/3, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer | Every 3 years | 25 years [^113EPAkY] [^114ntSDy] |
| HIV-positive women with history of high-grade CIN, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer | Annually | Indefinitely [^114LsobY] [^117QN96M] |
| Benign hysterectomy without history of CIN 2+ | Not recommended | Not applicable [^115bRwwh] [^1129PdYQ] |

## Clinical significance of abnormal vaginal cuff cytology

Abnormal vaginal cuff cytology results **are classified** according to the Bethesda system, which includes atypical squamous cells (ASC), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and atypical glandular cells (AGC). The clinical significance of these abnormalities varies:

- **ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance)**: Often associated with transient HPV infection; management typically involves repeat cytology or HPV testing [^113EPAkY].

- **LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion)**: Usually indicates low-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN 1); observation or repeat testing is often sufficient [^113EPAkY].

- **HSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion)**: Indicates high-grade VAIN (VAIN 2/3) or early invasive vaginal cancer; requires colposcopy with biopsy and definitive treatment [^113EPAkY] [^112zpNWc].

- **AGC (atypical glandular cells)**: Rare but significant; may indicate adenocarcinoma or other glandular malignancies, necessitating thorough evaluation and biopsy [^113EPAkY] [^117KRdEc].

---

## Management of abnormal vaginal cuff cytology

Management of abnormal vaginal cuff cytology **follows a risk-based approach**:

- **ASC-US/LSIL**: Repeat cytology or HPV testing in 6–12 months; colposcopy if persistent abnormalities or high-risk HPV positivity [^113EPAkY].

- **HSIL**: Immediate colposcopy with biopsy; treatment options include laser ablation, excision, or vaginectomy depending on lesion extent and severity [^113S8TJ7].

- **AGC**: Colposcopy with endocervical sampling, biopsy, and possible endometrial sampling if indicated [^117KRdEc].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Vaginal cuff cytology has several limitations and challenges, including a **low sensitivity** — particularly for detecting high-grade lesions or invasive cancer — which necessitates correlation with clinical findings and, when indicated, biopsy [^113p3nJB]. False positives and negatives occur, which can lead to unnecessary interventions or missed diagnoses [^116kcMyt]. Patient discomfort and anxiety from abnormal results and subsequent procedures are additional concerns [^116kcMyt].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **risk-based approach** to vaginal cuff cytology:

- **ASCCP guidelines**: Recommend continued surveillance for women with a history of CIN 2/3, AIS, or invasive cervical cancer, utilizing HPV-based testing every 3 years for 25 years [^113EPAkY] [^114ntSDy].

- **USPSTF guidelines**: Recommend against routine screening for cervical cancer in women who have undergone hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and have no history of high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer [^115bRwwh].

- **NCCN guidelines**: Provide comprehensive management strategies for vaginal cancer, emphasizing biopsy-based diagnosis and individualized treatment plans [^112zpNWc].

---

## Conclusion

Vaginal cuff cytology is a specialized screening tool primarily indicated for women with a history of cervical neoplasia or specific risk factors. Routine screening is **not recommended** for women who have undergone hysterectomy for benign disease without a history of high-grade cervical lesions. Management of abnormal results follows a risk-based approach, with colposcopy and biopsy guiding treatment decisions.

### Recurrent smear abnormalities where repeat loop treatment is not possible: is hysterectomy the answer? [^112zLcWw]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the outcome of women who underwent hysterectomy for recurrent cytological abnormalities where repeat loop treatment was considered not to be technically possible because of insufficient remaining cervical tissue.

Methods

Women undergoing a hysterectomy for the above indication at the Northern Gynaecological Cancer Centre over a period of 10 years (1992–2001) were identified from a prospectively collected database. Case notes were then reviewed and women undergoing hysterectomy for other indications were excluded. Relevant demographic and clinical data were then extracted.

Results

33 patients meeting the above criteria were identified. The overall hysterectomy rate for this indication was 0.73%. 20 out of the 33 women had significant pathology on the hysterectomy specimen. 95% of these had high-grade disease with one having a Stage 1A1 squamous carcinoma. None of the patients required more radical treatment than a simple hysterectomy. There were no major complications following the hysterectomy. Positive endocervical margins on the previous loop specimen (P = 0.05) was an important correlating factor predicting the presence of CIN on the hysterectomy specimen. One out of the thirty hysterectomies (3.3%) performed using the vaginal route had incomplete excision compared to one of three (33%) using the abdominal route. Hysterectomy was successful in treating 85.2% of the women; only 4 women subsequently developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.

Conclusion

Simple hysterectomy appears to be a suitable diagnostic and treatment option for women with recurrent high-grade cytological abnormalities where further loop treatment is technically not possible. Incomplete excision at the endocervical margin on the previous loop specimen was the main factor associated with the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at hysterectomy.

### Is microscopic examination of hysterectomy specimens removed for clinically benign disease necessary? [^113Ceran]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The likelihood of finding significant pathology in a hysterectomy specimen undertaken for clinically benign disease is low. Some data indicate that microscopic examination of these specimens may be abandoned. While this approach may seem attractive, the authors believe that there are a number of practical and clinical governance issues associated with this. Instead a pragmatic approach is advocated, with two tissue blocks (cervix and endomyometrium) being adequate in most cases.

Diagnosis and workup — vaginal cancer signs include bleeding, discharge, urine retention and rectal symptoms such as constipation or blood in the stool. However, up to 20% of individuals AFAB may be asymptomatic and have the disease discovered on pelvic (bimanual and rectovaginal) or cervical examination and pap cytology, colposcopy, or vulvar screening. Cofactors for vaginal cancer include immunosuppression, prior hysterectomy, and cigarette smoking.

### Significance of "normal" endometrial cells in cervical cytology from asymptomatic postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy [^111aYwNN]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to assess the significance of normal endometrial cells identified in screening Pap smears from asymptomatic postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Methods

Endometrial histology reported from 93 asymptomatic postmenopausal women receiving HRT noted to have normal endometrial cells on a screening Pap smear was reviewed. Information regarding HRT, endometrial sampling, and interval between the sentinel Pap and sampling was extracted from the record.

Results

Endometrial biopsies were obtained an average of 1.7 months after the Pap smears. Eighteen of the ninety-three histology specimens (19%, 95% CI: 12–27%) identified abnormalities, in four cases precancerous or cancerous lesions. These 18 abnormalities included 7 endometrial polyps; 7 cases of simple hyperplasia, 1 with atypia; 3 cases of complex hyperplasia, 1 with atypia; and 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Conclusion

Normal endometrial cells identified on a screening Pap smear in this population may be an indication of endometrial disease.

### Hysterectomy for abnormal cervical smear when local excision is not possible [^117F8pHL]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the outcomes of those women who underwent hysterectomy because of an abnormal cervical smear where local excision was considered technically not possible.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for all women who had hysterectomy at a university-affiliated hospital, carried out during the period between January 2000 and June 2012, because of cervical neoplasia.

Results

Fifty-six women were identified. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the women at the time of hysterectomy was 61.4 (8.2) years. Two women (3.6%) had cervical carcinoma, and adjuvant treatment was required in both cases. Being postmenopausal and older than 50 years and having a history of previous local excisional procedure were associated with a higher risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia found during hysterectomy (p > .005). During a mean (SD) follow-up of 42.3 (30.8) months after hysterectomy, 35.7% of women had persistent cytologic abnormality after hysterectomy, with 19.6% having subsequent histologically proven vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). Women's age, route of hysterectomy, previous local excision, degree of cytologic abnormality before hysterectomy, presence of VAIN before hysterectomy, and final histology of the hysterectomy specimen could not predict subsequent VAIN after hysterectomy.

Conclusions

Hysterectomy seems to be an appropriate option in management, but further surgery or adjuvant therapy may be needed. Women should also be aware of the possibilities of persistent cytologic abnormalities including VAIN, but unfortunately, no predictive factor for its occurrence can be identified.

### Importance of colposcopy impression in the early diagnosis of posthysterectomy vaginal cancer [^116yT9eg]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

The indication of hysterectomy included 3 myoma, 1 abnormal uterine bleeding (ovulatory disorder), 56 cervical HSIL, and 26 cervical cancers. Of the 3 patients who underwent hysterectomy for myoma, 1 with a cytology of HSIL and positive hrHPV testing was confirmed as having cancer, and the other 2 with cytology of HSIL and atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude HSIL and positive hrHPV results were confirmed as having vaginal HSIL. In addition, 1 patient who underwent hysterectomy for postmenopausal ovulatory disorder has a low-grade vaginal intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. Their intervals between hysterectomy and vaginectomy are 15, 19, 22, and 6 years, respectively, with a mean interval of 15.5 years. All 26 cervical cancer patients underwent initial treatment of hysterectomy, modified or radical hysterectomy according to their stages, including 11 IA1, 3 IA2, 9 IB1, 1 IB2, and 2 IIA1. According to surgical findings, 4 of 9 IB1, 1 of 1 IB2, and 1 of 2 IIA1 patients underwent adjuvant treatment of radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. However, 1 IB1 and 1 IIA1 patients declined adjuvant treatment above for personal reasons.

Available abnormal cytology and positive hrHPV were observed in 90.7% (49/54) and 96.2% (51/53) of the patients, respectively. Forty-three posthysterectomy vaginal HSIL patients diagnosed with colposcopy-directed biopsy had co-testing results of cytology and hrHPV. Among them, 83.7% (36/43) had abnormal cytology results (including atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude HSIL, LSIL, HSIL, and squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]) and positive hrHPV simultaneously; 11.6% (5/43) had normal cytology results and positive hrHPV; 4.7% (2/43) had negative hrHPV and abnormal cytology; and none had double negative co-testing results (Supplementary Table 2).

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^112tTNHB]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) fertility-sparing management — surveillance schedule and indications are as follows: For patients of reproductive age who desire future pregnancy, fertility-sparing management with an excisional procedure is acceptable provided that negative margins have been achieved and the patient is willing and able to adhere to surveillance; if negative margins cannot be achieved after maximal excisional attempts, fertility-sparing management is not recommended. For those managed conservatively, surveillance with co-testing and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for at least 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years, or until hysterectomy is performed; if co-testing and endocervical sampling remain consistently negative for 5 years, extending the interval to every 3 years starting in the sixth year is acceptable. After hysterectomy, surveillance per ASCCP surveillance guidelines for treated CIN 2+ is recommended, and if HPV test results become positive or cytology/histologic results are abnormal during surveillance, hysterectomy at the completion of childbearing is preferred.

### Recurrent colorectal carcinoma detected by routine cervicovaginal Papanicolaou smear testing [^114VXBn3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Background

We present a case of recurrent colon cancer detected by routine, annual Papanicolaou screening.

Case

A 59-year-old African American woman who had been treated for T₂N₀M₀ (stage II, Dukes A) colon cancer 2 years before to presentation had a Pap smear showing a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion with a normal cervical biopsy result. Because of this discrepancy, a loop electrosurgical excision procedure and endocervical curettage were performed and showed atypical glandular cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma. Subsequent colonoscopy showed recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon. The patient underwent an en-block total abdominal hysterectomy and anterior-perineal resection showing invasion of recurrent colon cancer into the uterus and cervix.

Conclusion

In patients with a history of extrauterine adenocarcinoma, abnormal Pap screening may indicate recurrent or metastatic carcinoma.

### Recurrence patterns and surveillance for patients with early stage endometrial cancer [^116XVikp]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

To evaluate the recurrence patterns and the clinical and economic role of surveillance with vaginal cytology in women with low risk endometrial cancer.

Methods

Patients undergoing primary surgery with final pathology consistent with a grade 1 endometrial cancer confined to the endometrium (FIGO 1988 stage IA) between 9/1997–12/2007 were retrospectively identified. Follow-up data for at least 2 years was also collected, including diagnosis of a recurrence, symptomatology at that time, and method of detection. Costs for vaginal cytology were estimated using Medicare charge-to-cost ratios adjusted to 2010 costs.

Results

One hundred fifty-four patients met study inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.4 years and the mean follow-up was 46.9 months. Four recurrences were detected, occurring 16–73 months after the initial diagnosis. During a scheduled visit, one patient was found to have an asymptomatic vaginal cuff recurrence, detected on physical examination. The remaining three cases were diagnosed at an unscheduled visit after the presence of symptoms (vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, shortness of breath) prompted further evaluation. In all, cytology detected no cases of recurrence and the estimated cost associated with cytology alone for all patients over the study time frame was approximately $7,760 per year.

Conclusions

Patients with grade 1 endometrial cancer confined to the endometrium have a low risk of recurrence (2.6%) and were detected on clinical findings alone. Emphasis should be placed on counseling patients on symptoms of recurrence and performing a thorough physical examination. The elimination of vaginal cytology for this select group of patients may be appropriate and result in a significant reduction in health care costs.

### Conducting health policy analysis in primary care research: turning clinical ideas into action [^114hMRws]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Step 8. Sharing the results of the process

Sharing the results of the process may take the form of a narrative, and primary care researchers need to clearly understand the reasons behind their decision. Most importantly, primary care researchers need to define the audience and 'pitch' the story to a target population, keeping in mind both the larger political environment and the story-telling medium. In the exemplar, the results of the analysis were shared with a member of the USPSTF, and the full paper was sent for consideration as part of the USPSTF cervical cancer screening guidelines. Shortly afterwards, another paper demonstrated very low yield of any abnormalities in vaginal cytological smears obtained after total hysterectomy. In contrast to the first edition of the USPSTF guidelines, the second edition of the USPSTFprovided a recommendation against Pap smear screening after total hysterectomy for benign disease. An additional analysis published by the authors demonstrated poor cost-effectiveness of testing, and the USPSTF continues to recommend against Pap test after total hysterectomy for benign disease. When presenting findings and recommendations, the family physician should consider the audience and tailor the 'pitch' accordingly. If hospital administrators are the decision-makers, consider whether an oral presentation or a written policy document is warranted, or whether a combination of the two is best for communicating key points.

Using new media interventions, primary care researchers conducting health policy analysis can share their findings in an impactful way to inform, persuade and motivate their audience. Media interventions are often used to communicate health research to other health professionals, patients and policy makers through social media, including Twitter. Abstracts shared via Twitter infograph can elicit interest in a full report or manuscript and has the potential to effectively share health-related research to policy makers and the public. Depending on the specific topic, writing an op-ed or commentary for local or national professional journals, organisations or newspapers can help to stimulate public interest in the topic and catch the attention of policy makers. Rather than using one media strategy, primary care researchers doing health policy analysis should consider multiple strategies and messages tailored to specific target audiences. Strategies may shift depending on the audience, which can include the public, healthcare providers, grant funding agencies and policy makers.

### Risk factor and treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia after hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [^1119ESSw]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical records of patients who underwent total hysterectomy for CIN treatment from January 2001 to August 2019 at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. The institutional review board of our institution approved this study (B-2005–612–104).

A total of 374 patients histologically diagnosed with CIN 1, 2, 3, carcinoma in situ, and adenocarcinoma in situ who underwent total hysterectomy were included in this study. Patients diagnosed with cervical cancer or VaIN history preoperatively or concurrently diagnosed with VaIN were excluded. Patients who underwent radiation therapy on the pelvis preoperatively and those in immunosuppressed status were also excluded. Patients who underwent subtotal hysterectomy were also excluded. Hysterectomy was performed via laparotomy or minimal invasive surgery (MIS), including robotic and laparoscopic surgery. Resection margin after hysterectomy was considered to be involved when high-grade CINs were reported.

During the follow-up period after hysterectomy, PAP smear was performed at 3–6 months after hysterectomy. For the PAP smear, conventional cytology was used until 2003 and liquid-based cytology afterward. Colposcopy-directed biopsy was performed in case of abnormal cytology.

For VaIN treatment, laser ablation was applied for lesions at vaginal vault suture line and extending into dog ear according to the institutional protocol using a CO₂ laser (AcuPulse Model; Lumenis Lasers, Inc). Before laser vaporization, we applied 3% acetic acid and Lugol solution to demarcate the lesion.

Recurrence of VaIN 1, 2, 3, or vaginal cancer (1+) was defined as histological confirmation of VaIN 1, 2, 3, or vaginal cancer by colposcopy-directed biopsy during the follow-up period after the total hysterectomy. The second VaIN1+ recurrence was defined as a histological confirmation of VaIN 1, 2, 3, and vaginal cancer by punch biopsy during the follow-up observation after the VaIN1+ treatment. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the period from the time of negative PAP result after the VaIN1+ treatment after hysterectomy to the second VaIN1+ recurrence.

Clinical Question 5

What is the recommended surveillance after treatment of AIS?

Recommendation 5.1

For patients who undergo definitive management with hysterectomy, surveillance per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus guidelines is recommended for at least 25 years after diagnosis, even if that extends the testing period beyond the age of 65 years (CIII).

Recommendation 5.2

i) For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with Pap plus HPV co-testing and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for the first 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years or until hysterectomy is performed (BII).
ii) For patients who have consistently negative co-testing results in the first 5 years of surveillance, extending surveillance to every 3 years indefinitely is acceptable (CIII).

Literature Review

Owing to an increased risk of developing vaginal dysplasia after a history of cervical dysplasia, it is recommended that definitive surgical management should be followed by at least 25 years of surveillance per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines, with vaginal colposcopy performed to evaluate high-grade cytology results, persistent low-grade cytology results, or persistent positive HPV test results (two or more); although the HPV test is not currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved for vaginal screening or surveillance, the high negative predictive value of the test can identify those individuals who are at low risk for developing vaginal cancer. Management of abnormal vaginal cytology and positive HPV test results in this setting is beyond the scope of these management guidelines and is well-defined in the review article by Khan et al.

K.4 Managing patients after hysterectomy — If hysterectomy is performed for treatment, patients should have 3 consecutive annual HPV-based tests before entering long-term surveillance. Long-term surveillance after treatment for histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (CIN 2 or CIN 3) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) involves HPV-based testing at 3-year intervals for 25 years, regardless of whether the patient has had a hysterectomy either for treatment or at any point during the surveillance period. Among patients who have undergone hysterectomy but either have no previous diagnosis of CIN 2+ within the previous 25 years or have completed the 25 year surveillance period, screening is generally not recommended; if performed, abnormal vaginal screening test results should be managed according to published recommendations (BII). Although HPV testing is not FDA approved for vaginal samples, sensitivity of HPV-based testing in the posttreatment setting for histologic HSIL seems superior to cytology alone. For benign-disease hysterectomy patients who are screened, ASC-US HPV-positive and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology should be managed with follow-up in 12 months, and only high-grade cytology (HSIL, ASC-H, AGC) should be referred immediately for vaginal colposcopy.

### Clinical evaluation of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance upon cervical cytologic examination in Israeli jewish women [^116bTvc5]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

RESULTS

There were 45 patients (mean age 41.3 years) in the study cohort. The smears of 14 of them (31%) were reported as due to AGUS alone and 31 (69%) smears had coexistent squamous pathology. Seven (16%) patients had a recent history of abnormal vaginal or postcoital bleeding. Four patients had a history of nongynecologic cancer: three had breast cancer and one had carcinoma of the rectum. One of the patients was pregnant at the time of her AGUS cytology finding.

All 45 patients were colposcoped and biopsied shortly after AGUS was confirmed: 16 women (36%) underwent colposcopy with cervical biopsies, 29 (64%) underwent colposcopy with cervical biopsies and endocervical curettage, and 25 (55%) of the women who underwent cervical biopsies required diagnostic conisation during their workup. Since our protocol dictates that women with AGUS and without clear external lesions undergo endocervical curettage, the 16 women who had clear external lesions did not undergo this procedure.

shows the pathology identified in the smears of the study group. Table 2

Table 2
Histopathology in women with AGUS smears with and without coexistent squamous abnormalities

compares the pathology found in women with AGUS with and without concomitant squamous abnormalities. A patient diagnosed with coexistent ASCUS carried a risk factor of 61.3% for the existence of a clinically significant lesion, compared with a risk of 35.7% for AGUS alone. When Fischer's exact test was used to compare these groups, however, the women with coexistent squamous abnormalities detected by a Pap smear were not found to have significantly more cervical lesions than women with AGUS alone (P > 0.05). Only one of the 45 patients with AGUS was found to have adenocarcinoma of the cervix.

In total, 14 (31%) of the study patients were postmenopausal, and our results indicated that both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients were at risk for clinically significant lesions. Moreover, there was no difference between pre- and postmenopausal women in terms of pathology. Even so, endometrial biopsy is recommended in postmenopausal women with Pap-diagnosed AGUS who do not have an external lesion on cervical or endocervical biopsy. All of our postmenopausal study women had significant cervical lesions and did not require endometrial biopsy.

5 PREVENTION

5.1 Primary prevention (vaccination)

Persistent HPV infection — particularly the HPV 16 subtype — has been associated with the long‐term development of HSILs and carcinoma of the vagina. The introduction of the HPV vaccination as a primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer has also been shown to reduce the prevalence of non‐cervical premalignant lesions among vaccinated women. Long‐term trend analyses from the Norwegian Cancer Registry also show a promising decline in the incidence of HPV‐associated vaginal cancer in the coming years with HPV‐vaccinated populations. This is supported by a recent Danish study that reported a reduction in the rates of vaginal HSIL among vaccinated women aged 17–26 years, compared to their unvaccinated counterparts (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13–0.68).

5.2 Secondary prevention (screening)

There is no evidence to support routine screening for vaginal cancer after a hysterectomy performed for benign disease. However, if the hysterectomy was carried out for persistent HSIL after multiple cervical excisional procedures, long‐term follow‐up with vault smears and colposcopy is recommended.

In cases where screening for vaginal cancer is indicated, HPV testing has shown good correlation with cytologic findings. In addition, co‐testing appears to offer better diagnostic accuracy, particularly of recurrent disease during follow‐up after treatment for premalignant cervical lesions.

### Management of cervical cytologic abnormalities [^112cZma7]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology developed guidelines in 2001 for the management of cervical cytologic abnormalities. The guidelines incorporate the Bethesda System 2001 terminology and data from randomized studies of atypical squamous cells, low-grade intraepithelial lesions, human papillomavirus testing, and liquid-based cytology to formulate evidence-based recommendations. Each recommendation is graded according to the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence, and specific terminology is added to highlight management options. The effectiveness of each triage recommendation is determined by the percentage of grade 2 and 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia it detects. Colposcopy, repeat cytology, and human papillomavirus DNA testing are acceptable options in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, but human papillomavirus DNA testing is preferred if liquid-based cytology is used. Colposcopy is recommended for women with a diagnosis of "atypical squamous cells-cannot rule out high-grade intraepithelial lesion". Women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be referred for colposcopy, and women with high-grade lesions should undergo colposcopy and endocervical assessment. Colposcopy and endocervical sampling are recommended in women with all subcategories of atypical glandular cells. Endometrial sampling and colposcopy are recommended in women older than 35 years with atypical glandular cells and in younger women with unexplained vaginal bleeding. Women with a diagnosis of "atypical glandular cells-favor neoplasia" or adenocarcinoma-in-situ who are not found to have invasive disease on colposcopy should undergo a diagnostic excisional procedure, preferably a cold-knife conization.

Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Cytology, Histopathology, and Immunochemistry

While cytology can be helpful in the detection of vaginal pre-invasive lesions, in the individual who still has a cervix, the finding of dysplastic squamous cells, or metaplastic or glandular cells, does not necessarily indicate a diagnosis of VaIN or adenosis, as cervical contamination is possible. Thus, cytology is not considered a primary screening modality for these conditions. Vaginal cytology may also be utilized after therapy for follow-up of a treated vaginal lesion, as well as for follow-up of cervical pre-invasive and invasive disease in a patient who had a hysterectomy.

Immunohistochemistry is a useful tool for distinguishing between different types of vaginal pre-invasive lesions (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Immunohistochemistry in Vaginal Pre-invasive Lesions

High-grade VaIN (VaIN 2/3, vaginal HSIL) is most often found in association with previous or current cervical neoplasia, and is cytologically and histologically identical to that of the vulva and cervix. Cytology focuses on increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with irregular hyperchromatic nuclei. Histology shows maturation abnormality of the squamous epithelium at least two-thirds of the way up from the basement membrane. As in vulvar and cervical HSIL, the neoplastic cells have hyperchromatic irregular nuclei, and mitotic figures are often seen. p16 block positivity is an indicator of transforming hr-HPV infection and can be used to distinguish HSIL from its mimics, although LSIL is occasionally associated with hr-HPV and might show block positivity. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry will distinguish SIL from non-SIL, by extending above the basal layer, but this staining pattern will not distinguish LSIL from HSIL. Neither LASTnor the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for vaginal cancer describes criteria for a superficially invasive lesion.

Clinical Aspects

Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is an underdiagnosed disease. Due to the absence of symptoms, it is more often diagnosed after a positive cervical cytology and/or HPV test in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on colposcopy and/or biopsy, or during follow-up of patients previously treated for cervical disease.

Individuals at higher risk for development of VaIN are those:

With a history of cervical cancer or cervical HSIL,
Who had a hysterectomy for cervical HSIL
Who had previous irradiation for gynecological cancer
Immunosuppressed individuals
Post-menopausal individuals
Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposed patients.

Similar to other sites, atypical and fragile vessels, and lesions with an irregular surface and ulceration, are suspicious for invasive disease(Figure 3).

The application of Lugol's iodine solution (Schiller's test) is important in colposcopy of the vagina. Colposcopically, VaIN may present as iodine-negative epithelium only, similar to what is observed on the cervix in some cases(Figure 4). In post-menopausal patients with a marked atrophy of the vaginal mucosa the interpretation of Schiller's iodine test may be difficult. The application of a topical estrogen for up to 3–4 weeks before the exam is recommended.

### Vaginal dysplastic lesions in women with hysterectomy and receiving radiotherapy are linked to high-risk human papillomavirus [^1117VLVA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing radiotherapy for advanced cervical and endometrial cancer bear a considerable risk of developing vaginal preneoplastic lesions. Radiotherapy itself has been considered to have a role in the pathogenesis of vaginal dysplasia, although human papillomavirus (HPV) involvement has also been suggested. A series of 88 patients who underwent hysterectomy and were irradiated for gynecological cancer, including 43 with postradiation vaginal dysplasia at colposcopy and 45 without vaginal lesions, were included in this study. Detection and genotyping of HPV DNA in vaginal scraping were carried out by a PCR-based method and compared with colposcopic and cytological findings and with other clinical and laboratory data. Forty-two (97.7%) colposcopy-positive subjects and 6 (13.3%) colposcopically-negative patients were PCR-positive for high-risk HPV DNA (P < 0.000001). Twenty-two out of the 43 patients with colposcopic lesions showed an abnormal Papanicolau (PAP) test. Cytologic examination was negative in all colposcopically negative women. Type 16 HPV DNA was more frequent in patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and in patients treated with external radiotherapy, whereas other types of high-risk HPV were more common in patients with low-grade lesions and in those treated with brachytherapy. When considering colposcopy as the standard for diagnosing vaginal dysplasia, HPV DNA testing was more sensitive than the PAP test. However, the specificity of the PAP test was higher with no false-positive case. In conclusion, vaginal preneoplastic changes in women post-hysterectomy and receiving radiotherapy for cervical, endometrial, and vaginal cancer represent an HPV-related nosologic entity. Whereas colposcopic examination can detect these preneoplastic lesions, HPV genotyping is a sensitive, inexpensive, and noninvasive method that may complement colposcopy and the PAP test.

### Vaginal cancer, version 5.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112zpNWc]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Vaginal cancer — diagnostic assessment and workup emphasize considering alternative primaries and using biopsy-based confirmation. It is important to consider synchronous anorectal, cervical, endometrial, or vulvar primary with vaginal metastasis or extension, or recurrent disease from prior malignancy, and only a minority of vaginal cancers originate in the vagina, with the remaining generally metastatic from other sites. If vaginal lesion(s) involve the cervix or vulva, they are not considered vaginal cancer, and the appropriate treatment algorithm should be consulted. Biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing vaginal cancer and can be best accomplished by an examination under anesthesia (EUA) that should include inspection of the vaginal fornices and biopsies of the cervix. Workup for suspicious symptoms includes history and physical, pelvic exam (bimanual and rectovaginal), cervical evaluation and pap cytology, colposcopy, vulvar evaluation, imaging, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and testing for HPV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in select patients. Smoking cessation and counseling, as well as HIV testing (especially in younger patients), are recommended.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117QN96M]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV — vaginal and vulvar cancer prevention — Following hysterectomy for benign disease, routine screening for vaginal cancer is not recommended for people with HIV (AIII). People with a history of high-grade CIN, adenocarcinoma in situ, or ICC are at increased risk and should be followed with annual vaginal cuff cervical cytology (BIII), and for patients not known to have had a hysterectomy for a benign indication, continued screening is recommended since studies have shown that CIN is the most common indication for hysterectomy for people with HIV (CIII). For patients with abnormal vaginal cuff cervical cytology results with no visible vaginal colposcopic abnormalities, the use of Lugol's iodine to stain the vagina is recommended (AIII), and vaginal colposcopy also is indicated in the presence of concomitant cervical and vulvar lesions. No screening procedure is available for vulvar cancer; however, biopsy or referral is indicated when inspection/palpation identifies lesions suspicious for VIN or cancer. In a study in women with HIV with previous hysterectomy and no previous abnormal cervical cytology results, among those with vaginal biopsies, 29% had VAIN 2 or VAIN 3, although this retrospective study was limited due to sample size.

Vaginal Cancer Screening

We found no studies about screening for vaginal cancer or cancer precursors in populations at high risk. ASCCP recommends that women who have undergone hysterectomy and have a history of CIN 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ have ongoing surveillance at 3-year intervals for a total of 25 years. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that routine vaginal cancer screening is not recommended for women with HIV after a hysterectomy for benign disease. They recommend annual vaginal cuff Pap tests in patients after hysterectomy for high-grade CIN, adenocarcinoma in situ, or invasive cervical cancer. They recommend continued screening in patients not known to have had a hysterectomy for benign indications. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states, "Following hysterectomy for benign disease, routine screening for vaginal cancer is not recommended for persons with HIV. Those with a history of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), adenocarcinoma in situ, or invasive cervical cancer should be followed with annual vaginal cuff Pap tests". Recommendations for solid-organ transplantations comment on inspection of the vagina at the time of cervical screening.

Anal Cancer Screening

We found two studies pertinent to anal cancer screening in women with HIV. The ANCHOR study was an RCT that included 4,459 people with HIV who were diagnosed with anal HSIL on the basis of high-resolution anoscopy–directed biopsies. Eight hundred sixty participants (19.2%) were women living with HIV. After randomization, 2,237 patients underwent immediate treatment for anal HSIL, either through in-office ablation, ablation, or excision under anesthesia or through topical medical treatment with imiquimod or fluorouracil. They returned for repeat high-resolution anoscopy at least every 6 months after treatment. The active-monitoring group consisted of 2,222 patients who underwent high-resolution anoscopy every 6 months. Nine patients in the treatment group and 21 patients in the active-monitoring group were diagnosed with anal cancer. The observed rate of progression to cancer in the treatment group was 173 per 100,000 person-years, whereas it was 402 per 100,000 person-years in the active-monitoring group. The rate of progression to anal cancer decreased by 57% in patients who underwent treatment (95% CI 6–80%; p = 0.03).

### Diagnostic accuracy of cytology for the detection of endometrial cancer in urine and vaginal samples [^1174Bdkr]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer affecting women globally, with approximately 382,000 new diagnoses and 89,900 deaths from the disease in 2018. Most women present early following the onset of postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) and have an excellent prognosis, but 20% of women present with advanced disease, for whom 5-year survival rates are just 15%. New strategies to facilitate early diagnosis are urgently needed to enable curative hysterectomy for women who present with biologically aggressive disease.

Although the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer, only 5–10% of women with PMB have sinister underlying pathology. Current practice is to exclude malignant disease through sequential transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS), outpatient hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy; however, this diagnostic pathway has limitations. TVS lacks specificity as a triage tool, exposing a high proportion of healthy women to further tests. Failed outpatient hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy, mostly due to technical failure or intolerable pain, affects up to 31% of women, demanding repeat investigations under general anaesthetic –. Currently millions of women who do not have endometrial cancer undergo these invasive tests every year, with huge financial implications for health service providersand at a considerable personal cost to women. A simple, easy to administer, non-invasive test that can triage women with endometrial cancer for diagnostic testing whilst safely reassuring the vast majority of healthy women, would improve patient care.

Endometrial cancer is known to shed malignant cells through the cervix into the lower genital tract. Tumour DNA collected from cervical brushes and vaginal tampons demonstrate methylation levels and mutational profiles matching those of the endometrial cancer resected at hysterectomy –. Tumour cells have also been reported on routine cervical cytology samples in 45% of women with endometrial canceralthough cytology has not been formally tested in this regard. Cytology could be a useful tool for endometrial cancer detection because the expertise and infrastructure required to deliver it is already established in most healthcare settings. Advantages include low costs, quick turn-around times and the potential for point-of-care diagnosis. In Japan, endometrial cytology is a well-established endometrial cancer diagnostic tool, although it relies on invasive intrauterine sampling.

Here, we test the hypothesis that PMB offers a potential liquid biopsy to enable endometrial cancer detection in lower urogenital tract samples. We provide proof-of-principle that endometrial cancer can be detected by cytology in voided urine and non-invasive vaginal samples with high diagnostic accuracy, when assessors are blinded to cancer outcomes.

Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunocompromised Patients

Immunocompromised patients encompass HIV-infected individuals, patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and those suffering from autoimmune diseases. These patients are at increased risk for acquisition and persistence of HPV infection, development of anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia, and progression to invasive HPV-related cancers.– Given the low incidence of VaIN, the low prevalence of immunocompromised population, and the scientific interest for HPV persistence in the HIV-positive population, the only available evidence is about VaIN in HIV-infected patients.

HIV-positive patients show an incidence of VaIN of 0.2 per 100 person-years versus 0.01 per 100 person-years in HIV-negative individuals. In individuals living with HIV, VaIN presents at a median age of 39 years (vs 57 in HIV-negative), and is more frequently multifocal and multicentric. The strong HPV field effect in the whole lower genital tract is confirmed.

Rates of recurrence and progression of VaIN in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals are reported to be 44.8% and 3.4%, respectively, over a median of 68 months follow-up. No risk factors were identified for recurrence or progression, despite a trend in those who were HIV-positive.

Long-term follow-up of 335 post-hysterectomy patients (both for benign and malignant indications) found a 5-year clearance of abnormal cytology of 116/100 person-years in HIV-negative individuals and 34/100 person-years in HIV-positive patients, related to the severity of immunosuppression (CD₄⁺ cells count). However, most abnormal cytology reports reflect low grade disease or HPV transient infection, with 6.4% risk of ever having an HSIL or worse cytology over 12 years of observation. These data were confirmed in HIV-positive patients who underwent hysterectomy for benign conditions: among these patients, colposcopic-guided biopsy for abnormal cytology found VaIN in 29% cases, whereas in immunocompetent patients who underwent hysterectomy for benign conditions VaIN was found in only 0.1%.

### Abnormal vaginal pap test after hysterectomy in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women [^114oxVGf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of abnormal vaginal cytology and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) and vaginal cancer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women with no history of abnormal cytologic screening who had a hysterectomy for conditions other than cervical dysplasia and cancer; and to explore the risk factors associated with VAIN and vaginal cancer.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed identifying 238 women between January 2000 to January 2015 with a history of HIV, previous hysterectomy, and no previous abnormal Pap tests. Medical records from patients with both HIV and history of hysterectomy were reviewed from Thomas Street Health Center and Northwest Community Health Center.

Results

Among 238 women, 164(69%) had normal Pap test results, 12(5%) had results showing atypical cells of undermined significance and human papillomavirus-positive, 55(23.1%) had results showing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 7(2.9%) had results showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. No demographic risk factor was associated with abnormal Pap test after hysterectomy. Median follow-up time for the Pap test was 16 years. Of those who underwent vaginal biopsies for an abnormal Pap test, 15(28%) were normal, 23(43%) were VAIN1, 9(16%) were VAIN2, and 7(13%) were VAIN3. No patients had invasive vaginal cancer.

Conclusion

Over 30% of HIV-infected women who had no pre-hysterectomy history of an abnormal Pap test had abnormal vaginal Pap tests. Among those who had vaginal biopsies, 29% had VAIN2 or VAIN3, suggesting that Pap tests post-hysterectomy in the HIV population may be indicated.

### Understanding sexual and gender minority populations and organ-based screening recommendations for human papillomavirus-related cancers [^112Rva9b]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Vagina

Vaginal cancer is an uncommon HPV-related malignancy. In the United States, the reported incidence rate of vaginal cancer is 0.4 per 100,000 individuals. The prevalence of HPV is comparable in the vagina and cervix, although noncarcinogenic genotypes may be detected more frequently in individuals without a cervix. – However, the rarity of vaginal cancer in comparison with cervical cancer suggests that the cervical transformation zone may be uniquely susceptible to HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Because of the rarity of vaginal cancer, screening for vaginal cancer is not recommended in the general population.

In contrast, individuals who have had cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or cancer are at significantly increased risk of developing vaginal cancer. In individuals with cervical HSIL at the time of hysterectomy, the incidence rate of vaginal cancer in 25-year follow-up is 51.3 per 100,000, with an age-adjusted incidence rate ratio of 21 when compared with individuals with a benign cervical history. Similarly, individuals with a history of HSIL who underwent hysterectomy for benign indications have an incidence rate of 17.1 and an incidence rate ratio of 5.81. Current cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend that individuals who have had preinvasive lesions (HSIL/adenocarcinoma in situ) or invasive cervical cancer undergo continued surveillance testing for at least 25 years after treatment. Therefore, our recommendation concurs with current guidelines to continue surveillance in individuals with a history of cervical HSIL or cancer who subsequently undergo hysterectomy, with vaginal cytology and/or hrHPV testing, for at least 25 years after their treatment for cervical precancer. We further encourage clinicians performing gender-affirming hysterectomy to review the cervical cancer screening histories of patients to ensure adequate surveillance as well as avoid unnecessary screening in low-risk individuals.

### Clinical evaluation of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance upon cervical cytologic examination in Israeli jewish women [^116fL4gx]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The classification of glandular abnormalities was significantly revised in the 2001 Bethesda System, reflecting a reappraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of cytology in assessing these findings. According to that system, glandular cell abnormalities are classified as 'atypical endocervical, endometrial, or glandular cells'. In most cases, the morphological features of the condition enable differentiating between atypical endometrial and endocervical cells. The management of patients with glandular abnormalities may vary significantly, depending upon cell type, thus justifying making this distinction when possible.

### Hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a retrospective observational multi-institutional study [^1172r3pf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In about 5% of cases of this series, a vaginal lesion was recorded during follow‐up. It is established that the risk of vaginal cancer or VaIN is significantly increased in women who have had a hysterectomy for cervical cancer or CIN compared to patients with other indications for hysterectomy. Hysterectomized women with prevalent CIN have a 20‐fold increase in age‐adjusted risk, compared with hysterectomized women with benign cervical history, and the risk for hysterectomized women with a history of CIN3 is 15‐fold increased, compared to non‐hysterectomized women. Therefore, in these women, practicing an unjustified hysterectomy could lead to a higher risk of subsequent vaginal cancer. This risk remains elevated for at least 15 years. From our data, this risk appears lower than expected, probably because follow‐up time is brief in some women. Only 2% of women appeared to have an HG‐VaIN, while less than 1% of cases revealed vaginal cancer, but the short follow‐up does not allow firm conclusions. This could also be because of the particular attention paid to the control of the vaginal walls during excisional treatments, especially in referral centers for colposcopy. Moreover, the Italian recommendations of the SICPCVpay close attention to VaIN, recommending vaginal biopsy in case of colposcopic alterations; in the presence of multiple vaginal lesions, the biopsy should be targeted on vascular patterns, raised areas, or areas suggestive of vaginal invasive cancer.

The inherent biases of the retrospective study design represent the major weakness of this investigation. Another important limitation was the limited follow up of the study population. However, the relatively large sample size and the originality of the study (very few case series analyzed in the literature) are the main strengths of the research.

Considering the data collected in this Italian multicenter study and the trend recorded, hysterectomy for CIN can lead to complications, risk of the onset of vaginal lesions, and risk of overtreatment, and remains, in the first instance, an unacceptable treatment, to be proposed only after adequate counseling. The treatment of CIN should be as conservative as possible, even after menopause. At the same time, the undeniable increasing trend in using this procedure, even in referral centers, could underline the importance of tailoring treatments, also improving adherence to guideline recommendations. Further studies are needed to evaluate the trend of hysterectomies for CIN in the future, despite data collected in this study strengthening the importance of a conservative approach.

### Empiric vaginal metronidazole in the management of the ASCUS Papanicolaou smear: a randomized controlled trial [^116DXHQN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether empiric treatment with vaginal metronidazole in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) on Papanicolaou smear increases the number of cases that regress to normal on repeated cytologic studies.

Methods

A randomized double-masked trial was designed to compare women with ASCUS on screening Papanicolaou smear who received vaginal metronidazole, 37.5 mg twice daily, or placebo gel twice daily, for 5 days. Normalization of repeated Papanicolaou smear at 3 months was the primary end point. Regression to normal between the two groups was compared by χ² analysis. Power analysis required 45 women per study arm to demonstrate a 50% improvement in regression to normal among the metronidazole-treated women, at alpha = 0.05 and 80% power.

Results

One hundred and six tubes of gel were dispensed, 54 metronidazole and 52 placebo. Eighty-four women (79%) returned for repeated cytologic examination at a mean of 6.5 months. Overall, 50 women (60%) had normal findings on repeated cytologic examination, and 34 (40%) had persistent abnormal findings. Twenty-two women had repeated ASCUS, and 11 had squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) on repeated cytologic examination. Regression to normal was found in 22 (54%) metronidazole-treated women and 28 (65%) placebo recipients. The number of cases of repeated ASCUS (31% versus 25%) or SIL (15% versus 10%) were similar between the two groups.

Conclusions

Empiric vaginal metronidazole does not improve the management of women with ASCUS on Papanicolaou smear and should be discouraged.

Management of women with a histological diagnosis of CIN 2,3 — algorithmic options and follow-up in Figure 4 include that, for satisfactory colposcopy, either excision or ablation of T-zone is shown, and for unsatisfactory colposcopy or recurrent CIN 2,3, the path shows a diagnostic excisional procedure or hysterectomy in selected instances. Acceptable follow-up approaches post-treatment include cytology @ 6 mos intervals, cytology & colposcopy @ 6 mos intervals, or human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing performed @ 6–12 mos after treatment. If ≥ ASC (any repeat cytology), colposcopy with endocervical sampling is displayed; if HPV Negative (for high-risk types), the path proceeds to routine screening for at least 20 years.

K.4 Managing Patients After Hysterectomy

Guideline: After a diagnosis of high-grade histology or cytology, patients may undergo hysterectomy for reasons related or unrelated to their cervical abnormalities. If hysterectomy is performed for treatment, patients should have 3 consecutive annual HPV-based tests before entering long-term surveillance. Long-term surveillance after treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) or AIS involves HPV-based testing at 3-year intervals for 25 years, regardless of whether the patient has had a hysterectomy either for treatment or at any point during the surveillance period (CIII). Among patients who have undergone hysterectomy but either have no previous diagnosis of CIN 2+ within the previous 25 years or have completed the 25 year surveillance period, screening is generally not recommended. However, if performed, abnormal vaginal screening test results should be managed according to published recommendations (BII).

Rationale: The risk of high-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is elevated among patients who have had a hysterectomy for treatment of histologic HSIL. Although HPV testing is not FDA approved for vaginal samples, sensitivity of HPV-based testing in the setting of posthysterectomy for histologic HSIL seems superior to cytology alone. For patients who have undergone a hysterectomy for benign disease and are screened with cytology and/or HPV testing, ASC-US HPV-positive and LSIL cytology should be managed with follow-up in 12 months and only those with high-grade cytology (HSIL, ASC-H, AGC) should be referred immediately for vaginal colposcopy.

### Pap smears | AAFP… [^116kcMyt]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Don't perform Pap smears on women under the age of 21 or women who have had a hysterectomy for non-cancer disease. Sources: US Preventive Services Task Force, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In a 2012 report, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed research published since 2003 that evaluated liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus testing. The USPSTF also commissioned researchers to develop a computer model to calculate the frequency of cervical cancer screening and the ages at which to begin and end this screening. The USPSTF issued the following recommendation statements: The excerpt below is from the USPTF summary statement: "Screening with cervical cytology or HPV testing can lead to physical and emotional harms. Abnormal test results can lead to more frequent testing and invasive diagnostic procedures, such as colposcopy and cervical biopsy.

Evidence from randomized, controlled trials and observational studies indicates that harms from these diagnostic procedures include vaginal bleeding, pain, infection, and failure to diagnose. Abnormal screening test results are also associated with increased anxiety and distress. The harms of treatment also could include risks from the treatment procedure which are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery, that can lead to low birth weight in infants and perinatal death. Evidence is convincing that many precancerous cervical lesions will regress and that other lesions are so slow-growing that they will not become clinically important over a woman's lifetime; identification and treatment of these lesions constitute overdiagnosis.

It is difficult to estimate the precise magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with any screening or treatment strategy, but it is of concern because it confers no benefit and can lead to unnecessary surveillance, diagnostic tests, and treatments with the associated harms. " This recommendation is provided solely for informational purposes and is not intended as a substitute for consultation with a medical professional. Patients with any specific questions about this recommendation or their individual situation should consult their physician.

### Importance of colposcopy impression in the early diagnosis of posthysterectomy vaginal cancer [^11276ff7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

The current consensuses and guidelines for cervical cancer screening are adequate and regularly updated. – The current cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend that high-risk groups, such as women who have had cervical precancer (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HSIL]) or invasive cervical cancer, undergo continued surveillance testing for at least 20 years after treatment. Because of the rarity of vaginal cancer, there are currently no formal guidelines recommending screening for vaginal cancer in the general population. Many such women have cytology and/or co-testing (cytology and hrHPV testing) performed. This leaves clinicians with the dilemma of how to manage these abnormal vaginal screening tests. In addition, the available literature is significantly limited in terms of the development of evidence-based recommendations in managing abnormal vaginal cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening tests after hysterectomy.

In the largest women's hospital of China, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University (OGHFU), women, including those who are posthysterectomy or not, undergo regular cytology and/or hrHPV testing; those with abnormal screening reports are referred to colposcopy and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) was diagnosed with colposcopy-directed biopsy. The detection rate of total VaIN (VaIN 1 and VaIN 2/3) in all lower genital tract intraepithelial lesions was 11% (1,923/16,732, VaIN 1: 9% [1,561/16,732], VaIN 2/3: 2% [362/16,732]) on average with an increasing trend from 2013 to 2015 in our hospital. Generally, vaginal HSIL patients diagnosed with colposcopy-directed biopsy can be effectively treated with ablation and medication. In our hospital, carbon dioxide laser is routinely used to treat VaIN 2/3.

Under 2 circumstances, vaginectomy can be performed in posthysterectomy VaIN 2/3 patients to exclude cancer. First, colposcopy impression was suspicion of cancer. Second, extensive HSIL was present in upper vagina, including vaginal dimples where sufficient inspection and biopsy are hard to achieve. However, the value of cytology, hrHPV status, colposcopy, and vaginectomy in the diagnosis of vaginal cancer after hysterectomy remains unclear. Here, a retrospective study of vaginectomy was performed to systematically investigate their values in the early diagnosis of vaginal cancer after hysterectomy.

### Abnormal vaginal pap test results after hysterectomy in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women [^112gbFVG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of abnormal vaginal cytology and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) and vaginal cancer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women with no history of abnormal cytologic screening who had a hysterectomy for conditions other than cervical dysplasia and cancer and to explore the risk factors associated with VAIN and vaginal cancer.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed identifying 238 women between January 2000 and January 2015 with a history of HIV, previous hysterectomy, and no previous abnormal Pap test results. Medical records from patients with both HIV and a history of hysterectomy were reviewed from Thomas Street Health Center and Northwest Community Health Center.

Results

Among 238 women, 164 (69%) had normal Pap test results, 12 (5%) had results showing atypical cells of undermined significance and human papillomavirus-positive, 55 (23.1%) had results showing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and seven (2.9%) had results showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. No demographic risk factor was associated with abnormal Pap test results after hysterectomy. Median follow-up time for the Pap test was 16 years. Of those who underwent vaginal biopsies for abnormal Pap test results, 15 (28%) had normal results, 23 (43%) had VAIN 1, nine (16%) had VAIN 2, and seven (13%) had VAIN 3. No patients had invasive vaginal cancer.

Conclusion

More than 30% of HIV-infected women who had no prehysterectomy history of abnormal Pap test results had abnormal vaginal Pap test results. Among those who had vaginal biopsies, 29% had VAIN 2 or 3, suggesting that Pap testing posthysterectomy in the HIV population may be indicated.

### Cervical cancer screening among women by hysterectomy status and among women aged ≥ 65 years-United States, 2000–2010 [^111VSiaL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Since 2003, major U.S. organizations consistently have recommended against screening most women for cervical cancer after a total hysterectomy for benign disease. Starting in 2003 and becoming consistent across organizations in 2012, guidelines also state that women with a history of adequate screening no longer should be screened after age 65 years. Reports have shown that many of those women continue to receive Papanicolaou (Pap) testing, contrary to recommendations. To measure recent screening behaviors and trends in accordance with evidence-based recommendations, biennial cross-sectional data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) on women aged ≥ 30 years were analyzed and stratified by hysterectomy status and by age (30–64 years and ≥ 65 years). The proportion of women reporting having had a hysterectomy who reported a recent (within 3 years) Pap test declined from 73.3% in 2000 to 58.7% in 2010. Declines among women having had a hysterectomy were significant among those aged 30–64 years, from 81.0% in 2000 to 68.5% in 2010, and among those aged ≥ 65 years, from 62.0% to 45.0%. Among women aged ≥ 65 years with no history of hysterectomy, recent Pap testing also declined significantly, from 73.5% to 64.5%. Although recommendations have resulted in reductions in screening posthysterectomy and of those aged ≥ 65 years, many women still are being screened who will not benefit from it.

### The incidence of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 2 + in patients with previous hysterectomy cervival intraepithelial neoplasia 3 + between 2005–2015: a population-based study [^11518vq7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In light of the rarity of vaginal cancer, the role of vaginal vault testing following hysterectomy for preinvasive or early cervical cancers is unclear. The objective was to determine the subsequent risk of VaIN2/3, and invasive vaginal cancer following hysterectomy, and to potentially identify individuals at higher risk who may benefit from vaginal vault testing.

Methods

The authors performed a population-based retrospective study using administrative databases to identify the study population. They identified patients who between 2005–2015 underwent hysterectomy after cervival intraepithelial neoplasia 3+ (CIN3+)/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and calculated the rate of VAIN2 and invasive vaginal cancer. Exclusion criteria are as follows: < 21 years and CIN3+ diagnosis prior to 2005. Patients were followed until 2021.

Results

During the study period, 6,230 patients underwent hysterectomy for a diagnosis of CIN3+/AIS. The subsequent rates of VaIN2/3, in situ, and invasive cancer were 1.9% (119/6,230) and 0.3 (18/6,230), respectively. Of these, most (84.7%) were made within 5 years of hysterectomy and remained stable over time (2.0% in 2005–2009, 2.4% in 2010–2015). However, only 54% of patients had vault cytology after hysterectomy; among these, 8.2% were abnormal of which 22.8% were diagnosed with VAIN2+. In addition, the risk of VaIN2+ was 5.8% when there was residual CIN3+ versus 2.1% when absent.

Conclusions

Individuals with evidence of CIN3+/AIS at time of hysterectomy are at elevated risk of developing VAIN 2+, with the highest risk occurring within 5 years from surgery. Vault cytology within 1 year of surgery will identify most cases of VAIN2+, but further data monitoring and integration of HPV testing will be required to determine this screening strategy.

### Abnormal pathology following vaginal hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse repair [^116kjDrT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective: Uterine-sparing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair has shown good results, but the potential negative implications of leaving the uterus in place are yet to be fully defined. We aimed to assess the risk of unanticipated abnormal gynecological pathology at the time of reconstructive pelvic surgery. Methods: A retrospective consecutive case series including women who underwent vaginal hysterectomy for POP repair at a tertiary medical center in 2006–2020. All patients were offered a free Pap smear test at the age of 65 years as part of a national screening program. Transvaginal ultrasound was routinely performed preoperatively. Standard 3 pedicle hysterectomy was performed with/without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). Results: The study comprised 462 women of mean age 63 ± 9.3 years without previous known malignant or premalignant pathology. Benign pathology was observed in 286 patients (61.9%). Endometrial malignancy was found in three patients (0.7%) and significant premalignant pathology in 15 patients (3.2%), including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 2–3 in seven patients (1.5%) and complex hyperplasia with atypia in eight patients (1.7%). All these pathologies were found in postmenopausal women. None had preoperative clinical symptoms or endometrial thickness of ≥ 5 mm on preoperative ultrasound. In the 35 patients after BSO, adnexal findings were normal (77.2%) or benign (22.8%). Conclusions: Premenopausal women with uterovaginal prolapse and normal preoperative evaluation have a minimal risk of significant abnormal uterine pathology. In postmenopausal women, the risk of unanticipated malignant uterine pathology is 0.7% and 3.2% for significant premalignancy.

### Hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a retrospective observational multi-institutional study [^116JZdQj]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2019 recommendations of the Italian Society of Colposcopy and Cervical‐Vaginal Pathology (SICPCV), and in the Italian guidelines of 2002 and 2006, in the presence of cervical HSIL, hysterectomy is defined as an unacceptable treatment. This procedure is acceptable, after informed consent, only if it is not possible to carry out or to repeat a diagnostic excision or in case of an impossible adequate follow‐up. For example, when multiple treatments, technical difficulties in the surgical approach to the residual cervix, untreatable stenosis of the cervical canal, vaginal stenosis are encountered. In the absence of other indications, and regardless of the age and obstetric history of the woman, hysterectomy could be harmful because of surgical complications and for the limitations of subsequent follow‐up.

Some reports highlighted that the risk of vaginal cancer or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) is significantly increased (5%–10%) in women who have had a hysterectomy for cervical cancer or CIN. A recent study, evaluating the outcome of a large cohort of Swedish patients undergoing hysterectomy for CIN, found an incidence rate of vaginal cancer of 51.3 per 100 000. The risk of vaginal cancer was increased after hysterectomy for women with benign cervical history as well (Incident Rates, IR 3.65). Compared to the general population (IR‐ratios 0.37) their risk was more than doubled. Very few other studies are available in the literature. Among these, a Dutch studypointed out that about 3% of CIN3 is still being treated with hysterectomy.

Data about trend of hysterectomy rate performed for CIN and about outcomes of patients with CIN undergoing this procedure are limited, and the compliance with national and international guidelines has been poorly assessed, making clear the importance of carrying out further studies.

The present study was aimed at analyzing the clinical management, the outcomes, and the trend in hysterectomy rates in patients who underwent this procedure for CIN between 2010 and 2020, across Italian referral centers. The study was conducted under the patronage of the SICPCV.

### Usefulness of vaginal cytology tests in women with previous hysterectomy for benign diseases: assessment of 53, 891 tests [^1153H7JM]. Gynecologic Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the value of vaginal screening cytology after hysterectomy for benign disease.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used cytology audit data from 2,512,039 screening tests in the metropolitan region of Campinas from 2000 to 2012; the object was to compare the prevalence of abnormal tests in women who had undergone a hysterectomy for benign diseases (n = 53,891) to that of women who had had no hysterectomy. Prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI) were determined, and chi-square analysis, modified by the Cochrane-Armitage test for trend, was used to investigate the effects of age.

Results

The prevalence of atypical squamous cells (ASC), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or squamous-cell carcinoma (HSIL/SCC) was 0.13%, 0.04% and 0.03%, respectively, in women who had undergone hysterectomy, and 0.93%, 0.51% and 0.26% in women who had not undergone hysterectomy. The prevalence ratios for ASC, LSIL and HSIL/SCC were 0.14 (0.11–0.17), 0.08 (0.06–0.13) and 0.13 (0.08–0.20), respectively, in women with a hysterectomy versus those without. For HSIL/SCC, the prevalence ratios were 0.09 and 0.29, respectively, for women < 50 or ≥ 50 years. The prevalence rates in women with a previous hysterectomy showed no significant variation with age.

Conclusion

The prevalence rates of ASC, LSIL and HSIL/SCC were significantly lower in women with a previous hysterectomy for benign disease compared with those observed in women with an intact uterine cervix. This study reinforces the view that there is no evidence that cytological screening is beneficial for women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 99: management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology [^111ZaXx7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence has shown that the risk of malignant and premalignant cervical disease and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections varies significantly with age (1,2). Furthermore, evidence now shows that treatment for cervical disease carries significant risk for future pregnancies (3–7). These factors have led to a re-evaluation of the guidelines for the management of premalignant cervical disease. The purpose of this document is to define strategies for diagnosis and management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology results. In this document, HPV refers to high-risk oncogenic forms of the virus.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^117XUFtx]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

After the initial diagnostic procedure, hysterectomy is the preferred management for all patients who have a histologic diagnosis of AIS, although fertility-sparing management for appropriately selected patients is acceptable. For patients with confirmed AIS with negative margins on the excisional specimen, simple hysterectomy is preferred. For patients with confirmed AIS with positive margins on the excisional specimen, re-excision to achieve negative margins is preferred, even if hysterectomy is planned. For patients with AIS and persistent positive margins for whom additional excisional procedures are not feasible, either a simple or modified radical hysterectomy is acceptable. After hysterectomy, surveillance per the ASCCP surveillance guidelines for treated CIN 2+ is recommended (Section J.3).

For patients of reproductive age who desire future pregnancy, fertility-sparing management with an excisional procedure is acceptable provided that negative margins have been achieved on the excisional specimen, and the patient is willing and able to adhere to surveillance recommendations. If negative margins cannot be achieved after maximal excisional attempts, fertility-sparing management is not recommended. For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with cotesting and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for at least 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years, or until hysterectomy is performed. For patients who have consistently negative cotesting and endocervical sampling results for 5 years, extending the surveillance interval to every 3 years starting in the sixth year of surveillance is acceptable. Small retrospective studies have shown HPV test results to be the best predictor for recurrent disease. Therefore, for patients who have consistently negative cotesting and endocervical sampling results, continued surveillance is acceptable after completion of childbearing. For patients who have had positive HPV test results or abnormal cytology/histologic results during surveillance, hysterectomy at the completion of childbearing is preferred (see Figure 11).

### Self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV testing: recommendations from the enduring consensus cervical cancer screening and management guidelines committee [^112bKUpz]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATION #4: When self-collected vaginal specimen HPV test results are: a) positive for HPV (untyped), b) negative for HPV 16/18 and positive for HPV HR12 (other); or c) negative for HPV 16/18 and positive for HPV 45, 33/58, 31, 52, 35/39/68, 51 or combinations thereof, obtaining a clinician-collected cervical specimen for cytology or dual stain is recommended. Subsequent management of cytology or dual-stain results per management guidelines is recommended (AII).

FIGURE 1
Summary of management for positive HPV screening test results with self-collected and clinician-collected specimens for settings using cytology (either as a cotest or triage test). Abbreviations: AGC indicates atypical glandular cells; ASC-H, atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL; ASC-US, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; CIN, cervical intrepithelial neoplasia; HPV, human papillomavirus; HSIL, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; LSIL, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; NILM, negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy; < CIN2, CIN1 or less; CIN2+, CIN2, CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ, cancer. In nonpregnant patients, endocervical curettage recommended for AGC; endometrial biopsy recommended if cytology specifies atypical endometrial cells and for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 35 and patients aged < 35 if risk factors for endometrial neoplasia present (e.g. abnormal uterine bleeding, conditions suggesting anovulation, obesity). Colposcopy or treatment is acceptable for results of untyped HPV with ASC-H or HSIL cytology; expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16-positive HSIL cytology) and for never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL cytology regardless of HPV genotype. Normal screening history documented in medical record, and/or patient is in the general screening population and has no known history of CIN2+. Cytology triage is not recommended for primary HPV screening with results positive for HPV59/56/66; this guideline may be used if cytology results are obtained. Note: For patients with a history of high-grade histology, high-grade cytology (HSIL or persistent ASC-H) or following treatment (or observation of CIN2), 2019 guidelines should be followed.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: cervical cancer, version 1.2024 [^117XtT6t]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Cervical cancer — surveillance after treatment: The Panel agrees with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's recommendations, and history and physical examinations are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, every 6 to 12 months for another 3 to 5 years, and then annually; patients with high‑risk disease can be assessed more frequently (eg, every 3 months for the first 2 years) than those with low‑risk disease (eg, every 6 months). Annual cervical/vaginal cytology tests can be considered as indicated for detection of lower genital tract dysplasia; the Panel does not recommend workup of low‑grade squamous dysplasia detected during surveillance, but suggests that patients should follow up with a provider with specific expertise in this area, and it is important to emphasize good clinical evaluation and a high index of suspicion because the detection rate of recurrent cervical cancer is low using cervical and vaginal cytology alone.

### A randomized controlled trial of metronidazole vaginal cream in the treatment of Papanicolaou smears showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) [^111VuYR8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare topical metronidazole gel vs. placebo to assess resolution to normal in subsequent Pap smears of patients with ASCUS.

Materials and Methods

Patients with ASCUS pap smears were randomized to metronidazole or placebo. Resolution of ASCUS vs. persistence, or progression, was the endpoint. A subanalysis stratified patients for bacterial vaginosis (BV) to determine if this population responded differently. Discrete variables were compared using chi-square analysis.

Results

Forty-nine patients received metronidazole and 52 received placebo. The rate of resolution in the placebo group were 60%, and 67% in the metronidazole group. With BV, the rate of resolution in the placebo group was 67%, and 70% in the metronidazole group. These were not significantly different.

Conclusions

Treatment of ASCUS Pap smears using topical metronidazole did not demonstrate a significant increase in the rate of resolution in subsequent Pap smears in the overall group nor in a subgroup with BV.

### Abnormal cervical smear in hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia: a case report [^1152FDSs]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia is a disorder that involves the mucosa, skin, hair, eyes, and lungs. It is an autosomal dominant condition, although sporadic cases have been reported. The syndrome is caused by an abnormality in desmosomes and gap junctions. We report a case of abnormal cervical smear in an affected individual. Vaginal, oral, and urinary cytological smears show a lack of epithelial cell maturation, large paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuoles, and cytoplasmic strand-shaped inclusions. Abnormal Pap cervical tests have been reported in affected individuals. It has been found that a misinterpretation of abnormal from a cervical smear may lead to an unnecessary hysterectomy. We believe this disorder should be brought to the attention of colposcopists because misinterpreted abnormal cervical Pap tests can lead to unnecessary treatment in such affected individuals.

### Diagnostic accuracy of cytology for the detection of endometrial cancer in urine and vaginal samples [^117W1Dwf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cytological assessment of urine and vaginal samples

Urine and vaginal samples were preserved with an equal volume of CRR (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey) and transferred to the Manchester Cytology Centre at MFT. Once there, samples were centrifuged at 1614× g for 5 min. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet fixed in 6 mL CRR for 1 h. After fixation, the sample was centrifuged at 403× g for 10 min, supernatant decanted and the pellet prepared as a liquid-based cytology (LBC) Papanicalaou stained slide using the BD prepstain (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stained slide was dehydrated in two changes of industrial methylated spirits, cleared in two changes of xylene and cover-slipped. All slides were reviewed by three independent observers, a consultant biomedical scientist (BMS) in cytopathology and two consultant specialist cytopathologists, with discrepant cases settled by consensus review at a multi-header microscope. Slides were reported as unsatisfactory (sample obscured by debris, lymphocytes, bacteria or paucicellular sample), negative (benign urothelial and/or squamous epithelial cells) or positive (glandular, atypical or malignant cells seen). Positive cytology included atypical cells of undetermined significance (ACUS, occasional small atypical, degenerate cells), glandular cells (unexpected finding in postmenopausal woman) or malignant (single and/or clusters of epithelial cells with malignant features, specifically high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, vacuolated or minimal non-vacuolated cytoplasm, enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear outlines).

Blinding

Women with unexplained PMB were sampled before clinical examination and any routine diagnostic tests, when researchers were blinded to cancer outcomes. The cytopathologists/BMS were blinded to patient identity, the results of clinical investigations and cancer outcomes until they had given their final report.

Primary and secondary outcomes

The pre-specified primary outcome was abnormal, suspicious or malignant glandular cells in urine and/or vaginal samples by cytology. Diagnostic accuracy was determined against routine histopathology on either the endometrial biopsy or hysterectomy specimen. Women with non-malignant causes of PMB were followed up for any subsequent referral or presentation to our service until May 2019; this was used as reference standard for women with no histopathology results.

For women aged over 65 years with adequate prior screening, "the benefit of Pap smears is little to none, but the harms are at least "small". The page adds that "The USPSTF makes a "D" recommendation against screening women aged over 65 years that are at low risk for cervical cancer and have had negative results from prior screenings". It further notes that "once a patient stops receiving screenings, in general they should not restart screenings", and that in women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease without a history of cervical cancer or high-grade lesions, "cervical cancer screening provides no benefits to these patients and may subject them to potential risks from false-positive results, including physical (e.g., vaginal bleeding from biopsies) or psychological (e.g., anxiety) distress".

### Self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV testing: recommendations from the enduring consensus cervical cancer screening and management guidelines committee [^111edS3C]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Based on all data available, we have strong evidence that HPV testing of self-collected vaginal specimens has better sensitivity and overall accuracy than cytology for detection of CIN3+ in the screening setting. Patients in the screening setting are asymptomatic individuals presenting for screening with a history of all normal results, no history of high-grade abnormal results, a remote history of low-grade abnormal results with at least 3 subsequent HPV-negative results, or without available history. Data are somewhat heterogeneous regarding agreement between the results of self-collected vaginal and clinician-collected cervical specimens for precancer detection. Some studies suggest equivalence although others suggest a small decrease in sensitivity, (Table 2). Studies are heterogeneous with respect to populations, sampling devices, sample handling, and HPV assays used. The cross-sectional data summarized in systematic reviews strongly support a 3-year interval. Five-year data following a negative self-collected HPV test result are currently not available to estimate risks that would directly inform longer intervals. Three-year intervals provide a margin of safety in the interim while additional data accrue. If additional data support the equivalence of self-collected vaginal specimens and clinician-collected cervical specimens, the recommended interval can be extended to 5 years in the future.

RECOMMENDATION #3: When self-collected vaginal specimens are positive for HPV 16 and/or 18, direct referral for colposcopy with concurrent cytology collection is recommended (AII).

Rationale

Human papillomavirus 16 and 18 infections confer an elevated risk of CIN3+. Colposcopy has therefore been recommended in prior guidelines; these recommendations are continued for self-collection. The recommendation to perform colposcopy when HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 are detected applies in all settings (e.g. screening, after colposcopy, after treatment). Evidence supports concordance of self- and clinician-collected specimens for HPV 16 and 18 (Table 3), and therefore equivalent management is warranted. As described in the 2019 guidelines, collection of cervical cytology at the colposcopy visit is recommended because additional diagnostic testing and surveillance is recommended for Atypical Glandular Cells (AGC), and for Atypical Squamous Cells cannot exclude High-grade (ASC-H) or High-grade Squamous Intraeipthelial Lesion (HSIL) cytology with colposcopic biopsy results of less than CIN2.(See Figures 1 and 2)

CONCLUSIONS

Colposcopy is pivotal in not only the evaluation of abnormal cytology/hrHPV tests after hysterectomy but also decision-making for vaginectomy in the detection of early cancer.

### Screening history of women with cervical cancer: a 6-year study in aarhus, Denmark [^11777XGG]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study population consisted of 286 patients identified electronically with histologically verified cervical cancer during the period 1 January 1997 to 30 October 2002 in Aarhus County (322 209 female inhabitants in 2000) by cervical biopsy, cervical abrades, conisation or hysterectomy specimens. The results of all previous cervical smears (CS) and histological samples from each patient were subsequently found in the national pathology databank, and registered according to the diagnostic categories of WHO. Information on age and tumour stage at diagnosis (ad modem FIGO) was obtained from medical records. Patients were distinguished according to whether they were diagnosed by the screening programme or because of symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge or pain.

A 'trigger smear' was defined for each patient as the smear leading to further examination. For the majority of patients with cervical cancer, the trigger smear, or more rarely a histological sample, started a 'diagnostic period' that continued for up to 5 months. To evaluate the previous screening process in each woman, we defined an 'intervention period' from 5 to 47 months before the diagnosis, during which a possible preinvasive stage or earlier cancer diagnosis should ideally have been detected. An intervention period of 42 months was chosen to give the women a 6-month period to respond to an invitation, as used previously. In the collected data, patients were scored into six different groups based on the screening history:
'Failure to screen in the intervention period' included women whose last smear was taken outside the recommended screening interval;
'Never screened' included women who were never screened previously;
'Failure in detection' included women having a CS in the intervention period reported as normal. This group could be the false-negative results of PAP screening (either due to an inadequate or poor smear or failure in reading the smear), as one would expect at least a precancerous diagnosis within 3.5 years before an invasive cancer;
'Abnormal CS and adequate follow-up' included women having an abnormal smear result in the intervention period and receiving adequate follow-up afterward;
'Failure in follow-up' included women with abnormal CS in the intervention period and no or delayed follow-up before the trigger CS (i.e. a trigger delay). The registered trigger smear could either be upon a new invitation, after symptoms or the result of an inadequate follow-up guidance;
'Other screening history' included patients outside the other groups and consisted of women already in a follow-up (e.g. after conisation).

The following additional management considerations are associated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:

Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be considered screening tests for STIs.
All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer screening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity (i.e. those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual, or transgender).
A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is smeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for 10–20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based cytology can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle.
If specific infections other than HPV (e.g. chlamydia or gonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test after appropriate treatment for those infections might be indicated. However, in most instances (even in the presence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology tests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and reliable final reports can be produced without the need to repeat the cytology test after treatment.
The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not postpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after removal of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.
HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or by using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.
In the absence of other indications, the presence of external genital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical cancer screening.
The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection of other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test results or their interpretation. Typically, vaginal specimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical specimens for STI testing can be collected first.
Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal of the cervix do not require screening unless cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years. If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical hysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be performed as indicated.
Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test collection and use simple quality assurance measures are more likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined by the laboratory).
The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical transformation zone (e.g. cytobrushes) improves the accuracy of cytology tests.
Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable because they have similar test-performance characteristics.
At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their recent cytology test and HPV results and any history of evaluation and treatment (e.g. loop electrosurgical excision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with management; effort should be made to obtain copies of recent results. The importance and frequency of screening should be reinforced.

### A common clinical dilemma: management of abnormal vaginal cytology and human papillomavirus test results [^112c9hiD]. Gynecologic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Vaginal cancer is an uncommon cancer of the lower genital tract, and standardized screening is not recommended. Risk factors for vaginal cancer include a history of other lower genital tract neoplasia or cancer, smoking, immunosuppression, and exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. Although cervical cancer screening after total hysterectomy for benign disease is not recommended, many women inappropriately undergo vaginal cytology and/or human papillomavirus (hrHPV) tests, and clinicians are faced with managing their abnormal results. Our objective is to review the literature on vaginal cytology and hrHPV testing and to develop guidance for the management of abnormal vaginal screening tests.

Methods

An electronic search of the PubMed database through 2015 was performed. Articles describing vaginal cytology or vaginal hrHPV testing were reviewed, and diagnostic accuracy of these tests when available was noted.

Results

The available literature was too limited to develop evidence-based recommendations for managing abnormal vaginal cytology and hrHPV screening tests. However, the data did show that 1) the risk of vaginal cancer in women after hysterectomy is extremely low, justifying the recommendation against routine screening, and 2) in women for whom surveillance is recommended, e.g. women post-treatment for cervical precancer or cancer, hrHPV testing may be useful in identification of vaginal cancer precursors.

Conclusion

Vaginal cancer is rare, and asymptomatic low-risk women should not be screened. An algorithm based on expert opinion is proposed for managing women with abnormal vaginal test results.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^114p1Pzp]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

6 Guidelines apply to all individuals with a cervix. Guidelines apply to women and transgender men with a cervix, including individuals who have undergone supracervical hysterectomy. Risk estimates were validated in individuals of diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and shown to be comparable. Though not the primary focus of the 2019 guidelines, management recommendations are also provided for patients who have undergone hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and who have a previous diagnosis of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 2/3, CIN 3, and/or AIS, irrespective of whether the hysterectomy was performed for precancer treatment or another indication.

7 Equal management for equal risk. History and current test results are used to calculate a patient's current and future risk of CIN 3+. Similar risks are managed similarly, regardless of the combination of results/history used to estimate the risk.

8 Balancing benefits and harms. Providing the best care means balancing cancer prevention with overtesting and overtreatment. Preventing all cervical cancers is unfortunately not an achievable goal. Interventions to prevent cervical cancer can cause harm. The 2019 guidelines are designed to maximize cervical cancer prevention and minimize harms from overtesting and overtreating by managing patients according to their current and future risks of CIN 3+. High-risk patients require closer follow-up to maximize detection of CIN 3+, whereas low-risk patients require fewer tests and procedures.

9 Guidelines apply to asymptomatic patients that require management of abnormal cervical screening test results. Patients with symptoms such as abnormal uterine or vaginal bleeding or a visibly abnormal-appearing cervix require appropriate diagnostic testing as this may be a sign of cancer. This evaluation may include cervical cytology, colposcopy, diagnostic imaging, and cervical, endocervical, or endometrial biopsy. Guidelines cannot cover all clinical situations and clinical judgment is advised, especially in those circumstances which are not covered by the 2019 guidelines.

10 Guidelines are intended for use in the United States. Appropriate management may differ in countries with limited follow-up capabilities, less availability of colposcopy, limited pathology infrastructure, or different views of the trade-offs between cancer risk, cost, and overtesting/overtreatment.

Atypical endocervical, endometrial, or glandular cells not otherwise specified (NOS) — postcolposcopy follow-up when HPV status is known: For women without CIN 2,3 or glandular neoplasia identified histologically, the recommended management is to repeat cytological testing combined with HPV DNA testing at 6 months if HPV DNA positive and at 12 months if HPV DNA negative (CII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for high-risk (oncogenic) HPV DNA or who are found to have atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater on repeat cytology; if both tests are negative, women can return to routine cytological testing (BII).

Preventing vaginal and vulvar cancer in women with HIV after hysterectomy: Following hysterectomy for benign disease, routine screening for vaginal cancer is not recommended for women who are HIV seropositive (AIII); however, women with a history of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), adenocarcinoma in situ, or invasive cervical cancer are at increased risk and should be followed with an annual vaginal cuff Pap test (BIII); although vaginal Pap tests are often abnormal in women with HIV infection and more common than in women without HIV infection, VAIN 2+ and vaginal cancers are infrequent; among women with HIV infection with previous hysterectomy and no previous abnormal Pap test, among those with vaginal biopsies, 29% had VAIN 2 or VAIN 3; for patients with abnormal vaginal cuff Pap test results with no visible vaginal colposcopic abnormalities, the use of Lugol's iodine to stain the vagina is recommended (AIII), vaginal colposcopy is indicated when concomitant cervical and vulvar lesions are present, classification of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) parallels that of the cervix (VAIN 1, VAIN 2, and VAIN 3), and no screening procedure is available for vulvar cancer, with biopsy or referral indicated when inspection/palpation identifies lesions suspicious for VIN or cancer.

### Vaginal hysterectomy for uterovaginal prolapse: what is the incidence of concurrent gynecological malignancy? [^111uU3ZE]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Vaginal hysterectomy (VH) is a commonly performed procedure for the operative treatment of uterovaginal prolapse (UVP). The reported incidence of unexpected gynecological cancer in cases of VH for UVP ranges between 0.3 and 0.8%. Aim of the study is to assess the incidence of malignant and premalignant gynecological histopathological findings among women who underwent a VH for UVP and had a normal preoperative workup.

Methods

The histopathology reports of women who underwent VH for the treatment of UVP were retrospectively assessed. All women had a history of normal cervical smear tests and a normal preoperative transvaginal scan. Patients with a history of a premalignant or malignant gynecological pathological condition and women with abnormal uterine bleeding were excluded.

Results

Overall, 14 out of 333 women who underwent VH (4.2%) were found to have abnormal histopathological findings of the uterus. Among them, there were 9 cases of endometrial hyperplasia of any type (2.7%), 1 case of cervical cancer (0.3%), 1 case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III (0.3%), and 3 cases of CINI (0.9%). No cases of endometrial cancer were detected. Among women who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy (n = 86) three simple serous cysts (3.5%) were found, with no cases of ovarian cancer.

Conclusions

The incidence of unexpected premalignant or malignant gynecological pathological conditions among asymptomatic women who underwent VH, with a history of normal cervical smear tests and normal preoperative TVS, was low but not negligible. This information should be included in the preoperative counseling of women planning to undergo surgery for UVP.

### Papanicolaou smears are of little value in the post-treatment surveillance of patients with ovarian epithelial cancer [^112uMYJf]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

275 consecutive patients with ovarian epithelial cancer had routine brush vaginal vault cytology performed as part of routine post-treatment surveillance for recurrent disease screening. No patient with stage I or II disease (75 patients total) developed either recurrent vaginal vault disease or had an abnormal Pap smear indicating recurrent adenocarcinoma or even atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGCUS). Of the 200 patients with stage III or IV disease there were four vaginal vault recurrences (three macroscopic, one microscopic); all of these recurrences had recurrent disease elsewhere and none were detected on the basis of Papanicolaou smear alone. Papanicolaou smear may be safely omitted as part of any post-treatment surveillance protocol for patients with ovarian epithelial cancers.

FIGURE 9
This figure describes management of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by HSIL cytology.

FIGURE 10
This figure describes management of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by ASC-H cytology.

Rationale: Patients with a diagnosis of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) after HSIL and ASC-H cytology have 1-year CIN 3+ risks of 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Because HSIL cytology is associated with a higher risk than ASC-H cytology, colposcopy is recommended in addition to HPV-based testing at the 1-year follow-up if excision is not elected. Failure to detect CIN 2+ at colposcopy in patients with HSIL cytology does not mean that a CIN 2+ lesion has been excluded, although occult carcinoma is unlikely. As a result, patients with HSIL cytology who do not have immediate diagnostic excision require close follow-up. Few studies of HSIL cytology managed without treatment have been reported, and follow-up in those is limited; management relies on expert opinion. Of note, at all colposcopic examination when no lesion is identified on the cervix, the vagina and vulva must be examined for vaginal or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.

### Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance from extramammary Paget's of the bladder [^111geUG9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance and appropriate diagnostic evaluation of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGCUS) on cervicovaginal Papanicolaou test have not been well established.

Case

A 53-year-old woman with AGCUS underwent colposcopy, cervical biopsy, hysteroscopy, dilation and fractional curettage, and subsequently hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without abnormal findings. A repeat vaginal Papanicolaou test revealed malignant cells. Extramammary Paget's disease and urothelial carcinoma in situ were subsequently determined to be the source of the abnormal cells interpreted as AGCUS.

Conclusion

AGCUS may be associated with extramammary Paget's disease and urothelial carcinoma. One should maintain a high index of suspicion for extragenital causes of persistent AGCUS.

### Effect of human immunodeficiency virus infection on the prevalence and incidence of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia [^1145oA7D]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence, incidence, and clearance of abnormal vaginal cytology and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive women.

Methods

Pap tests were done semiannually for 335 HIV-seropositive and 75 HIV-seronegative women with prior hysterectomy in the prospective Women's Interagency HIV Study cohort. End points included abnormal Pap test results after hysterectomy and VAIN regardless of hysterectomy.

Results

Over a median of 5.6 years of follow-up, vaginal Pap test results were abnormal at 1,076 (29%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25–33%) of 3,700 visits among HIV-seropositive compared with 31 (4%; 95% CI 2–8%) of 763 visits among HIV-seronegative women (P < .001). Abnormal Pap test results included 641 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 425 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 10 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in HIV-seropositive women and 28 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and three low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in HIV-seronegative women. The incidence of abnormal Pap test results after hysterectomy was 14 per 100 person-years among HIV-seropositive and two per 100 person-years among HIV-seronegative women (P < .001) and remained stable across time. The 5-year clearance rate of abnormal Pap test results was 34 per 100 person-years for HIV-seropositive and 116 per 100 person-years for HIV-seronegative women (P < .001). In multivariate regression models, women with lower CD4 counts were more likely to have and less likely to clear abnormal cytology when it occurred. The incidence of VAIN 2 or worse was 0.2 and 0.01 per 100 person-years for HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative women (P = 0.001). Two HIV-seropositive women developed stage II cancers with remission after radiotherapy.

Conclusion

Vaginal Pap test results are often abnormal in HIV-seropositive women. Although more common than in HIV-seronegative women, VAIN 2 or worse and especially vaginal cancers are infrequent.

### Incidence of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology among women over age 65 years living with human immunodeficiency virus [^114LsobY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with human immunodeficiency virus have higher rates of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology and, subsequently, of cervical and vaginal cancers. Although professional bodies currently advocate for indefinite cytology screening for women living with human immunodeficiency virus, these recommendations are based on expert opinion, not evidence-based. In the general population, women who have never had an abnormal cytology result can cease screening at age 65 years. This is due to the relatively low incidence of dysplasia in this group and the risk of false-positive results as women age, invasive follow-up testing, and destructive treatments of lesions that are unlikely to progress to cancer. What is unclear, however, is how human immunodeficiency virus-infected women over age 65 years who have no history of abnormal cytology should be screened to maximize benefit while reducing harms of overscreening. This is a crucial question, as women over age 65 years who are living with human immunodeficiency virus comprise a rapidly growing population.

Objective

To describe the incidence of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology results in women over the age of 65 years living with human immunodeficiency virus, with the goal of providing evidence for screening recommendations.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed, identifying 69 women who received gynecologic follow-up in a county hospital system in Houston, Texas, between 2000 and 2018 and who met study criteria. Incidence of abnormal cytology after age 65 was determined by analyzing all available cytology results after age 65. Demographic and clinical risk factors, including human immunodeficiency virus-specific clinical risk factors, were analyzed. Matched cervical and vaginal pathology results, if conducted, were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 15, including χ² tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Estimates of the cumulative probability of developing an abnormal cytology result was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

Among 69 women with no history of abnormal cervical cytology, 12 (17%) went on to develop abnormal cytology results, including 3 (4%) showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The incidence rate was 3.5 cases per 100 woman-years (95% confidence interval, 1.58, 7.81). No demographic or gynecologic characteristics were associated with abnormal cytology. A CD₄ count of < 200 at the time of human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis or at the time of cytology was associated with an abnormal Papanicolaou test result (P < .0001, P = 0.031). Of women with pathology results in the county hospital system (n = 8), 4 (50%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 2+. No women developed invasive cancer. However, 50% of women who had an abnormal Papanicolaou test result in the study period were lost to follow-up; outcomes for these patients are unknown.

Conclusion

Given the relatively high proportion (4%) of women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ during the study period, we agree with current screening recommendations for continued routine Papanicolaou testing after the age of 65 years in women with human immunodeficiency virus. More evidence from larger studies is needed to solidify evidence-based screening recommendations in this unique and growing population.

### Evaluation of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance: is age important? [^111c8ARZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to assess the effect of age on the incidence of significant pathologic findings in patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance.

Study Design

This retrospective study evaluated nonreferred patients with Papanicolaou smears showing atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance over a 5-year period.

Results

Two hundred eighty-one women (91%) with Papanicolaou smears showing atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance were available for follow-up. Significant abnormality was found in 90 subjects (32%), including 31 women (11%) with cancer. Older patients (≥ 50 years old) have lower odds of high-grade cervical dysplasia (odds ratio = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.32–0.40) and higher odds of uterine cancer (odds ratio = 12.88; 95% CI: 1.78–567.60) compared with younger patients.

Conclusions

Women with Papanicolaou smears showing atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance have a 1 in 3 chance of having significant abnormality. Evaluation includes colposcopy, endocervical curettage, and appropriate cervical biopsies. Patients > 45 years require endometrial biopsies.

### Presence of tumor cells in the vagina during surgical treatment could be the source of vaginal recurrence in patients with endometrial carcinoma – A pilot prospective study [^111amTen]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The commonest site of recurrence in endometrial cancer (EC) is the vagina, with a rate of 16%. The aim of this study was to determine if vaginal recurrences in EC patients could develop due to contamination of the vagina with glandular tumor cells dropping off on polypoid, large size EC or tumors involving the endocervix, through manipulation of the uterus during surgery.

Methods

This pilot prospective study included 10 consecutive patients with EC, surgically treated with hysterectomy and additional lymphadenectomy according to stage. In every case, 2 proximal vaginal smears were collected before and during the hysterectomy procedure. All smears underwent Papanicolaou staining and the presence of atypical glandular cells in the smears was correlated with clinico-pathological parameters.

Results

Residual tumor was identified on the surgical specimen in the 10 cases; the tumor characteristics were large size (median 6 cm), polypoid type (80%), infiltrating the cervix (70%), and infiltrating more than half of the myometrium (60%). The smears obtained from the vagina showed that five cases (50%) presented tumor cells of glandular type in all smears (before and during the surgery), while in 3 cases (30%) the smears were negative for tumor cells preoperatively, but positive in the perioperative smears.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the vagina is most often contaminated preoperatively due to bleeding; however, the vaginal wound may also be contaminated perioperatively. We propose a change in the surgical procedure, which is easy to perform and inexpensive compared to postsurgical vaginal radiotherapy.

3 PREVENTION

3.1 Primary prevention (vaccination)

As with premalignant cervical lesions and carcinoma of the cervix, persistent HPV infection — particularly the HPV 16 subtype — has been associated with the long‐term development of high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and carcinoma of the vagina. The introduction of HPV vaccination as a primary prevention strategy in cervical cancer has also been shown to reduce the prevalence of noncervical premalignant lesions among vaccinated women. Long‐term trend analyses from the Norwegian Cancer Register also show promising estimates of reduction in HPV‐associated cases of vaginal cancer in future years among HPV‐vaccinated communities.

3.2 Secondary prevention (screening)

There is no evidence to indicate routine screening for vaginal cancer after hysterectomy for benign disease. If a hysterectomy has been performed for persistent HSIL after repeated excisional procedures of the cervix, vault smears and colposcopy are recommended for long‐term follow‐up.

In those cases where screening for vaginal cancer is indicated, HPV tests adequately correlate with cytological findings. Independently of that, co‐testing seems to offer better accuracy in the diagnosis of recurrent disease — as observed during follow‐up after treatment of premalignant cervical lesions.

G.4 Benign Endometrial Cells in Premenopausal Patients or Benign Glandular Cells in Posthysterectomy Patients

Guideline: For asymptomatic premenopausal patients with benign endometrial cells, endometrial stromal cells, or histiocytes, no further evaluation is recommended (BII). For postmenopausal patients with benign endometrial cells, endometrial assessment is recommended (BII). For posthysterectomy patients with a cytology report of benign glandular cells, no further evaluation is recommended (BII).

Rationale: In the Bethesda system for reporting cervical cytology, cytologically benign-appearing endometrial cells are reported in women 45 years or older under the "other" general category, and follow-up left to the clinical provider. Benign glandular cells in women after hysterectomy are reported in the negative (NILM) Bethesda category. Literature review for the 2012 guidelines indicated increased risk of endometrial pathology in postmenopausal patients with endometrial cells on cytology but did not indicate increased endometrial cancer risk for premenopausal patients with benign endometrial cells in the absence abnormal uterine bleeding. The literature review was updated using a PubMed search for recent publications since 2012 that address benign-appearing endometrial cells in postmenopausal and glandular cells in posthysterectomy individuals. References were reviewed and no evidence was found to change the 2012 recommendations. –

Posttreatment histologic HSIL (CIN 2+) — short-term follow-up and prognostic performance: After treatment, HPV-based testing at 6 months is preferred regardless of the margin status of the excisional specimen (BII), and if HPV-based tests are positive, colposcopy and appropriate biopsies should be performed (AII); follow-up at 6 months with colposcopy and endocervical curettage (ECC) is acceptable (BIII). For patients younger than 25 years or those who are concerned about the potential effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes, observation is recommended (BII), and if recurrent histologic HSIL (CIN 2+) develops after excisional treatment and repeat excision is not feasible or not desired, hysterectomy is recommended. Supporting data show higher risk with positive excision margins versus negative margins (RR = 4.8; 95% CI = 3.2–7.2), margin status predicts only 56% (95% CI = 49–66%) of persistent/recurrent precancer, the ability of HPV-based testing to predict persistent/recurrent histologic HSIL (CIN 2+) is 91% (95% CI = 82%–96%), and the absolute risk after excision with positive margins is 17% (95% CI = 13%–22%).

Other glandular abnormalities — benign-appearing endometrial and glandular cells: Approximately 0.5% to 1.8% of cervical cytology specimens from women 40 years old and older will have endometrial cells. Benign-appearing exfoliated endometrial cells in premenopausal women identified during either the first or the second half of the menstrual cycle are rarely associated with significant pathology, whereas benign-appearing endometrial cells in postmenopausal women are not infrequently associated with significant endometrial pathology. In a study of postmenopausal women with benign-appearing endometrial cells on routine cytology who underwent endometrial biopsy, 8% had significant pathology identified including endometrial adenocarcinoma in 5% of the women. After total hysterectomy, benign-appearing glandular cells derived from small accessory ducts, foci of benign adenosis, or prolapse of the fallopian tube into the vagina have no clinical significance.

### Risk factor and treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia after hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [^115Fwcj1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia incidence rate of 9.1% in our study after total hysterectomy for CIN treatment is similar to or slightly higher than that in the previous studies that reported between 1% and 7%. – Although this could be due to the smaller sample size in this study, this could also be due to the increased detection rate after the expansion of cytologic screening and colposcopy as compared with the time when the previous studies were conducted.– In addition, in our study, old age was identified as an independent VaIN1+ risk factor for patients who underwent hysterectomy due to CIN. A previous study also demonstrated that patients who developed VaIN 2 or 3 or vaginal cancer after hysterectomy for CIN were significantly older than those who did not. Moreover, in univariate analysis, the resection margin status of hysterectomy specimens was associated with VaIN1+ occurrence afterward (p < .001). Another study explained that insufficient vaginal cuff excision might be related to the early recurrence. Hence, they recommended that at least 1 cm of the vaginal wall should be removed when performing hysterectomy for CIN III. Furthermore, another study advised that patients scheduled hysterectomy for CIN would undergo more careful and thorough colposcopic assessment to determine vaginal involvement.

### Vaginal cytology results in follow-up of endometrial carcinoma after hysterectomy [^116WPnbJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our study examined accumulated data on vaginal cytology follow-up results of women treated for endometrial carcinoma (EmCa) by hysterectomy in a large academic women's hospital practice.

Methods

This study analyzed cases of EmCa treated by hysterectomy from January 2006 to December 2008 with documented follow-up vaginal cytology and/or vaginal biopsy results available prior to September 2013.

Results

Of 607 patients with EmCa who had documented hysterectomy findings, 420 had either follow-up vaginal biopsy or cytology results during a mean follow-up period of 42.5 months, and 414 (98.6%) had at least one vaginal cytology follow-up result. Of 414 patients followed with vaginal cytology results, 48 (11.6%) had biopsy results while 366 (88.4%) had only vaginal cytology results. Recurrent EmCa in the vagina was documented by biopsy in 11 patients, eight within 2 years of hysterectomy. Cytology findings of neoplastic glandular cells triggered diagnostic vaginal biopsies in two of 11 cases.

Conclusions

Vaginal recurrences of EmCa were diagnosed in 11 (2.6%) of 420 patients with documented vaginal follow-up testing. Abnormal vaginal cytology findings directly led to vaginal biopsy diagnoses of EmCa in two of the 11 patients. Vaginal cytology is no longer a recommended routine surveillance option for detection of vaginal cuff recurrence of EmCa.

### The utility and management of vaginal cytology after treatment for endometrial cancer [^113p3nJB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the accuracy of vaginal cytology in postoperative surveillance for detecting recurrent endometrial cancer and to estimate the optimal management of squamous abnormalities detected in this setting.

Methods

This review included women who underwent hysterectomy for endometrial cancer between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010, and had at least one postoperative Pap test. Clinical and demographic data were collected and outcomes including abnormal vaginal cytology, results of colposcopic examination, and endometrial cancer recurrence were assessed. A Cox regression model to estimate the risk of abnormal cytology was created. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of detecting vaginal recurrences were calculated.

Results

Four hundred thirty-three women contributed 2,378 Pap tests. At least one abnormal cytology result was found during follow-up of 55 (13%) women, representing 3% of all Pap tests. No recurrent endometrial cancers were diagnosed on the basis of isolated abnormal cytology. No cases of recurrent cancer were diagnosed in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Pap test results. In multivariable analysis, abnormal cytology was highly associated with prior postoperative radiation therapy (P < .001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of an abnormal Pap test result in detecting a local recurrence are 40%, 87.9%, 7.3%, and 98.4%, respectively.

Conclusion

Colposcopy is not needed after a Pap test result read as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or LSIL.

For postmenopausal women with benign endometrial cells, endometrial assessment is recommended regardless of symptoms (BII). For posthysterectomy patients with a cytological report of benign glandular cells, no further evaluation is recommended (BII).

### Should pelvic examination Be continued after hysterectomy?… [^116j8rej]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with some interest the editorial 1on the American Cancer Society guidelines for the early detection of cervical cancer in American Family Physician and found it generally well written. However, the following statement caused me some concern: "… vaginal cuff smears after hysterectomy for benign conditions appear to be a common clinical practice, accounting for untold medical costs and patient discomfort". Does this imply that after hysterectomy, no further pelvic examinations are necessary because they are the painful part of the procedure rather than the swab of the cuff with a tongue blade, cotton-tipped swab, or brush. I do not believe that the smear accounts for "patient discomfort, " but if this has been clinically documented I would appreciate the appropriate literature references.

I do not believe there is any support for implying that the pelvic examination, including the speculum examination of the vagina and the bimanual examination, should be discontinued after total hysterectomy, with or without ovaries present. in reply: If the hysterectomy was completed for a benign indication, the yield from vaginal cuff smear is exceedingly low, and is, in fact, exceeded by issues of false positive work-ups and patient discomfort. This is the basis for our recommendations. There are no data to support utility from bimanual examinations in this subset of patients, and I would defer to clinical judgment.

### Cervical cancer screening in average-risk women: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114p7wCh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Talking points for clinicians discussing cervical cancer screening with average-risk women note that beginning screening too soon can lead to investigation of transient abnormalities and treatment of cervical lesions that may resolve without treatment, and that screening more often than every 3 y increases harms of false-positive test results and invasive procedures yet confers little benefit. Continued screening of low-risk women after age 65 y provides little or no benefit but can lead to invasive tests and procedures, and after hysterectomy with removal of the cervix, women are no longer at risk for cervical cancer yet may have invasive procedures for test abnormalities.

### Hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a retrospective observational multi-institutional study [^115hw2Jv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, it may be worthy of note that since 2018, the HR‐ HPV‐DNA test has replaced the Pap smear as the routine test in screening programs in many Italian regions, starting from the 50–64 aged cohort. A more aggressive surgical approach, especially in postmenopausal women with previous conization and a major risk of recurrence, may be partially explained also by the uncertainties in the management of the results of a new test, leading to an over‐perceived threat by a positive result.

In our series, in about 1% of cases, an occult uterine cancer (corpus and adnexa) was found. In the United States of America, every year over 600 000 benign hysterectomies are performed. Deasi et al. reported in 2019 an incidence of occult endometrial carcinoma in 0.75% of cases, while occult uterine sarcoma was described in 0.22%. The overall risk of occult uterine cancer was 0.96% in women undergoing hysterectomy for presumed benign indications. It could be noticed retrospective studies report a higher prevalence of occult uterine cancer than prospective studies.

### Surveillance for recurrent cancers and vaginal epithelial lesions in patients with invasive cervical cancer after hysterectomy: are vaginal cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus testing useful? [^117GKMwK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether women who have had a hysterectomy for cervical cancer may be at an increased risk of vaginal epithelial lesions.

Methods

We studied 147 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma (76 squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs], 60 adenocarcinomas [ADCs], and 11 adenosquamous cell carcinomas) who were treated by hysterectomy and had vaginal pathologic follow-up for a mean period of 43.3 months.

Results

Of the patients, 15.0% (22/147) developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or recurrence after hysterectomy, including two recurrent carcinomas and eight high-grade VAINs. More important, these high-grade VAINs or recurrent carcinomas were detected only in patients with cervical SCC within the first two years after hysterectomy but not in patients with cervical ADC. Eleven (23.4%) of 47 patients had at least one positive high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing result during the follow-up period, and VAIN was detected in 54.5% (6/11) of patients with an hrHPV-positive result compared with 16.7% (6/36) with an hrHPV-negative result.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that women with cervical cancer are at an increased risk of VAIN besides recurrence, and women with cervical SCC are more prone to high-grade VAIN/recurrence, especially within the first two years after hysterectomy. The significantly increased detection rate of VAINs/recurrence in the hrHPV-positive group suggests vaginal cytology and HPV cotesting might be the preferred method for surveillance in these women.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^115L82Lu]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines — General comments — For certain clinical situations there is limited high-quality evidence, and in these cases the guidelines have been based on consensus expert opinion. Acceptable management strategies reflect an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect high-grade neoplasia or cancer, and it is unreasonable to expect this risk can be reduced to zero; attempts to achieve zero risk could result in greater harm than good, including overtreatment. The guidelines should never substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical judgment should always be used when applying a guideline to an individual patient because it is impossible to develop guidelines that apply to all clinical situations.

### Hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a retrospective observational multi-institutional study [^111qiHEA]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study was aimed at observing the actual clinical management, the outcomes, and the trend in hysterectomy rates of patients who underwent hysterectomies for CIN over the last decade across nine Italian referral centers. The charts of 242 women having a hysterectomy for CIN in the last 10 years were reviewed, thus observing several noteworthy findings. First, a significant increase in the trend of HR for CIN was recorded. Second, between 2010 and 2020, about the 2% of hysterectomies was performed for CIN, and about 85% of these patients underwent surgery with no additional indication. Third, the mortality rate was 0.4%, and 5% had operative complications. Fourth, on definitive histopathology examination, a CIN of any grade was recorded in 71.5% of cases and an occult invasive cancer in 1.24%. Overtreatment (no pathology or CIN1) was recorded and was found in 26.8% of cases, also considering that CIN1 does not represent a target for cervical cancer screening because of the low rate of progression and the high rate of spontaneous regression (14). During follow‐up, a vaginal lesion was recorded in 5% of cases. These rates are not negligible and gain particular significance considering the incidence of complications and the mortality rate related to hysterectomy. Likewise, the incidence of vaginal disease in follow‐up was significant, and it is known that both diagnosis and treatment of VaIN and invasive vaginal cancer are more difficult in hysterectomized women.

Individuals of any age who have undergone hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and who have no history of CIN2+ should not be screened with cytology or HPV testing for lower genital tract malignancies, such as vaginal cancer.

### Improving quality and decreasing cost in gynecologic oncology care. Society of Gynecologic Oncology recommendations for clinical practice [^1133hnTJ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify potential cost savings in gynecologic oncology care without sacrificing quality.

Methods

Members of the Clinical Practice Committee of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology were asked to review current practice patterns in gynecologic oncology and assess the potential for cost savings founded on evidence-based medicine and current guidelines.

Results

Five clinical practices were identified including the following: vaginal cytology for endometrial cancer survivors; colposcopy for low grade cytologic abnormalities for cervical cancer survivors; routine imaging studies for gynecologic cancer survivors; screening for ovarian cancer with serum biomarkers and ultrasound; and improving palliative care for gynecologic cancer patients. Review of the published literature and guidelines were performed to make evidence-based recommendations for cost effective quality gynecologic oncology care.

Recommendations

- Do not perform Pap tests of the vaginal cuff in patients with a history of endometrial cancer.
- Do not perform colposcopy for low grade Pap tests in women with a history of cervical cancer.
- Avoid routine imaging for cancer surveillance in asymptomatic women with gynecologic cancer, specifically ovarian, endometrial, cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer.
- Do not screen women at low risk for ovarian cancer with ultrasound or CA-125 or other biomarkers.
- Do not delay basic level palliative care for women with advanced or relapsed gynecologic cancer, do refer to a palliative care specialist when needed, and avoid unnecessary treatments at life's end.

### Clinical significance of atypical glandular cells on cervical cytology [^111jmNCq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence and histologic outcomes of patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS), diagnosed by Pap test, and concurrent risk factors.

Data Sources

A PubMed/MEDLINE/Ovid HealthStar search of the English literature was conducted from January 1988 through March 2004.

Methods Of Study Selection

The search criteria included the terms "atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance", "AGUS", or "AGC". All studies investigating the clinical significance of patients with an AGUS Pap test were included, except for those where consecutive Pap tests were not studied. Diagnostic outcomes were then determined.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Of the 916 studies identified, 24 met our inclusion criteria. Of the 2,389,206 Pap tests included in these studies, 6,829 (0.29%) had AGUS. Follow-up was available for 3,890 tests. These data showed the following rates of pathology: 8.5% low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 11.1% high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 2.9% adenocarcinoma in situ, 1.4% endometrial hyperplasia, and 5.2% malignancy. The most common malignancies were endometrial adenocarcinoma (57.6%), cervical adenocarcinoma (23.6%), ovarian and fallopian tube carcinoma (6.4%), squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (5.4%), and other (6.9%). Of the AGUS Pap tests, the remaining 71.0% corresponded to benign findings, including reactive changes, polyps, and normal histology. Patients with AGUS, which favors a neoplastic process, or with a concurrent ASCUS have a greater likelihood of disease.

Conclusion

Histologic diagnosis showed that 29.0% of these Pap tests had findings requiring follow-up or therapeutic intervention, including a 5.2% rate of malignancy. Based on these findings, 99.6% of the diagnoses are within the region of surveillance when AGUS Pap tests are evaluated with colposcopy and directed biopsy, endocervical curettage, an endometrial biopsy in patients with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and pelvic examination.

Family medicine research — it starts in the clinic

Mike Fetters

Great research questions arise daily in clinical practice — they are just waiting to be recognized and explored.

Back when I was a family medicine resident, I was scheduled to see a 52-year-old woman for a gynaecological examination, which included a Pap smear. Her medical history mentioned obesity and hypertension. It also indicated that she had undergone a hysterectomy due to the presence of fibroids. I was trained to collect cells from the squamocolumnar junction to ensure an accurate Pap smear, but given the patient did not have a cervix, I was baffled as to what to do. I asked my preceptor for advice. She replied, 'That's a good question!'

The prevailing wisdom at the time was to scrape the surgical cuff. When I went to perform the Pap smear with an Ayres spatula, I struggled to find my patient's surgical cuff. Afterwards, I wondered how she could even get cervical cancer. After all, she had no cervix! When I tried to look up an answer, I found contradictions between multiple specialty guidelines and acknowledgement of uncertainty in the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations.

I was intrigued and pondered the mismatch between standard practice and common sense. With faculty encouragement, I applied and received a small research grant from the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation. I conducted a literature review framed by the USPSTF criteria for effective screening tests. With input from colleagues, I published an article in JAMA concluding that there was no evidence for conducting Pap smears after a hysterectomy for benign disease. Additional research studies started appearing in the literature, and the USPSTF subsequently recommended against doing Pap smears in women who had undergone a total hysterectomy.

### Cost-effectiveness of pap smear screening for vaginal cancer after total hysterectomy for benign disease [^112ZCaqK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the cost effectiveness of Papanicolaou screening for cancer after total hysterectomy for benign disease.

Materials and Methods

Decision analysis including Markov modeling applied to women aged 40 or older with a history of total hysterectomy for benign disease. We derived expected discounted costs and life expectancy.

Results

Maximum gain in life expectancy between no screening and any screening strategy was approximately 3 weeks. Cost effectiveness in dollars per life-year gained was ≥ $143,875 more than no screening for strategies starting at age 50, and over $12 million for aged 40 or more screening strategy. None of the sensitivity analyses caused the incremental cost effectiveness of any strategy to come to less than $100,000 per life year gained compared with no screening.

Conclusions

Despite significant costs for any strategy, Pap smear screening after total hysterectomy for benign disease provides essentially no gain in life expectancy. In absence of risks for genital cancer, such screening is not cost effective.
