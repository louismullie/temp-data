## Question

In NASCET, for symptomatic patients with 50–69% carotid stenosis, what was the effect of carotid endarterectomy versus medical therapy on 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effect of carotid endarterectomy versus medical therapy on 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk in symptomatic patients with 50–69% carotid stenosis in NASCET. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact NASCET population and stenosis stratum. Then, I should verify the 5-year ipsilateral stroke outcomes in the surgical and medical arms. Next, I will calculate the absolute and relative risk reductions and the number needed to treat. After that, I should confirm the statistical significance and confidence intervals. Finally, I will consider external validation from pooled analyses and contemporary guideline perspectives to contextualize the magnitude and applicability of benefit.

> Let me first confirm the population and intervention details so I don't misstate the evidence. NASCET enrolled patients with recent ipsilateral TIA or non-disabling stroke and angiographically confirmed carotid stenosis, comparing carotid endarterectomy plus best medical therapy versus best medical therapy alone, with stenosis measured by the NASCET method and outcomes adjudicated blinded to treatment allocation, which establishes internal validity for the subgroup of interest here [^c5ad8bc3].

> I need to check the specific 5-year ipsilateral stroke results for the 50–69% stratum. In NASCET, the 5-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke was 15.7% with endarterectomy versus 22.2% with medical therapy alone, yielding an absolute risk reduction of 6.5% and a relative risk reduction of approximately 30% with surgery, which is the canonical figure cited in guidelines and summaries of NASCET [^c5ad8bc3] [^77e0ebfc] [^92305d9d].

> Wait, let me verify the calculation and the number needed to treat so I don't propagate an error. An absolute risk reduction of 6.5% corresponds to a number needed to treat of about 15 over 5 years, meaning roughly 15 patients need surgery to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in this moderate-stenosis subgroup, which aligns with vascular society summaries and pooled analyses that report an NNT near 15 for 50–69% stenosis [^77e0ebfc] [^7307a92a].

> Hold on, I should verify statistical significance and the confidence interval. The reported relative risk for ipsilateral stroke in the 50–69% group was 0.70 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.48 to 0.93, indicating a statistically significant benefit of surgery over medical therapy alone in this stratum, which is consistent with the trial's intention-to-treat analysis and subsequent pooled reanalyses [^c5ad8bc3] [^7307a92a].

> Next, I should review external validation to ensure this is not an isolated finding. Pooled analyses of NASCET, ECST, and VA309 that harmonized stenosis measurement and outcomes confirmed a modest but real benefit of endarterectomy in 50–69% symptomatic stenosis, with an absolute risk reduction around 4–6% at 5 years depending on the exact pooling method, reinforcing that the benefit is small but consistent across trials [^7307a92a] [^7776dc4d].

> But wait, what if contemporary medical therapy has eroded this benefit. I need to consider modern best medical therapy and timing effects. Recent observational cohorts and trials using intensive medical therapy show lower stroke rates on medical management than in the 1980s–1990s, and subgroup analyses suggest the absolute benefit of CEA in 50–69% stenosis is smaller in women and diminishes with longer delays from symptom onset, which tempers the magnitude of benefit seen historically and underscores the need to individualize decisions and pursue early evaluation when CEA is contemplated [^397901d0] [^b635a5b0] [^8b3574bc].

> I should double-check guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with current standards. Contemporary AHA/ASA and SVS guidelines endorse CEA for selected symptomatic patients with 50–69% stenosis when perioperative risk is low and patient-specific factors favor benefit, acknowledging a smaller absolute risk reduction than in severe stenosis and emphasizing shared decision-making and operator outcomes [^69fba3b6] [^121f9c4c].

> In summary, I can conclude with confidence that in NASCET, symptomatic patients with 50–69% carotid stenosis had a 5-year ipsilateral stroke rate of 15.7% with endarterectomy versus 22.2% with medical therapy alone, representing a 6.5% absolute risk reduction and a 30% relative risk reduction, with an NNT of about 15, and this benefit was statistically significant and externally validated in pooled analyses, though its magnitude is modest and must be weighed against perioperative risk, timing, sex, and contemporary medical therapy improvements [^c5ad8bc3] [^7307a92a] [^77e0ebfc] [^69fba3b6].

---

In NASCET, symptomatic patients with 50–69% carotid stenosis had a **5-year ipsilateral stroke risk** of 15.7% with carotid endarterectomy plus medical therapy versus 22.2% with medical therapy alone, yielding an **absolute risk reduction of 6.5%** and a **relative risk reduction of 29%** (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48–0.93) [^c5ad8bc3]. The number needed to treat to prevent one ipsilateral stroke over 5 years is **15** [^77e0ebfc]. Benefit is greatest when surgery is performed within 2 weeks of the index event and in men, older patients, and those with hemispheric symptoms [^b635a5b0] [^8b3574bc].

## NASCET trial design and patient population

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial.
- **Population**: 2,226 patients with recent ipsilateral TIA or non-disabling stroke and 50–99% carotid stenosis.
- **Intervention**: Carotid endarterectomy plus best medical therapy vs best medical therapy alone.
- **Primary outcome**: 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke.

## 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk in 50–69% stenosis subgroup

In the 50–69% stenosis subgroup, the **5-year ipsilateral stroke risk** was 15.7% with CEA plus medical therapy versus 22.2% with medical therapy alone, corresponding to an **absolute risk reduction (ARR)** of 6.5% and a **relative risk reduction (RRR)** of 29% (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48–0.93) [^c5ad8bc3].

---

## Clinical significance and interpretation

- **Number needed to treat (NNT)**: 15 over 5 years to prevent one ipsilateral stroke [^77e0ebfc].
- **Statistical significance**: The benefit is statistically significant (p < 0.05) [^c5ad8bc3].
- **Generalizability**: Benefit applies to surgically fit patients operated on by experienced surgeons with low complication rates [^7776dc4d].

---

## Factors influencing benefit

Several factors **modulate the magnitude of benefit** from CEA in this subgroup:

| **Factor** | **Influence on benefit** |
|-|-|
| Timing of surgery | Greater benefit when performed within 2 weeks of the index event [^b635a5b0] |
| Sex | Men benefit more than women; women have higher perioperative risk and smaller ARR [^8b3574bc] [^b9fb2cf7] |
| Age | Older patients (≥ 75 years) derive greater benefit [^6bf84af4] |
| Symptom type | Hemispheric symptoms confer greater benefit than retinal events [^notfound] |

---

## Comparison with other stenosis severity subgroups

- **< 50% stenosis**: No benefit; surgery may increase risk [^7307a92a].
- **70–99% stenosis**: Greater benefit (ARR ~16%) [^7307a92a].
- **Near-occlusion**: No clear benefit [^7307a92a].

---

## Contemporary relevance and guidelines

Current guidelines continue to recommend CEA for symptomatic patients with 50–69% stenosis, provided the **perioperative risk is low (< 6%)** and patient-specific factors favor benefit [^69fba3b6] [^b6add45d]. Modern medical therapy has improved outcomes, but CEA maintains a modest benefit in this subgroup [^397901d0].

---

In NASCET, symptomatic patients with 50–69% carotid stenosis had a **5-year ipsilateral stroke risk** of 15.7% with CEA plus medical therapy versus 22.2% with medical therapy alone, representing a 6.5% absolute and 29% relative risk reduction. Benefit is greatest with early surgery and in selected patients, with an NNT of 15 over 5 years.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^f9788e41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of the Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2011.

Objectives

To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched in July 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1990 to July 2016), Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal, and handsearched relevant journals and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 6343 participants. As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files, and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery. Surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 2.01), had no significant effect in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (N = 1429, RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.38), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (N = 1549, RR 0.84, 95%CI 0.60 to 1.18), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (N = 1095, RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.88). However, there was no evidence of benefit (N = 271, RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.84) in participants with near-occlusions. Ipsilateral ischaemic stroke describes insufficient blood flow to the cerebral hemisphere, secondary to same side severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery.

Authors' Conclusions

Endarterectomy was of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence), and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (moderate-quality evidence). We found no benefit in people with carotid near-occlusion (high-quality evidence).

### Benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate or severe stenosis. north American symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial collaborators [^c5ad8bc3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1998). Excellent credibility.

The study NASCET was published by Barnett HJ and colleagues in 1998 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Carotid artery stenosis, Transient ischemic attack and Acute ischemic stroke. In the NASCET study, the trial question was: is carotid endarterectomy superior to medical care alone in patients with moderate carotid stenosis and TIAs or non-disabling strokes ipsilateral to the stenosis (within 180 days)? In the NASCET study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the NASCET study, the population was: 2226 patients (668 female, 1558 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with moderate carotid stenosis and TIAs or non-disabling strokes ipsilateral to the stenosis (within 180 days). The key exclusion criteria were lack of angiographic visualization of the symptomatic artery, nonatherosclerotic carotid disease, cardiac lesions likely to cause cardioembolism, or a history of ipsilateral endarterectomy. In the NASCET study, the interventions were: n = 1108 surgical therapy (carotid endarterectomy plus medical treatment) n = 1118 medical therapy (medical care alone with antiplatelet medications, antihypertensives and antilipidemics as indicated). In the NASCET study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in any ipsilateral stroke at 5 years, in patients with stenosis of 50–69% (15.7% vs. 22.2%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93). In the NASCET study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in any ipsilateral stroke at 5 years, in patients with < 50% stenosis (14.9% vs. 18.7%; RR 0.8, 95% CI -0.31 to 1.91). In the NASCET study, the conclusion was: in patients with moderate carotid stenosis and TIAs or non-disabling strokes ipsilateral to the stenosis (within 180 days), surgical therapy was superior to medical therapy with respect to any ipsilateral stroke at 5 years, in patients with stenosis of 50–69%.

Carotid endarterectomy outcomes — moderate and high-grade symptomatic stenosis: Among symptomatic NASCET patients with stenosis of 50% to 69%, the 5-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke was 15.7% in patients treated surgically compared with 22.2% in those treated medically, and to prevent one ipsilateral stroke during the 5-year follow up period, 15 patients would have to undergo carotid endarterectomy. For high-grade stenosis of 70% to 99%, the cumulative risk of any ipsilateral stroke at 2 years was 9% with endarterectomy compared with 26% with medical therapy; to prevent one ipsilateral stroke, six patients would have to undergo carotid endarterectomy, and for a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke the corresponding estimates were 2.5% and 13.1% with nine patients needed to prevent one such event. ECST data were similar: the 3-year risk of ipsilateral stroke was 2.8% with endarterectomy vs 16.8% with medical therapy, the 3-year risk of disabling or fatal stroke, or surgical death was 6.0% vs 11.0%, and to prevent an ipsilateral stroke or the composite outcome, 7 and 20 patients had to undergo endarterectomy, respectively.

Background

Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications.

Objectives

To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone in patients with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (July 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2010), EMBASE (1990 to March 2010) and three other databases, and handsearched relevant journals and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included three trials. As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 patients (35,000 patient years of follow-up) after reassessment of the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files and redefined outcome events where necessary to achieve comparability. On re-analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups or in the effects of surgery. Surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in patients with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, absolute risk reduction (ARR) -2.2%, P = 0.05), had no significant effect in patients with 30% to 49% stenosis (N = 1429, ARR 3.2%, P = 0.6), was of marginal benefit in patients with 50% to 69% stenosis (N = 1549, ARR 4.6%, P = 0.04), and was highly beneficial in patients with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (N = 1095, ARR 16.0%, P < 0.001). However, there was no evidence of benefit (N = 262, ARR -1.7%, P = 0.9) in patients with near-occlusions. Benefit from surgery was greatest in men, patients aged 75 years or over, and patients randomised within two weeks after their last ischaemic event and fell rapidly with increasing delay.

Authors' Conclusions

Endarterectomy is of some benefit for 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis and highly beneficial for 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion. Benefit in patients with carotid near-occlusion is marginal in the short-term and uncertain in the long-term. These results are generalisable only to surgically-fit patients operated on by surgeons with low complication rates (less than 7% risk of stroke and death). Benefit from endarterectomy depends not only on the degree of carotid stenosis, but also on several other factors, including the delay to surgery after the presenting event.

Carotid stenosis

Surgery vs. stenting

Two large randomized trials, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ESC), found a clear benefit for carotid endarterectomy compared with medical treatment in patients with high-degree symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Taken together, the trials found an absolute risk reduction of 13.5% over 5 years for the combined endpoint of stroke and death in favour of carotid endarterectomy. The risk reduction was even higher in patients with an ICA stenosis > 90%. In patients with an ICA stenosis of 50–69%, the 5-year absolute risk reduction for the endpoint ipsilateral stroke was 4.6%. Patients with an ICA stenosis < 50% did not benefit from carotid endarterectomy. The short-term complication rates (stroke and death) were 6.2% with an ICA stenosis > 70 and 8.4% with an ICA stenosis of 50–69%. One should, however, keep in mind that these studies were performed at times when optimal treatment of vascular risk factors was not available.

### The evidence for medicine versus surgery for carotid stenosis [^bb063fcf]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Several large randomised trials have compared best medical management with carotid endarterectomy and provide a strong evidence base for advising and selecting patients for carotid surgery. Best medical management of carotid stenosis includes lowering of blood pressure, treatment with statins and antiplatelet therapy in symptomatic patients. Combined analysis of the symptomatic carotid surgery trials, together with observational data, has shown that patients with recently symptomatic severe carotid stenosis have a very high risk of recurrent stroke in the first few days and weeks after symptoms. Carotid endarterectomy has a risk of causing stroke or death at the time of surgery in symptomatic patients of around 5–7%, but in patients with recently symptomatic stenosis of more than 70%, the benefits of endarterectomy outweigh the risks. In patients with moderate stenosis of between 50 and 69%, the benefits may justify surgery in patients with very recent symptoms, and in patients older than 75 years within a few months of symptoms. Patients with less than 50% stenosis do not benefit from surgery. In asymptomatic patients, or those whose symptoms occurred more than 6 months ago, the benefits of surgery are considerably less. Patients with asymptomatic stenosis treated medically only have a small risk of future stroke when treated medically of about 2% per annum. If carotid endarterectomy can be performed safely with a perioperative stroke and death rate of no more than 3%, then the randomised trials showed a significant benefit of surgery over 5 years follow-up, with an overall reduction in the risk of stroke from about 11% over 5 years down to 6%. However, of 100 patients operated, only 5 will benefit from avoiding a stroke over 5 years. The majority of neurologists have concluded that this does not justify a policy of routine screening and endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis. Patients known to have asymptomatic stenosis should be advised of the risks and benefits. The trials provide justification for surgery at centres with a proven low complication rate, in asymptomatic patients prepared to take a small immediate risk in exchange for a small longer term benefit. Those that opt for medical management alone should be advised to seek urgent medical attention should they become symptomatic in the future.

### Risk, causes, and prevention of ischaemic stroke in elderly patients with symptomatic internal-carotid-artery stenosis [^6bf84af4]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Carotid endarterectomy benefits patients with symptomatic stenosis of 70–99% in the internal carotid artery, with smaller benefit for 50–69% stenosis. The benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients of 75 years and older remains unclear.

Methods

Patients aged 75 years or older from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial were compared with those aged 65–74 years and less than 65 years for baseline characteristics and risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke at 2 years by degree of stenosis and treatment group.

Findings

Among patients with 70–99% stenosis, the absolute risk reduction of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke with carotid endarterectomy was 28.9% (95% CI 12.9–44.9) for patients aged 75 years or older (n = 71), 15.1% (7.2–23.0) for those aged 65–74 years (n = 285), and 9.7% (1.5–17.9) for the youngest group (n = 303). Among patients with 50–69% stenosis, the absolute risk reduction was significant only in those of 75 years and older (n = 145; 17.3% [6.6–28.0]). The perioperative risk of stroke and death at any degree of stenosis was 5.2% for the oldest group, 5.5% for 65–74 years, and 7.9% for less than 65 years. The number of patients aged 75 years or older needed to treat to prevent one ipsilateral stroke within 2 years was three with 70–99% stenosis and six with 50–69% stenosis.

Interpretation

In the prevention of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, elderly patients with 50–99% symptomatic carotid stenosis benefited more from carotid endarterectomy than younger patients did. To achieve this treatment benefit, surgeons must be skilled and patients with other life-threatening illnesses must be excluded.

### Endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis in relation to clinical subgroups and timing of surgery [^b635a5b0]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with recently symptomatic stenosis. Benefit depends on the degree of stenosis, and we aimed to see whether it might also depend on other clinical and angiographic characteristics, and on the timing of surgery.

Methods

We analysed pooled data from the European Carotid Surgery Trial and North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. The risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke for patients on medical treatment, the perioperative risk of stroke and death, and the overall benefit from surgery were determined in relation to seven predefined and seven post hoc subgroups.

Results

5893 patients with 33000 patient-years of follow-up were analysed. Sex (p = 0.003), age (p = 0.03), and time from the last symptomatic event to randomisation (p = 0.009) modified the effectiveness of surgery. Benefit from surgery was greatest in men, patients aged 75 years or older, and those randomised within 2 weeks after their last ischaemic event, and fell rapidly with increasing delay. For patients with 50% or higher stenosis, the number of patients needed to undergo surgery (ie, number needed to treat) to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in 5 years was nine for men versus 36 for women, five for age 75 years or older versus 18 for younger than 65 years, and five for those randomised within 2 weeks after their last ischaemic event, versus 125 for patients randomised after more than 12 weeks. These results were consistent across the individual trials.

Interpretation

Benefit from endarterectomy depends not only on the degree of carotid stenosis, but also on several other clinical characteristics such as delay to surgery after the presenting event. Ideally, the procedure should be done within 2 weeks of the patient's last symptoms.

### Carotid artery endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic non-stenotic carotid artery disease [^45d800a0]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of patients with carotid artery disease is well defined in evidence-based guidelines which consider the degree of luminal stenosis as the main criteria as an indication for intervention. The two main trials which provided evidence were the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), and the European Carotid Surgery Trial. These large, randomised clinical trials, conducted more than three decades ago, risk stratified patients by the degree of lumen narrowing on catheter angiography. Based on these landmark studies, the management of carotid artery disease was influenced in two ways. On the one hand, these trials showed that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone in symptomatic patients with moderate (50%–69%) and severe (> 70%) stenosis. On the other hand, the degree of luminal stenosis became the primary surrogate for carotid-related stroke risk and indication for revascularisation. Consequently, patients with documented carotid atherosclerotic disease ipsilateral to an ischaemic stroke who did not reach the 50% stenosis limit were managed medically without revascularisation.

Recent biological and clinical data have demonstrated that pathological changes within the vessel wall determine the fate of a plaque regardless of the severity of stenosis. By extension, structural and biological factors that define plaque stability and vulnerability, especially at the lumen/wall interface, might be more significant than the degree of narrowing in determining the risk profile and root cause of a cerebrovascular event, even in patients with mild (< 50%) carotid stenosis. However, current guidelines suggest that carotid revascularisation should not be pursued in this patient population.

Over the years at our institution, we have performed CEA in a series of highly selected patients with mild stenosis and cerebrovascular ischaemic events which are often recurrent despite intensive medical management. These patients typically possess imaging features of plaque vulnerability and mild (< 50%) luminal stenosis within the ipsilateral carotid artery without any other identifiable embolic source. Such patients may be said to have symptomatic non-stenotic carotid artery disease (SyNC), or SyNC as defined by Goyal et al. If this management paradigm is safe and efficacious, it may call into question the emphasis that current guidelines place exclusively on the degree of luminal stenosis without consideration of plaque morphological characteristics as seen on imaging. The objective of the current study was to therefore describe our institutional cohort of patients with ischaemic cerebral events who underwent CEA for SyNC.

### Carotid endarterectomy plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone for carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients: a meta-analysis [^f436fda3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus medical therapy (MT) with MT alone for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients suffering from carotid artery stenosis in terms of long-term stroke/death rate.

Design

A meta-analysis of parallel randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) (blind or open) published in English.

Setting

A university-based electronic search.

Participants

Patients suffering from carotid artery stenosis symptomatic or not.

Interventions

Patients were subjected to CEA plus MT or MT alone.

Measurements and Main Results

For asymptomatic patients, 6 RCTs comprising 5,733 patients (CEA = 2,853 and MT = 2,880) were included. CEA did not affect the stroke/death risk for asymptomatic patients (risk ratio [RR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 1.02; I² = 0%; p = 0.14). For symptomatic patients, 2 RCTs were included. They had 5,627 patients (CEA = 3,069 and MT = 2,558) of whom 2,295 patients (CEA = 1,213; MT = 1,082) had severe stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET] technique ≥ 50% and European Carotid Surgery Trial technique ≥ 70%). CEA decreased the stroke/death risk only for patients with severe stenosis (RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59–0.81; p < 0.001 [random effects model]; I² = 0% on the odds ratio and 17% on the RR [benefit or harm side]; number needed to treat = 11 [95% CI, 8–17]).

Conclusions

CEA is helpful for recently symptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50% (NASCET technique) but adds no benefit in terms of stroke/death for asymptomatic patients.

### European Stroke Organisation guideline on endarterectomy and stenting for carotid artery stenosis [^3aa10c60]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. The aim of this guideline is to analyse the evidence pertaining to medical, surgical and endovascular treatment of patients with carotid stenosis. These guidelines were developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The working group identified relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote recommendations. Based on moderate quality evidence, we recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with ≥ 60–99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis considered to be at increased risk of stroke on best medical treatment (BMT) alone. We also recommend CEA for patients with ≥ 70–99% symptomatic stenosis, and we suggest CEA for patients with 50–69% symptomatic stenosis. Based on high quality evidence, we recommend CEA should be performed early, ideally within two weeks of the last retinal or cerebral ischaemic event in patients with ≥ 50–99% symptomatic stenosis. Based on low quality evidence, carotid artery stenting (CAS) may be considered in patients < 70years old with symptomatic ≥ 50–99% carotid stenosis. Several randomised trials supporting these recommendations were started decades ago, and BMT, CEA and CAS have evolved since. The results of another large trial comparing outcomes after CAS versus CEA in patients with asymptomatic stenosis are anticipated in the near future. Further trials are needed to reassess the benefits of carotid revascularisation in combination with modern BMT in subgroups of patients with carotid stenosis.

### Risk of stroke in relation to degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: a population-based cohort study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^1b73910d]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Two large randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the benefits of carotid endarterectomy for prevention of stroke in patients with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis, with the observed benefit being highly dependent on the degree of stenosis. Similar randomised controlled trials in patients with 50% or greater asymptomatic carotid stenosis have shown a more modest reduction in stroke risk after endarterectomy, compared with medical therapy alone. However, recent cohort studies have reported lower risks of stroke with contemporary medical treatment alone, leading some to question the benefit of routine surgical intervention. Selection of patients for surgical intervention has been made difficult by the unexpected observation from the three pivotal clinical trials of endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis that stroke rates on medical therapy, and hence the benefit of intervention, were unrelated to severity of stenosis. As well as being inconsistent with findings in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, this observation is at odds with previous cohort studies of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, and could simply reflect recruitment bias in randomised controlled trials.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Randomised controlled trials in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have shown modest reductions in stroke risk after endarterectomy compared with medical therapy alone, but there is uncertainty as to which patients should undergo surgical intervention and substantial variation in clinical practice worldwide. International guidelines state that surgical intervention might be indicated in patients with 60–99% asymptomatic stenosis who are at risk of stroke on medical therapy. However, selecting patients for surgical intervention has been made difficult by the unexpected observation, from the three pivotal randomised trials of endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, that stroke rates on medical therapy, and hence the benefit of endarterectomy, were unrelated to severity of stenosis. This finding could simply reflect recruitment bias in clinical trials. Additionally, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of cohort studies. We therefore searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from inception to Oct 1, 2020) to identify studies of prognosis in patients with non-operated asymptomatic carotid stenosis (defined as 50–99% atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid bifurcation lumen or extracranial part of the internal carotid artery without ipsilateral carotid territory symptoms in the previous 6 months) on medical treatment alone. We evaluated observational cohort studies, medical treatment groups of randomised trials, and international guidelines.

### Analysis of pooled data from the randomised controlled trials of endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^7307a92a]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Endarterectomy reduces risk of stroke in certain patients with recently symptomatic internal carotid stenosis. However, investigators have made different recommendations about the degree of stenosis above which surgery is effective, partly because of differences between trials in the methods of measurement of stenosis. To accurately assess the overall effect of surgery, and to increase power for secondary analyses, we pooled trial data and reassessed carotid angiograms.

Methods

We pooled data from the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, and Veterans Affairs trial 309 from the original electronic data files. Outcome events were re-defined, if necessary, to achieve comparability. Pre-randomisation carotid angiograms from ECST were re-measured by the method used in the other two trials.

Results

Risks of main outcomes in both treatment groups and effects of surgery did not differ between trials. Data for 6092 patients, with 35000 patient-years of follow-up, were therefore pooled. Surgery increased the 5-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in patients with less than 30% stenosis (n = 1746, absolute risk reduction -2.2%, p = 0.05), had no effect in patients with 30–49% stenosis (1429, 3.2%, p = 0.6), was of marginal benefit in those with 50–69% stenosis (1549, 4.6%, p = 0.04), and was highly beneficial in those with 70% stenosis or greater without near-occlusion (1095, 16.0%, p < 0.001). There was a trend towards benefit from surgery in patients with near-occlusion at 2 years' follow-up (262, 5.6%, p = 0.19), but no benefit at 5 years (-1.7%, p = 0.9).

Interpretation

Re-analysis of the trials with the same measurements and definitions yielded highly consistent results. Surgery is of some benefit for patients with 50–69% symptomatic stenosis, and highly beneficial for those with 70% symptomatic stenosis or greater but without near-occlusion. Benefit in patients with carotid near-occlusion is marginal in the short-term and uncertain in the long-term.

### Symptomatic carotid stenosis: endarterectomy, stenting, or best medical management? [^6d67775b]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In the past, management of symptomatic carotid stenosis was uncertain. The results of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) in 1991 demonstrated a significant advantage of Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) compared to medical management with Aspirin (ASA). Since the publishing of the NASCET results, there have been advances in both the medical management of patients with peripheral arterial disease as well as the introduction and improvement of the technique of minimally invasive carotid angioplasty and stenting. With this progress, the question has to be raised about what is the most appropriate treatment option for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. A review of the prospective clinical trials regarding the medical, surgical and endovascular management will help to elucidate the optimal therapy for symptomatic carotid stenosis.

### AAN review of carotid endarterectomy… [^acf113f2]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy is the most common procedure used in the prevention of stroke. A subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology reviewed articles on carotid endarterectomy to assess the effectiveness of the procedure in preventing stroke in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. The review was published in the September 27, 2005, issue of. Neurology. The AAN found good evidence to support carotid endarterectomy in patients with 70 to 99 percent internal carotid artery angiographic stenosis that has been symptomatic in the previous six months. Endarterectomy may be considered in patients with 50 to 69 percent symptomatic stenosis, but it is not indicated for patients with less than 50 percent symptomatic stenosis. Consideration of carotid endarterectomy is reasonable in selected patients with 60 to 99 percent asymptomatic stenosis.

Physicians should consider patient variables and radiologic factors when deciding whether carotid endarterectomy should be performed. For example, the procedure was of no clear benefit in women with 50 to 69 percent symptomatic stenosis; was of more benefit in patients with hemispheric transient ischemic attack or stroke than in those with retinal ischemic events; was of no benefit in patients with asymptomatic stenosis and contralateral occlusion; and was of persistent benefit in patients with symptomatic stenosis and occlusion. The procedure is of greater benefit in patients whose last TIA or mild stroke occurs within two weeks of the operation. Because the benefit of carotid endarterectomy is seen only after several years, the AAN recommends that patients undergoing the procedure have at least five years' life expectancy and that the perioperative stroke or death rate be less than 6 percent in patients with symptomatic stenosis.

The AAN found good evidence that endarterectomy can reduce the future stroke rate if the perioperative stroke or death rate is kept below 3 percent. Data regarding the value of emergent carotid endarterectomy in patients with a progressing neurologic deficit were insufficient for the AAN to make a recommendation.

### Optimised medical therapy alone versus optimised medical therapy plus revascularisation for asymptomatic or low-to-intermediate risk symptomatic carotid stenosis (ECST-2): 2-year interim results of a multicentre randomised trial [^b08a13c9]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Carotid revascularisation, comprising either carotid endarterectomy or stenting, is offered to patients with carotid stenosis to prevent stroke based on the results of randomised trials conducted more than 30 years ago. Since then, medical therapy for stroke prevention has improved. We aimed to assess whether patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis with a low or intermediate predicted risk of stroke, who received optimised medical therapy (OMT), would benefit from additional revascularisation.

Methods

The Second European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST-2) is a multicentre randomised trial with blinded outcome adjudication, which was conducted at 30 centres with stroke and carotid revascularisation expertise in Europe and Canada. Patients aged 18 years or older with asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% or greater, and a 5-year predicted risk of ipsilateral stroke of less than 20% (estimated using the Carotid Artery Risk [CAR] score), were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to either OMT alone or OMT plus revascularisation (1:1) using a web-based system. The primary outcome for this 2-year, interim analysis was a hierarchical outcome composite of: (1) periprocedural death, fatal stroke, or fatal myocardial infarction; (2) non-fatal stroke; (3) non-fatal myocardial infarction; or (4) new silent cerebral infarction on imaging. Analysis was by intention-to-treat using the win ratio-ie, each patient in the OMT alone group was compared as a pair with each patient in the OMT plus revascularisation group, with a win declared for the patient with a better outcome within the pair (a tie was declared if neither patient in the pair had a better outcome). The win ratio was calculated as the number of wins in the OMT alone group divided by the number of wins in the OMT plus revascularisation group. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN97744893) and is ongoing.

Findings

Between March 1, 2012, and Oct 31, 2019, 429 patients were randomly assigned to OMT alone (n = 215) or OMT plus revascularisation (n = 214). One patient allocated to OMT alone withdrew consent within 48 h and was not considered further. The median age of patients was 72 years (IQR 65–78); 296 (69%) were male and 133 (31%) female. No benefit was recorded in favour of either treatment group with respect to the primary hierarchical outcome assessed 2 years after randomisation, with 5228 (11.4%) wins for the OMT alone group, 5173 (11.3%) wins for the OMT plus revascularisation group, and 35395 (77.3%) ties between groups (win ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.60–1.70]; p = 0.97). For OMT alone versus OMT plus revascularisation, four versus three patients had periprocedural death, fatal stroke, or fatal myocardial infarction; 11 versus 16 had non-fatal stroke; seven versus five had non-fatal myocardial infarction; and 12 versus seven had new silent cerebral infarction on imaging. One periprocedural death occurred in the OMT plus revascularisation group, which was attributed to decompensated aortic stenosis 1 week after carotid endarterectomy.

Interpretation

No evidence for a benefit of revascularisation in addition to OMT was found in the first 2 years following treatment for patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% or greater with a low or intermediate predicted stroke risk (assessed by the CAR score). The results support treating patients with asymptomatic and low or intermediate risk symptomatic carotid stenosis with OMT alone until further data from the 5-year analysis of ECST-2 and other trials become available.

### Risk of stroke in relation to degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: a population-based cohort study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^cbfdecaa]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Added value of this study

In this population-based study of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who were on contemporary medical therapy, and in the accompanying systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies and medical treatment groups of randomised controlled trials, we show that ipsilateral stroke risk was highly dependent on the degree of stenosis, with the stroke risk being less than 5% after 5 years on contemporary medical therapy for patients with moderate stenosis, but approximately 15% in patients with severe stenosis. The strong association between the degree of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and ipsilateral stroke risk fits well with the proposed synergistic effect of flow reduction and embolisation in the pathogenesis of stroke distal to the carotid plaque.

Implications of all the available evidence

Although randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for quantifying the effects of an intervention, they are nonetheless prone to selection biases when determining risk associations within treatment groups. Guidelines should consider this issue when setting criteria for selecting patients for an intervention. Despite advances in medical therapy, the stroke risk for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains high, suggesting that the benefit of the surgical intervention might be underestimated in current guidelines. Conversely, up to 5 years of follow-up data from patients on contemporary medical therapy for moderate stenosis suggest that stroke risk is low in this population, calling into question any benefit from revascularisation.

Although randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for quantifying the effects of an intervention, they might not be reliable for determining risk associations within treatment groups. Recruitment of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis into randomised controlled trials required clinical equipoise between medical therapy and surgical intervention. When these clinical trials were done, there was a strong expectation that the severity of stenosis would predict stroke risk, so trial investigators might have randomly assigned patients with severe stenosis who they considered to be otherwise relatively low risk, with higher-risk patients undergoing endarterectomy outside the trial setting. Moreover, patients with moderate stenosis, who were generally considered to have a low risk of stroke, might have been more likely to be recruited if their physician felt that they had a higher than standard stroke risk on medical therapy alone. Thus, there could have been a differential recruitment bias in relation to the severity of stenosis, which would undermine any expected risk association in trial cohorts. Indeed, such risk-related recruitment was suggested in the protocol of the largest trial, which recommended recruitment of patients with 50% stenosis if they had soft plaques.

### Reanalysis of the final results of the European carotid surgery trial [^d1add694]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) and North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) have shown that endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke in certain patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. However, they differed in the degree of stenosis above which surgery was reported to be effective. This disparity has led to inconsistent clinical recommendations but may have been due to differences between the trials in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and definitions of outcome events.

Methods

To allow direct comparison of analyses from ECST and NASCET, we remeasured the prerandomization ECST carotid angiograms and redefined the outcome events the same way as in NASCET.

Results

We randomized 3018 patients and followed them up for a mean of 73 months. Surgery reduced the 5-year risk of any stroke or surgical death by 5.7% (95% CI, 0 to 11.6) in patients with 50% to 69% stenosis (n = 646, P = 0.05) and by 21.2% (95% CI, 12.9 to 29.4) in patients with 70% to 99% stenosis without "near occlusion" (n = 429, P < 0.0001). These benefits were maintained at the 10-year follow-up. However, surgery was of no benefit in patients (n = 125) with near occlusion. The effect of surgery in this group was highly significantly different from that in patients with 70% to 99% stenosis without near occlusion (P = 0.002). Surgery was harmful in patients with < 30% stenosis (n = 1321, P = 0.007) and of no benefit in patients with 30% to 49% stenosis (n = 478, P = 0.6).

Conclusions

Results of the ECST and NASCET were consistent when analyzed in the same way. In ECST, surgery was highly beneficial for 70% to 99% stenosis and moderately beneficial for 50% to 69% stenosis. However, contrary to clinical recommendations and current practice, surgery was of little benefit in patients with carotid near occlusion.

### Carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^9b1ff804]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is of proven benefit in recently-symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis. Its role in asymptomatic stenosis is still debated. The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) more than doubled the number of patients randomised to CEA trials. This revised review incorporates the recently published ACST results.

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the effects of CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched May 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004), Current Contents (1995 to January 1997), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted researchers in the field to identify additional published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

All completed randomised trials comparing CEA to medical treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Attempts were made to contact investigators to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Three trials with a total of 5223 patients were included. In these trials, the overall net excess of operation-related perioperative stroke or death was 2.9%. For the primary outcome of perioperative stroke or death or any subsequent stroke, patients undergoing CEA fared better than those treated medically (relative risk (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83). Similarly, for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, there was benefit for the surgical group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90). For the outcome of any stroke or death, there was a non-significant trend towards fewer events in the surgical group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). Subgroup analyses were performed for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent carotid stroke. CEA appeared more beneficial in men than in women and more beneficial in younger patients than in older patients although the data for age effect were inconclusive. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment effect estimates in patients with different grades of stenosis but the data were insufficient.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite about a 3% perioperative stroke or death rate, CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis reduces the risk of ipsilateral stroke, and any stroke, by approximately 30% over three years. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (approximately 1% per annum over the first few years of follow up in the two largest and most recent trials) but it could be higher with longer follow up.

### Endarterectomy versus stenting for stroke prevention [^31a31ca3]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Symptomatic patients

Background

Patients are traditionally considered 'recently symptomatic' if they have suffered a carotid territory transient ischaemic attack or stroke within the preceding 6 months. In the 1980s, there was controversy as to whether carotid endarterectomy (CEA) conferred any benefit over best medical therapy (BMT) in patients with an ipsilateral carotid stenosis. Two landmark randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), determined that CEA conferred significant benefit over BMT in patients with an ipsilateral 50%–99% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, using the NASCET method for measuring carotid stenosis severity. Subgroup analyses suggested that it was possible to identify certain imaging/clinical features that were associated with a higher risk of stroke on BMT. Clinical features of increased benefit conferred by CEA include: increasing age (especially patients aged > 75 years), recency of symptoms, male sex, hemispheric versus ocular symptoms, cortical versus lacunar stroke and increasing medical comorbidities. Imaging features associated with an increased risk of stroke on medical therapy include: irregular versus smooth plaques, increasing stenosis severity (but not subocclusion), contralateral occlusion, tandem intracranial disease and a failure to recruit the intracranial collateral circulation.

### Comparative effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy vs initial medical therapy in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^3db3a957]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The absolute reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes associated with early CEA intervention found in this study appeared to be less than half the risk difference observed in trials initiated more than 2 decades ago. This reduction was no longer statistically significant when the competing risk of nonstroke deaths were accounted for in the analysis. Given the up-front perioperative risks associated with CEA, initial medical therapy may be an equally acceptable treatment strategy for the management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

### Carotid plaque hemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging strongly predicts recurrent ischemia and stroke [^82a4bdc8]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in secondary prevention of stroke in patients with symptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis is well documented by pooled randomized controlled trial evidence. Current guidelines recommend early surgical intervention for symptomatic individuals with 50 to 99% carotid stenosis as determined by angiographic or ultrasonographic measurement of the luminal diameter according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria. However, 70 to 80% of symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% stenosis will not experience recurrent stroke at 5 years. This group of patients at low risk of recurrent cerebral ischemic events routinely undergo potentially unnecessary surgical intervention, demonstrating the limitation of the current risk stratification model, based on degree of stenosis alone.

Randomized controlled trials were mostly performed more than a decade ago, since which time there has been considerable progress in best medical management for secondary prevention of stroke. Since then, the EXPRESS study has successfully changed clinical practice to early initiation of medical therapy after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, lowering the risk of stroke recurrence. This improvement in medical treatment may also reduce the additional benefit from surgery. Nonetheless, some recent guidelines recommend expanding the indications for carotid revascularization in carotid disease. A cost-effective and reliable method of defining stroke risk beyond that predicted by the degree of stenosis alone would offer the potential to better target patients most likely to benefit from surgery, while avoiding unnecessary surgery for those at low risk of embolic stroke from carotid disease.

Detection of ultrasonographic microembolic signals by transcranial Doppler can be used to assess patients at high risk of recurrence, but has a limited power in accurately identifying those at very low risk who may be safely excluded from carotid intervention. Other research efforts focused on noninvasive imaging techniques to predict the "vulnerable" or "unstable" plaque based on the evidence that certain histomorphological plaque features are associated with symptomatic carotid disease. Atherosclerotic plaque destabilization is histologically characterized by fibrous cap rupture, high lipid content, and notably, intraplaque hemorrhage. Recently developed dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques allow characterization of these features, of which intraplaque hemorrhage (PH) is the most widely studied imaging marker. Based on typical MRI characteristics of blood products, PH can be reliably identified in both multicontrast and single T1-weighted MRI scans that depict PH as distinct intraplaque hyperintensity.–

### Low risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis on best medical treatment: a prospective, population-based study [^21675552]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The annual risk of ischemic stroke distal to ≥ 50% asymptomatic carotid stenoses was approximately 2% to 3% in early cohort studies and subsequent randomized trials of endarterectomy. This risk might have fallen in recent years owing to improvements in medical treatment, but there are no published prognostic data from studies initiated within the last 10 years.

Methods

In a population-based study of all patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke in the Oxford Vascular Study, we studied the risk of TIA and stroke in patients with ≥ 50% contralateral asymptomatic carotid stenoses recruited consecutively from 2002 to 2009 and given intensive contemporary medical treatment.

Results

Of 1153 consecutively imaged patients presenting with stroke or TIA, 101 (8.8%) had ≥ 50% asymptomatic carotid stenoses (mean age, 75 years; 39% women; 40% age ≥ 80 years). During 301 patient-years of follow-up (mean, 3 years), there were 6 ischemic events in the territory of an asymptomatic stenosis, 1 minor stroke (initially 50% to 69% stenosis), and 5 TIAs (2 initially 50% to 69% stenosis; 3 to 70% to 99% stenosis), 3 of which led to subsequent endarterectomy. The average annual event rates on medical treatment were 0.34% (95% CI, 0.01 to 1.87) for any ipsilateral ischemic stroke, 0% (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.99) for disabling ipsilateral stroke, and 1.78% (95% CI, 0.58 to 4.16) for ipsilateral TIA.

Conclusions

In the first study of the prognosis of ≥ 50% asymptomatic carotid stenosis to be initiated in the last 10 years, the risk of stroke on intensive contemporary medical treatment was low. Larger studies are required to determine whether this apparent improvement in prognosis is generalizable.

### Carotid endarterectomy: who is the high-risk patient? [^386755e1]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The role of carotid endarterectomy in the prevention of stroke was validated by two randomized clinical trials, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS). However, these trials excluded patients at high risk for perioperative stroke and other morbidity, raising concerns for the applicability of the trial results to the general population. Some have also suggested these "high-risk" patients are better suited for carotid artery stenting with the belief that stenting has lower morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review many of the commonly accepted high-risk factors for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and examine their outcomes. High-risk patients are more common than generally believed and their outcomes may be the same with carotid endarterectomy as it is with carotid stenting. Truly "high-risk" patients with shortened life expectancy are best served with no intervention.

### Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9d7707bc]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — three randomized clinical trials (n = 5226) of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (stenosis ≥ 50%) versus medical therapy over 2 to 9 years found that, compared with medical therapy alone, 2.0% fewer patients treated with CEA had perioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke combined over 30 d and 3.5% fewer had perioperative stroke or death and any subsequent stroke combined; however, none of the trials focused on exclusively asymptomatic populations identified by primary care screening, between 20% and 32% of trial patients reported a history of contralateral artery transient ischemic attack, stroke, or CEA at baseline, requirements for asymptomatic status differed across trials (eg, no ipsilateral events for the past 6 months vs the past 45 days), medical therapy varied and operators were highly selected, and because of these limitations the USPSTF concluded that the magnitude of any benefit would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population than among patients in the trials.

### Cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients [^f237ef41]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical therapy for stroke prevention has improved significantly over the past 30 years. Recent analyses of medically treated cohorts have suggested that early rates of stroke may have reduced, and reports of the safety of carotid surgery have also shown improvements. Since the effectiveness of carotid surgery versus medical therapy was established in the 1990s, there is an urgent need to evaluate whether surgery remains cost-effective in the UK.

Methods

A decision model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and utilities of modern medical therapy with and without carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic stenosis from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. The base-case population consisted of adults aged 70 years with 70–99 per cent stenosis. Model data were obtained from clinical studies and wider literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out.

Results

In the base-case scenario, the 5-year absolute risk reduction with carotid endarterectomy was 5 per cent, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €12 021 (exchange rate £1 GBP = €1.1125 (Tuesday 1 January 2019)) per quality-adjusted life-year. Surgery was more cost-effective if performed rapidly after presentation. In patients with 50–69 per cent carotid stenosis, surgery appeared less clinically effective. However, there was considerable uncertainty.

Conclusion

Surgery may not now be clinically effective and cost-effective in those with moderate carotid stenosis. However, these results are uncertain because of the limited data on modern medical therapy and an RCT may be justified.

### Who should operate in carotid disease? [^bac37cef]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

In this issue of American Family Physician, Biller and Thies 1 review evidence showing that carotid endarterectomy can be highly effective in preventing stroke. Patients with high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis that is ipsilateral to the side of previous symptoms or nondisabling stroke benefit dramatically from the combined use of surgery and medical therapy compared with the use of medical therapy alone. In patients with severe carotid artery stenosis, fewer than eight carotid endarterectomies are required to prevent one stroke. The benefits of carotid endarterectomy are not as dramatic in symptomatic patients with lesser degrees of stenosis, and surgery may not be beneficial in patients with less than 50 percent stenosis. The benefits of surgery in asymptomatic patients have been controversial.

In these patients, carotid endarterectomy may prevent only nondisabling strokes rather than disabling ones, and the clinical significance of a small risk reduction for such an outcome is questionable. 2 A recent meta-analysis 3 of all randomized controlled trials conducted in asymptomatic patients indicated that the number of surgeries needed to prevent one stroke over three years is close to 50.

1. Although some authorities speculate that certain subgroups of asymptomatic patients might benefit from surgery, we have no idea who these patients are. Many experts believe that surgery is not indicated for patients without symptoms, regardless of the severity of carotid stenosis. 2 Treatment must always be individualized, but risk-factor reduction and education about the warning signs of ischemic stroke, rather than surgery, are appropriate measures in most asymptomatic patients. 4 and 0. 1 percent in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study.

5 In fact, the risk of surgery in ACAS was lower than the risk of angiography. Several population-based studies have demonstrated that the low complication rates cited for the NASCET and the ACAS are almost impossible to achieve outside of centers of excellence such as those in which these trials were performed. 12 indicated that 30-day perioperative morbidity and mortality following carotid endarterectomy were significantly reduced by the use of low doses of aspirin compared with high doses. High-dose aspirin is likely better than no aspirin at all; however, patients scheduled for carotid artery surgery should be placed on low-dose aspirin prior to surgery and remain on such a dose indefinitely.

Carotid artery disease

Approximately 10%–20% of thromboembolic stroke is thought to be from significant extracranial carotid artery disease. Generally, significant stenosis refers to a > 50% stenosis estimated using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. In clinical trials, patients are often stratified to 50%–69% stenosis and 70%–99% stenosis. Revascularisation is not indicated for a near-occluded or occluded carotid artery. A carotid stenosis is defined as 'symptomatic' if there is ischaemic symptoms within preceding 6 months. Abnormalities on brain imaging studies without symptoms are generally not considered 'symptomatic'.

Early revascularisation is well-established as the standard of care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (figure 2). Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have consistently found carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to be superior to medical therapy alone in this population. Clinical features associated with higher benefits from CEA are more severe carotid lesions (70%–99%), male sex, older age (> 75 years) and hemispheric and cortical strokes (as opposed to retinal or lacunar strokes). The benefits of CEA are greatest within 14 days of the ischaemic event and decline as time passes.

Figure 2
Diagnostic algorithm for patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. *Symptoms of stroke/transient ischaemic attack within 6 months.

The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is more controversial. Early trials found better outcomes with CEA compared with medical therapy for significant carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. However, medical therapy has evolved greatly since the 1990s and early 2000s when there were little statin use, no antithrombotic option other than aspirin and no specific goal for treating blood pressure and diabetes. Lacking newer data, the ESC/ESVS guideline only recommends revascularisation in asymptomatic patients with 60%–99% who have additional risk factors, such as a history of contralateral transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction or anatomically high-risk findings on imaging (lipid-rich core or intraplaque haemorrhage on MRA, large echolucent and hypoechogenic plaque on ultrasound or rapid stenosis progression) (Figure 3). The ongoing CREST-2 (carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke) trial will help determine whether CEA, carotid artery stenting (CAS) or modern medical therapy is the best strategy for patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^19c927d6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis — carotid endarterectomy recommendation: In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Evidence includes a systematic review/meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 5223 asymptomatic patients; stenosis thresholds were ≥ 50% in the Veteran Affairs Cooperative Study and ≥ 60% in ACAS and ACST. The incidence of 30-day perioperative stroke or death was 2.8%, and endarterectomy reduced risk versus medical therapy: relative risk 0.69 (0.57 to 0.83) for perioperative stroke, death or any subsequent stroke, and 0.71 (0.55 to 0.90) for perioperative stroke, death, or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, with no important inconsistency across trials (I² = 0); for any stroke or death there was a nonsignificant trend favoring surgery (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). The committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing stroke disability and morbidity versus avoiding endarterectomy downsides, and in broader contexts clinicians should "consider these as suggestions (GRADE 2)".

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^79d047bd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Extracranial cerebrovascular disease — evidence and rationale for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in asymptomatic carotid stenosis are summarized as follows: randomized trials reported aggregate risk reduction, 53%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 22%-72%. ACAS thresholds included patients aged < 80 years and required that the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. CEA showed an advantage in limiting stroke and death at 5 years compared with maximal medical therapy (4.1% vs 10.0%; 95% CI, 4.0%-7.8%), and among patients aged < 75 years the 10-year stroke rates were 13.3% vs 17.9%. Systematic reviews and a population-based cohort analysis evaluated contemporary medical therapy, with 5-year stroke risk for 70% to 99% carotid stenosis at 14.6% (6 of 53) compared with 0% for 50% to < 70% stenosis (P < .0001), and for 80% to 99% stenosis ipsilateral stroke was 5 of 34 (18.3%) vs 1 of 173 (1%); P < .0001. Investigators concluded that the benefit of CEA might have been underestimated for patients with severe stenosis (> 70%), whereas the 5-year stroke risk was relatively low for those with < 70% stenosis receiving contemporary best medical therapy. Perioperative safety data from large National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, state, and Medicare datasets of 4000 to 35,000 patients demonstrated stroke and death rates as low as 2.2%, with a maximum of 6.9% (symptomatic patients only). For stenting alternatives, the role of TF-CAS or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is even less clear because no completed studies have compared these treatments against best medical therapy.

### Risk of stroke in relation to degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: a population-based cohort study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^272a7ddd]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

There is uncertainty around which patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis should be offered surgical intervention. Although stroke rates were unrelated to the degree of stenosis in the medical-treatment-only groups in previous randomised trials, this could simply reflect recruitment bias and there has been no systematic analysis of a stenosis-risk association in cohort studies. We aimed to establish whether there is any association between the degree of asymptomatic stenosis and ipsilateral stroke risk in patients on contemporary medical treatment.

Methods

We did a prospective population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study; OxVasc), and a systematic review and meta-analysis. All patients in OxVasc with a recent suspected transient ischaemic attack or stroke, between April 1, 2002, and April 1, 2017, who had asymptomatic carotid stenosis were included in these analyses. We commenced contemporary medical treatment and determined ipsilateral stroke risk in this cohort by face-to-face follow-up (to Oct 1, 2020). We also did a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies (from Jan 1, 1980, to Oct 1, 2020) reporting ipsilateral stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and included both observational cohort studies and medical treatment groups of randomised controlled trials if the number of patients exceeded 30, ipsilateral stroke rates (or the raw data to calculate these) were provided, and were published in English.

Findings

Between April 1, 2002, and April 1, 2017, 2354 patients were consecutively enrolled in OxVasc and 2178 patients underwent carotid imaging, of whom 207 had 50–99% asymptomatic stenosis of at least one carotid bifurcation (mean age at imaging: 77.5 years [SD 10.3]; 88 [43%] women). The 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk increased with the degree of stenosis; patients with 70–99% stenosis had a significantly greater 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk than did those with 50–69% stenosis (six [14.6%; 95% CI 3.5–25.7] of 53 patients vs none of 154; p < 0.0001); and patients with 80–99% stenosis had a significantly greater 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk than did those with 50–79% stenosis (five [18.3%; 7.7–29.9] of 34 patients vs one [1.0%; 0.0–2.9] of 173; p < 0.0001). Of the 56 studies identified in the systematic review (comprising 13717 patients), 23 provided data on ipsilateral stroke risk fully stratified by degree of asymptomatic stenosis (in 8419 patients). Stroke risk was linearly associated with degree of ipsilateral stenosis (p < 0.0001); there was a higher risk in patients with 70–99% stenosis than in those with 50–69% stenosis (386 of 3778 patients vs 181 of 3806 patients; odds ratio [OR] 2.1 [95% CI 1.7–2.5], p < 0.0001; 15 cohort studies, three trials) and a higher risk in patients with 80–99% stenosis than in those with 50–79% stenosis (77 of 727 patients vs 167 of 3272 patients; OR 2.5 [1.8–3.5], p < 0.0001; 11 cohort studies). Heterogeneity in stroke risk between studies for patients with severe versus moderate stenosis (p het < 0.0001) was accounted for by highly discrepant results (p diff < 0.0001) in the randomised controlled trials of endarterectomy compared with cohort studies (trials: pooled OR 0.8 [95% CI 0.6–1.2], p het = 0.89; cohorts: 2.9 [2.3–3.7], p het = 0.54).

Interpretation

Contrary to the assumptions of current guidelines and the findings of subgroup analyses of previous randomised controlled trials, the stroke risk reported in cohort studies was highly dependent on the degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, suggesting that the benefit of endarterectomy might be underestimated in patients with severe stenosis. Conversely, the 5-year stroke risk was low for patients with moderate stenosis on contemporary medical treatment, calling into question any benefit from revascularisation.

### Risk of stroke in relation to degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: a population-based cohort study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^9bd235fc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of stroke and for future research. As observed in patients with symptomatic disease, the degree of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis also appears to be strongly associated with ipsilateral stroke risk, which fits well with the proposed synergistic effect of flow reduction and embolisation in the pathogenesis of stroke in relation to carotid plaques. In view of the strong association observed between the degree of stenosis and stroke risk, research investigating other surrogate markers associated with stroke risk in asymptomatic patients must be fully adjusted for the degree of carotid stenosis. Additionally, our findings are an important reminder that, although randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for quantifying the effects of an intervention, they might not be suitable for determining risk associations within treatment groups and so should not be used for epidemiological analyses.

Our findings have implications for clinical practice. Contrary to assumptions in current guidelines, the stroke risk in cohort studies was highly dependent on the degree of asymptomatic stenosis, being less than 5% after 5 years on contemporary medical therapy for moderate stenosis, but approximately 15% for patients with severe stenosis. In Europe, intervention rates for high-grade stenosis might be too low, whereas in the USA the intervention rates for moderate stenosis might be too high, as recent data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program confirm that 25% of all endarterectomies for asymptomatic disease were done in patients with moderate stenosis.

Our findings also highlight the importance of accuracy in measurement of stenosis in routine practice, within certified vascular units. Finally, our findings support the notion of surveillance for moderate asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in appropriate subgroups, since the predictive value of the baseline severity of stenosis was diluted in studies with a longer follow-up, potentially due to progression of moderate stenosis over time.

In conclusion, our findings confirm previous reports that the risk of stroke distal to asymptomatic carotid stenosis has declined over the decades. However, we have shown that stroke risk remains high for patients with high-grade stenosis on contemporary medical therapy, suggesting that the benefits of surgical intervention might be underestimated. Conversely, stroke risk was low for patients with moderate stenosis on contemporary medical therapy, calling into question any benefit of revascularisation.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^2bb66a0f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for extracranial carotid disease — treatment selection and thresholds are as follows: The committee recommends carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the first-line treatment for most symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 60% to 99%. The periprocedural risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons, and CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

### Overview of the principal results and secondary analyses from the European and north American randomised trials of endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^7014f794]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Review of the primary results and secondary analyses from the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET).

Design

Review of 48 ECST and NASCET papers.

Results

The simple assumption that all patients with a symptomatic stenosis > 70% benefit from CEA is untenable. Approximately 70–75% will not have a stroke if treated medically. The ECST and NASCET have identified subgroups that should have expedited investigation and surgery (male sex, age > 75 years, 90–99% stenosis, irregular plaque, hemispheric symptoms, recurrent events for > 6 months, contralateral occlusion, multiple co-morbidity). Accordingly development of local protocols for patient selection/exclusion should involve surgeons and physicians and take account of the local operative risk. The ECST and NASCET have also shown that the ubiquitous "string sign" is not associated with a high risk of stroke, and emergency CEA is unnecessary.

Conclusions

Surgeons must quote their own results and be aware that a high operative risk reduces long-term benefit. Accordingly, in those centres with a higher operative death/stroke rate, some "lower risk" patients should probably be considered for best medical therapy alone. It is hoped that pooling of the ECST and NASCET databases will enable more definitive guidelines to be developed regarding who benefits most from CEA.

Interventional management

Interventional management consisting mainly of CEA and CAS has been shown to decrease the stroke rate in patients with carotid artery stenosis.

Carotid endarterectomy

ECST, NASCET and VA309 (Veterans Affairs 309) trials have demonstrated significant benefit of surgical intervention over medical treatment for secondary stroke prevention in patients with ipsilateral 50%–99% symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, with maximal efficacy in patients with 70%–99% carotid stenosis. Of note, pooled analysis of these trials showed no benefit of CEA for patients with 0%–49% stenosis.

For asymptomatic carotid stenosis, ACAS (Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study) and ACST-1 (Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial) established the benefit of CEA over medical therapy alone in patients with 60%–99% carotid stenosis. However, both studies started before the era of modern OMT, the widespread use of which has reduced the annual stroke rate significantly since the 1990s. In ACST-1, for example, the percentage of statin use has increased from 10% in the early period of recruitment to 80% by the end of follow-up. As such, it may be reasonable to consider OMT first for some patients who were considered surgical candidates in the past.

CEA versus CAS

CEA was first described in 1975 by DeBakey and has since become a conventional treatment for severe ECAD. As an alternative to CEA, CAS emerged in 1989 and has proven to be effective and safe for carotid artery stenosis. A number of RCTs have been done to compare the two interventional therapies (table 1). Most studies have shown a higher rate of periprocedural stroke from CAS and a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) with CEA. Similar findings have also been reported by a Cochrane review of 7572 patients, including 16 trials in 2012, and a meta-analysis of 6526 patients from 5 RCTs in 2017. Similar long-term outcomes, including the rate of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke or death with CAS and CEA, have been reported by most of the studies. CEA is preferable to CAS in patients over 70 years old.

Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and antihypertensive therapy and statins are recommended; a trial of 2 lipid targets showed that an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL reduced vascular events compared with a target of 90 to 110 mg/dL and included patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional analyses found benefit in 50% to 69% ICA stenosis quantified as 4.6% over 5 years, with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke higher in women than men (36 versus 9). In pooled carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA analyses of 4754 patients from 4 clinical trials, within 120 days of study entry the hazard ratio for those aged 65 to 69 years was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.90–2.88).

Asymptomatic patients

Background

Patients considered to be asymptomatic have either reported no carotid territory symptoms at any time in the past, or at least 6 months have elapsed since the most recent symptom. Two landmark RCTs, the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST), determined that CEA conferred a small but significant benefit over BMT in patients with an ipsilateral 60%–99% ICA stenosis. Unlike in NASCET and ECST, it was more difficult to identify subgroups of patients who were at higher (or lower) risk of stroke if treated medically. The available data suggested that males gained greater benefit than females and that patients aged > 75 years gained no benefit from CEA. Interestingly, the presence of a contralateral occlusion and increasing stenosis severity was not associated with an increased risk of late stroke on medical therapy in the RCTs.

CEA versus CAS in asymptomatic patients

30-day outcomes

Four RCTs exclusively randomised asymptomatic patients, while five included asymptomatic patients within the trial as well as symptomatic patients. In the latter studies, outcomes were not always stratified for symptom status. Table 4 details the main 30-day outcomes from five RCTs where data were provided for asymptomatic patients.

Table 4
30-day morbidity and mortality in randomised trials comparing CEA and CAS in asymptomatic patients

Late outcomes

The Lexington study, CREST and ACT-1 observed that once the perioperative period had elapsed, there was no difference in rates of late ipsilateral stroke, suggesting that CAS was as durable as CEA.

Translating evidence into clinical practice

Unlike the symptomatic RCTs, which continue to retain the same relevance in the modern era, there are concerns that the ACAS and ACST trials (which recruited patients up to 25 years ago) may not be as relevant as when published in 1995 and 2004, respectively. This is mainly because of increasing evidence that the risk of stroke on 'modern BMT' may not be as high as previously thought and there is evidence that the annual risk of stroke on BMT may have declined by about 70% since ACAS first reported in 1995. These concerns were recognised in the 2018 ESVS carotid guidelines where it was recommended that only patients with one or more clinical and/or imaging features that might make them higher risk for stroke on BMT should be considered for CEA or CAS. These imaging and clinical criteria are summarised in table 5 and readers are referred to the 2018 ESVS carotid guidelines, where greater detail has been provided regarding the magnitude of benefit (in terms of stroke reduction) associated with each of these clinical/imaging parameters.

Therapy selection and outcome weighting in extracranial carotid disease — trial composites versus committee emphasis and thresholds for no intervention: In most CEA versus CAS trials, stroke, MI, and death have been given equal weight in determining a composite end point, but data from CREST indicate that stroke has a more significant effect on quality of life at 1 year than nonfatal MI, so the committee placed more emphasis on the prevention of stroke and procedurally related death than the occurrence of periprocedural MI. The threat of stroke in asymptomatic patients with < 60% ICA stenosis and in symptomatic patients with 50% stenosis is generally considered to be small and does not warrant intervention; ECST and NASCET demonstrated that CEA was unable to reduce subsequent neurologic event rates in symptomatic patients with < 50% diameter reduction and was actually associated with increased morbidity compared with medical management, stenoses of < 60% were excluded from the asymptomatic studies, and there have been no studies supporting either CEA or CAS for this cohort of patients.

Specifically, we estimated the 5-year risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes in the CEA and initial medical therapy cohorts incorporating the IPCW, and then we computed the risk difference by comparing the CEA cohort with the initial medical therapy cohort. We computed the end point and 95% CI estimate of the 5-year risk and risk difference from the 50th, 2. 5th, and
97. 5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution for the risks and risk difference. The 5-year cumulative incidence function, accounting for competing risks for patients in the CEA cohort and those in the initial medical therapy cohort in the pragmatic sample, is seen in Figure 3. The stroke risk at 5 years of follow-up was
5. 4% in the CEA cohort and 6. 2% in the initial medical therapy cohort. The observed 5-year risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke among patients with carotid stenosis in the RCT-like sample was 6. 7% in the CEA cohort and was

### Medical management of patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^cf7feb73]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Level 1 evidence recommends that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) should be considered for symptomatic > 50% internal carotid artery stenosis for stroke prevention. However, there is little contemporary data on the natural history of patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis who were managed with medical therapy alone. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis who were managed medically.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study at a tertiary Vascular referral centre. The study period was from 1 st of June 2019 to 1 st of January 2024. Threshold for surgical intervention in patients with a symptomatic internal carotid artery was set at a stenosis of ≥ 70%-99% as defined by societal guidelines. The primary outcome was stroke-free survival and all-cause mortality. Kaplan Meier analysis was performed to assess stroke-free survival and all-cause mortality.

Results

There were 280 patients who were referred for management with a symptomatic carotid artery stenosis during the study period. One-hundred fifty patients (69.4%) were treated with a CEA, 3 patients (1.4%) with carotid artery stenting and the remaining 63 patients (29.2%) were managed medically. Of the patients managed medically, three patients (4.8%) developed a further ipsilateral ischaemic stroke during the follow-up period. Any stroke-free survival for medically vs surgically managed patients at 1- and 4-years were both 94% vs 94% and 88%. Overall, the medically-managed patient group survival compared with those who had carotid intervention at 1- and 4-years were 88% and 57% vs 97% and 88% respectively.

Conclusion

Patients who underwent intervention for symptomatic carotid disease have a better survival however risk of future ipsilateral stroke events appear to be comparable with patients who had medical management only. Larger studies are warranted to confirm the long term outcomes between carotid surgery and medical management in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

The observed 5-year risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke among patients with carotid stenosis in the pragmatic sample was 7.5% (95% CI, 6.5%-8.7%) in the CEA cohort and 6.9% (95% CI, 5.8%-8.1%) in the initial medical therapy cohort (Table 2). Five-year survival in the pragmatic sample was 73.3% (95% CI, 71.6%-74.9%) for the CEA cohort and 66.9% (95% CI, 65.0%-68.7%) for the initial medical therapy cohort.

### Carotid artery stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of carotid artery stenosis [^bfb28d0b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid artery stenting is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis. This review updates a previous version first published in 1997 and subsequently updated in 2004, 2007, and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of stenting compared with endarterectomy in people with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2018) and the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index to August 2018. We also searched ongoing trials registers (August 2018) and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing stenting with endarterectomy for symptomatic or asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. In addition, we included RCTs comparing carotid artery stenting with medical therapy alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. A second review author independently validated trial selection and a third review author independently validated data extraction. We calculated treatment effects as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with endarterectomy as the reference group. We quantified heterogeneity using the I² statistic and used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 22 trials involving 9753 participants. In participants with symptomatic carotid stenosis, compared with endarterectomy stenting was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural death or stroke (the primary safety outcome; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.19; P < 0.0001, I² = 5%; 10 trials, 5396 participants; high-certainty evidence); and periprocedural death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.80; P = 0.002, I² = 0%; 6 trials, 4861 participants; high-certainty evidence). The OR for the primary safety outcome was 1.11 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.64) in participants under 70 years old and 2.23 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.08) in participants 70 years old or more (interaction P = 0.007). There was a non-significant increase in periprocedural death or major or disabling stroke with stenting (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.91; P = 0.08, I² = 0%; 7 trials, 4983 participants; high-certainty evidence). Compared with endarterectomy, stenting was associated with lower risks of myocardial infarction (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.94; P = 0.03, I² = 0%), cranial nerve palsy (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; P < 0.00001, I² = 0%), and access site haematoma (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.68; P = 0.003, I² = 27%). The combination of periprocedural death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up (the primary combined safety and efficacy outcome) favoured endarterectomy (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.85; P < 0.0001, I² = 0%; 8 trials, 5080 participants; high-certainty evidence). The rate of ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period did not differ between treatments (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.47; P = 0.77, I² = 0%). In participants with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, there was a non-significant increase in periprocedural death or stroke with stenting compared with endarterectomy (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.97; P = 0.05, I² = 0%; 7 trials, 3378 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The risk of periprocedural death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.84; P = 0.22, I² = 0%; 6 trials, 3315 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate or higher carotid artery restenosis (50% or greater) or occlusion during follow-up was more common after stenting (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.60; P = 0.02, I² = 44%), but the difference in risk of severe restenosis was not significant (70% or greater; OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.00; P = 0.33, I² = 58%; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with a higher risk of periprocedural stroke or death than endarterectomy. This extra risk is mostly attributed to an increase in minor, non-disabling strokes occurring in people older than 70 years. Beyond the periprocedural period, carotid stenting is as effective in preventing recurrent stroke as endarterectomy. However, combining procedural safety and long-term efficacy in preventing recurrent stroke still favours endarterectomy. In people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, there may be a small increase in the risk of periprocedural stroke or death with stenting compared with endarterectomy. However, CIs of treatment effects were wide and further data from randomised trials in people with asymptomatic stenosis are needed.

### Carotid endarterectomy or stenting or best medical treatment alone for moderate-to-severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: 5-year results of a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^befb401d]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is under debate. Since best medical treatment (BMT) has improved over time, the benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) is unclear. Randomised data comparing the effect of CEA and CAS versus BMT alone are absent. We aimed to directly compare CEA plus BMT with CAS plus BMT and both with BMT only.

Methods

SPACE-2 was a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial at 36 study centres in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. We enrolled participants aged 50–85 years with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis at the distal common carotid artery or the extracranial internal carotid artery of at least 70%, according to European Carotid Surgery Trial criteria. Initially designed as a three-arm trial including one group for BMT alone (with a randomised allocation ratio of 2.9:2.9:1), the SPACE-2 study design was amended (due to slow recruitment) to become two substudies with two arms each comparing CEA plus BMT with BMT alone (SPACE-2a) and CAS plus BMT with BMT alone (SPACE-2b); in each case in a 1:1 randomisation. Participants and clinicians were not masked to allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative incidence of any stroke or death from any cause within 30 days or any ipsilateral ischaemic stroke within 5 years. The primary safety endpoint was any stroke or death from any cause within 30 days after CEA or CAS. The primary analysis was by intention-to treat, which included all randomly assigned patients in SPACE-2, SPACE-2a, and SPACE-2b, analysed using meta-analysis of individual patient data. We did two-step hierarchical testing to first show superiority of CEA and CAS to BMT alone then to assess non-inferiority of CAS to CEA. Originally, we planned to recruit 3640 patients; however, the study had to be stopped prematurely due to insufficient recruitment. This report presents the primary analysis at 5-year follow-up. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN78592017.

Findings

513 patients across SPACE-2, SPACE-2a, and SPACE-2b were recruited and surveyed between July 9, 2009, and Dec 12, 2019, of whom 203 (40%) were allocated to CEA plus BMT, 197 (38%) to CAS plus BMT, and 113 (22%) to BMT alone. Median follow-up was 59.9 months (IQR 46.6–60.0). The cumulative incidence of any stroke or death from any cause within 30 days or any ipsilateral ischaemic stroke within 5 years (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.5% (95% CI 1.0–5.8) with CEA plus BMT, 4.4% (2.2–8.6) with CAS plus BMT, and 3.1% (1.0–9.4) with BMT alone. Cox proportional-hazard testing showed no difference in risk for the primary efficacy endpoint for CEA plus BMT versus BMT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.22–3.91; p = 0.93) or for CAS plus BMT versus BMT alone (1.55, 0.41–5.85; p = 0.52). Superiority of CEA or CAS to BMT was not shown, therefore non-inferiority testing was not done. In both the CEA group and the CAS group, five strokes and no deaths occurred in the 30-day period after the procedure. During the 5-year follow-up period, three ipsilateral strokes occurred in both the CAS plus BMT and BMT alone group, with none in the CEA plus BMT group.

Interpretation

CEA plus BMT or CAS plus BMT were not found to be superior to BMT alone regarding risk of any stroke or death within 30 days or ipsilateral stroke during the 5-year observation period. Because of the small sample size, results should be interpreted with caution.

### Risk factors for stroke, myocardial infarction, or death following carotid endarterectomy: results from the international carotid stenting study [^0b4a8441]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Three major trials of carotid surgery versus best medical therapy for symptomatic carotid stenosis (the North American Symptomatic Carotid Study, NASCET, the European Carotid Surgery Trial, ECST, and the smaller Veteran's Affairs Trial)demonstrated the benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in reducing the long-term rate of recurrent stroke. Since these trials published their results, CEA has become the standard of care for patients with > 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis. However, despite developments in secondary prevention medical therapy, anaesthetic technique, surgical technique, and processes of care, there remains a significant risk of major complications associated with CEA. Trials have focussed on the endpoints of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death. Stroke and MI have a significant adverse impact on the patient's long-term survival – in-hospital stroke in particular has been shown in one study to confer a two-fold lower survival in the first year after surgery.

There is variability in surgical technique for CEA, and debate remains over optimal processes of care, including perioperative antiplatelet therapy, type of arterial reconstruction (standard, patch, or eversion CEA) and mode of anaesthesia (general, local, or combined local-general anaesthesia).

The International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS) was an international multicentre randomized controlled open clinical trial that compared the newer technique of carotid artery stenting (CAS) with CEA for patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. This study aimed to determine whether there were subgroups of surgical patients in ICSS at higher risk of stroke, MI, or death, and whether specific surgical factors are associated with higher risk.

### Influence of a six-month home-based individualized physical activity intervention on carotid plaque instability measured by magnetic resonance imaging: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^ef3d5d7c]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After 65 years of age, 4% of men and 2% of women present with carotid stenosis larger than 50% NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy trial), and the prevalence increases up to 7% and 4%, respectively, for the 75–79 year age group. Vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaques present with a thin fibrous cap, a large lipid core, and immature neovascularization leading to intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH). Among these features, IPH can be reliably assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a high sensitivity and specificity and is the best indicator of plaque instability and subsequent ischaemic risk. Despite considerable improvement in the understanding of carotid atherosclerotic plaque, the management of asymptomatic patients is still debated. The Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial studies did not report better outcomes after carotid endarterectomy surgery compared to drug therapy for the majority of asymptomatic patients. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis showed that carotid endarterectomy and modern best medical therapy presented with the same odds of stroke. Previously, the decision to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery was almost exclusively based on the severity of the carotid stenosis (≥ 70% NASCET) regardless of the risk of stroke, whereas now plaque vulnerability is also considered. Thus, the identification of patients at low risk of stroke for whom carotid endarterectomy surgery might be less beneficialled to a growing population of patients with carotid stenosis > 50% NASCET. These patients were only treated according to the best medical therapy which corresponds to the association of statins, anti-hypertensive, and antiplatelet aggregator drugs as well as lifestyle management.

for surgery were asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 167, transient ischemic attack in 294, completed stroke in 62, and nonspecific symptoms in 155. Thirty-two patients died or suffered nonfatal strokes. DURING THE PAST decade, several controlled trials have provided evidence that carotid endarterectomy is superior to best medical therapy in reducing subsequent stroke rates among important subgroups of persons at risk. 1–4 Studies in North America and Europe1, 2 demonstrated a beneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy among symptomatic.

1. The most frequent indications for carotid endarterectomy were TIA, followed by asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, nonspecific symptoms, and completed stroke. Seven patients died during their index hospitalizations, and 5 more died in the 30-day postoperative. period, for a 30-day mortality rate of 1. 8%.

Nonfatal stroke was identified within 30 days of surgery in 20 patients, including 16 during the initial hospitalization. Overall 30-day stroke or death rate was 4. 7%. and comorbid patient conditions among the 678 patients. By indication, stroke or death rates ranged from 2. 4% among the 167 patients operated on for asymptomatic carotid stenosis to
7. 1% among the 294 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for TIA. Among comorbid conditions, only. endarterectomy. Patients who underwent surgery in higher-volume hospitals for asymptomatic carotid disease or nonspecific symptoms had no strokes or deaths at 30 days, as compared with rates of 4. 9% and
4. 6%, respectively, in lower-volume hospitals. Thirty-day stroke or death rates among patients. study required rehospitalization; therefore, it is possible that patients with minor postoperative strokes escaped detection in this investigation.

Had minor cerebrovascular events been excluded in NASCET, the analogous rate would have been 2. 1%, with a fatality rate of
0. 6%. 2 Patients who were asymptomatic had 30-day stroke or death rates similar.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^94c2f411]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) revascularization evidence — ACST-1 underscored the merits of carotid revascularization (CEA or transfemoral stenting) for net 5-year stroke risk reduction benefit for patients undergoing immediate compared with deferred surgery, but < 40% of patients received statins. A 10-year analysis showed 4.5% absolute risk reduction for CEA compared with medical therapy alone. The SPACE-2 trial did not show clear superiority of carotid revascularization over medical therapy alone in patients with > 70% to 99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis. CREST 1 was the first large prospective randomized trial comparing stenting and endarterectomy; when revascularization was considered, CEA and carotid stenting had similar rates of perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), death, and subsequent ipsilateral stroke, with an age interaction favoring stenting for patients < 70 years and CEA for patients > 70 years. Transcarotid artery revascularization is a newer technique that could be considered on an individual basis. Without a large clinical trial directly comparing revascularization with contemporary medical management, a definitive conclusion on whether there is benefit from carotid revascularization in asymptomatic patients remains elusive; results from the anticipated CREST 2 could provide much-needed clarity.

Individual factors

Age

Subgroup analysis of Carotid Revascularisation Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) showed increased periprocedural stroke/MI/death by 1.77 times in patients older than 70 years treated with CAS, whereas no evidence of increased risk in CEA-treated patients. A meta-analysis of 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) also demonstrated significantly increased risk of stroke or death within 30 days after CAS in patients older than 70 and 80 years of age compared with those under 60 years of age (OR, 4.01 and 4.15, respectively). This association, however, was not found in patients undergoing CEA. Notably, even though CEA may be generally preferable to CAS in patients over 70 years old due to lower periprocedural rate of stroke or death, CAS is a reasonable choice in elderly patients with unfavourable anatomy for CEA, radiation-induced stenosis or restenosis after CEA.

Gender

Pooled data from ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial) and NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) found greater benefit from surgery in men with the number needed to treat to prevent ipsilateral stroke in 5 years being 9 for men vs 36 for women in patients with 50% or higher stenosis. In addition, the 30-day perioperative risk of death was significantly higher in women than in men (2.3% vs 0.8%, p = 0.002). Combined analysis of NASCET and the ASA and Carotid Endarterectomy (ACE) trial found no benefit from CEA in women (ARR = 3.0%, p = 0.94), contrary to men (ARR = 10.0%, p = 0.02) in 50%–69% carotid stenosis. In contrast, with 70% to 99% stenosis, CEA was beneficially in both men and women with similar 5-year ARR in stroke (17.3% vs 15.1%). Therefore, CEA is effective for stroke prevention in symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (≥ 70%) regardless of genders, while may be only beneficial in men and selected women (eg, high risk of stroke) with moderate stenosis (50%–69%).

Table 1
Duplex ultrasound velocity criteria equivalent to NASCET angiography measures used for grading the degree of carotid stenosis

The primary outcome of this analysis (≥ 70% restenosis) was defined as any residual or recurrent severe stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery detected at any stage during follow-up after completed treatment. The secondary outcome (≥ 50% restenosis) was defined as any residual or recurrent moderate or severe carotid stenosis or occlusion after completed treatment. We compared the incidence of the primary and secondary outcomes between patients randomly assigned to endovascular treatment versus endarterectomy and between patients who were treated with balloon angioplasty alone (without use of a stent) and patients treated with a stent in those randomly assigned to endovascular treatment. Because the use of stents was not randomised in CAVATAS, the analysis of patients treated with stents and those treated with balloon angioplasty is a comparison of two subsets of patients in the endovascular treatment arm and is based on post-randomisation information (ie, which endovascular treatment technique the patient actually received).

We investigated whether the following baseline characteristics were independently associated with restenosis of 70% or more: age at randomisation, sex, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, history of coronary heart disease, history of peripheral vascular disease, and the degree of ipsilateral carotid stenosis at randomisation according to the NASCET method. In a separate analysis, we assessed whether the moderate (50–69%) residual or early recurrent stenosis diagnosed up to 60 days after treatment was associated with long-term risk of restenosis of 70% or more.

To assess the association between restenosis and recurrent cerebrovascular events during long-term follow-up, we compared the incidence of the composite endpoint of ipsilateral stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and only ipsilateral stroke between patients with and without 70% or more restenosis diagnosed in the first year after treatment. Only cerebrovascular events that occurred after the first 1-year carotid duplex ultrasound that confirmed 70% or more restenosis or less than 70% restenosis were included. Events that occurred within 30 days of initial treatment were excluded because they were defined as perioperative complications of treatment. To ascertain the natural risk of cerebrovascular events with restenosis, patients who had endovascular treatment or endarterectomy for recurrent stenosis after their initial treatment were censored at the time of retreatment.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^fdd0da6a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy — evidence limitations and NASCET exclusions: Carotid endarterectomy for nonhemispheric symptoms, vertebrobasilar symptoms, acute stroke, or for stroke or TIA with internal carotid occlusion is not supported by high quality evidence but rather by very low quality evidence (case series and unsystematic observations), and in these settings surgeon's complication rate and patient's values and preferences play a major role in decision making. NASCET withheld endarterectomy from patients with life expectancy of less than 5 years and significant comorbid conditions and also excluded patients over the age of 79, those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy, and those without adequate angiographic visualization; accordingly, the net benefit in these populations is unclear, requiring judicious and selective application, and case by case decision-making with attention to patient values, surgeon experience, and surgical center outcomes.

In most patients with carotid stenosis who are candidates for intervention, CEA is preferred to CAS for reduction of all-cause stroke and periprocedural death (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B), though data from CREST suggest patients aged < 70 years may be better treated by CAS but need further confirmation. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with ≥ 60% diameter stenosis should be considered for CEA to reduce long-term stroke risk, provided a 3- to 5-year life expectancy and periprocedural stroke/death rates ≤ 3% (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).

### Long-term outcomes of stenting and endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis: a preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient data [^1d62c458]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The risk of periprocedural stroke or death is higher after carotid artery stenting (CAS) than carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis. However, long-term outcomes have not been sufficiently assessed. We sought to combine individual patient-level data from the four major randomised controlled trials of CAS versus CEA for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis to assess long-term outcomes.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of individual patient-level data, acquired from the four largest randomised controlled trials assessing the relative efficacy of CAS and CEA for treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis (Endarterectomy versus Angioplasty in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis trial, Stent-Protected Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy trial, International Carotid Stenting Study, and Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial). The risk of ipsilateral stroke was assessed between 121 days and 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 years after randomisation. The primary outcome was the composite risk of stroke or death within 120 days after randomisation (periprocedural risk) or subsequent ipsilateral stroke up to 10 years after randomisation (postprocedural risk). Analyses were intention-to-treat, with the risk of events calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards analysis with adjustment for trial.

Findings

In the four trials included, 4775 patients were randomly assigned, of whom a total of 4754 (99.6%) patients were followed up for a maximum of 12.4 years. 21 (0.4%) patients immediately withdrew consent after randomisation and were excluded. Median length of follow-up across the studies ranged from 2.0 to 6.9 years. 129 periprocedural and 55 postprocedural outcome events occurred in patients allocated CEA, and 206 and 57 for those allocated CAS. After the periprocedural period, the annual rates of ipsilateral stroke per person-year were similar for the two treatments: 0.60% (95% CI 0.46–0.79) for CEA and 0.64% (0.49–0.83) for CAS. Nonetheless, the periprocedural and postprocedural risks combined favoured CEA, with treatment differences at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years all ranging between 2.8% (1.1–4.4) and 4.1% (2.0–6.3).

Interpretation

Outcomes in the postprocedural period after CAS and CEA were similar, suggesting robust clinical durability for both treatments. Although long-term outcomes (periprocedural and postprocedural risks combined) continue to favour CEA, the similarity of the postprocedural rates suggest that improvements in the periprocedural safety of CAS could provide similar outcomes of the two procedures in the future.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^121f9c4c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease. A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. The committee recommends CEA as the first-line treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 70% to 99%. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. In patients with recent stable stroke (modified Rankin scale score, 0–2), carotid revascularization is considered appropriate for symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis and should be performed as soon as the patient is neurologically stable after 48 hours but definitely < 14 days after symptom onset. In the general population, screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease is not recommended. In selected asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of carotid stenosis, we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis as long as the patients would potentially be fit for and willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience.

### Carotid endarterectomy in patients with recurrent symptoms associated with an ipsilateral carotid artery near occlusion with full collapse [^e5f736f4]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The term internal carotid artery near occlusion (ICA NO) is used for a severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery with a collapse of the artery distal of the stenosis. It is a relatively rare condition, with a prevalence of around 20% amongst all patients with a severe (> 70%) symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and only 1% of these patients have an ICA NO with full collapse. The first relevant angiographic criteria to diagnose ICA NO were defined in 1997 by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and specified in 2005. Nevertheless, published cohort studies have used different and heterogeneous definitions of ICA NO during the past years (for example near total occlusion, pseudo-occlusion, string sign). As a result, for the domain of patients with carotid artery stenosis, no consensus on the definition of near occlusion has yet been reached.

Optimal medical treatment (OMT) has been recommended for patients with an ICA NO, which is based on a reanalysis of the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST-1), NASCET and the Veterans Affairs trial 309. This pooled analysis revealed that in patients with ICA NO (irrespective of the presence or absence of a post-stenotic full collapse), CEA plus OMT had a negative absolute risk reduction in 5 year follow-up (absolute risk reduction − 0.1%). From this time onwards, OMT was recommended in patients with symptomatic ICA NO and these patients were excluded from randomized controlled trials. Since then, a wide variety in cohort studies was published on treatment approaches and results. More recently, a meta-analysis (mainly based on small cohort studies) could not provide a new, definitive recommendation for clinical practice because of the limited number of included studies and patients, the use of a variety in diagnostic criteria, and the lack of a distinction between ICA NO with or without a post-stenotic full collapse.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to carotid endarterectomy, symptomatic patients, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing carotid endarterectomy in patients with a history of carotid territory symptoms within the preceding 6 months and a 50–69% CAS, provided the documented 30-day risk of death/stroke rate is < 6%.

### Editor's choice-risk of stroke before revascularisation in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis: a pooled analysis of randomised controlled trials [^397901d0]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Current guidelines recommending rapid revascularisation of symptomatic carotid stenosis are largely based on data from clinical trials performed at a time when best medical therapy was potentially less effective than today. The risk of stroke and its predictors among patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis awaiting revascularisation in recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and in medical arms of earlier RCTs was assessed.

Methods

The pooled data of individual patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis randomised to stenting (CAS) or endarterectomy (CEA) in four recent RCTs, and of patients randomised to medical therapy in three earlier RCTs comparing CEA vs. medical therapy, were compared. The primary outcome event was any stroke occurring between randomisation and treatment by CAS or CEA, or within 120 days after randomisation.

Results

A total of 4 754 patients from recent trials and 1 227 from earlier trials were included. In recent trials, patients were randomised a median of 18 (IQR 7, 50) days after the qualifying event (QE). Twenty-three suffered a stroke while waiting for revascularisation (cumulative 120 day risk 1.97%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–3.17). Shorter time from QE until randomisation increased stroke risk after randomisation (χ² = 6.58, p = .011). Sixty-one patients had a stroke within 120 days of randomisation in the medical arms of earlier trials (cumulative risk 5%, 95% CI 3.8–6.2). Stroke risk was lower in recent than earlier trials when adjusted for time between QE and randomisation, age, severity of QE, and degree of carotid stenosis (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25–0.88, p = .019).

Conclusion

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis enrolled in recent large RCTs had a lower risk of stroke after randomisation than historical controls. The added benefit of carotid revascularisation to modern medical care needs to be revisited in future studies. Until then, adhering to current recommendations for early revascularisation of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis considered to require invasive treatment is advisable.

In SPACE-2, no difference was seen with "unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.82 [95% CI, 0.33–24.07]", while a trial of CAS versus best medical therapy reported "unadjusted HR, 3.50 [95% CI, 0.42–29.11]". In AMTEC, CEA reduced composite events versus best medical therapy with "calculated unadjusted HR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06–0.65]".

### Second asymptomatic carotid surgery trial (ACST-2): a randomised comparison of carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy [^f8c4da65]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Among asymptomatic patients with severe carotid artery stenosis but no recent stroke or transient cerebral ischaemia, either carotid artery stenting (CAS) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can restore patency and reduce long-term stroke risks. However, from recent national registry data, each option causes about 1% procedural risk of disabling stroke or death. Comparison of their long-term protective effects requires large-scale randomised evidence.

Methods

ACST-2 is an international multicentre randomised trial of CAS versus CEA among asymptomatic patients with severe stenosis thought to require intervention, interpreted with all other relevant trials. Patients were eligible if they had severe unilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenosis and both doctor and patient agreed that a carotid procedure should be undertaken, but they were substantially uncertain which one to choose. Patients were randomly allocated to CAS or CEA and followed up at 1 month and then annually, for a mean 5 years. Procedural events were those within 30 days of the intervention. Intention-to-treat analyses are provided. Analyses including procedural hazards use tabular methods. Analyses and meta-analyses of non-procedural strokes use Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN21144362.

Findings

Between Jan 15, 2008, and Dec 31, 2020, 3625 patients in 130 centres were randomly allocated, 1811 to CAS and 1814 to CEA, with good compliance, good medical therapy and a mean 5 years of follow-up. Overall, 1% had disabling stroke or death procedurally (15 allocated to CAS and 18 to CEA) and 2% had non-disabling procedural stroke (48 allocated to CAS and 29 to CEA). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year non-procedural stroke were 2.5% in each group for fatal or disabling stroke, and 5.3% with CAS versus 4.5% with CEA for any stroke (rate ratio [RR] 1.16, 95% CI 0.86–1.57; p = 0.33). Combining RRs for any non-procedural stroke in all CAS versus CEA trials, the RR was similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (overall RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91–1.32; p = 0.21).

Interpretation

Serious complications are similarly uncommon after competent CAS and CEA, and the long-term effects of these two carotid artery procedures on fatal or disabling stroke are comparable.

Symptoms and severity of carotid stenosis

Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is defined as focal neurological symptoms that are sudden in onset and referable to ipsilateral carotid atherosclerotic pathology, including one or more transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke within the previous 6 months. The risk of recurrent ipsilateral stroke in patients with symptomatic moderate to severe carotid stenosis varies from 2.7% within the first day to 18.8% within 90 days after symptoms onset, significantly higher than those with asymptomatic stenosis with annual risk of stroke ranging from 0.34% to 2%. Despite conflicting results on the association between severity of carotid artery stenosis and risk of stroke, linear correlation between the benefit from CEA and degree of stenosis has been confirmed by previous research. Data of 6092 patients with 35 000 patient-years of follow-up showed that the absolute risk reduction (ARR) from CEA was −2.2% in patients with < 30% stenosis, 3.2% with 30%–49% stenosis, 4.6% with 50%–69% stenosis and 16.0% with 70%–99% stenosis. Therefore, the presence of symptoms and severity of stenosis serve as main factors for selection of treatment.

Update on carotid surgery and stenting

Given the recent improvements in medical therapy, should we continue to base our treatment decisions on data from 'old' symptomatic carotid trials?

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and a high risk of recurrent stroke (e.g. > 70% carotid stenosis, ischaemic event < 2 weeks previously) should be offered timely intervention with carotid intervention (Grade A).

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and lower-risk of recurrent stroke (e.g. moderate carotid stenosis, retinal symptoms only, event > 2 weeks previously) may be randomised to trials comparing carotid intervention plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone (ECST-2/CREST-2) if clinician and patient substantially uncertain about the benefits of intervention (Grade B).
Is it ever appropriate to intervene on a < 50% symptomatic stenosis?

Almost all patients with < 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis should not be treated with intervention. However, intervention in certain patients may be considered if the stenosis causes recurrent symptoms despite optimal medical therapy (Grade C).
Does gender matter – Do women really derive less benefit from carotid intervention than men?

Decisions on whether or not to intervene on patients with carotid stenosis should not be based on gender (Grade A).
With more experience, better case selection and technological advances, can CAS compete with carotid endarterectomy?

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an effective alternative intervention in selected cases (e.g. not recently symptomatic, age < 70 years, no prior ischaemic brain damage) when done by experienced interventionists. Technological advances in cerebral protection, access and stent design should be considered in patients treated with CAS (Grade A).

### Sex based subgroup differences in randomized controlled trials: empirical evidence from cochrane meta-analyses [^b055d634]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In another example, a statistically significant subgroup finding was seen for surgery (carotid endarterectomy) compared with no surgery in patients with recent symptomatic carotid stenosis for the primary outcome of five year cumulative risk of ipsilateral carotid ischemic stroke or any stroke or death within 30 days. The authors of the review suggest that sex is a clinically important effect modifier given the lower risk of ischemic stroke during medical treatment and higher operative risk in women. Other authors have offered a mechanistic explanation as to why anatomical differences could affect carotid endarterectomy. Although the most recent American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for the prevention of stroke do not make a distinction between the treatment of men and women, UpToDate suggests differential management for men and women with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50–69%.

Finally, in the topic where risperidone was compared with olanzapine for the adverse effect of change in prolactin levels from baseline, the authors included a discussion about clinical significance. Antipsychotic drug treatments are known to cause increases in plasma prolactin levels, and for women, hyperprolactinemia could be related to severe menstrual disorders. Although the review does not discuss any biological rationale, the authors state that clinicians might want to consider the different tolerability profiles of risperidone and olanzapine.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^47861d98]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention and has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation, including multiple controlled randomized trials. The appropriate treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to the community of vascular surgeons. In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, only one randomized trial, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), had been published. Since that publication, four major randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS have been published, and the role of medical management has been re-emphasized. The current publication updates and expands the 2008 guidelines with specific emphasis on six areas: imaging in identification and characterization of carotid stenosis, medical therapy (as stand-alone management and also in conjunction with intervention in patients with carotid bifurcation stenosis), risk stratification to select patients for appropriate interventional management (CEA or CAS), technical standards for performing CEA and CAS, the relative roles of CEA and CAS, and management of unusual conditions associated with extracranial carotid pathology. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, as has been done with other Society for Vascular Surgery guideline documents The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. CAS should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons. CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy.

### CASCOM study: CAR score predicting restroke in symptomatic carotid stenosis with only intensive medical therapy [^5b9d1a99]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis is based on decades-old trials, while modern medical therapy has substantially improved outcomes. The carotid artery risk (CAR) score predicts stroke risk using clinical and imaging factors. This study evaluates the 2-year risk of recurrent ipsilateral stroke in patients with recent transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, or minor stroke and ipsilateral symptomatic carotid stenosis treated with intensive medical therapy.

Methods

In this prospective, single-arm observational study conducted in Denmark from October 2020 to March 2023, we enrolled 109 patients with recent TIA, amaurosis fugax, or minor stroke and 50% to 99% ipsilateral symptomatic carotid stenosis. Patients with a CAR score ≤ 20% or > 20%, as well as those with contraindications to surgery, were included. All received intensive medical therapy. The primary outcome was ipsilateral recurrent stroke or death within 2 years.

Results

The mean age was 73 years; 60% were male patients. Six patients (5.5%) experienced ipsilateral recurrent stroke, representing a ≈75% reduction compared with historical NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) rates (≈23%). Patients with CAR score ≤ 20% (n = 96) had a significantly lower 2-year stroke rate (3.1%) than those with CAR score > 20% (n = 13; 23%; P = 0.02). The CAR score ≤ 20% subgroup showed high predictive accuracy: sensitivity of 0.90, specificity of 0.50, and positive predictive value of 0.97.

Conclusions

In this observational study, modern medical therapy was associated with low rates of recurrent stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Patients with a CAR score ≤ 20% had a low risk of recurrent stroke, suggesting that selected patients may be managed conservatively.

Figure 1
Sex-specific long-term outcomes. n represents the number of female patients. Pattern areas represent pooled individual patient data analysis.

Overall, the individual patient data meta-analysis of NASCET and ESCT reported a lower absolute risk (ARR) for 5-year stroke and periprocedural death with CEA in women compared with men (2.8% (2.2–7.8) vs 11.0% (7.6–14.4)). When stratified by per cent stenosis, women with ≥ 70% benefited from the procedure (ARR: 9.9%), while those with 50%–69% stenosis did not. A similar pattern was observed with time to procedure: only women who had a CEA performed within 2 weeks of the index event had a significant reduction in recurrent stroke. Comparing CEA to CAS at 30 days, there was a non-significant trend towards an increased hazard with CAS. No study compared CAS to BMT. Adverse events were not reported by sex.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1f7efd08]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Indications for carotid bifurcation imaging — epidemiology and rationale are summarized as follows: stroke is the third leading cause of death, behind coronary artery disease and cancer, and is the leading cause of disability in the United States and Western Europe. Approximately 80% of strokes are ischemic and 20% are hemorrhagic. Significant carotid stenosis (> 50%) is seen in 12% to 20% of all anterior circulation ischemic strokes. Unfortunately, only 15% of stroke victims have a warning transient ischemic attack (TIA) before stroke. The purpose of carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect "stroke-prone" carotid bifurcation plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from therapy designed to reduce stroke risk. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) clearly demonstrated the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in reducing stroke in patients with symptoms of carotid territory cerebral ischemia and carotid bifurcation stenosis that reduced luminal diameter by > 50%.

### The risk and benefit of endarterectomy in women with symptomatic internal carotid artery disease [^8b3574bc]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Perioperative risk and long-term benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CE) are not detailed in women with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of CE versus medical therapy in women and men with symptomatic ICA stenosis.

Methods

Data were taken from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (873 women, 2012 men) and the ASA and Carotid Endarterectomy trial (335 women, 813 men).

Results

The 30-day perioperative risk of death was higher in women than in men (2.3% versus 0.8%, P = 0.002). Higher perioperative risk of stroke and death was also observed (7.6% versus 5.9%) but not statistically significant. With ≥ 70% stenosis, the 5-year absolute risk reduction (ARR) in stroke from CE was similar between women (15.1%) and men (17.3%). With 50% to 69% stenosis, CE was not beneficial in women (ARR = 3.0%, P = 0.94), contrary to men (ARR = 10.0%, P = 0.02). Medically treated women had low risk for stroke. A stroke prognosis instrument (SPI-II) assigned points to 7 factors that identified higher risk for medically treated women: 3 points for hemispheric (not retinal) event, history of diabetes, previous stroke; 2 for age older than 70 years, stroke (not transient ischemic attack); 1 for severe hypertension, history of myocardial infarction. CE was beneficial only for 29.0% of women with 50% to 69% stenosis who had the highest total score of 8 to 15 (ARR = 8.9%).

Conclusions

Women and men with ≥ 70% symptomatic stenosis had similar long-term benefit from CE, although the perioperative risks were higher for women. CE was not beneficial for women with 50% to 69% stenosis without other risk factors for stroke.

### Sex and hypertensive organ damage: stroke [^a1f16d9a]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy

There is evidence of a different risk-benefit ratio in men and women for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Studies have demonstrated that women are less likely to undergo CEA than men, likely due to lower incidence of high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis. In addition, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke in 5 years following CEA was 9 for men versus 36 for women. A pooled analysis reported comparable benefits in stroke risk reduction from CEA in patients with ≥ 70% carotid stenosis, with a 5-year absolute risk reduction (ARR) in ischaemic stroke of 15.1% (p = 0.007) in women and 17.3% (p < 0.001) in men. Although there was a greater perioperative risk of death in women (2.3% versus 0.8% in men, p = 0.002). In this analysis, in the setting of 50–69% stenosis, CEA only provided benefit for men (men: ARR 10.0%, p = 0.02; women: ARR 3.0%, p = 0.94). It is important to note however, that women made up under 1/3 of participants in these trials. Pathological evaluation of CEA specimens established that plaques from women have a less inflammatory and more stable phenotype and are perhaps less likely to lead to a recurrent event.

### Risks and benefits of surgery for carotid endarterectomy… [^5ba5d01f]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The role of surgery in symptomatic carotid stenosis is controversial. Long-term benefits, particularly the prevention of stroke, may not outweigh the risks of surgery. There is also uncertainty regarding the medical treatment of carotid stenosis, the role of comorbidities and difficulties in defining the degree of stenosis, significant subgroups of patients and the experience/skill of individual surgeons. In the largest randomized clinical trial to date, the European Carotid Surgery Trial compared the outcome of early surgical intervention with delaying surgery as long as possible after an ischemic event attributable to carotid artery stenosis. The two groups had some small baseline differences: the surgical group had a slightly higher prevalence of both hypertension and ischemic heart disease. However, these differences were unlikely to have been clinically relevant.

There was a nonsignificant tendency for patients in the control group to be treated more aggressively with antiplatelet and lipid-lowering drugs during the follow-up period. In the group undergoing immediate surgery, 669 patients died or experienced a major stroke during the follow-up period. The risk of stroke or death was highest within 30 days of surgery. Of the 1, 745 patients assigned to the surgery group, the risk of non-fatal major stroke or death within 30 days of surgery was 7 percent. In the control group, 442 patients died or experienced a major stroke during the follow-up period. The risk of major stroke was clearly related to the age of the patient and to the severity of carotid stenosis, but only during the first two to three years following randomization. The authors compiled survival curves to estimate the balance of benefit and harm at different ages and with different degrees of carotid stenosis.

The authors conclude that decisions about endarterectomy must be based on factors such as patient characteristics and the physician's surgical expertise, but, in general, the balance of risk and benefit does not favor surgery when less than approximately 80 percent of the artery is occluded following a symptomatic episode of carotid ischemia. For a 70-year-old man, the zone of "no clear hazard or benefit" starts around stenosis of 20 percent and extends to approximately 80 percent. For women, clinical decisions may be somewhat easier, as the corresponding area of uncertainty extends from about 70 to 90 percent. In perhaps the majority of patients, however, there can be no confidence that surgery will prevent the very serious consequences of cerebral ischemia.

The study ECST was published by European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group. and colleagues in 1998 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Carotid artery stenosis, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ECST study, the trial question was: what is the role of carotid endarterectomy in adult patients with carotid stenosis who experienced at least one ischemic vascular event in the distribution of one or both carotid arteries in the previous 6 months? In the ECST study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the ECST study, the population was: 3018 patients (850 female, 2168 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with carotid stenosis with ≥ 1 ischemic vascular event in the distribution of one or both carotid arteries in the previous 6 months. The key exclusion criteria were doctors reasonably certain surgery is indicated or not indicated, embolism from the heart to the brain or eye, or more severe disease of the distal than of the proximal ICA. In the ECST study, the interventions were: n = 1807 carotid endarterectomy (within 1 year of randomization) n = 1211 no routine surgical intervention (surgery to be avoided for as long as possible). In the ECST study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in major stroke or death at 3 years, in patients with stenosis > 80% (14.9% vs. 26.5%; ARD 11.6, 95% CI 4.72 to 18.48). In the ECST study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with carotid stenosis with ≥ 1 ischemic vascular event in the distribution of one or both carotid arteries in the previous 6 months, carotid endarterectomy was superior to no routine surgical intervention with respect to major stroke or death at 3 years, in patients with stenosis > 80%.

### Long-term outcomes after stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis: the international carotid stenting study (ICSS) randomised trial [^79348dbd]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy for treatment of carotid artery stenosis, but long-term efficacy is uncertain. We report long-term data from the randomised International Carotid Stenting Study comparison of these treatments.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomly assigned 1:1 to open treatment with stenting or endarterectomy at 50 centres worldwide. Randomisation was computer generated centrally and allocated by telephone call or fax. Major outcomes were assessed by an independent endpoint committee unaware of treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was fatal or disabling stroke in any territory after randomisation to the end of follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat ([ITT] all patients) and per protocol from 31 days after treatment (all patients in whom assigned treatment was completed). Functional ability was rated with the modified Rankin scale. This study is registered, number ISRCTN25337470.

Findings

1713 patients were assigned to stenting (n = 855) or endarterectomy (n = 858) and followed up for a median of 4.2 years (IQR 3.0–5.2, maximum 10.0). Three patients withdrew immediately and, therefore, the ITT population comprised 1710 patients. The number of fatal or disabling strokes (52 vs 49) and cumulative 5-year risk did not differ significantly between the stenting and endarterectomy groups (6.4% vs 6.5%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.72–1.57, p = 0.77). Any stroke was more frequent in the stenting group than in the endarterectomy group (119 vs 72 events; ITT population, 5-year cumulative risk 15.2% vs 9.4%, HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.28–2.30, p < 0.001; per-protocol population, 5-year cumulative risk 8.9% vs 5.8%, 1.53, 1.02–2.31, p = 0.04), but were mainly non-disabling strokes. The distribution of modified Rankin scale scores at 1 year, 5 years, or final follow-up did not differ significantly between treatment groups.

Interpretation

Long-term functional outcome and risk of fatal or disabling stroke are similar for stenting and endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis.

### Clinical outcomes of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with ipsilateral intracranial stenosis [^df75e45d]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The risk of perioperative stroke and the benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remain uncertain in the case of an ipsilateral intracranial stenosis. The aim of this observational study was to analyze the early and late outcomes of CEA in patients with a carotid tandem lesion (CTL), defined as a severe stenosis at the bifurcation with any concomitant lesion ≥ 50% involving the intracranial portion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery or the main trunk of the anterior or middle cerebral artery.

Methods

From 2000 to 2009, 1143 patients underwent CEA for symptomatic or asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis according to the NASCET and ACAS recommendations, respectively. CTLs were diagnosed in 219 patients (19.2%) by extracranial and transcranial color-coded Doppler sonography combined with noninvasive brain imaging studies. The primary endpoints of the study were perioperative (30-day) stroke and death, and any ipsilateral ischemic adverse events during the follow-up, which ranged from 0.1 to 10 years (mean 4.9 ± 3.3 years). The rates of the primary endpoints were compared between patients with (group I) and without CTL (group II).

Results

Overall, 219 CEAs were performed in group I and 924 in group II. Nearly two in three of the carotid lesions (777 of 1143, 68%) were symptomatic at presentation (62.1% in group I vs 69.4% in group II; p = 0.03), with a 23.8% rate of stroke (21.9% in group I vs 24.2% in group II; p = 0.85). There were 2 (0.9%) perioperative ipsilateral strokes in group I and 5 (0.5%) in group II (p = 0.62), and no deaths. The 5-year ipsilateral stroke-free, any stroke-free, and overall survival rates did not differ significantly between patients with and without CTL.

Conclusions

This study has shown that patients with and without CTL who underwent CEA had a similar occurrence of perioperative adverse events (probably due to the extremely low incidence of perioperative complications) and comparable late outcomes, suggesting that the presence of CTL does not justify refusing CEA for patients who could benefit from it.

### Comparative effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy vs initial medical therapy in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^b4670b64]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We used national VA and Medicare data to mimic a carotid trial similar in design and analysis to the ACST, the most recent published trial that compared CEA with initial medical therapy among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Similar to the ACST, the survival curves in the pragmatic sample crossed within 2 years of follow-up, and, as in the ACST, higher stroke-free survival was found among patients who received CEA. However, the fatal and nonfatal stroke risk difference at 5 years between patients who were randomized to early CEA and those randomized to initial medical therapy was 2.3% and was less than the stroke risk difference of 5.4% (any stroke and perioperative death) reported in the ACST. This risk difference corresponded to an annualized net benefit in stroke reduction of only 0.46% per year and an NNT of 43 at 5 years. In other words, 43 patients needed to be revascularized within 1 year to avoid a single fatal or nonfatal stroke within 5 years. In contrast, in the ACST, the NNT was approximately 18. Furthermore, to test the robustness of this result to the competing risk of nonstroke death, we estimated cumulative incidence functions for fatal and nonfatal strokes in the CEA and initial medical therapy cohorts, accounting for the competing risk of death associated with other causes. This analysis suggested that little to no difference existed between the 2 treatment strategies after accounting for competing causes of death. These analyses, when taken together, suggest that in real-world practice medical therapy may be an equally acceptable treatment strategy for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to carotid artery revascularization, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to perform carotid endarterectomy to reduce the risk of future stroke, depending on patient-specific factors such as age, gender, and comorbidities, if the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is < 6% in patients with a recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral moderate (50–69%) carotid stenosis as documented by catheter-based imaging or noninvasive imaging.

### Carotid endarterectomy in patients with recurrent symptoms associated with an ipsilateral carotid artery near occlusion with full collapse [^3cec0996]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Since patients with ICA NO (with and without a post-stenotic full collapse) were identified in the first landmark trials as a subgroup that did not benefit from CEA, these patients were excluded from subsequent RCTs. As a consequence, only outdated data and data from cohort studies are available about the pros and cons of CEA, CAS or BMT in these patients.

A limited number of cohort studies have published the results of their centers' preferred treatment approach, which varied from CEA to carotid artery stenting (CAS) or BMT. Reported outcomes were highly heterogeneous and ranged from a 30-day stroke/death risk of 0–11.1% for CEA to 0–9.2% for CAS and 0–43% for best medical treatment (BMT). Furthermore, analyses of published studies are hampered by both a variety in inclusion criteria and the reporting of different clinical outcomes. In addition, most of the cohort studies do not distinguish between patients with an ICA NO with or without a post-stenotic full collapse, nor between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, even though evidence suggests this distinction to be highly important. Only the NASCET distinguished between ICA NO with versus without a post-stenotic full collapse and reported a 30-day procedural risk of 6.7% in patients with a NOFC which was similar to this risk in patients with a 70–94%. Since the 30-day procedural CEA risk decreased over the last years, it is unfortunate that no recent data are available on this risk in patients with NOFC in a randomized setting.

### ESC consensus statement on stroke risk management in carotid atherosclerotic disease: 10 key points [^76fe1394]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Carotid-related strokes can be largely prevented

Atherosclerotic carotid stenosis is a major, modifiable risk factor of ischaemic stroke. Stroke prevention strategies include screening, risk factor control, optimal medical therapy, and carotid revascularization for patients at increased stroke risk. Preventing carotid-related strokes is paramount, as once a disabling stroke occurs no treatment can currently reverse the cerebral tissue loss.

### Carotid endarterectomy in patients with recurrent symptoms associated with an ipsilateral carotid artery near occlusion with full collapse [^49dd99e6]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 17 patients with RSNOFC despite adequate medical treatment who underwent CEA, we show a 30-day post-procedural stroke/death rate of 5.9%. Besides this, no re-stenosis was seen on CTA, MRA or duplex ultrasound during the follow-up period.

Our relatively low peri- and post-procedural stroke/death rate is similar to the stroke risk in surgically treated patients with an ICA NO participating in the ECST-1 and NASCET, (irrespective of presence or absence of a post-stenotic full collapse). The negative absolute risk reduction after 5 year follow-up in patients treated with CEA in the pooled analysis is remarkable, as a beneficial effect was suggested by the NASCET investigators since in patients with NOFC, the 1-year ipsilateral stroke risk was 11.1% in medically treated patients versus 6.7% in surgically treated patients. An explanation for this could be that the NASCET reported the 1-year ipsilateral stroke risk while the pooled analysis reported the combined any stroke and operative death risk. Besides this, ECST patients had a lower prevalence of vascular risk factors such as advanced age, ischemic heart disease and dyslipidemia.

### Status update and interim results from the asymptomatic carotid surgery trial-2 (ACST-2) [^f298c5e6]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

ACST-2 is currently the largest trial ever conducted to compare carotid artery stenting (CAS) with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis requiring revascularization.

Methods

Patients are entered into ACST-2 when revascularization is felt to be clearly indicated, when CEA and CAS are both possible, but where there is substantial uncertainty as to which is most appropriate. Trial surgeons and interventionalists are expected to use their usual techniques and CE-approved devices. We report baseline characteristics and blinded combined interim results for 30-day mortality and major morbidity for 986 patients in the ongoing trial up to September 2012.

Results

A total of 986 patients (687 men, 299 women), mean age 68.7 years (SD ± 8.1) were randomized equally to CEA or CAS. Most (96%) had ipsilateral stenosis of 70–99% (median 80%) with contralateral stenoses of 50–99% in 30% and contralateral occlusion in 8%. Patients were on appropriate medical treatment. For 691 patients undergoing intervention with at least 1-month follow-up and Rankin scoring at 6 months for any stroke, the overall serious cardiovascular event rate of periprocedural (within 30 days) disabling stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, and death at 30 days was 1.0%.

Conclusions

Early ACST-2 results suggest contemporary carotid intervention for asymptomatic stenosis has a low risk of serious morbidity and mortality, on par with other recent trials. The trial continues to recruit, to monitor periprocedural events and all types of stroke, aiming to randomize up to 5,000 patients to determine any differential outcomes between interventions.

### Endarterectomy versus angioplasty in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (EVA-3S) trial: results up to 4 years from a randomised, multicentre trial [^93ff48cc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid stenting is a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy but whether this technique is as safe as surgery and whether the long-term protection against stroke is similar to that of surgery are unclear. We previously reported that in patients in the Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis (EVA-3S) trial, the rate of any stroke or death within 30 days after the procedure was higher with stenting than with endarterectomy. We now report the results up to 4 years.

Methods

In this follow-up study of a multicentre, randomised, open, assessor-blinded, non-inferiority trial, we compared outcome after stenting with outcome after endarterectomy in 527 patients who had carotid stenosis of at least 60% that had recently become symptomatic. The primary endpoint of the EVA-3S trial was the rate of any periprocedural stroke or death (ie, within 30 days after the procedure). The prespecified main secondary endpoint was a composite of any periprocedural stroke or death and any non-procedural ipsilateral stroke during up to 4 years of follow-up. Other trial outcomes were any stroke or periprocedural death, any stroke or death, and the above endpoints restricted to disabling or fatal strokes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00190398.

Findings

262 patients were randomly assigned to endarterectomy and 265 to stenting. The cumulative probability of periprocedural stroke or death and non-procedural ipsilateral stroke after 4 years of follow-up was higher with stenting than with endarterectomy (11.1%vs 6.2%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.06–3.67; p = 0.03). The HR for periprocedural disabling stroke or death and non-procedural fatal or disabling ipsilateral stroke was 2.00 (0.75–5.33; p = 0.17). A hazard function analysis showed the 4-year differences in the cumulative probabilities of outcomes between stenting and endarterectomy were largely accounted for by the higher periprocedural (within 30 days of the procedure) risk of stenting compared with endarterectomy. After the periprocedural period, the risk of ipsilateral stroke was low and similar in both treatment groups. For any stroke or periprocedural death, the HR was 1.77 (1.03–3.02; p = 0.04). For any stroke or death, the HR was 1.39 (0.96–2.00; p = 0.08).

Interpretation

The results of this study suggest that carotid stenting is as effective as carotid endarterectomy for middle-term prevention of ipsilateral stroke, but the safety of carotid stenting needs to be improved before it can be used as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to carotid artery stenting, symptomatic patients, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing carotid artery stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy in recently symptomatic patients with 50–99% stenoses with anatomical features or comorbidities deemed by the multidisciplinary team to be at higher risk for carotid endarterectomy, provided the documented 30-day risk of death/stroke is < 6%.

### Long-term outcome after angioplasty for symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis in poor surgical candidates [^b336dff0]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The optimal treatment of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis who are poor surgical candidates is uncertain. The purposes of this study were to report the long-term outcome after angioplasty in a series of these patients and to compare these data with historical control data from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET).

Methods

We identified 42 consecutive patients with > 70% carotid stenosis and ipsilateral ischemic symptoms within 120 days of treatment with angioplasty. All were considered poor surgical candidates by experienced surgeons. Baseline epidemiological stroke risk factors were obtained from review of medical records. Follow-up was from clinic records and by telephone.

Results

Baseline epidemiological stroke risk factors were similar to those of medically treated NASCET patients. Angioplasty patients tended to have higher degrees of stenosis (45% with > 90% stenosis versus 24% in NASCET) and more frequent contralateral stenosis or occlusion (30% versus 9%) than NASCET patients. Three patients suffered procedural strokes; 2 of the 3 made nearly complete recoveries. One additional patient suffered a central retinal occlusion 48 hours after angioplasty. No ipsilateral strokes occurred during the mean follow-up period of 1.7 years. Three patients were lost to follow-up. The cumulative risk of stroke was 9.5% (4 of 42) compared with 26% at 2 years for medically treated patients in NASCET.

Conclusions

These pilot data suggest a beneficial effect of angioplasty for patients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis who are not good surgical candidates.

### 10-year stroke prevention after successful carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis (ACST-1): a multicentre randomised trial [^a1653bd6]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

If carotid artery narrowing remains asymptomatic (ie, has caused no recent stroke or other neurological symptoms), successful carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces stroke incidence for some years. We assessed the long-term effects of successful CEA.

Methods

Between 1993 and 2003, 3120 asymptomatic patients from 126 centres in 30 countries were allocated equally, by blinded minimised randomisation, to immediate CEA (median delay 1 month, IQR 0.3–2.5) or to indefinite deferral of any carotid procedure, and were followed up until death or for a median among survivors of 9 years (IQR 6–11). The primary outcomes were perioperative mortality and morbidity (death or stroke within 30 days) and non-perioperative stroke. Kaplan-Meier percentages and logrank p values are from intention-to-treat analyses. This study is registered, number ISRCTN26156392.

Findings

1560 patients were allocated immediate CEA versus 1560 allocated deferral of any carotid procedure. The proportions operated on while still asymptomatic were 89.7% versus 4.8% at 1 year (and 92.1%vs 16.5% at 5 years). Perioperative risk of stroke or death within 30 days was 3.0% (95% CI 2.4–3.9; 26 non-disabling strokes plus 34 disabling or fatal perioperative events in 1979 CEAs). Excluding perioperative events and non-stroke mortality, stroke risks (immediate vs deferred CEA) were 4.1% versus 10.0% at 5 years (gain 5.9%, 95% CI 4.0–7.8) and 10.8% versus 16.9% at 10 years (gain 6.1%, 2.7–9.4); ratio of stroke incidence rates 0.54, 95% CI 0.43–0.68, p < 0.0001. 62 versus 104 had a disabling or fatal stroke, and 37 versus 84 others had a non-disabling stroke. Combining perioperative events and strokes, net risks were 6.9% versus 10.9% at 5 years (gain 4.1%, 2.0–6.2) and 13.4% versus 17.9% at 10 years (gain 4.6%, 1.2–7.9). Medication was similar in both groups; throughout the study, most were on antithrombotic and antihypertensive therapy. Net benefits were significant both for those on lipid-lowering therapy and for those not, and both for men and for women up to 75 years of age at entry (although not for older patients).

Interpretation

Successful CEA for asymptomatic patients younger than 75 years of age reduces 10-year stroke risks. Half this reduction is in disabling or fatal strokes. Net benefit in future patients will depend on their risks from unoperated carotid lesions (which will be reduced by medication), on future surgical risks (which might differ from those in trials), and on whether life expectancy exceeds 10 years.

### Lessons from ACST-2 [^7f643ec9]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent 130-center, international, second ACST trial (Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial) involving 3625 patients found that regardless of whether a patient underwent stenting or endarterectomy, the periprocedural risk of disabling or fatal stroke was about 1% and the 5-year estimated risk of nonprocedural disabling or fatal stroke was 2.5%. With advances in technique, technology, and patient selection, stenting done by appropriately trained and experienced operators can achieve safety and efficacy comparable to endarterectomy for asymptomatic patients. The ongoing CREST-2 trial (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial) will clarify whether revascularization, by either stenting or endarterectomy, remains an important therapeutic goal in the setting of modern intensive medical therapy.
