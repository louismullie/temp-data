## Question

interventions for potential fall

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interventions for preventing falls in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the target population and scope. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence hierarchy and extract PICO. Next, I will appraise individual studies and synthesize by intervention type, assigning GRADE-like certainty. After that, I need to translate this into practical, risk-stratified recommendations and implementation details. Finally, I will flag controversies, gaps, and monitoring needs, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't jump to conclusions. The question centers on community-dwelling older adults, typically aged 65 years and older, at increased risk of falls, and excludes institutionalized settings and primary fracture-prevention strategies, which aligns with USPSTF and Cochrane scopes and the World Guidelines' emphasis on community-based prevention rather than acute care or post-fracture rehabilitation [^aa88bea6] [^e14efe10] [^76e14b5e].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy and explicitly frame PICO to guide appraisal. The strongest evidence comes from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, followed by individual RCTs, with observational and guideline statements supporting external validity and implementation; PICO is Population: community-dwelling adults ≥ 65 years at increased fall risk; Interventions: exercise, multifactorial risk assessment with targeted interventions, and selected adjuncts; Comparators: usual care or no active intervention; Outcomes: falls, injurious falls, fractures, hospitalizations, mortality, adherence, and harms [^aa88bea6] [^808c9d82] [^c058f254].

> Now, I will examine exercise interventions, since they consistently show the most robust benefit. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and components. High-certainty evidence shows exercise reduces falls by about 23% and the proportion of fallers by about 15%, with the most effective programs emphasizing balance and functional training, often combined with strength and resistance; Tai Chi also reduces falls and is particularly effective in higher-risk groups, and programs typically require at least 12 weeks, often 2–3 sessions per week, with progression in intensity to maintain challenge [^c058f254] [^93f7349d] [^ffd3962e] [^39462b15].

> Hold on, I should verify multifactorial interventions next and not overstate their effect. Multifactorial programs that start with a comprehensive risk assessment and deliver individualized interventions reduce fall rates by roughly 16% in pooled analyses, but show little to no reduction in the number of people who fall, injurious falls, or fractures; heterogeneity is high, and adherence to recommendations hovers around 60–70%, which likely attenuates effect sizes in real-world settings [^808c9d82] [^95c09836] [^e14efe10].

> Let me consider environmental and assistive strategies, and I should double-check that I'm not conflating universal versus targeted approaches. Home hazard reduction is effective when targeted to higher-risk individuals, reducing falls by about 26% overall and by about 38% in those selected for higher risk, whereas universal home modification without risk selection shows no benefit; this reinforces the need to pair environment changes with risk stratification and, when possible, occupational therapy delivery [^a9fc72eb].

> I should confirm the stance on vitamin D, because older guidance sometimes conflates fracture and fall prevention. The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation solely to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults without deficiency, as high-quality evidence shows no benefit on falls; vitamin D may reduce fractures in deficient individuals, but that is a separate question from fall prevention and should not drive fall-prevention prescribing [^2c4e539d] [^d083c9c2].

> Next, I should review other single or adjunct interventions with more limited or conditional evidence. Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medications reduces falls in appropriate candidates, pacemakers reduce falls in carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and first-eye cataract surgery reduces falls; vision correction alone can increase falls in some contexts, so it must be individualized and, when possible, paired with balance training or other risk mitigation [^b8fc9884] [^a9fc72eb].

> I will now translate this into a risk-stratified, clinically actionable approach, but let me verify alignment with guidelines. For adults 65 and older, screen annually for falls or functional limitations; those with a history of falls, gait or balance impairment, or fear of falling should be offered exercise as first-line therapy, with progression in intensity and at least 12 weeks' duration; consider Tai Chi or structured balance programs for added benefit, and ensure programs are accessible and supervised when needed [^aa88bea6] [^39462b15] [^cdbbabdd].

> For patients at higher risk or with recurrent falls, I should confirm that multifactorial assessment and targeted interventions are reasonable despite modest effect sizes. A comprehensive assessment should cover balance and gait, vision and hearing, medications (especially psychotropics), orthostatic blood pressure, cognition, foot problems and footwear, and home hazards; interventions are then tailored to identified risks, with exercise remaining a core component and adherence strategies emphasized to realize benefit [^1e3e16a0] [^76e14b5e] [^74d72e76].

> But wait, what about implementation barriers and pragmatic delivery models. I need to ensure recommendations are feasible in primary care. STEADI provides a structured screen, assess, intervene framework that clinicians can adopt, and the CDC Compendium catalogs evidence-based programs for referral; telehealth delivery and community partnerships can expand access, though fidelity and supervision still matter for exercise effectiveness [^01a80ce3] [^128cf007] [^43ca873d].

> I should double-check controversies and evidence gaps so counseling is balanced. Heterogeneity and adherence limitations dampen observed effects for multifactorial programs, and two large pragmatic trials struggled to reproduce efficacy-level benefits, underscoring the need for adequate resources, staffing, and behavior-change support; research gaps include optimal dosing of exercise components, effectiveness in adults ≥ 85 and those with frailty, and validated tools for primary care risk stratification [^76e14b5e] [^43ca873d].

> Let me reconsider special populations and modifiers to avoid overgeneralization. Adults with cognitive impairment require caregiver involvement and simplified, safer exercise modalities; those with multimorbidity may need individualized pacing and closer monitoring; and post-hospital discharge patients are at very high short-term risk, warranting expedited fall-prevention planning and follow-up [^9fd94e24] [^a10a76a6].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up so the plan is dynamic. Reassess fall risk periodically, track adherence to exercise and other recommendations, and adjust the intervention mix if falls recur or new risk factors emerge; document outcomes and communicate with caregivers and community providers to sustain engagement [^01a80ce3] [^9fd94e24].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and reference-anchored. Exercise with balance and functional training is the most effective single intervention and should be offered broadly to older adults at increased fall risk; multifactorial assessment with targeted interventions can provide additional benefit in higher-risk patients but requires resources and adherence support; environmental modifications are most effective when targeted; vitamin D should not be used solely to prevent falls; and implementation via STEADI, community programs, and telehealth can scale access while preserving fidelity [^aa88bea6] [^c058f254] [^a9fc72eb] [^2c4e539d] [^01a80ce3].

The most effective interventions to prevent potential falls in older adults are **exercise programs** (balance, strength, and functional training) [^c058f254] and **multifactorial risk assessment with targeted interventions** (medication review, vision correction, home hazard modification, and management of chronic conditions) [^e14efe10] [^a9fc72eb]. Exercise reduces falls by **23%** and injurious falls by **15%**, while multifactorial interventions reduce fall rates by **16%** [^c058f254] [^808c9d82]. Vitamin D is not recommended for fall prevention unless there is deficiency [^2c4e539d], and population-based strategies show limited evidence [^06bac8bd]. Individualized, sustained programs with adherence support yield the best outcomes [^9fd94e24] [^60224dc4].

---

## Exercise interventions

Exercise is the **most effective single intervention** for fall prevention, with strong evidence supporting balance, strength, and functional training [^c058f254] [^93f7349d].

- **Balance and functional training**: Reduces falls by 24% and the number of fallers by 13% [^c058f254].
- **Strength and resistance training**: Essential component, especially when combined with balance exercises [^c058f254] [^39462b15].
- **Tai Chi**: Reduces falls by 19% and the number of fallers by 20% [^c058f254] [^ffd3962e].
- **Dosing**: At least 3 sessions per week for 12+ weeks, progressed in intensity; longer programs yield greater benefits [^39462b15] [^cdbbabdd].

---

## Multifactorial interventions

Multifactorial interventions begin with a **comprehensive risk assessment** and deliver individualized interventions, including medication review, vision correction, home hazard modification, and management of chronic conditions [^e14efe10] [^76e14b5e].

- **Effectiveness**: Reduces fall rate by 16% (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.95) [^808c9d82] [^95c09836].
- **Components**: Exercise, medication review, vision assessment, home hazard modification, and management of chronic conditions [^e14efe10] [^76e14b5e].
- **Adherence**: 60–70% for individual recommendations; adherence impacts effectiveness [^41421a9e].

---

## Environmental modifications

Home hazard assessment and modification are effective, particularly for **high-risk individuals** [^a9fc72eb].

- **Effectiveness**: Reduces falls by 26% overall; 38% in high-risk groups [^a9fc72eb].
- **Components**: Installation of grab bars, handrails, non-slip surfaces, improved lighting, and removal of tripping hazards [^a9fc72eb].
- **Targeted approach**: More effective when tailored to individuals with a history of falls or functional impairment [^a9fc72eb].

---

## Medication management

Medication review and **psychotropic medication withdrawal** significantly reduce falls [^b8fc9884].

- **Psychotropic medication withdrawal**: Reduces falls by 66% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16–0.74) [^b8fc9884].
- **General medication review**: Identifies and modifies medications that increase fall risk [^e14efe10] [^74d72e76].

---

## Vision correction

Vision assessment and correction, including **cataract surgery**, reduce falls in older adults with visual impairment [^b8fc9884].

- **Cataract surgery**: Reduces falls by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48–0.96) [^b8fc9884].
- **Regular vision screening**: Essential for early detection and correction of visual deficits [^76e14b5e].

---

## Vitamin D supplementation

Vitamin D is **not recommended for fall prevention** unless there is documented deficiency [^2c4e539d] [^a8658d38].

- **Evidence**: No significant reduction in falls in community-dwelling older adults [^2c4e539d] [^b8fc9884].
- **Exception**: May benefit those with vitamin D deficiency or osteoporosis [^b8fc9884] [^724b7bbd].

---

## Population-based interventions

Population-level strategies (e.g. community-wide programs, public education) show **limited evidence** and require further research [^06bac8bd] [^8a269ee5].

---

## Individualized and sustained interventions

Individualized, sustained interventions with adherence support yield the **best outcomes** [^9fd94e24] [^60224dc4].

- **Person-centered care**: Incorporates patient preferences, beliefs, and resources [^9fd94e24].
- **Adherence support**: Essential for sustained engagement and effectiveness [^60224dc4].

## Summary of evidence-based interventions

| **Intervention** | **Effectiveness** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Exercise (balance, strength, functional) | 23% reduction in falls; 15% reduction in injurious falls | High |
| Multifactorial interventions | 16% reduction in fall rate | Moderate |
| Home hazard modification | 26% reduction in falls; 38% in high-risk groups | Moderate |
| Psychotropic medication withdrawal | 66% reduction in falls | High |
| Cataract surgery | 32% reduction in falls | Moderate |
| Vitamin D supplementation | No benefit unless deficient | High |

---

The most effective interventions for preventing potential falls in older adults are **exercise programs** and **multifactorial risk assessment with targeted interventions**. Environmental modifications, medication management, and vision correction also contribute to reduced fall risk. Individualized, sustained programs with adherence support are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^aa88bea6]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the US. In 2018, 27.5% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported at least 1 fall in the past year and 10.2% reported a fall-related injury. In 2021, an estimated 38 742 deaths resulted from fall-related injuries.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.

Population

Community-dwelling adults 65 years or older at increased risk of falls.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians individualize the decision to offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. Existing evidence indicates that the overall net benefit of routinely offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls is small. When determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient's values and preferences. (C recommendation).

### Don't lose sight of the importance of the individual in effective falls prevention interventions [^762f8d37]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Falls remain a major public health problem, despite strong growth in the research evidence of effective single and multifactorial interventions, particularly in the community setting. A number of aspects of falls prevention require individual tailoring, despite limitations being reported regarding some of these, including questions being raised regarding the role of falls risk screening and falls risk assessment. Being able to personalise an individual's specific risk and risk factors, increase their understanding of what interventions are likely to be effective, and exploring options of choice and preference, can all impact upon whether or not an individual undertakes and sustains participation in one or more recommendations, which will ultimately influence outcomes. On all of these fronts, the individual patient receiving appropriate and targeted interventions that are meaningful, feasible and that they are motivated to implement, remains central to effective translation of falls prevention research evidence into practice.

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^06bac8bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Around one-third of older adults aged 65 years or older who live in the community fall each year. Interventions to prevent falls can be designed to target the whole community, rather than selected individuals. These population-level interventions may be facilitated by different healthcare, social care, and community-level agencies. They aim to tackle the determinants that lead to risk of falling in older people, and include components such as community-wide polices for vitamin D supplementation for older adults, reducing fall hazards in the community or people's homes, or providing public health information or implementation of public health programmes that reduce fall risk (e.g. low-cost or free gym membership for older adults to encourage increased physical activity).

Objectives

To review and synthesise the current evidence on the effects of population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people. We defined population-based interventions as community-wide initiatives to change the underlying societal, cultural, or environmental conditions increasing the risk of falling.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in December 2020, and conducted a top-up search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, trials with stepped-wedge designs, and controlled non-randomised studies evaluating population-level interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in adults ≥ 60 years of age. Population-based interventions target entire communities. We excluded studies only targeting people at high risk of falling or with specific comorbidities, or residents living in institutionalised settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We prioritised seven outcomes: rate of falls, number of fallers, number of people experiencing one or more fall-related injuries, number of people experiencing one or more fall-related fracture, number of people requiring hospital admission for one or more falls, adverse events, and economic analysis of interventions. Other outcomes of interest were: number of people experiencing one or more falls requiring medical attention, health-related quality of life, fall-related mortality, and concerns about falling.

Main Results

We included nine studies: two cluster RCTs and seven non-randomised trials (of which five were controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and two were controlled interrupted time series (CITS)). The numbers of older adults in intervention and control regions ranged from 1200 to 137,000 older residents in seven studies. The other two studies reported only total population size rather than numbers of older adults (67,300 and 172,500 residents). Most studies used hospital record systems to collect outcome data, but three only used questionnaire data in a random sample of residents; one study used both methods of data collection. The studies lasted between 14 months and eight years. We used Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFaNE) taxonomy to classify the types of interventions. All studies evaluated multicomponent falls prevention interventions. One study (n = 4542) also included a medication and nutrition intervention. We did not pool data owing to lack of consistency in study designs. Medication or nutrition Older people in the intervention area were offered free-of-charge daily supplements of calcium carbonate and vitamin D 3. Although female residents exposed to this falls prevention programme had fewer fall-related hospital admissions (with no evidence of a difference for male residents) compared to a control area, we were unsure of this finding because the certainty of evidence was very low. This cluster RCT included high and unclear risks of bias in several domains, and we could not determine levels of imprecision in the effect estimate reported by study authors. Because this evidence is of very low certainty, we have not included quantitative results here. This study reported none of our other review outcomes. Multicomponent interventions Types of interventions included components of exercise, environment modification (home; community; public spaces), staff training, and knowledge and education. Studies included some or all of these components in their programme design. The effectiveness of multicomponent falls prevention interventions for all reported outcomes is uncertain. The two cluster RCTs included high or unclear risk of bias, and we had no reasons to upgrade the certainty of evidence from the non-randomised trial designs (which started as low-certainty evidence). We also noted possible imprecision in some effect estimates and inconsistent findings between studies. Given the very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes, we have not reported quantitative findings here. One cluster RCT reported lower rates of falls in the intervention area than the control area, with fewer people in the intervention area having one or more falls and fall-related injuries, but with little or no difference in the number of people having one or more fall-related fractures. In another cluster RCT (a multi-arm study), study authors reported no evidence of a difference in the number of female or male residents with falls leading to hospital admission after either a multicomponent intervention ("environmental and health programme") or a combination of this programme and the calcium and vitamin D 3 programme (above). One CBA reported no difference in rate of falls between intervention and control group areas, and another CBA reported no difference in rate of falls inside or outside the home. Two CBAs found no evidence of a difference in the number of fallers, and another CBA found no evidence of a difference in fall-related injuries. One CITS found no evidence of a difference in the number of people having one or more fall-related fractures. No studies reported adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the very low-certainty evidence, we are unsure whether population-based multicomponent or nutrition and medication interventions are effective at reducing falls and fall-related injuries in older adults. Methodologically robust cluster RCTs with sufficiently large communities and numbers of clusters are needed. Establishing a rate of sampling for population-based studies would help in determining the size of communities to include. Interventions should be described in detail to allow investigation of effectiveness of individual components of multicomponent interventions; using the ProFaNE taxonomy for this would improve consistency between studies.

### How to tackle the global challenge of falls? [^06398ff9]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, falls and accompanying injuries are increasingly common, making their prevention and management a critical global challenge. The wealth of evidence to support interventions to prevent falls has recently (2022) been distilled in the first World Falls Guideline for Prevention and Management for Older Adults. The core of falls prevention includes (i) risk assessment and stratification; (ii) general recommendations on optimising physical function and mobility for all and (iii) offering a holistic, multidomain intervention to older adults at high risk of falls, in which the older adult's priorities, beliefs and resources are carefully considered. In recent decades, sustainable and adequately resourced falls prevention has proved challenging, although evidence suggests that suboptimal implementation of falls prevention is ineffective. Future research should focus on understanding the most successful approaches for implementation. To further optimise falls prevention, recent developments include technological innovation to identify and prevent falls, including exergaming. Further work is warranted to understand how to best incorporate the concepts of frailty and sarcopenia in falls prevention and management. This themed collection includes key articles in the field of falls prevention, covering several topics including risk factors, effective interventions, older adult's views, implementation issues and future perspectives.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2c4e539d]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the United States. In 2014, 28.7% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported falling, resulting in 29 million falls (37.5% of which needed medical treatment or restricted activity for a day or longer) and an estimated 33 000 deaths in 2015.

Objective

To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls and that multifactorial interventions have a small benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. Existing evidence indicates that the overall net benefit of routinely offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls is small. When determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient's values and preferences. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older. (D recommendation) These recommendations apply to community-dwelling adults who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

Abstract

Background

Around one‐third of older adults aged 65 years or older who live in the community fall each year. Interventions to prevent falls can be designed to target the whole community, rather than selected individuals. These population‐level interventions may be facilitated by different healthcare, social care, and community‐level agencies. They aim to tackle the determinants that lead to risk of falling in older people, and include components such as community‐wide polices for vitamin D supplementation for older adults, reducing fall hazards in the community or people's homes, or providing public health information or implementation of public health programmes that reduce fall risk (e.g. low‐cost or free gym membership for older adults to encourage increased physical activity).

Objectives

To review and synthesise the current evidence on the effects of population‐based interventions for preventing falls and fall‐related injuries in older people. We defined population‐based interventions as community‐wide initiatives to change the underlying societal, cultural, or environmental conditions increasing the risk of falling.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in December 2020, and conducted a top‐up search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2023.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, trials with stepped‐wedge designs, and controlled non‐randomised studies evaluating population‐level interventions for preventing falls and fall‐related injuries in adults ≥ 60 years of age. Population‐based interventions target entire communities. We excluded studies only targeting people at high risk of falling or with specific comorbidities, or residents living in institutionalised settings.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We prioritised seven outcomes: rate of falls, number of fallers, number of people experiencing one or more fall‐related injuries, number of people experiencing one or more fall‐related fracture, number of people requiring hospital admission for one or more falls, adverse events, and economic analysis of interventions. Other outcomes of interest were: number of people experiencing one or more falls requiring medical attention, health‐related quality of life, fall‐related mortality, and concerns about falling.

The numbers of older adults in intervention and control regions ranged from 1200 to 137,000 older residents in seven studies.

Most studies used hospital record systems to collect outcome data, but three only used questionnaire data in a random sample of residents; one study used both methods of data collection.

One study (n = 4542) also included a medication and nutrition intervention. We did not pool data owing to lack of consistency in study designs.

Medication or nutrition

Older people in the intervention area were offered free‐of‐charge daily supplements of calcium carbonate and vitamin D 3. Although female residents exposed to this falls prevention programme had fewer fall‐related hospital admissions (with no evidence of a difference for male residents) compared to a control area, we were unsure of this finding because the certainty of evidence was very low. This cluster RCT included high and unclear risks of bias in several domains, and we could not determine levels of imprecision in the effect estimate reported by study authors. Because this evidence is of very low certainty, we have not included quantitative results here. This study reported none of our other review outcomes.

Multicomponent interventions

Types of interventions included components of exercise, environment modification (home; community; public spaces), staff training, and knowledge and education. Studies included some or all of these components in their programme design.

The effectiveness of multicomponent falls prevention interventions for all reported outcomes is uncertain. The two cluster RCTs included high or unclear risk of bias, and we had no reasons to upgrade the certainty of evidence from the non‐randomised trial designs (which started as low‐certainty evidence). We also noted possible imprecision in some effect estimates and inconsistent findings between studies.

One CBA reported no difference in rate of falls between intervention and control group areas, and another CBA reported no difference in rate of falls inside or outside the home. Two CBAs found no evidence of a difference in the number of fallers, and another CBA found no evidence of a difference in fall‐related injuries. One CITS found no evidence of a difference in the number of people having one or more fall‐related fractures.

No studies reported adverse events.

Authors' conclusions

Given the very low‐certainty evidence, we are unsure whether population‐based multicomponent or nutrition and medication interventions are effective at reducing falls and fall‐related injuries in older adults. Methodologically robust cluster RCTs with sufficiently large communities and numbers of clusters are needed. Establishing a rate of sampling for population‐based studies would help in determining the size of communities to include. Interventions should be described in detail to allow investigation of effectiveness of individual components of multicomponent interventions; using the ProFaNE taxonomy for this would improve consistency between studies.

### Implementation of multifactorial interventions for fall and fracture prevention [^d03a8ddc]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Over 60% of falls experienced by older people result from multiple aetiological factors. Preventing falls in individual patients requires the identification and treatment of these interacting factors. Multifactorial interventions have been successful in some, but not all, fall prevention trials. Preventing falls in populations requires selection of the population most likely to benefit, and selection of the particular interventions shown to have been effective in this group. The implementation of preventive measures has been low despite strong evidence that fall and fractures can be reduced. Misconceptions about the potential for prevention in old age, the time to effect improvement, resource issues and the nature of the interventions contribute to the low uptake. An improved system of delivery of proven preventive measures is needed.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^f9042789]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF fall prevention net benefit — community-dwelling older adults at increased risk: This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk of falls. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls, and concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls.

USPSTF — rationale for falls prevention interventions in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls: Adequate evidence indicates that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit and multifactorial interventions have a small benefit for preventing falls and fall-related morbidity, with the harms of both bounded as no greater than small; overall, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit and multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in this population.

USPSTF research gaps — interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults emphasize that research is needed to develop and validate primary care–feasible risk assessment tools for adults 65 years or older, to compare exercise plus multifactorial interventions with exercise alone, to improve availability and accessibility of effective interventions (including remote delivery), to evaluate effectiveness and harms in distinct functional/risk groups (including persons 85 years or older and those with frailty), and to assess benefits and harms of educational and psychological interventions.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^fa9d443e]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF implementation guidance — Determine who is at increased risk for falls: Increasing age is strongly related to risk of falls; intervention studies most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk; and a pragmatic approach would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility. Refer older adults at increased risk for falls to exercise interventions, and individualize the decision to refer older adults at increased risk for falls to multifactorial interventions, considering the balance of benefits and harms based on prior falls, comorbid conditions, and patient values and preferences.

### Interventions to prevent falls in older adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^808c9d82]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are the most common cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in older adults.

Objective

To systematically review evidence on the effectiveness and harms of fall prevention interventions in community-dwelling older adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials for relevant English-language literature published between January 1, 2016, and May 8, 2023, with ongoing surveillance through March 22, 2024.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses with Knapp-Hartung adjustment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Falls, injurious falls, fall-related fractures, hospitalizations or emergency department visits, people with 1 or more falls, people with injurious falls, people with fall-related fractures, and harms.

Results

Eighty-three fair- to good-quality randomized clinical trials (n = 48 839) examined the effectiveness of 6 fall prevention interventions in older adults. This article focuses on the 2 most studied intervention types: multifactorial (28 studies; n = 27 784) and exercise (37 studies; n = 16 117) interventions. Multifactorial interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in falls (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74–0.95]) but not a statistically significant reduction in individual risk of 1 or more falls (relative risk [RR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91–1.02]), injurious falls (IRR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84–1.01]), fall-related fractures (IRR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81–1.26]), individual risk of injurious falls (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.83–1.02]), or individual risk of fall-related fractures (RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.60–1.24]). Exercise interventions were associated with statistically significant reductions in falls (IRR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]), individual risk of 1 or more falls (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.98]), and injurious falls (IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74–0.95]) but not individual risk of injurious falls (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.02]). Harms associated with multifactorial and exercise interventions were not well reported and were generally rare, minor musculoskeletal symptoms associated with exercise.

Conclusions and Relevance

Multifactorial and exercise interventions were associated with reduced falls in multiple good-quality trials. Exercise demonstrated the most consistent statistically significant benefit across multiple fall-related outcomes.

### Prevention of falls in older people [^84a4429b]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years the evidence base for prevention of falls in older people has increased and associated with this has been an inevitable expansion in clinical services which attempt to localize and implement what is described in the literature. This article reviews the basic physiology implicit in maintenance of the upright posture; highlights the diversity of medical and non-medical risk factors associated with falls; describes the clinical assessment of an older person at risk of falls; reviews the evidence for intervention in the prevention of falls in older people; and acknowledges the need for a clear strategic direction to successfully prevent falls and the requirement for ongoing research as well as much needed service evaluation.

### Interventions to prevent falls in older adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^257cff96]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are the most common cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults.

Objective

To systematically review literature on the effectiveness and harms of fall prevention interventions in community-dwelling older adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language literature published through August 2016, with ongoing surveillance through February 7, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years and older.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses using the method of DerSimonian and Laird.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of falls (number of unexpected events in which a person comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level), people experiencing 1 or more falls, injurious falls, people experiencing injurious falls, fractures, people experiencing fractures, mortality, hospitalizations, institutionalizations, changes in disability, and treatment harms.

Results

Sixty-two randomized clinical trials (N = 35 058) examining 7 fall prevention intervention types were identified. This article focused on the 3 most commonly studied intervention types: multifactorial (customized interventions based on initial comprehensive individualized falls risk assessment) (26 trials [n = 15 506]), exercise (21 trials [n = 7297]), and vitamin D supplementation (7 trials [n = 7531]). Multifactorial intervention trials were associated with a reduction in falls (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68–0.91]) but were not associated with a reduction in other fall-related morbidity and mortality outcomes. Exercise trials were associated with statistically significant reductions in people experiencing a fall (relative risk, 0.89 [95% 13 CI, 0.81–0.97]) and injurious falls (IRR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73–0.90]) and with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in falls (IRR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75–1.00]) but showed no association with mortality. Few exercise trials reported fall-related fractures. Seven heterogeneous trials of vitamin D formulations (with or without calcium) showed mixed results. One trial of annual high-dose cholecalciferol (500 000 IU), which has not been replicated, showed an increase in falls, people experiencing a fall, and injuries, while 1 trial of calcitriol showed a reduction in falls and people experiencing a fall; the remaining 5 trials showed no significant difference in falls, people experiencing a fall, or injuries. Harms of multifactorial and exercise trials were rarely reported but generally included minor musculoskeletal injuries.

Conclusions and Relevance

Multifactorial and exercise interventions were associated with fall-related benefit, but evidence was most consistent across multiple fall-related outcomes for exercise. Vitamin D supplementation interventions had mixed results, with a high dose being associated with higher rates of fall-related outcomes.

Response to public comment — exercise intervention components and high-risk populations — notes that the studies of exercise interventions it reviewed varied in several ways, such as providing individual vs group sessions and in the exercise components of the interventions, that nearly all exercise interventions included gait, balance, and functional training, and most included a strength and resistance training component, and that research gaps include groups at high risk of falls, such as persons 85 years or older.

### Don't lose sight of the importance of the individual in effective falls prevention interventions [^60224dc4]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

There has been growing criticism of falls risk screening and assessment tools recently, in particular related to the limited prediction accuracy of these tools. Falls risk screening involves a brief evaluation (usually less than 5 items) that classifies a person's risk of falls, but does not provide a basis to plan an individualised treatment plan, because of the general nature and small number of items reviewed. Probably the best screening item in isolation is history of previous falls, which has consistently been shown to be a strong risk factor for falls, and is a component of the majority of community based falls risk screening tools (eg). The purpose of a screen is to determine those who exceed the threshold risk level, an indication of need for a full falls risk assessment.

Falls risk assessment can involve a detailed structured assessment, or can involve use of a falls risk assessment tool. The main purpose of a falls risk assessment tool is not to predict falls risk, but to identify presence of contributory factors to the individual's falls risk, which can then form the basis of a multi-factorial falls prevention intervention. Falls risk on individual risk factors can vary in severity, and even presence of mild levels of risk on an individual risk factor should be considered for intervention, from a preventive perspective. Relatively few falls risk assessments provide graded risk on individual risk factors. Examples that do are the Physiological Profile Assessment and the FROP-Com.

Without using falls risk screening tools or falls risk assessment tools, the only approach to introducing multi-factorial interventions is to introduce falls prevention actions universally, perhaps to all identified as at increased risk. This approach has the potential to be applied to many people who do not specifically need the intervention, and to not provide required interventions for others. Identifying risk and risk factors is very important to efficient targeting of falls prevention interventions. Application of a comprehensive falls risk assessment can be the basis for effective falls prevention for individuals, particularly those at increased risk.

A potential factor limiting effectiveness of falls prevention activities is low levels of uptake and sustained engagement in recommended falls prevention activities by the older individual. Improving knowledge among older people, health professionals and carers and other staff involved with older people – that evidence based interventions can reduce falls – is likely to improve engagement with recommendations. Involvement of the older individual and their families in discussing their risk factors, goal setting, and preferences, and in linking falls prevention messages to messages promoting maintenance of independence and function may also result in improved uptake and adherence.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of a multifactorial fall prevention intervention in older home care clients at risk for falling [^ba835771]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Falls among older community-dwelling adults cause significant problems, and evidence suggests that most falls are predictable and preventable. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalization for seniors; and the economic costs of falls are likely greater than decision-makers expect. In general, falls result from the interaction of multiple risk factors, many of which are preventable. Fall prevention strategies incorporating multifactorial and interprofessional approaches, aimed at multiple risk factors contributing to falls, might be the most successful. Studies have shown that multifactorial programs are as effective at reducing falls as single intervention programs.

Although the goals of a fall prevention program are to improve health outcomes including reducing fall risk factors, preventing falls and fall-related use of health services, and maintaining quality of life, cost-effectiveness is also a critical factor. Decision- and policy-makers often have an implicit monetary value that they are willing to spend in order to produce a particular health outcome (e.g. prevent a fall), referred to as willingness-to-pay (WTP). An intervention may be effective at reducing falls, but if its costs are prohibitively high, it may not be a practical option for implementation given the WTP. To adequately inform policy- and decision-makers, both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions (including the suitability of intervention to individuals) need to be assessed.

### Multifactorial interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 trials and almost 20 000 participants [^e141371a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We identified 41 trials assessing the effects of multifactorial intervention for preventing falls in older people living in the community, with the mean age of participants ranging from 72 to 85 years. The trials included a range of multifactorial interventions, with most trials including at least two or more of the intervention components recommended by NICE. Exercise — in 35 of 41 trials — was the most common component of multifactorial interventions included in this review with more than half of all trials including study participants judged to be at higher risk of falls at enrolment (ie, participants had either presented for medical attention because of a fall or reported recurrent falls in the past year).

Multifactorial interventions were found to reduce the rate of falls when compared with those who received the comparator intervention; however, there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity. Multifactorial interventions are a specific type of intervention, where their definition means that the individual components of the intervention will differ (based on an individual's risk profile), both within an individual trial and across trials. As such, a certain amount of heterogeneity would be anticipated; however, we have downgraded our confidence in the results to low, reflecting our uncertainty around the treatment effect. Cumulative meta-analysisshows how the effect of multifactorial interventions on reducing the rate of falls has gradually become more conservative and stable over time, as more trials have been conducted.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults… [^41421a9e]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions, nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists.
4. Most trials included a history of falls as either the sole criterion or as 1 of several risk factors defining increased risk. Across the 35 trials that reported it, 58% of participants were at increased risk for falls. 4, 11. The most commonly recommended intervention components were individual or group exercise interventions, medication review, referral to vision and/or hearing specialists, and recommendations or referrals for environmental modifications.

However, not all recommendations were consistently implemented; most commonly, adherence to recommendations was in the 60% to 70% range for any individual recommendation or referral. Additionally, several trials provided intervention components to all participants regardless of the results of the risk assessment. For example, 9 of 28 trials gave 100% of the intervention group participants an exercise intervention, while 17 trials referred patients as needed to an exercise intervention. 4, 11. A pooled analysis of 20 trials demonstrated that multifactorial interventions were associated with a significant reduction in the rate of incident falls at the longest follow-up. However, pooled analyses found no significant reductions in the number of persons experiencing a fall, injurious falls, fall-related fractures, or all-cause mortality. 4, 11.

The USPSTF found evidence on other interventions, including environment assessment, exercise in combination with education intervention, medication review, exercise in combination with environmental assessment, psychological intervention, and a group education intervention. 4, 11 Studies of these other interventions were too few, too small, and had other limitations to allow the USPSTF to draw any definitive conclusions. The CDC recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach for fall prevention in adults 65 years or older that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. 19 The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that.

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^d9a4d115]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Interventions targeting falls prevention and fall‐related injuries usually target individuals with known susceptibility to modifiable risk factors or having a history of falls (Gillespie 2012), that is people identified as being at medium or high risk of falling. These fall prevention interventions usually include one or more of the following components: exercise (e.g. strength, balance, general physical activity); medication (e.g. vitamin D supplementation, medication review); medical intervention (e.g. cataract surgery, management of urinary incontinence, fluid or nutrition therapy); environmental intervention (e.g. home adaptation, mobility aids); psycho‐social intervention (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, home care services); and educational intervention (e.g. written material, videos, lectures) (Hopewell 2018). Falls prevention interventions that target individuals can be more readily evaluated through randomised controlled trials, and existing evidence supports their effectiveness in at‐risk groups (Gillespie 2012; Hopewell 2018; Sherrington 2019).

Recommendations of others — fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults — are summarized as follows: The CDC recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach for fall prevention in adults 65 years or older that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that older adults engage in multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training, as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, as part of the 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity recommended for all adults. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the USPSTF 2018 recommendation on fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults.

### Prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^20686a7b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on counseling to prevent household and recreational injuries, including falls.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults. The interventions were grouped into 5 main categories: multifactorial clinical assessment (with or without direct intervention), clinical management (with or without screening), clinical education or behavioral counseling, home hazard modification, and exercise or physical therapy.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (Grade B recommendation)The USPSTF does not recommend automatically performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older because the likelihood of benefit is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of the circumstances of prior falls, comorbid medical conditions, and patient values. (Grade C recommendation).

### Interventions for preventing falls in elderly people [^275e7606]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 30 per cent of people over 65 years of age and living in the community fall each year; the number is higher in institutions. Although less than one fall in 10 results in a fracture, a fifth of fall incidents require medical attention.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in elderly people (living in the community, or in institutional or hospital care).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group specialised register (January 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 Week 19), CINAHL (1982 to April 2003), The National Research Register, Issue 2, 2003, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com accessed 11 July 2003) and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied. Further trials were identified by contact with researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of interventions designed to minimise the effect of, or exposure to, risk factors for falling in elderly people. Main outcomes of interest were the number of fallers, or falls. Trials reporting only intermediate outcomes were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were pooled using the fixed effect model where appropriate.

Main Results

Sixty two trials involving 21,668 people were included. Interventions likely to be beneficial: Multidisciplinary, multifactorial, health/environmental risk factor screening/intervention programmes in the community both for an unselected population of older people (4 trials, 1651 participants, pooled RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.85), and for older people with a history of falling or selected because of known risk factors (5 trials, 1176 participants, pooled RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76 to 0.98), and in residential care facilities (1 trial, 439 participants, cluster-adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.60, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.73) A programme of muscle strengthening and balance retraining, individually prescribed at home by a trained health professional (3 trials, 566 participants, pooled relative risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.66 to 0.98) Home hazard assessment and modification that is professionally prescribed for older people with a history of falling (3 trials, 374 participants, RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.81) Withdrawal of psychotropic medication (1 trial, 93 participants, relative hazard 0.34, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.74) Cardiac pacing for fallers with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity (1 trial, 175 participants, WMD -5.20, 95%CI -9.40 to -1.00) A 15 week Tai Chi group exercise intervention (1 trial, 200 participants, risk ratio 0.51, 95%CI 0.36 to 0.73). Interventions of unknown effectiveness: Group-delivered exercise interventions (9 trials, 1387 participants) Individual lower limb strength training (1 trial, 222 participants) Nutritional supplementation (1 trial, 46 participants) Vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium (3 trials, 461 participants) Home hazard modification in association with advice on optimising medication (1 trial, 658 participants), or in association with an education package on exercise and reducing fall risk (1 trial, 3182 participants) Pharmacological therapy (raubasine-dihydroergocristine, 1 trial, 95 participants) Interventions using a cognitive/behavioural approach alone (2 trials, 145 participants) Home hazard modification for older people without a history of falling (1 trial, 530 participants) Hormone replacement therapy (1 trial, 116 participants) Correction of visual deficiency (1 trial, 276 participants). Interventions unlikely to be beneficial: Brisk walking in women with an upper limb fracture in the previous two years (1 trial, 165 participants).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Interventions to prevent falls that are likely to be effective are now available; less is known about their effectiveness in preventing fall-related injuries. Costs per fall prevented have been established for four of the interventions and careful economic modelling in the context of the local healthcare system is important. Some potential interventions are of unknown effectiveness and further research is indicated.

Clinical Question

Which types of interventions reduce falls in older people living in the community?

Bottom Line

Fall-prevention exercise programs, usually including muscle strengthening and balance retraining, were associated with lower fall rates in community-dwelling older people whether or not individuals were selected on the basis of fall risk. Home safety interventions, vitamin D supplementation in people with lower vitamin D levels, and individually targeted multifactorial interventions were associated with fewer falls in community-dwelling people with risk factors for falling.

### Multiple component interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries among older people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^946b8e73]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Limited attention has been paid in the literature to multiple component fall prevention interventions that comprise two or more fixed combinations of fall prevention interventions that are not individually tailored following a risk assessment. The study objective was to determine the effect of multiple component interventions on fall rates, number of fallers and fall-related injuries among older people and to establish effect sizes of particular intervention combinations.

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Cochrane, AMED, UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio, Current Controlled Trials register and Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials register were systematically searched to August 2013 for randomised controlled trials targeting those aged 60 years and older with any medical condition or in any setting that compared multiple component interventions with no intervention, placebo or usual clinical care on the outcomes reported falls, number that fall or fall-related injuries. Included studies were appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Estimates of fall rate ratio and risk ratio were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis. Data synthesis took place in 2013.

Results

Eighteen papers reporting 17 trials were included (5034 participants). There was a reduction in the number of people that fell (pooled risk ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.80 to 0.91) and the fall rate (pooled rate ratio = 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89) in favour of multiple component interventions when compared with controls. There was a small amount of statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 20%) across studies for fall rate and no heterogeneity across studies examining number of people that fell.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials found evidence that multiple component interventions that are not tailored to individually assessed risk factors are effective at reducing both the number of people that fall and the fall rate. This approach should be considered as a service delivery option.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (1947 to March 2012), CINAHL (1982 to February 2012), and online trial registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in community-dwelling older people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled data where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 159 trials with 79,193 participants. Most trials compared a fall prevention intervention with no intervention or an intervention not expected to reduce falls. The most common interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention (59 trials) and multifactorial programmes (40 trials). Sixty-two per cent (99/159) of trials were at low risk of bias for sequence generation, 60% for attrition bias for falls (66/110), 73% for attrition bias for fallers (96/131), and only 38% (60/159) for allocation concealment. Multiple-component group exercise significantly reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82; 16 trials; 3622 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96; 22 trials; 5333 participants), as did multiple-component home-based exercise (RaR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80; seven trials; 951 participants and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94; six trials; 714 participants). For Tai Chi, the reduction in rate of falls bordered on statistical significance (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.00; five trials; 1563 participants) but Tai Chi did significantly reduce risk of falling (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; six trials; 1625 participants). Multifactorial interventions, which include individual risk assessment, reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86; 19 trials; 9503 participants), but not risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; 34 trials; 13,617 participants). Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Home safety assessment and modification interventions were effective in reducing rate of falls (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97; six trials; 4208 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96; seven trials; 4051 participants). These interventions were more effective in people at higher risk of falling, including those with severe visual impairment. Home safety interventions appear to be more effective when delivered by an occupational therapist. An intervention to treat vision problems (616 participants) resulted in a significant increase in the rate of falls (RaR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.06) and risk of falling (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.91). When regular wearers of multifocal glasses (597 participants) were given single lens glasses, all falls and outside falls were significantly reduced in the subgroup that regularly took part in outside activities. Conversely, there was a significant increase in outside falls in intervention group participants who took part in little outside activity. Pacemakers reduced rate of falls in people with carotid sinus hypersensitivity (RaR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93; three trials; 349 participants) but not risk of falling. First eye cataract surgery in women reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.95; one trial; 306 participants), but second eye cataract surgery did not. Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.73; one trial; 93 participants), but not risk of falling. A prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians significantly reduced risk of falling (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; one trial; 659 participants). An anti-slip shoe device reduced rate of falls in icy conditions (RaR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.78; one trial; 109 participants). One trial (305 participants) comparing multifaceted podiatry including foot and ankle exercises with standard podiatry in people with disabling foot pain significantly reduced the rate of falls (RaR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91) but not the risk of falling. There is no evidence of effect for cognitive behavioural interventions on rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.72; one trial; 120 participants) or risk of falling (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; two trials; 350 participants). Trials testing interventions to increase knowledge/educate about fall prevention alone did not significantly reduce the rate of falls (RaR 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.20; one trial; 45 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.03; four trials; 2555 participants). No conclusions can be drawn from the 47 trials reporting fall-related fractures. Thirteen trials provided a comprehensive economic evaluation. Three of these indicated cost savings for their interventions during the trial period: home-based exercise in over 80-year-olds, home safety assessment and modification in those with a previous fall, and one multifactorial programme targeting eight specific risk factors.

Authors' Conclusions

Group and home-based exercise programmes, and home safety interventions reduce rate of falls and risk of falling. Multifactorial assessment and intervention programmes reduce rate of falls but not risk of falling; Tai Chi reduces risk of falling. Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment.

### Multiple component interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries among older people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c162c34]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are a common problem affecting older people, with a third of those aged 65 and over, and half of those aged over 85, falling each year. The consequences of falls are disability, reduced quality of life and financial costs to individuals and society. The UK National Health Service (NHS) is reported to spend around £1.7 billion each year on falls. As a consequence there has been a wealth of research undertaken to establish how best to prevent falls with interventions including exercise, home safety modifications and education. These interventions have been categorised into one of the following three combinations:

a) Single interventions e.g. exercise;

b) Multifactorial interventions where two or more individually tailored interventions are provided following a risk assessment e.g. one person may receive exercise and home hazard modification whereas another may receive home hazard and medication modifications; and

USPSTF — exercise interventions for community-dwelling older adults show that nearly all programs included gait, balance, and functional training (30/37 trials), with about two-thirds including strength and resistance training (25/37); pooled analyses found that a pooled analysis of 29 trials (n = 14 475) showed exercise interventions were associated with a significant reduction in injurious fall rate at the longest follow-up (6–24 months) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]), reduced the number of persons with ≥ 1 fall at the longest follow-up (6–24 months) (25 trials; n = 13 384; relative risk, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.98]) and the risk of injurious falls at 6 to 60 months (21 trials; n = 3984; IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74–0.95]), while pooled analyses found no significant reductions in fall-related fractures or all-cause mortality; across reporting exercise trials, 58% of participants were at increased risk for falls.

Burden and public health importance — Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the US, with high recent prevalence and mortality. In 2018, 27.5% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported at least 1 fall in the past year and 10.2% reported a fall-related injury, and in 2021, 38,742 deaths resulted from fall-related injuries.

Multidomain interventions for community dwelling older adults at high fall risk

Developing a person-centred intervention

We recommend that a falls prevention plan be based on a holistic multifactorial falls risk assessment as previously described with shared decision being used to develop agreed goals and interventions (see Algorithm, Figure 1). This means paying attention to the entire clinical assessment and considering the priorities, beliefs, resources of the older person and other relevant individuals, such as caregivers in order to develop a feasible plan that addresses individually relevant risk factors in the context of other geriatric syndromes and conditions (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online).

Strong recommendation. A care plan developed to prevent falls and related injuries should incorporate the values and preferences of the older adult. GRADE: 1B.

Strong recommendation. When creating falls prevention care plans for older adults with cognitive impairment, both the older adults' and their caregivers' perspectives should be included as it improves adherence to interventions and outcomes. GRADE: 1C.

Recommendation details and justification

Engaging older adults in a discussion about their preferences coupled with shared decision-making can improve adherence with recommendations and outcomes. The aspects identified in a scoping review of 52 studies included: the meaning of falls, perceived causes, assessment of personal risk, reaction to this perceived risk and priority given to falls as a health concern.
For those with cognitive and functional limitations, the development and then implementation of a care plan to prevent falls and related injuries will also require the involvement and training of informal (unpaid) and/or formal (paid) caregivers.
Fall prevention interventions can be time-consuming, intensive and of long duration. An older adult should be informed of both benefits and burdens of falls prevention therapy, to enable them to make an informed choice about participation. An older adult's knowledge and attitudes about falls and the priority they give to their prevention will determine whether, or what type, of therapeutic interventions they would be willing to engage in.

### Interventions for the prevention of falls in older adults: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^3e5f0682]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the relative effectiveness of interventions to prevent falls in older adults to either a usual care group or control group.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analyses.

Data Sources

Medline, HealthSTAR, Embase, the Cochrane Library, other health related databases, and the reference lists from review articles and systematic reviews.

Data Extraction

Components of falls intervention: multifactorial falls risk assessment with management programme, exercise, environmental modifications, or education.

Results

40 trials were identified. A random effects analysis combining trials with risk ratio data showed a reduction in the risk of falling (risk ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.95), whereas combining trials with incidence rate data showed a reduction in the monthly rate of falling (incidence rate ratio 0.80, 0.72 to 0.88). The effect of individual components was assessed by meta-regression. A multifactorial falls risk assessment and management programme was the most effective component on risk of falling (0.82, 0.72 to 0.94, number needed to treat 11) and monthly fall rate (0.63, 0.49 to 0.83; 11.8 fewer falls in treatment group per 100 patients per month). Exercise interventions also had a beneficial effect on the risk of falling (0.86, 0.75 to 0.99, number needed to treat 16) and monthly fall rate (0.86, 0.73 to 1.01; 2.7).

Conclusions

Interventions to prevent falls in older adults are effective in reducing both the risk of falling and the monthly rate of falling. The most effective intervention was a multifactorial falls risk assessment and management programme. Exercise programmes were also effective in reducing the risk of falling.

Framework of the guidelines

Fall Risk Stratification: a standard approach to assess an individual's estimated level of risk for falls, in order to apply a proportionate detailed assessment and intervention according to level of risk.
Assessment: process of identifying and measuring the falls risk factors across multiple domains, using recommended tools if available, to indicate potentially modifiable areas for intervention. Combined with other components of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), this enables a person-centred approach.
Management and Interventions: description of various approaches to fall prevention including recommended treatments or actions which can reduce the risk of falls and may be suitable as single interventions or in combinations.
Assessment and Treatment Algorithm: this links the three stages of initial risk stratification, assessment and management, and encourages a 'person-centred' approach to design an individualised intervention.

### Multifactorial interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 trials and almost 20 000 participants [^24a55469]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A 2018 Cochrane review of interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older people showed that multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate of falls compared with usual care (ie, no active fall prevention intervention), but may have little or no effect on other fall-related outcomes. Estimates of effectiveness have varied over time and trials have struggled to demonstrate a consistent effect of multifactorial interventions over time and in different countries. Variation in follow-up and subtle differences in comparator groups likely contribute to the large levels of study heterogeneity.

We aimed to provide a contemporary synthesis of the effectiveness of multifactorial intervention for preventing falls in older people living in the community and to focus on trials which provide longer term follow-up (≥ 12 months). This duration was selected as it is the accepted minimal duration of follow-up recommended by NICE for robust appraisal of the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to explore heterogeneity with meta-regression, and stability of effects over time.

### Multiple component interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries among older people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^790a9e5d]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We assessed RCTs that compared multiple component interventions, where participants received a fixed combination of two or more interventions that were not individually tailored based on a fall risk assessment, with a control. We found that, overall, multiple component interventions were effective at reducing the number of people that fall and the fall rate but it remains unclear as to the benefits of preventing fall-related injuries. Undertaking in-depth assessments with individuals in order to establish individual risk is recommended in the UK as best practice whereas a recent report by the US Preventative Services Task Force recommended that multifactorial assessment and individually tailored interventions are not undertaken as they provide only a small net benefit. In addition, there has also been recent debate in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society on the relative benefits of single versus multifactorial interventions to prevent falls among community dwelling older people. The results of this review provide evidence for a third approach, having multiple components that target the population of interest rather than targeting individual risk factors, which may be potentially less resource intensive than multifactorial programmes as staff would not need to undertake in-depth, multifactorial assessment to establish individual risk factors.

Comparison with existing literature

Although a number of systematic reviews have synthesised findings from single and individually tailored multifactorial fall prevention interventions, there has been limited evaluation of multiple component interventions as defined by Lamb and colleagues. Gillespie et al. reported the findings from 19 RCTs examining multiple component interventions, although studies were not pooled due to clinical heterogeneity of the interventions. They concluded that few multiple component interventions were effective. Ten of their studies were included in our review with the remainder being excluded as they did not meet pre-specified selection criteria on the basis of the study design (n = 2), being unpublished (n = 1), being published only as an abstract (n = 2), the intervention not being multiple component (n = 2) and controls not being inert in relation to preventing falls (n = 1). The findings of our review are supported by a Cochrane review of population-based interventions to prevent falls among older people that comprised six non-randomised controlled studies. They concluded that interventions aimed at the population rather than individuals reduced fall-related injuries, with relative reductions ranging from 6% to 33%, suggesting that interventions that are not tailored to the individual can be effective. We found only two studies undertaken with care home residents and therefore the review findings should be interpreted with some caution in relation to this population.

### Multifactorial and multiple component interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community [^e14efe10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Falls and fall-related injuries are common, particularly in those aged over 65, with around one-third of older people living in the community falling at least once a year. Falls prevention interventions may comprise single component interventions (e.g. exercise), or involve combinations of two or more different types of intervention (e.g. exercise and medication review). Their delivery can broadly be divided into two main groups: 1) multifactorial interventions where component interventions differ based on individual assessment of risk; or 2) multiple component interventions where the same component interventions are provided to all people.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of multifactorial interventions and multiple component interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, trial registers and reference lists. Date of search: 12 June 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, individual or cluster, that evaluated the effects of multifactorial and multiple component interventions on falls in older people living in the community, compared with control (i.e. usual care (no change in usual activities) or attention control (social visits)) or exercise as a single intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias and extracted data. We calculated the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls. For dichotomous outcomes we used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. For continuous outcomes, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data using the random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 62 trials involving 19,935 older people living in the community. The median trial size was 248 participants. Most trials included more women than men. The mean ages in trials ranged from 62 to 85 years (median 77 years). Most trials (43 trials) reported follow-up of 12 months or over. We assessed most trials at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. Forty-four trials assessed multifactorial interventions and 18 assessed multiple component interventions. (I 2 not reported if = 0%). Multifactorial interventions versus usual care or attention controlThis comparison was made in 43 trials. Commonly-applied or recommended interventions after assessment of each participant's risk profile were exercise, environment or assistive technologies, medication review and psychological interventions. Multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate of falls compared with control: rate ratio (RaR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87; 19 trials; 5853 participants; I² = 88%; low-quality evidence. Thus if 1000 people were followed over one year, the number of falls may be 1784 (95% CI 1553 to 2016) after multifactorial intervention versus 2317 after usual care or attention control. There was low-quality evidence of little or no difference in the risks of: falling (i.e. people sustaining one or more fall) (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; 29 trials; 9637 participants; I² = 60%); recurrent falls (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 12 trials; 3368 participants; I² = 53%); fall-related hospital admission (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 15 trials; 5227 participants); requiring medical attention (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 8 trials; 3078 participants). There is low-quality evidence that multifactorial interventions may reduce the risk of fall-related fractures (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01; 9 trials; 2850 participants) and may slightly improve health-related quality of life but not noticeably (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.35; 9 trials; 2373 participants; I² = 70%). Of three trials reporting on adverse events, one found none, and two reported 12 participants with self-limiting musculoskeletal symptoms in total. Multifactorial interventions versus exerciseVery low-quality evidence from one small trial of 51 recently-discharged orthopaedic patients means that we are uncertain of the effects on rate of falls or risk of falling of multifactorial interventions versus exercise alone. Other fall-related outcomes were not assessed. Multiple component interventions versus usual care or attention controlThe 17 trials that make this comparison usually included exercise and another component, commonly education or home-hazard assessment. There is moderate-quality evidence that multiple interventions probably reduce the rate of falls (RaR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.91; 6 trials; 1085 participants; I² = 45%) and risk of falls (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; 11 trials; 1980 participants). There is low-quality evidence that multiple interventions may reduce the risk of recurrent falls, although a small increase cannot be ruled out (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.05; 4 trials; 662 participants). Very low-quality evidence means that we are uncertain of the effects of multiple component interventions on the risk of fall-related fractures (2 trials) or fall-related hospital admission (1 trial). There is low-quality evidence that multiple interventions may have little or no effect on the risk of requiring medical attention (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.35; 1 trial; 291 participants); conversely they may slightly improve health-related quality of life (SMD 0.77, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.39; 4 trials; 391 participants; I² = 88%). Of seven trials reporting on adverse events, five found none, and six minor adverse events were reported in two. Multiple component interventions versus exerciseThis comparison was tested in five trials. There is low-quality evidence of little or no difference between the two interventions in rate of falls (1 trial) and risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10; 3 trials; 863 participants) and very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of the effects on hospital admission (1 trial). One trial reported two cases of minor joint pain. Other falls outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate of falls compared with usual care or attention control. However, there may be little or no effect on other fall-related outcomes. Multiple component interventions, usually including exercise, may reduce the rate of falls and risk of falling compared with usual care or attention control.

Abstract

The Task Force on Global Guidelines for Falls in Older Adults has put forward a fall risk stratification tool for community-dwelling older adults. This tool takes the form of a flowchart and is based on expert opinion and evidence. It divides the population into three risk categories and recommends specific preventive interventions or treatments for each category. In this commentary, we share our insights on the design, validation, usability and potential impact of this fall risk stratification tool with the aim of guiding future research.

### Risk assessment and prevention of falls in older community-dwelling adults: a review [^1d9de882]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are reported by more than 14 million US adults aged 65 years or older annually and can result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures.

Observations

Falls result from age-related physiologic changes compounded by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Major modifiable risk factors among community-dwelling older adults include gait and balance disorders, orthostatic hypotension, sensory impairment, medications, and environmental hazards. Guidelines recommend that individuals who report a fall in the prior year, have concerns about falling, or have gait speed less than 0.8 to 1 m/s should receive fall prevention interventions. In a meta-analysis of 59 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in average-risk to high-risk populations, exercise interventions to reduce falls were associated with 655 falls per 1000 patient-years in intervention groups vs 850 falls per 1000 patient-years in nonexercise control groups (rate ratio [RR] for falls, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71–0.83; risk ratio for number of people who fall, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81–0.89; risk difference, 7.2%; 95% CI, 5.2%-9.1%), with most trials assessing balance and functional exercises. In a meta-analysis of 43 RCTs of interventions that systematically assessed and addressed multiple risk factors among individuals at high risk, multifactorial interventions were associated with 1784 falls per 1000 patient-years in intervention groups vs 2317 falls per 1000 patient-years in control groups (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.87) without a significant difference in the number of individuals who fell. Other interventions associated with decreased falls in meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-randomized trials include surgery to remove cataracts (8 studies with 1834 patients; risk ratio [RR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.96), multicomponent podiatry interventions (3 studies with 1358 patients; RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61–0.99), and environmental modifications for individuals at high risk (12 studies with 5293 patients; RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61–0.91). Meta-analysis of RCTs of programs to stop medications associated with falls have not found a significant reduction, although deprescribing is a component of many successful multifactorial interventions.

Conclusions and Relevance

More than 25% of older adults fall each year, and falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in persons aged 65 years or older. Functional exercises to improve leg strength and balance are recommended for fall prevention in average-risk to high-risk populations. Multifactorial risk reduction based on a systematic clinical assessment for modifiable risk factors may reduce fall rates among those at high risk.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^41508787]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Multifactorial fall risk assessment and intervention — older persons: A multifactorial fall risk assessment can reveal risk factors and guide targeted interventions, and when followed by intervention it is described as a highly effective strategy to reduce falls. Multicomponent interventions offer a set of interventions to all participants, whereas multifactorial interventions offer only the adjusted subset targeting identified risk factors. Evidence, including two meta-analyses, supports multifactorial or multicomponent approaches to prevent falls, while risk factor assessment without direct intervention does not appear to be effective. Domains highlighted as particularly effective include environmental adaptation; balance, transfer, strength, and gait training; reduction in medications, particularly psychoactive medications; and management of visual deficits, postural hypotension, and other cardiovascular and medical problems.

### Psychological and educational interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community [^6ee2e99f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults are at increased risk of both falls and fall-related injuries. Falls have multiple causes and many interventions exist to try and prevent them, including educational and psychological interventions. Educational interventions aim to increase older people's understanding of what they can do to prevent falls and psychological interventions can aim to improve confidence/motivation to engage in activities that may prevent falls. This review is an update of previous evidence to focus on educational and psychological interventions for falls prevention in community-dwelling older people.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy; with or without an education component) and educational interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community.

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trials registries to June 2023. We also screened reference lists and conducted forward-citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of community-dwelling people aged 60 years and older exploring the effectiveness of psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy) or educational interventions (or both) aiming to prevent falls.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was rate of falls. We also explored: number of people falling; people with fall-related fractures; people with falls that required medical attention; people with fall-related hospital admission; fall-related psychological outcomes (i.e. concerns about falling); health-related quality of life; and adverse events.

Main Results

We included 37 studies (six on cognitive behavioural interventions; three on motivational interviewing; three on other psychological interventions; nine on multifactorial (personalised) education; 12 on multiple topic education; two on single topic education; one with unclear education type; and one psychological plus educational intervention). Studies randomised 17,478 participants (71% women; mean age 73 years). Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias for one or more domains. Cognitive behavioural interventions Cognitive behavioural interventions make little to no difference to the number of fallers (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.02; 4 studies, 1286 participants; low-certainty evidence), and there was a slight reduction in concerns about falling (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.19; 3 studies, 1132 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain or missing about the effect of cognitive behavioural interventions on other outcomes. Motivational interviewing The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of motivational interviewing on rate of falls, number of fallers, and fall-related psychological outcomes. No evidence is available on the effects of motivational interviewing on people experiencing fall-related fractures, falls requiring medical attention, fall-related hospital admission, or adverse events. Other psychological interventions The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of health coaching on rate of falls, number of fallers, people sustaining a fall-related fracture, or fall-related hospital admission; the effect of other psychological interventions on these outcomes was not measured. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of health coaching, guided imagery, and mental practice on fall-related psychological outcomes. The effect of other psychological interventions on falls needing medical attention or adverse events was not measured. Multifactorial education Multifactorial (personalised) education makes little to no difference to the rate of falls (rate ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17; 2 studies, 777 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effect of multifactorial education on people experiencing fall-related fractures was very imprecise (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.48; 2 studies, 510 participants; low-certainty evidence), and the evidence is very uncertain about its effect on the number of fallers. There was no evidence for other outcomes. Multiple component education Multiple component education may improve fall-related psychological outcomes (MD -2.94, 95% CI -4.41 to -1.48; 1 study, 459 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about its effect on all other outcomes. Single topic education The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of single-topic education on rate of falls, number of fallers, and people experiencing fall-related fractures. There was no evidence for other outcomes. Psychological plus educational interventions Motivational interviewing/coaching combined with multifactorial (personalised) education likely reduces the rate of falls (although the size of this effect is not clear; rate ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99; 1 study, 430 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but makes little to no difference to the number of fallers (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13; 1 study, 430 participants; high-certainty evidence). It probably makes little to no difference to falls-related psychological outcomes (MD -0.70, 95% CI -1.81 to 0.41; 1 study, 353 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no adverse events detected (1 study, 430 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence for psychological plus educational intervention on other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that a combined psychological and educational intervention likely reduces the rate of falls (but not fallers), without affecting adverse events. Overall, the evidence for individual psychological interventions or delivering education alone is of low or very-low certainty; future research may change our confidence and understanding of the effects. Cognitive behavioural interventions may improve concerns about falling slightly, but this may not help reduce the number of people who fall. Certain types of education (i.e. multiple component education) may also help reduce concerns about falling, but not necessarily reduce the number of falls. Future research should adhere to reporting standards for describing the interventions used and explore how these interventions may work, to better understand what could best work for whom in what situation. There is a particular dearth of evidence for low- to middle-income countries.

### Falls in older people: epidemiology, risk factors and strategies for prevention [^8729e937]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Falls are a common and often devastating problem among older people, causing a tremendous amount of morbidity, mortality and use of health care services including premature nursing home admissions. Most of these falls are associated with one or more identifiable risk factors (e.g. weakness, unsteady gait, confusion and certain medications), and research has shown that attention to these risk factors can significantly reduce rates of falling. Considerable evidence now documents that the most effective (and cost-effective) fall reduction programmes have involved systematic fall risk assessment and targeted interventions, exercise programmes and environmental-inspection and hazard-reduction programmes. These findings have been substantiated by careful meta-analysis of large numbers of controlled clinical trials and by consensus panels of experts who have developed evidence-based practice guidelines for fall prevention and management. Medical assessment of fall risks and provision of appropriate interventions are challenging because of the complex nature of falls. Optimal approaches involve interdisciplinary collaboration in assessment and interventions, particularly exercise, attention to co-existing medical conditions and environmental inspection and hazard abatement.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^95c09836]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — multifactorial interventions in community-dwelling older adults encompassed 28 trials (n = 27 784) with mean ages 72 to 85 years, in which all trials administered an initial assessment of modifiable fall risk factors and delivered individualized fall prevention advice; the most commonly recommended components were individual or group exercise, medication review, referrals to vision and/or hearing specialists, and environmental modifications, though adherence to recommendations was in the 60% to 70% range and, for example, 9 of 28 trials gave 100% of participants an exercise intervention while 17 trials referred patients as needed; a pooled analysis of 20 trials (n = 22 115) showed a significant reduction in the rate of falls at the longest follow-up (6–28 months) (IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74–0.95]) but no significant reductions in the number of persons experiencing a fall, injurious falls, fall-related fractures, or all-cause mortality.

### Novel sensing technology in fall risk assessment in older adults: a systematic review [^ac99ab69]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of accidental death and injury in older adults. One in 3 older adults over the age of 65 and 1 in 2 over 85 years of age will experience a fall in the next year and a significant portion of those that fall will suffer an injury. Given the adverse consequence of falls in older adults, considerable research has focused on identifying individual fall risk factors and targeted fall prevention. This collective research has revealed that falls and fall-related injuries are predictable and preventable with interventions targeting modifiable risk factors such as muscle strength, balance and mobility. It is also maintained that effective fall prevention programs are cost effective and an appropriate method to maximize quality of life and maintain independence of older adults. The first step to an effective fall prevention program is to identify those at risk of falling and then to determine the most appropriate interventions to reduce or eliminate falls.

### Reconsidering the approach to prevention recommendations for older adults [^bdbe67f0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bases its recommendations on an evidence-based model of clinical prevention that focuses on specific diseases, well-defined preventive interventions, and evidence of improved health outcomes. Applying this model to prevention for very old patients has been problematic for several reasons: Many geriatric disorders have multiple risk factors, interventions, and expected outcomes; older adults are not often represented in clinical trials; and important outcomes may not be measured and reported in ways that are conducive to evidence synthesis and interpretation. In 2005, the USPSTF convened a geriatrics workgroup to refine USPSTF methodology and processes to better address the preventive needs of older adults. The USPSTF has begun to apply these new approaches to the review and recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in older adults.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d41bc2e3]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Risk assessment for falls in primary care — older adults: When determining who is at increased risk of falls, primary care clinicians can consider a number of risk factors, and increasing age is strongly related to risk for falls. Other risk factors include cognitive and sensory deficits, presence of acute or chronic medical conditions, use of specific medications that can increase fall risk, environmental or occupational hazards, home or neighborhood features, and alcohol or drug use; intervention studies have most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk for future falls, and a pragmatic approach to identifying persons at increased risk for falls would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility.

### Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community [^6ef675ae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 30% of people over 65 years of age living in the community fall each year.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions to reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Current Controlled Trials (all to May 2008).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in community-dwelling older people. Primary outcomes were rate of falls and risk of falling.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were pooled where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 111 trials (55,303 participants). Multiple-component group exercise reduced rate of falls and risk of falling (rate ratio (RaR) 0.78, 95%CI 0.71 to 0.86; risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.97), as did Tai Chi (RaR 0.63, 95%CI 0.52 to 0.78; RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.51 to 0.82), and individually prescribed multiple-component home-based exercise (RaR 0.66, 95%CI 0.53 to 0.82; RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.61 to 0.97). Assessment and multifactorial intervention reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.75, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.86), but not risk of falling. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce falls (RaR 0.95, 95%CI 0.80 to 1.14; RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.92 to 1.01), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels. Overall, home safety interventions did not reduce falls (RaR 0.90, 95%CI 0.79 to 1.03); RR 0.89, 95%CI 0.80 to 1.00), but were effective in people with severe visual impairment, and in others at higher risk of falling. An anti-slip shoe device reduced rate of falls in icy conditions (RaR 0.42, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.78). Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.34, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.73), but not risk of falling. A prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians significantly reduced risk of falling (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.91). Pacemakers reduced rate of falls in people with carotid sinus hypersensitivity (RaR 0.42, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.75). First eye cataract surgery reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.66, 95%CI 0.45 to 0.95). There is some evidence that falls prevention strategies can be cost saving.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise interventions reduce risk and rate of falls. Research is needed to confirm the contexts in which multifactorial assessment and intervention, home safety interventions, vitamin D supplementation, and other interventions are effective.

### It takes a village to prevent falls: reconceptualizing fall prevention and management for older adults [^ee149b0a]. Injury Prevention (2008). Low credibility.

Systematic evidence reviews support the efficacy of physical activity programs and multifactorial strategies for fall prevention. However, community settings in which fall prevention programs occur often differ substantially from the research settings in which efficacy was first demonstrated. Because of these differences, alternative approaches are needed to judge the adequacy of fall prevention activities occurring as part of standard medical care or community efforts. This paper uses the World Health Organization Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framework to rethink how fall prevention programs might be implemented routinely in both medical and community settings. Examples of innovative programs and policies that provide fall prevention strategies consistent with the ICCC framework are highlighted, and evidence where available is provided on the effects of these strategies on processes and outcomes of care. Finally, a "no wrong door" approach to fall prevention and management is proposed, in which older adults who are found to be at risk of falls in either a medical or community setting are linked to a standard fall risk evaluation across three domains (physical activity, medical risks, and home safety).

### The (cost-) effectiveness of an implemented fall prevention intervention on falls and fall-related injuries among community-dwelling older adults with an increased risk of falls: protocol for the in balance randomized controlled trial [^f8a08d24]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in older adults. More than one-third of community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older falls at least once per year. The number of falls is expected to increase even further due to the ageing of the population. Falls in older adults often result in injury with 109,000 older adults visiting an Emergency Department due to a fall-related injury in the Netherlands in 2019. Besides the risk of injuries, falls may also increase fear of falling. Fear of falling may result in a reduction in physical activity in daily life, which can lead to a decreased muscle strength and an increased fall risk. Falls and its sequelae can lead to a decreased quality of life up to 9 months after a fall, suggesting that even after that amount of time older adults are still suffering from their fall and its consequences. Fall-related injuries result in considerable healthcare costs, which are estimated at more than 1 billion euros in the Netherlands. On top of these healthcare costs, other costs also have to be taken into account, such as individual expenses, help from family and/or friends and productivity losses due to absence from work or unpaid activities. The alarming impact of falls on older individuals, healthcare and our greying society renders the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries highly urgent.

Systematic reviews have shown fall prevention programmes to be effective in reducing the risk of falls among older adults. Group interventions appear more effective than individual programmes, because of higher compliance of participants in the group intervention. Despite the evidence that falls can be prevented by fall prevention programmes, barriers for practical implementation may harm the impact of these programmes. It can for example be questioned whether effectiveness maintains after adjustments in the intervention when implemented, which indicates the importance of re-evaluating implemented interventions.

An effective group fall prevention intervention, that is widely implemented in the Netherlands, is the In Balance intervention. In Balance is a relatively inexpensive fourteen-week group intervention that requires minimal equipment and aims to reduce falls by increasing awareness, balance and strength in older adults at risk of falling. The first four weeks of In Balance include counselling and education meetings once per week on topics regarding fall prevention to increase knowledge about preventing falls, and to increase awareness of fall risk and balance disruption. The last ten weeks comprise two one-hour exercise sessions per week. Exercises are derived from principles of Tai Chi and are mainly focused on physical balance and strength.

### Fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults [^09f26b75]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Falls are common among older adults. One in 3 adults aged 65 years or older and 1 in 2 adults aged 80 years or older fall each year. Interventions for prevention have been identified; however, they are often not addressed in primary care practice. Screening all older adults annually for falls can identify who will benefit from further clinical evaluation and management. Falls and the need for care from subsequent injury increase with age. They adversely affect quality of life and are a financial burden on the health care industry. As a result, risk reduction is a key focus of prevention efforts, even among very elderly persons.

### Fall-risk evaluation and management: challenges in adopting geriatric care practices [^5f0e0006]. The Gerontologist (2006). Low credibility.

One third of older adults fall each year, placing them at risk for serious injury, functional decline, and health care utilization. Despite the availability of effective preventive approaches, policy and clinical efforts at preventing falls among older adults have been limited. In this article we present the burden of falls, review evidence concerning the effectiveness of fall-prevention services, describe barriers for clinicians and for payers in promoting these services, and suggest strategies to encourage greater use of these services. The challenges are substantial, but strategies for incremental change are available while more broad-based changes in health care financing and clinical practice evolve to better manage the multiple chronic health conditions, including falls, experienced by older Americans.

USPSTF intervention components — The most common components of exercise interventions were gait, balance, and functional training, followed by strength and resistance training, flexibility, and endurance training. Multifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls (eg, balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health) and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment.

### Comparisons of interventions for preventing falls in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0edd44e5]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls result in substantial burden for patients and health care systems, and given the aging of the population worldwide, the incidence of falls continues to rise.

Objective

To assess the potential effectiveness of interventions for preventing falls.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ageline databases from inception until April 2017. Reference lists of included studies were scanned.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of fall-prevention interventions for participants aged 65 years and older.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers independently screened the studies, abstracted data, and appraised risk of bias. Pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Injurious falls and fall-related hospitalizations.

Results

A total of 283 RCTs (159 910 participants; mean age, 78.1 years; 74% women) were included after screening of 10 650 titles and abstracts and 1210 full-text articles. Network meta-analysis (including 54 RCTs, 41 596 participants, 39 interventions plus usual care) suggested that the following interventions, when compared with usual care, were associated with reductions in injurious falls: exercise (odds ratio [OR], 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.79]; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.67 [95% CI, -1.10 to -0.24]); combined exercise and vision assessment and treatment (OR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38]; ARD, -1.79 [95% CI, -2.63 to -0.96]); combined exercise, vision assessment and treatment, and environmental assessment and modification (OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.70]; ARD, -1.19 [95% CI, -2.04 to -0.35]); and combined clinic-level quality improvement strategies (eg, case management), multifactorial assessment and treatment (eg, comprehensive geriatric assessment), calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supplementation (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.55]; ARD, -2.08 [95% CI, -3.56 to -0.60]). Pairwise meta-analyses for fall-related hospitalizations (2 RCTs; 516 participants) showed no significant association between combined clinic- and patient-level quality improvement strategies and multifactorial assessment and treatment relative to usual care (OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.81]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Exercise alone and various combinations of interventions were associated with lower risk of injurious falls compared with usual care. Choice of fall-prevention intervention may depend on patient and caregiver values and preferences.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for preventing falls in elderly people [^c8d2a3ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 30 per cent of people over 65 years of age and living in the community fall each year; the number is higher in institutions. Although less than one fall in 10 results in a fracture, a fifth of fall incidents require medical attention.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in elderly people (living in the community, or in institutional or hospital care).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 Week 19), CINAHL (1982 to April 2003), The National Research Register, Issue 2, 2003, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com accessed 11 July 2003) and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied. Further trials were identified by contact with researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of interventions designed to minimise the effect of, or exposure to, risk factors for falling in elderly people. Main outcomes of interest were the number of fallers, or falls. Trials reporting only intermediate outcomes were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were pooled using the fixed effect model where appropriate.

Main Results

Sixty two trials involving 21,668 people were included. Interventions likely to be beneficial:Multidisciplinary, multifactorial, health/environmental risk factor screening/intervention programmes in the community both for an unselected population of older people (4 trials, 1651 participants, pooled RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.85), and for older people with a history of falling or selected because of known risk factors (5 trials, 1176 participants, pooled RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76 to 0.98), and in residential care facilities (1 trial, 439 participants, cluster-adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.60, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.73) A programme of muscle strengthening and balance retraining, individually prescribed at home by a trained health professional (3 trials, 566 participants, pooled relative risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.66 to 0.98) Home hazard assessment and modification that is professionally prescribed for older people with a history of falling (3 trials, 374 participants, RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.81) Withdrawal of psychotropic medication (1 trial, 93 participants, relative hazard 0.34, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.74) Cardiac pacing for fallers with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity (1 trial, 175 participants, WMD -5.20, 95%CI -9.40 to -1.00) A 15 week Tai Chi group exercise intervention (1 trial, 200 participants, risk ratio 0.51, 95%CI 0.36 to 0.73). Interventions of unknown effectiveness:Group-delivered exercise interventions (9 trials, 1387 participants) Individual lower limb strength training (1 trial, 222 participants) Nutritional supplementation (1 trial, 46 participants) Vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium (3 trials, 461 participants) Home hazard modification in association with advice on optimising medication (1 trial, 658 participants), or in association with an education package on exercise and reducing fall risk (1 trial, 3182 participants) Pharmacological therapy (raubasine-dihydroergocristine, 1 trial, 95 participants) Interventions using a cognitive/behavioural approach alone (2 trials, 145 participants) Home hazard modification for older people without a history of falling (1 trial, 530 participants) Hormone replacement therapy (1 trial, 116 participants) Correction of visual deficiency (1 trial, 276 participants). Interventions unlikely to be beneficial:Brisk walking in women with an upper limb fracture in the previous two years (1 trial, 165 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Interventions to prevent falls that are likely to be effective are now available; less is known about their effectiveness in preventing fall-related injuries. Costs per fall prevented have been established for four of the interventions and careful economic modelling in the context of the local healthcare system is important. Some potential interventions are of unknown effectiveness and further research is indicated.

### Exercise for preventing falls in older people living in the community [^c058f254]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

At least one-third of community-dwelling people over 65 years of age fall each year. Exercises that target balance, gait and muscle strength have been found to prevent falls in these people. An up-to-date synthesis of the evidence is important given the major long-term consequences associated with falls and fall-related injuries OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trial registers up to 2 May 2018, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of any form of exercise as a single intervention on falls in people aged 60+ years living in the community. We excluded trials focused on particular conditions, such as stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was rate of falls.

Main Results

We included 108 RCTs with 23,407 participants living in the community in 25 countries. There were nine cluster-RCTs. On average, participants were 76 years old and 77% were women. Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias for one or more items. Results from four trials focusing on people who had been recently discharged from hospital and from comparisons of different exercises are not described here. Exercise (all types) versus control Eighty-one trials (19,684 participants) compared exercise (all types) with control intervention (one not thought to reduce falls). Exercise reduces the rate of falls by 23% (rate ratio (RaR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.83; 12,981 participants, 59 studies; high-certainty evidence). Based on an illustrative risk of 850 falls in 1000 people followed over one year (data based on control group risk data from the 59 studies), this equates to 195 (95% CI 144 to 246) fewer falls in the exercise group. Exercise also reduces the number of people experiencing one or more falls by 15% (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89; 13,518 participants, 63 studies; high-certainty evidence). Based on an illustrative risk of 480 fallers in 1000 people followed over one year (data based on control group risk data from the 63 studies), this equates to 72 (95% CI 52 to 91) fewer fallers in the exercise group. Subgroup analyses showed no evidence of a difference in effect on both falls outcomes according to whether trials selected participants at increased risk of falling or not. The findings for other outcomes are less certain, reflecting in part the relatively low number of studies and participants. Exercise may reduce the number of people experiencing one or more fall-related fractures (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95; 4047 participants, 10 studies; low-certainty evidence) and the number of people experiencing one or more falls requiring medical attention (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79; 1019 participants, 5 studies; low-certainty evidence). The effect of exercise on the number of people who experience one or more falls requiring hospital admission is unclear (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; 1705 participants, 2 studies, very low-certainty evidence). Exercise may make little important difference to health-related quality of life: conversion of the pooled result (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; 3172 participants, 15 studies; low-certainty evidence) to the EQ-5D and SF-36 scores showed the respective 95% CIs were much smaller than minimally important differences for both scales. Adverse events were reported to some degree in 27 trials (6019 participants) but were monitored closely in both exercise and control groups in only one trial. Fourteen trials reported no adverse events. Aside from two serious adverse events (one pelvic stress fracture and one inguinal hernia surgery) reported in one trial, the remainder were non-serious adverse events, primarily of a musculoskeletal nature. There was a median of three events (range 1 to 26) in the exercise groups. Different exercise types versus controlDifferent forms of exercise had different impacts on falls (test for subgroup differences, rate of falls: P = 0.004, I² = 71%). Compared with control, balance and functional exercises reduce the rate of falls by 24% (RaR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81; 7920 participants, 39 studies; high-certainty evidence) and the number of people experiencing one or more falls by 13% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.91; 8288 participants, 37 studies; high-certainty evidence). Multiple types of exercise (most commonly balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises) probably reduce the rate of falls by 34% (RaR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.88; 1374 participants, 11 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and the number of people experiencing one or more falls by 22% (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96; 1623 participants, 17 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Tai Chi may reduce the rate of falls by 19% (RaR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; 2655 participants, 7 studies; low-certainty evidence) as well as reducing the number of people who experience falls by 20% (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91; 2677 participants, 8 studies; high-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of programmes that are primarily resistance training, or dance or walking programmes on the rate of falls and the number of people who experience falls. No trials compared flexibility or endurance exercise versus control.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise programmes reduce the rate of falls and the number of people experiencing falls in older people living in the community (high-certainty evidence). The effects of such exercise programmes are uncertain for other non-falls outcomes. Where reported, adverse events were predominantly non-serious. Exercise programmes that reduce falls primarily involve balance and functional exercises, while programmes that probably reduce falls include multiple exercise categories (typically balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises). Tai Chi may also prevent falls but we are uncertain of the effect of resistance exercise (without balance and functional exercises), dance, or walking on the rate of falls.

### Exercise for falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults: trial and participant characteristics, interventions and bias in clinical trials from a systematic review [^5ec52d57]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

There is strong evidence that exercise prevents falls in community-dwelling older people. This review summarises trial and participant characteristics, intervention contents and study quality of 108 randomised trials evaluating exercise interventions for falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and three other databases sourced randomised controlled trials of exercise as a single intervention to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 60+ years to May 2018.

Results

108 trials with 146 intervention arms and 23 407 participants were included. Trials were undertaken in 25 countries, 90% of trials had predominantly female participants and 56% had elevated falls risk as an inclusion criterion. In 72% of trial interventions attendance rates exceeded 50% and/or 75% of participants attended 50% or more sessions. Characteristics of the trials within the three types of intervention programme that reduced falls were: (1) balance and functional training interventions lasting on average 25 weeks (IQR 16–52), 39% group based, 63% individually tailored; (2) Tai Chi interventions lasting on average 20 weeks (IQR 15–43), 71% group based, 7% tailored; (3) programmes with multiple types of exercise lasting on average 26 weeks (IQR 12–52), 54% group based, 75% tailored. Only 35% of trials had low risk of bias for allocation concealment, and 53% for attrition bias.

Conclusions

The characteristics of effective exercise interventions can guide clinicians and programme providers in developing optimal interventions based on current best evidence. Future trials should minimise likely sources of bias and comply with reporting guidelines.

### Interventions for preventing falls and fall-related fractures in community-dwelling older adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9c9b2664]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Falls in older adults are a highly prevalent problem. Falls occur in one‐third of community‐dwelling people aged ≥ 65 years at least once a year. Twenty percent of these falls lead to a fall‐related injury.

Many intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for falling have been identified. Suffering from multiple chronic conditions, for example, rheumatic disease, vertigo, may pose an even higher risk of falling; these medical conditions are prevalent in older people.

Fall prevention interventions target risk factors that are modifiable and can be divided into three main groups: (1) single interventions (participants receive one type of intervention), (2) multiple interventions (participants receive the same, fixed combination of two or more types of interventions), and (3) multifactorial interventions (participants receive a personalized selection out of two or more types of interventions, according to the results of a pre‐executed, personal falls risk assessment). Until Tricco, previous systematic reviews (SRs) and meta‐analyses were restricted to looking at combinations of multifactorial/multiple interventions on fall prevention as a whole, rather than being able to disentangle the effect of the individual components from the entire combination. It is, however, important to determine which particular components are most effective, as this can result in a more accurate prevention strategy. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) enables the evaluation of individual components from multiple comparisons estimating the relative effectiveness between any pair of interventions, even if these interventions have never been compared directly.

Furthermore, previous reviews did not focus on multimorbid older (age ≥ 75) adults. As this population have a high risk of falling, it is essential to gain more insight into which particular fall prevention interventions are most beneficial in this high risk group.

Therefore, the aim of this SR and NMA was to update the Tricco et al. search on the effectiveness of single, multiple, and multifactorial interventions and their individual components for preventing falls and fall‐related fractures in community‐dwelling older persons, with a particular focus on multimorbidity and age > 75 years.

### The role of medical assessment and intervention in the prevention of falls [^9efc2cf2]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence that falls amongst older people can be prevented now requires researchers and policy makers to elucidate the most comprehensive and cost-effective approach to implementation. The syndrome of falls and fractures in later life reflects the combined age-associated influences of cumulative susceptibility to health problems and reduced adaptive reserve. The major contribution of health factors to falling has long been recognised clinically and has also emerged clearly in epidemiological studies of risk. A fall in an older adult, especially if recurrent, may be a key signal of unmet medical need and should accordingly trigger an in-depth diagnostic process and clinical intervention by an appropriately skilled physician. Although well-designed controlled studies specifying this approach as part of a multifactorial intervention are comparatively few, recent published trials have confirmed the anticipated substantial returns in fall prevention achieved for community-dwelling patients with a history of falling. Larger-scale studies are now required, and further research is needed to achieve effective prevention strategies in institutional care. Combined calcium and vitamin D may act via neuromuscular and skeletal mechanisms in fracture prevention. The requirement for medical assessment has now appropriately been incorporated into national and international guidelines.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Although there are reviews on falls prevention interventions in older people, these target components of falls prevention interventions when delivered to individuals rather than to whole communities (Clemson 2023; Hopewell 2018; Sherrington 2019). Hopewell 2018 distinguishes between multifactorial and multicomponent interventions: "A multifactorial intervention is one in which the selection of falls prevention interventions (such as exercise, home‐hazard modification or medication review) prescribed or provided to each individual is matched to their risk‐of‐falls profile, which is assessed beforehand. This individually‐tailored intervention means that after receiving an assessment of known risk factors for falling, individuals are likely to received different combinations of interventions: i.e. one person may receive supervised exercise and home‐hazard modification whereas another may receive home‐hazard modification and medication review. Multiple component interventions are those where people receive a fixed combination of two or more fall prevention interventions selected from different categories of intervention (e.g. exercises, medication review, environment/assistive technology)". Clearly, multifactorial interventions are at odds with how we define population‐based interventions, as they require individualised risk assessments, but for completeness and accuracy of comparison we include them here. We are not aware of any comparable reviews of population‐based falls prevention interventions.

### The patient who falls: "It's always a trade-off" [^d083c9c2]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Falls are common health events that cause discomfort and disability for older adults and stress for caregivers. Using the case of an older man who has experienced multiple falls and a hip fracture, this article, which focuses on community-living older adults, addresses the consequences and etiology of falls; summarizes the evidence on predisposing factors and effective interventions; and discusses how to translate this evidence into patient care. Previous falls; strength, gait, and balance impairments; and medications are the strongest risk factors for falling. Effective single interventions include exercise and physical therapy, cataract surgery, and medication reduction. Evidence suggests that the most effective strategy for reducing the rate of falling in community-living older adults may be intervening on multiple risk factors. Vitamin D has the strongest clinical trial evidence of benefit for preventing fractures among older men at risk. Issues involved in incorporating these evidence-based fall prevention interventions into outpatient practice are discussed, as are the trade-offs inherent in managing older patients at risk of falling. While challenges and barriers exist, fall prevention strategies can be incorporated into clinical practice.

### Environmental interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community [^a9fc72eb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls and fall-related injuries are common. A third of community-dwelling people aged over 65 years fall each year. Falls can have serious consequences including restricting activity or institutionalisation. This review updates the previous evidence for environmental interventions in fall prevention.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of environmental interventions (such as fall-hazard reduction, assistive technology, home modifications, and education) for preventing falls in older people living in the community.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, other databases, trial registers, and reference lists of systematic reviews to January 2021. We contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of environmental interventions (such as reduction of fall hazards in the home, assistive devices) on falls in community-residing people aged 60 years and over. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was rate of falls.

Main Results

We included 22 studies from 10 countries involving 8463 community-residing older people. Participants were on average 78 years old, and 65% were women. For fall outcomes, five studies had high risk of bias and most studies had unclear risk of bias for one or more risk of bias domains. For other outcomes (e.g. fractures), most studies were at high risk of detection bias. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for high risk of bias, imprecision, and/or inconsistency. Home fall-hazard reduction (14 studies, 5830 participants) These interventions aim to reduce falls by assessing fall hazards and making environmental safety adaptations (e.g. non-slip strips on steps) or behavioural strategies (e.g. avoiding clutter). Home fall-hazard interventions probably reduce the overall rate of falls by 26% (rate ratio (RaR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.91; 12 studies, 5293 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); based on a control group risk of 1319 falls per 1000 people a year, this is 343 (95% CI 118 to 514) fewer falls. However, these interventions were more effective in people who are selected for higher risk of falling, with a reduction of 38% (RaR 0.62, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.70; 9 studies, 1513 participants; 702 (95% CI 554 to 812) fewer falls based on a control risk of 1847 falls per 1000 people; high-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a reduction in rate of falls when people were not selected for fall risk (RaR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16; 6 studies, 3780 participants; high-certainty evidence). Findings were similar for the number of people experiencing one or more falls. These interventions probably reduce the overall risk by 11% (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; 12 studies, 5253 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); based on a risk of 519 per 1000 people per year, this is 57 (95% CI 15 to 93) fewer fallers. However, for people at higher risk of falling, we found a 26% decrease in risk (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.85; 9 studies, 1473 participants), but no decrease for unselected populations (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 6 studies, 3780 participants) (high-certainty evidence). These interventions probably make little or no important difference to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (standardised mean difference 0.09, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.27; 5 studies, 1848 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of fall-related fractures (RR 1.00, 95% 0.98 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1668 participants), fall-related hospitalisations (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.06; 3 studies, 325 participants), or in the rate of falls requiring medical attention (RaR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.43; 3 studies, 946 participants) (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for number of fallers requiring medical attention was unclear (2 studies, 216 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported no adverse events. Assistive technology Vision improvement interventions may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 3 studies, 1489 participants) or people experiencing one or more falls (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.50) (low-certainty evidence). We are unsure of the evidence for fall-related fractures (2 studies, 976 participants) and falls requiring medical attention (1 study, 276 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There may be little or no difference in HRQoL (mean difference 0.40, 95% CI -1.12 to 1.92) or adverse events (falls while switching glasses; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02) (1 study, 597 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results for other assistive technology - footwear and foot devices, and self-care and assistive devices (5 studies, 651 participants) - were not pooled due to the diversity of interventions and contexts. Education We are uncertain whether an education intervention to reduce home fall hazards reduces the rate of falls or the number of people experiencing one or more falls (1 study; very low-certainty evidence). These interventions may make little or no difference to the risk of fall-related fractures (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 1 study, 110 participants; low-certainty evidence). Home modifications We found no trials of home modifications that measured falls as an outcome for task enablement and functional independence.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-certainty evidence that home fall-hazard interventions are effective in reducing the rate of falls and the number of fallers when targeted to people at higher risk of falling, such as having had a fall in the past year and recently hospitalised or needing support with daily activities. There was evidence of no effect when interventions were targeted to people not selected for risk of falling. Further research is needed to examine the impact of intervention components, the effect of awareness raising, and participant-interventionist engagement on decision-making and adherence. Vision improvement interventions may or may not impact the rate of falls. Further research is needed to answer clinical questions such as whether people should be given advice or take additional precautions when changing eye prescriptions, or whether the intervention is more effective when targeting people at higher risk of falls. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether education interventions impact falls.

Physical activity targets — general health and fall prevention context: It is important to note that physical activity is associated with multiple health benefits in addition to fall prevention, and the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity.

### Population-based interventions for the prevention of fall-related injuries in older people [^63ec5558]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Fall-related injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the older population. Summary information about counter-measures that successfully address the risk factors for fall-related injuries in research settings has been widely disseminated. However, less available is evidence-based information about successful roll-out of these counter-measures in public health programmes in the wider community. Population-based interventions in the form of multi-strategy, multi-focused programmes are hypothesised to result in a reduction in population-wide injury rates. This review tests this hypothesis with regards to fall-related injuries among older people.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of population-based interventions, defined as coordinated, community-wide, multi-strategy initiatives, for reducing fall-related injuries among older people.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was based on electronic searches, handsearches of selected journals and snowballing from reference lists of selected publications.

Selection Criteria

Studies were independently screened for inclusion by two reviewers. Included studies were those that reported changes in medically treated fall-related injuries among older people following the implementation of a controlled population-based intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was not appropriate, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies.

Main Results

Out of 23 identified studies, five met the criteria for inclusion. There were no randomised controlled trials. Significant decreases or downward trends in fall-related injuries were reported in all five of the included studies with the relative reduction in fall-related injuries ranging from 6 to 33%.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite methodological limitations of the evaluation studies reviewed, the consistency of reported reductions in fall-related injuries across all programmes support the preliminary claim that the population-based approach to the prevention of fall-related injury is effective and can form the basis of public health practice. Randomised, multiple community trials of population-based interventions are indicated to increase the level of evidence in support of the population-based approach. Research is also required to elucidate the barriers and facilitators in population-based interventions that influence the extent to which population programmes are effective.

### Effectiveness of a therapeutic tai Ji quan intervention vs a multimodal exercise intervention to prevent falls among older adults at high risk of falling: a randomized clinical trial [^ffd3962e]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a fall prevention–specific tai ji quan intervention clinically more effective in reducing falls among older adults at high risk of falling than a stretching intervention (control) or a standard multimodal exercise intervention?

Findings

In a randomized clinical trial involving 670 adults 70 years or older with a history of falls or impaired mobility, the therapeutic tai ji quan intervention effectively reduced falls by 58% compared with the stretching exercise (control intervention) and by 31% compared with a multimodal exercise intervention.

Meaning

For older adults at high risk of falling, a therapeutically tailored tai ji quan intervention was more effective than stretching or multimodal exercises in reducing the incidence of falls.

### Evaluation of a novel technology-supported fall prevention intervention-study protocol of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in older adults at increased risk of falls [^6c8d1262]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Reviews of available studies demonstrate that effective fall prevention strategies simultaneously address different risk factors. Exercise-based strategies are most effective when they combine balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises. Particularly, the integration of activities that are important for daily life functioning, such as rising from a chair are essential. According to current evidence, an exercise programme needs to have a minimal duration and has to be challenging in intensity to be effective in reducing the fall incidence. Among the current challenges to prevent falls in older persons are a timely identification of persons at risk, as well as ensuring older persons' participation and adherence to appropriate fall prevention programmes. To realise optimal effects, the type of exercises and their dosing should preferably be individualised, and the person should participate over a sufficiently long duration. However, there is a large gap between evidence about effective fall prevention interventions and their transfer into clinical practice and preventing initial falls. In their review, Michael et al. analysed the barriers most often noted by providers of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls. The participants (physicians) suggested that they would be more convinced to act in regard to fall prevention for older adults if they have actual data about falls of their patients and an effective fall-risk assessment and treatment. Furthermore, they would prefer information where they can refer high-risk patients to receive effective fall prevention. With our study protocol we aim to address these omissions.

Miscellaneous new technology can contribute to the assessment of fall risk as well as the implementation of novel fall prevention interventions. Furthermore, stepping interventions and perturbation-based interventions are implemented to prevent falls. The effects of robot-assisted approaches using exoskeletons and (end-effector) robots on fall-related risk-factors have already been studied in different disease groups (multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease) (e.g.). However, there still is little information about the use of robotic devices to prevent falls in older adults. Only one study by Verrusio et al. used robotic technology for fall prevention training with healthy older adults. Their results showed first positive effects of using the exoskeleton human body posturizer regarding fall incidence in older adults without any diseases.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^76e14b5e]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Multidomain falls risk intervention

Strong recommendation. Offer multidomain interventions, informed by a multiprofessional, multifactorial falls risk assessment to community-dwelling older adults identified to be at high risk of falling (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: 1B.

Recommendation details and justification

Multidomain interventions encompass two or more components, individually targeted to the older adult based on findings from a multifactorial (or comprehensive) falls risk assessment. It is not a standardized set of interventions applied to everyone.
A multidomain intervention in older community-dwelling adults at a minimum should include: strength and balance exercise, medication review, management of orthostatic hypotension and cardiovascular diseases, management of underlying acute and chronic diseases, optimising vision (cataract surgery for those who need it, refraction) and hearing, addressing foot problems and appropriate footwear, vitamin D supplementation, optimising nutrition, continence management, interventions to address concerns about falling, individual education and environmental modification (including assisted devices and use of technology).
The recommended components are derived from the following literature: a 2021 comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analyses on interventions for preventing falls in community dwelling older adults, two Cochrane systematic reviews assessing multidomain interventions for prevention of falls in older adults living in the community and two WHO summary reports on falls prevention in community dwelling older persons.
The findings of two recent pragmatic RCTs suggest that both exercise and multifactorial strategies that have been shown to reduce falls in efficacy trials cannot easily be applied with sufficient fidelity through current existing services (RCTs based in UK and USA, respectively) to achieve equivalent benefits. These trial outcomes suggest the importance of the provision of sufficient resources to roll out and support high-quality sustainable delivery of fall prevention programmes that are in line with previous high quality successful efficacy trials. Though disappointing, the results of these two pragmatic trials did not substantively alter network meta-analysis results or our recommendations.

Component interventions

Exercise and physical activity interventions

Strong recommendation. Exercise programmes for fall prevention for community-dwelling older adults that include balance challenging and functional exercises (e.g. sit-to-stand, stepping) should be offered with sessions three times or more weekly which are individualised, progressed in intensity for at least 12 weeks and continued longer for greater effect (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: 1A.

Strong recommendation. Include, when feasible, of Tai Chi and/or additional individualised progressive resistance strength training. GRADE: 1B.

### Multifactorial interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 trials and almost 20 000 participants [^5bfca24c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the longer term effects of multifactorial interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community, and to explore whether prespecific trial-level characteristics are associated with greater fall prevention effects.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression.

Data sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, CENTRAL and trial registries were searched up to 25 July 2018.

Study selection

We included randomised controlled trials (≥ 12 months' follow-up) evaluating the effects of multifactorial interventions on falls in older people aged 65 years and over, living in the community, compared with either usual care or usual care plus advice.

Review methods

Two authors independently verified studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Rate ratios (RaR) with 95% CIs were calculated for rate of falls, risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes. Data were pooled using a random effects model. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Results

We included 41 trials totalling 19 369 participants; mean age 72–85 years. Exercise was the most common prespecified component of the multifactorial interventions (85%; n = 35/41). Most trials were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in ≥ 1 domain. Twenty trials provided data on rate of falls and showed multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate at which people fall compared with the comparator (RaR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.88; 20 trials; 10 116 participants; I² = 90%; low-quality evidence). Multifactorial interventions may also slightly lower the risk of people sustaining one or more falls (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00; 30 trials; 13 817 participants; I² = 56%; moderate-quality evidence) and recurrent falls (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 15 trials; 7277 participants; I² = 46%; moderate-quality evidence). However, there may be little or no difference in other fall-related outcomes, such as fall-related fractures, falls requiring hospital admission or medical attention and health-related quality of life. Very few trials (n = 3) reported on adverse events related to the intervention. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that the effect on rate of falls may be smaller when compared with usual care plus advice as opposed to usual care only. Overall, heterogeneity remained high and was not explained by the prespecified characteristics included in the meta-regression.

Conclusion

Multifactorial interventions (most of which include exercise prescription) may reduce the rate of falls and slightly reduce risk of older people sustaining one or more falls and recurrent falls (defined as two or more falls within a specified time period).

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^05809551]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

A population‐based intervention can include shared ownership of the problem (falls and fall‐related injury) and its solution (preventing falls and fall‐related injuries). Interventions may therefore include experts and community members in determining the priorities and appropriate interventions. It should acknowledge the causal link between social and organisational structures, and any multicomponent strategy should optimise community involvement (McClure 2005; Moller 1991).

A central requirement for population‐based interventions is that the focus of the intervention is on the community rather than the individual. However, this presents some challenges, as there are examples of nationwide intervention studies using the individual as the unit of randomisation, yet still aiming to cover an entire cohort (e.g. aged 50 years and over) across several states (Le Boff 2020). The use of randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs in programme evaluation is often precluded due to difficulties with blinding and ensuring that members of a control group are not exposed to intervention material (Kempton 2000). Instead, separate communities, towns, cities, or regions with comparable demographic attributes, can be used as intervention and control areas in assessing programme effectiveness. Cluster RCTs – ideally, using multiple separate communities in each cluster – can be used to test the effectiveness of population‐based interventions (Hussey 2007), as well as stepped‐wedge designs, where all identified clusters begin as control areas, before one by one at random each cluster is switched to be an intervention area at set time points, until all clusters are intervention areas.

Other relevant USPSTF recommendations — falls, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency screening: The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older. The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls; multifactorial interventions may also be effective in some persons as well. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.

Introduction

One-third of community-dwelling people aged 65 years and older fall each year, and this proportion increases with age. Falls can have serious long-term consequences, including loss of independence, morbidity and mortality. Fall-related risk factorsinclude advancing age, history of previous falls, muscle weakness, gait and balance problems, poor vision and chronic diseases such as arthritis. Environmental factors such as lack of handrails, poor lighting, slippery or uneven surfaces, use of walking aids and poor footwear can also play a role. Most falls result from multiple interacting factorsand generally the more risk factors a person has, the greater their chances are of having a fall. In the UK, the National Health Service is estimated to spend around £2.3 billion each year on fall-related injuries in people over the age of 65.

Fall prevention interventions aim to minimise known modifiable risk factors for falling, and thereby prevent falls and associated injuries. Multifactorial interventions are recommended as a primary treatment strategy in a number of international guidelines for prevention of falls. Multifactorial interventions require a person to have a minimum of two or more modifiable risk factors for falling and the strategy involves tailoring interventions to each person's particular risk profile. Hence, within any treatment cohort not all people receive the same combination of interventions. The manner in which multifactorial interventions are delivered varies. In some instances, the assessment and linked interventions are by the same provider. In others, one provider assesses the patient and interventions are provided through referral to other providers. Exercise programmes whether supervised or unsupervised, or involve a mixture of both, form an important part of many multifactorial interventions. The core interventions that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend are: strength and balance training exercises, home hazard assessment and intervention, vision assessment and referral, as well as medication review with modification/withdrawal.

### Don't lose sight of the importance of the individual in effective falls prevention interventions [^a10a76a6]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Another way that falls prevention actions can be implemented at an earlier stage of the falls risk continuum is to support improved identification of older people who have had a fall. Over two thirds of older people who fall may not report the fall to health professionals or their families, particularly if the fall does not cause an injury. Given the strong evidence that previous falls, even those that do not cause an injury, are a strong predictor of future falls, a key falls prevention target needs to be improving identification of people who fall. Best practice guidelines recommend that all general practitioners should ask all older patients at least once each year whether they have had a fall. If the individual patient answers yes, they should then undergo an assessment to determine whether modifiable falls risk factors are present. The other avenue to increase reporting is to promote this information broadly to older people through a range of promotional avenues, including use of self checklists of falls risk, that could be used in general practitioners' offices, or distribution through home care workers. The key messages of these documents needs to be that falls are not just due to age, that many falls can be prevented, and some simple questions about presence of common falls risk factors that indicate the need for a health practitioner review.

Falls risk can vary over time for the one individual. In particular, acute health problems, and hospitalisation increases risk of falling. Falls rates are high for older people in the month after discharge home, with 15% falling at least once, and 11% of these requiring re-admission to hospital. Some clinical groups also have high falls risk following discharge home from hospital, one of the highest risk groups is people being discharged home from hospital after stroke. In one study, 46% of stroke patients fell in the six months following discharge from hospital, with 42% of these occurring in the first month. Hospital discharge planning needs to have a stronger focus on ensuring falls prevention is a core element post discharge.

The older individual, their individual mix of falls risk factors, their preferences in terms of interventions, and their engagement in recommended interventions in a sustained manner are all essential to effective falls prevention. These factors require a stronger focus in falls prevention research and practice.

### Physical therapy approaches to reduce fall and fracture risk among older adults [^084a4e8a]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Falls and fall-related injuries, such as fractures, are a growing problem among older adults, often causing longstanding pain, functional impairments, reduced quality of life and excess health-care costs and mortality. These problems have led to a variety of single component or multicomponent intervention strategies to prevent falls and subsequent injuries. The most effective physical therapy approach for the prevention of falls and fractures in community-dwelling older adults is regular multicomponent exercise; a combination of balance and strength training has shown the most success. Home-hazard assessment and modification, as well as assistive devices, such as canes and walkers, might be useful for older people at a high risk of falls. Hip protectors are effective in nursing home residents and potentially among other high-risk individuals. In addition, use of anti-slip shoe devices in icy conditions seems beneficial for older people walking outdoors. To be effective, multifactorial preventive programs should include an exercise component accompanied by individually tailored measures focused on high-risk populations. In this Review, we focus on evidence-based physical therapy approaches, including exercise, vibration training and improvements of safety at home and during periods of mobility. Additionally, the benefits of multifaceted interventions, which include risk factor assessment, dietary supplements, elements of physical therapy and exercise, are addressed.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^74d72e76]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

AGS/BGS falls prevention — interventions for older persons living in the community: Direct interventions customized to the identified risk factors, coupled with an appropriate exercise program should follow the multifactorial fall risk assessment [A], and a strategy to reduce the risk of falls should include multifactorial assessment of known fall risk factors and management of the risk factors identified [A]. The components most commonly included in effective interventions are adaptation or modification of home environment [A], withdrawal or minimization of psychoactive medications [B], withdrawal or minimization of other medications [C], management of postural hypotension [C], management of foot problems and footwear [C], and exercise, particularly balance, strength, and gait training [A]. All older adults who are at risk of falling should be offered an exercise program incorporating balance, gait, and strength training; flexibility and endurance training should also be offered but not as sole components of the program [A]. Multifactorial or multicomponent interventions should include an education component complementing and addressing issues specific to the intervention being provided, customized to individual cognitive function and language [C], and the health professional or team conducting the fall risk assessment should directly implement the interventions or ensure that other qualified healthcare professionals conduct the interventions [A]. Exercise should be included as a component of multifactorial interventions for fall prevention in community-residing older persons [A], and an exercise program that targets strength, gait, and balance, such as tai chi or physical therapy, is recommended as an effective intervention to reduce falls [A].

### Multifactorial assessment and targeted intervention for preventing falls and injuries among older people in community and emergency care settings: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117b1766]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of multifactorial assessment and intervention programmes to prevent falls and injuries among older adults recruited to trials in primary care, community, or emergency care settings.

Design

Systematic review of randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index) to 22 March 2007, reference lists of included studies, and previous reviews.

Review Methods

Eligible studies were randomised or quasi-randomised trials that evaluated interventions to prevent falls that were based in emergency departments, primary care, or the community that assessed multiple risk factors for falling and provided or arranged for treatments to address these risk factors.

Data Extraction

Outcomes were number of fallers, fall related injuries, fall rate, death, admission to hospital, contacts with health services, move to institutional care, physical activity, and quality of life. Methodological quality assessment included allocation concealment, blinding, losses and exclusions, intention to treat analysis, and reliability of outcome measurement.

Results

19 studies, of variable methodological quality, were included. The combined risk ratio for the number of fallers during follow-up among 18 trials was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.02) and for fall related injuries (eight trials) was 0.90 (0.68 to 1.20). No differences were found in admissions to hospital, emergency department attendance, death, or move to institutional care. Subgroup analyses found no evidence of different effects between interventions in different locations, populations selected for high risk of falls or unselected, and multidisciplinary teams including a doctor, but interventions that actively provide treatments may be more effective than those that provide only knowledge and referral.

Conclusions

Evidence that multifactorial fall prevention programmes in primary care, community, or emergency care settings are effective in reducing the number of fallers or fall related injuries is limited. Data were insufficient to assess fall and injury rates.

### Multifactorial interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 trials and almost 20 000 participants [^69766262]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this review

The strengths of this review include the comprehensive search, explicit eligibility criteria, duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias assessment, consideration of possible subgroup effects and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence. The interventions assessed in this review are reflective of what patients would receive in clinical practice in the UK, including the use of usual care plus non-tailored falls prevention advice. The inclusion of meta-regression in addition to meta-analysis allowed us to examine the effect of prespecific trial-level factors on outcomes.

The limitations of our review relate largely to the underlying evidence. Trials were heterogeneous (I² = 90% for rate of falls), meaning results need to be interpreted cautiously. While multifactorial interventions are by their nature heterogeneous, the influence of differences between the included trials must be considered. Several of the subgroups analysed included a small number of studies, limiting the power of these analyses. Egger's tests showed no clear evidence of small study effects; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that trials did not report outcomes for which no positive effect was found. Only 3 of the 41 included trials reported on adverse events. More complete data on adverse outcomes related to multifactorial interventions would improve our ability to judge the overall benefit of these interventions. Our risk of bias assessment identified that improvements are needed in reporting of trials, and measurement of outcomes remains an area of concern. These deficiencies in reporting preclude clinicians and researchers from reliably replicating or implementing interventions.
