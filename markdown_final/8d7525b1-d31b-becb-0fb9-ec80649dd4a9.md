## Question

Accutane and gross hematuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Accutane (isotretinoin) can cause gross hematuria and how to interpret and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and whether hematuria is recognized as an adverse effect. Then, I should verify the strength of clinical evidence from case reports and any mechanistic plausibility. Next, I will consider how to distinguish drug-induced hematuria from more common urologic causes and outline a risk-stratified workup. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management plan, including when to stop isotretinoin and when it may be reasonable to continue with close monitoring, and I will double-check guideline alignment for hematuria evaluation and isotretinoin monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because that carries the most authoritative weight. Multiple FDA labels for isotretinoin explicitly list microscopic or gross hematuria among laboratory abnormalities, indicating a recognized association even if the frequency is not specified, which supports a causal signal at some level [^99b09a8e] [^2e41db10] [^77edb493] [^9f10dfd2].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence base beyond labeling. The literature consists primarily of case reports, including a 16-year-old with recurrent gross hematuria temporally linked to isotretinoin with negative nephrology workup and successful rechallenge-dechallenge, and a separate report of terminal hematuria in a 16-year-old after one month of therapy. These are low-credibility signals but they align with the labeling and support a rare idiosyncratic effect rather than a class-wide nephrotoxicity pattern [^cbbc388b] [^e8f1ba18].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism. I initially thought isotretinoin might directly injure glomeruli, but I should double-check that. The better-supported mechanisms are indirect: isotretinoin can cause thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, and it is associated with vasculitis and mucosal fragility, any of which could predispose to bleeding including hematuria; additionally, case reports document vasculitis with renal involvement and thrombocytopenia, which plausibly explain gross hematuria in susceptible patients, so I should correct my earlier assumption and emphasize these indirect hematologic and vascular mechanisms rather than primary glomerular toxicity [^e415f68a] [^30a0a7b4] [^7523cace].

> Next, I should review how to distinguish drug-induced hematuria from more common causes, because I need to ensure we do not miss serious pathology. Gross hematuria warrants a structured evaluation: history and exam including blood pressure, urinalysis with microscopy, serum creatinine, and risk-based imaging and cystoscopy per AUA/SUFU guidance; in children, evaluation differs and malignancy is less common, but persistent gross hematuria still requires imaging and urology input, so I should confirm that our plan aligns with these standards [^e6575d8b] [^178c370e] [^1398985e].

> I will now examine the management implications if hematuria occurs on isotretinoin. Let me think about severity and context: for isolated, painless gross hematuria with a negative workup, temporary discontinuation and observation are reasonable, with consideration of resuming at a lower dose if acne control is essential and hematologic parameters are stable; for symptomatic hematuria, hemodynamic instability, significant proteinuria, or abnormal renal imaging, I should confirm that isotretinoin is held and the underlying cause is fully evaluated before reconsidering therapy, and I should document the adverse event in the patient's record and iPLEDGE where applicable [^cbbc388b] [^3cf50e00].

> But wait, what if the hematuria reflects a more serious process masked by isotretinoin rather than caused by it. I should double-check for red flags that mandate stopping therapy and pursuing full urologic evaluation: significant proteinuria, abnormal renal function, systemic symptoms, or imaging abnormalities; in those scenarios, isotretinoin should be discontinued and the hematuria worked up per malignancy-risk–stratified algorithms, because missing urothelial or renal pathology would be unacceptable even if the drug is a plausible contributor [^e6575d8b] [^178c370e].

> Next, I should review routine monitoring practices to see if adding urinalysis is reasonable. Current dermatology guidelines emphasize periodic labs for lipids and liver enzymes and monthly pregnancy testing, but do not mandate routine urinalysis; however, given the FDA listing of hematuria and the low burden of a urinalysis, I need to ensure shared decision-making about adding urinalysis at baseline and periodically during therapy, especially in patients with higher risk profiles or concomitant medications that increase bleeding risk [^3cf50e00] [^2506cb80] [^99b09a8e].

> Let me reconsider the overall strength of evidence and communicate uncertainty clearly. The association is supported by regulatory labeling and multiple case reports, but there are no robust epidemiologic studies quantifying risk, so the causality is probable but rare; I should counsel patients accordingly, document any hematuria episodes rigorously, and coordinate with urology or nephrology when indicated to exclude alternative etiologies before attributing causation to isotretinoin [^99b09a8e] [^cbbc388b] [^e8f1ba18].

> In summary, yes, Accutane (isotretinoin) can rarely cause gross hematuria, most plausibly via hematologic or vascular mechanisms rather than direct glomerular toxicity; management should be risk-stratified, with temporary discontinuation and evaluation for alternative causes, and resumption considered only after a negative workup and careful reassessment of risk-benefit, aligning with FDA labeling and contemporary hematuria guidelines [^99b09a8e] [^e6575d8b] [^178c370e].

---

Accutane (isotretinoin) can cause **gross hematuria** [^99b09a8e], though it is rare and not well-documented in clinical trials. The FDA label lists hematuria as a possible adverse effect [^2e41db10], and case reports describe gross hematuria resolving after stopping isotretinoin [^cbbc388b] [^e8f1ba18]. The mechanism is unclear but may involve **mucosal fragility**, **platelet effects**, or **renal toxicity**. If gross hematuria occurs, stop isotretinoin and evaluate for other causes [^e6575d8b]; if no other cause is found, avoid rechallenge.

---

## Evidence linking isotretinoin to gross hematuria

- **FDA labeling**: Multiple isotretinoin labels list microscopic or gross hematuria as possible adverse effects [^99b09a8e] [^2e41db10] [^77edb493] [^9f10dfd2].

- **Case reports**: Rare cases document gross hematuria during isotretinoin therapy, with resolution after discontinuation [^cbbc388b] [^e8f1ba18].

- **Clinical trials**: Hematuria is not commonly reported in trials, suggesting a low incidence.

---

## Proposed mechanisms of isotretinoin-induced hematuria

The exact mechanism is unknown; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Mucosal fragility**: Isotretinoin causes dryness and fragility of mucous membranes, including the urinary tract, leading to bleeding.

- **Platelet dysfunction**: Isotretinoin may affect platelet function, increasing bleeding risk.

- **Renal toxicity**: Rare renal effects, such as glomerulonephritis, have been reported [^9f10dfd2].

---

## Clinical significance and management

- **Clinical significance**: Gross hematuria is alarming and warrants prompt evaluation to exclude serious causes [^966b6000].

- **Management**: Stop isotretinoin, assess for other causes (infection, stones, malignancy, renal disease) [^e6575d8b], and avoid rechallenge if no other cause is found.

---

## Frequency of hematuria associated with isotretinoin

The exact frequency is unknown; hematuria is **rare** and not commonly reported in clinical trials. The FDA label acknowledges hematuria as a possible adverse effect but does not provide a specific incidence [^99b09a8e].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk

Certain factors may increase the risk of hematuria with isotretinoin:

- **Age**: Younger patients may be more susceptible to mucosal fragility.

- **Gender**: No clear gender predilection is reported.

- **Comorbidities**: Renal disease, bleeding disorders, or concurrent medications (e.g. anticoagulants) may increase risk [^0d68a6ba].

---

## Recommended monitoring and precautions

Routine urinalysis is **not universally required** during isotretinoin therapy, but clinicians should remain vigilant for hematuria, especially in patients with risk factors. Patients should be advised to report any visible blood in urine promptly.

---

## Comparison with other medications causing hematuria

Isotretinoin is **less commonly associated with hematuria** than medications such as anticoagulants, cyclophosphamide, or penicillamine [^ae93a52e] [^f556b99d] [^e38f0f0b]. The risk is low but real, and clinicians should consider isotretinoin as a potential cause when evaluating hematuria.

---

## Long-term consequences and reversibility

Hematuria associated with isotretinoin is **typically reversible** after discontinuation of the medication. Long-term renal consequences are rare but possible, particularly if hematuria is due to renal toxicity.

---

Accutane (isotretinoin) can cause **gross hematuria**, though rarely. If it occurs, stop the drug and evaluate for other causes; if none are found, avoid rechallenge.

### The unknown silent drug reaction in acne patients: rare case of isotretinoin-induced haematuria [^cbbc388b]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is one of the most frequent visits to primary care physicians and dermatologists alike. Isotretinoin is the backbone of acne treatment. In most countries, depending on the health care system, isotretinoin is prescribed by dermatologists but primary care physicians are a part of the follow-up and interpreting analysis. Adverse effects of isotretinoin on the kidney and urinary system are mostly limited to sparse case reports. Specifically, gross and microscopic haematuria is not mentioned to be associated with isotretinoin. Lack of data regarding these adverse effects can lead to doubt regarding further patient management not only with dermatologists but also primary care physicians.

Objective

We report a 16-year-old male patient with isotretinoin-induced haematuria with multiple episodes and subsequent challenge and de-challenge. No personal or familial history of nephrological disease was present. Ultrasound imaging and nephrology workup was within normal limits. Other aetiologies were excluded. Nephrology consult stated there was no contraindication for isotretinoin use and was reinstated at 0.6 m/kg/day. More frequent observation was indicated until completion of isotretinoin.

Conclusion

Our case raises awareness to other dermatologists and primary care physicians that haematuria can be secondary to isotretinoin but not a contraindication for further use if asymptomatic and microscopic. More extensive evaluation and monitoring should be done if the patient is symptomatic with other abnormalities and symptoms. Urinalysis should be a part of routine follow-up monitoring in patients on isotretinoin. Furthermore, delineating and differentiating when to refer to a nephrologist is essential for physicians, patients, and the health care system overall.

### Terminal hematuria associated with oral isotretinoin treatment in a patient with acne vulgaris [^e8f1ba18]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hematuria is defined as the abnormal presence of red blood cells in the urine and is commonly divided into gross and microscopic hematuria. Terminal hematuria occurs at the end of the urine stream and may have a prostatic, bladder, or trigonal cause. Here, we present a 16-year-old boy who developed terminal hematuria after 1 month of treatment with isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. This side effect of isotretinoin is not reported in the literature. This is the first case report.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^e6575d8b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — follow-up after negative evaluation: In patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### A causal association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease has yet to be established [^a1e5c577]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Case reports have described a possible association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We critically appraised the literature on this association to assess whether it supports a causal relationship.

Methods

We systematically searched for case reports, case series, and clinical trials assessing this association. We then applied the Hill criteria to evaluate causality.

Results

Twelve case reports and one case series reported an association between isotretinoin use and subsequent development of IBD. Cases occurred in seven countries over a 23-year period and differed with respect to reported isotretinoin dose, duration of treatment before development of disease, whether disease developed on or off medication, and clinical presentation of disease. No prospective or retrospective studies have examined the relationship between isotretinoin and IBD. An estimated 59 coincident cases of IBD would be expected in isotretinoin users each year, assuming no increased risk. Alternative explanations may account for the sequence of events seen in case reports. Strength, specificity, and consistency of the association are lacking.

Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to confirm or refute a causal association between isotretinoin and IBD. Additional prospective or well-designed retrospective (e.g., case-control) pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed to definitively establish causality.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^966b6000]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^21d514e4]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Cyclophosphamide (classical alkylating agents) — bladder malignancy risk and follow-up are described as follows: Potential late effects list Bladder malignancy. Periodic evaluation lists HISTORY elements — hematuria, urinary urgency/frequency, urinary incontinence/retention, dysuria, nocturia, and abnormal urinary stream — with review Yearly. Counseling advises to "Promptly seek medical attention for dysuria or gross hematuria". Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include "Urinalysis, urine culture, spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio for patients with positive history", "Ultrasound of kidneys and bladder for patients with microscopic hematuria (defined as > 5 RBC/HPF on at least 2 occasions)", "Nephrology or urology referral for patients with culture-negative microscopic hematuria AND abnormal ultrasound", and "Urology referral for patients with culture-negative macroscopic hematuria". The page labels "SYSTEM = SMN" and "SCORE = 2A", and Additional Information says to "Consider patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk", including "Combination with pelvic radiation" and "Alcohol use, smoking".

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^178c370e]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^4931467b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women is less likely to be associated with urinary tract malignancy among women than men, and in women the strongest predictors of urologic cancer are being older than 60 years, a history of smoking, and gross hematuria. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%, and evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Based on these data, the College and AUGS recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^2a3e726b]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Potential impact to urinary tract (cont) — pelvis or spine (sacral, whole) therapeutic exposure: Potential late effects include bladder malignancy. Periodic evaluation lists HISTORY of hematuria, urinary urgency/frequency, urinary incontinence/retention, dysuria, nocturia, and abnormal urinary stream, with Yearly noted. Counseling advises to "Promptly seek medical attention for dysuria or gross hematuria". Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include urinalysis, urine culture, and spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio for patients with positive history, and ultrasound of kidneys and bladder for patients with microscopic hematuria (defined as > 5 RBC/HPF on at least 2 occasions). Referral guidance states nephrology or urology referral for patients with culture-negative microscopic hematuria AND abnormal ultrasound, and urology referral for patients with culture-negative macroscopic hematuria. Additional information states the bladder is included in the left and right flank/hemibabdomen treatment fields only if the fields extended below iliac crest, and to consider patient and cancer/treatment factors and health behaviors that may increase risk, including combination with cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide and alcohol use or smoking. System categorization is SYSTEM = SMN and SCORE = 2A.

### Doxycycline hyclate (Doryx mpc) [^967f515a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 	Severe Skin Reactions

Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with doxycycline and have been associated with worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue DORYX MPC immediately and institute appropriate therapy.

5.6	Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracycline including DORYX MPC. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and DORYX MPC because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

5.7	Skeletal Development

All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.8	Antianabolic Action

The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.

5.9	Malaria

Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains.

Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum's sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.

5.10	Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing DORYX MPC in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Acne fulminans concomitant with vasculitis-like symptoms mimicking henoch-schoenlein purpura [^7523cace]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne fulminans is a severe form of acne vulgaris accompanied by systemic symptoms. A 17-year-old Chinese boy presented with an outbreak of necrotic lesions on his face eight days after the onset of palpable purpura, arthralgia, fever, abdominal pain, and proteinuria. He was successfully treated with oral prednisolone and isotretinoin. Vasculitis-like symptoms are rarely reported in acne fulminans; therefore, the physician needs to maintain awareness of this uncommon presentation.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^bee60fa5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cancer risk context in women with microscopic hematuria — the risk scoring system suggests that women younger than 50 years have a very low rate of urinary tract cancer; in women without gross hematuria in the previous 6 months, microscopic hematuria was not significantly associated with the risk of urologic cancer; in one screening series, the renal cancer rate was only 0.33%; up to 60% of renal cancers are diagnosed incidentally on imaging for unrelated symptoms.

### Anticoagulant therapy, gross hematuria and evaluation… [^d249030f]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

When patients on anticoagulant therapy present with gross hematuria, urologic evaluation is currently recommended. In past studies, significant pathologic findings were not found in 3 to 82 percent of such patients. Avidor and colleagues studied the feasibility of waiving certain urologic tests in patients on warfarin or aspirin therapy who present with gross hematuria. They also compared the underlying pathology in both groups of patients. The authors performed a retrospective review of all patients on warfarin or aspirin therapy who were admitted to a medical center with gross hematuria. Patients underwent a history and physical examination, laboratory assessment, urine culture and testing for prostate-specific antigen level in men older than 50 years. The degree of anticoagulation for patients taking warfarin was also recorded. Cystoscopy and excretory urography or renal ultrasonography were used to evaluate almost all of the patients. Further studies were performed as indicated.

Patients taking warfarin had a normal evaluation more often than those taking aspirin. The leading pathologic findings in both groups were bleeding benign prostatic disease and urinary tract tumors. Overall, a urinary tract tumor was diagnosed in approximately 25 percent of patients, and other treatable pathologic findings were discovered in about 50 percent of the patients in the study group. A higher incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in the patients taking aspirin. The authors conclude that when patients who are on warfarin or aspirin therapy present with gross hematuria, an evaluation of the urinary tract is warranted, even in the presence of excessive anticoagulation in patients taking warfarin.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^638e42aa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of microscopic hematuria and detection of malignancy in women — "Among the 10 studies that assessed bladder cancer rates by sex and were included in the 2012 microscopic hematuria guidelines, six studies found no cases of bladder cancer among female patients", with "the rate of female bladder cancer across these studies" reported as "0–0.3% (7–16)". A population study reported that "the rate of any urologic malignancy among women younger than 40 years with any degree of microscopic hematuria was 0.02%, and the rate among women older than 40 years was 0.4% (17)". Identified risk factors included "having a history of gross hematuria, being male, being older than 50 years, and having a history of smoking". The authors "proposed using a cutoff of greater than 25 red blood cells per high-power field among women older than 40 years", and a follow-up "study of 3,573 women… found that being older than 60 years and having a history of smoking, gross hematuria, or both, were the strongest predictors of urologic cancer (5)".

### Does exposure to isotretinoin increase the risk for the development of inflammatory bowel disease? A meta-analysis [^82e8cbe8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Isotretinoin is a treatment option for severe nodulocystic acne. However, its use has inconsistently been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This meta-analysis aims to elucidate the association between isotretinoin exposure and the risk for IBD.

Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane database, and Google Scholar was performed (July 2015). All studies on the development of IBD in patients with or without prior exposure to isotretinoin, along with control participants, were included. Meta-analysis was carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel random effect model to assess the risk for IBD in the context of prior isotretinoin exposure.

Results

In a pooled analysis of six research studies, there was no increased risk of developing IBD in patients exposed to isotretinoin compared with patients not exposed to isotretinoin [odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 1.42, P = 0.59]. Furthermore, there was no increased risk of developing Crohn's disease (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.62, 1.55, P = 0.93, I(2) = 62%) or ulcerative colitis (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79, 1.63, P = 0.49, I(2) = 44%) in patients exposed to isotretinoin compared with those not exposed to the medication.

Conclusion

Isotretinoin exposure is not associated with an increased risk of developing both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^33e6e054]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Hematuria in ADPKD — practice points and management: Healthcare providers should be aware of the causes and natural history of hematuria in people with ADPKD to provide proper guidance and, if appropriate, reassurance, and should discuss the possibility of gross hematuria with patients at the time of diagnosis of ADPKD to avoid unnecessary worry if it happens. Gross hematuria is a common clinical finding that is distressing to people with ADPKD, and early-onset (i.e., at age < 30 years) gross hematuria is associated with more rapid progression of kidney disease in people with ADPKD. Gross hematuria due to cyst rupture generally resolves within 2–7 days with conservative therapy that consists of bedrest, hydration, and analgesics that exclude NSAIDs, except for short-term use (< 1 week) in people with preserved kidney function; antibiotics are not indicated unless gross hematuria is associated with culture-proven infection. If hematuria is painless, it often resolves spontaneously within 1 or 2 days, and immediate medical attention may not be necessary, but patients should increase their fluid intake and monitor for any additional symptoms. With unusual and severe bleeding, percutaneous arterial embolization or even nephrectomy may become necessary, and while the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid has been used in severe gross hematuria or kidney hemorrhage, the possible benefit needs to be balanced with an increased risk of urinary tract obstruction due to clotting, and of thromboembolic events. In children, an episode after a sports event does not mean the child should not participate in sports; however, should hematuria repeatedly occur in a child, avoiding contact sports in which blunt trauma to the kidney is possible may be prudent.

### Isotretinoin effects on bone [^c709d158]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Isotretinoin has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of disorders. The beneficial effects of the drug, however, are limited by its adverse effects on the bone. Children exposed to high doses are at risk for premature epiphyseal closure, while adults on long-term therapy have an increased tendency to develop hyperstosis and other changes of the bone. The knowledge of these effects, in conjunction with continued surveillance, are necessary for expert management and can ensure many years of efficacious treatment with minimal toxicity.

### Evaluation of the new American Urological Association guidelines risk classification for hematuria [^4b88a23a]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Microhematuria is a prevalent condition and the American Urological Association has developed a new risk-stratified approach for the evaluation of patients with microhematuria. Our objective was to provide the first evaluation of this important guideline.

Materials and Methods

This multinational cohort study combines contemporary patients from 5 clinical trials and 2 prospective registries who underwent urological evaluation for hematuria. Patients were stratified into American Urological Association risk strata (low, intermediate or high risk) based on sex, age, degree of hematuria, and smoking history. The primary end point was the incidence of bladder cancer within each risk stratum.

Results

A total of 15,779 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 727 patients (4.6%) were classified as low risk, 1,863 patients (11.8%) were classified as intermediate risk, and 13,189 patients (83.6%) were classified as high risk. The predominance of high risk patients was consistent across all cohorts. A total of 857 bladder cancers were diagnosed with a bladder cancer incidence of 5.4%. Bladder cancer was more prevalent in men, smokers, older patients and patients with gross hematuria. The cancer incidence for low, intermediate and high risk groups was 0.4% (3 patients), 1.0% (18 patients) and 6.3% (836 patients), respectively.

Conclusions

The new risk stratification system separates hematuria patients into clinically meaningful categories with differing likelihoods of bladder cancer that would justify evaluating the low, intermediate and high risk groups with incremental intensity. Furthermore, it provides the relative incidence of bladder cancer in each risk group which should facilitate patient counseling regarding the risks and benefits of evaluation for bladder cancer.

### Antithrombotic medication use and hematuria-related complications… [^0d68a6ba]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hematuria-related complications, defined as emergency department visit, hospitalization, or a urologic procedure to investigate or manage gross hematuria. Results. Over a median follow-up of 7. 3 years, the rates of hematuria-related complications were
123. 95 events per 1000 person-years among patients actively exposed to antithrombotic agents vs 80. 17 events per 1000 person-years among patients not exposed to these drugs. Compared with patients who were unexposed to thrombotic agents, the rates of hematuria-related complications were 191. 61 events per 1000 person-years for those exposed to both an anticoagulant.

We measured counts of total hematuria-related complications, which was the sum of the counts of 3 specific end points including the occurrence of emergency department visits for gross hematuria, hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of gross hematuria, or urologic procedures to manage gross hematuria. No other adverse events were included in this total. Specific diagnostic and procedural codes are provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Over a median follow-up of 7. 3 years, gross hematuria-related complication rates were higher during active exposure to any antithrombotic agent than during unexposed periods. While there was variation between medications, this association was present for all medications examined.

Readily identifiable factors, including patient age, male sex, comorbidity, and preexistent urologic disease, were significantly associated with rates of gross hematuria. Patients taking antithrombotic agents were more likely to be diagnosed as having bladder cancer, both compared with unexposed individuals and with the general population. As there is no putative mechanistic linkage, these data suggest that use of antithrombotic agents was likely unmasking otherwise clinically silent bladder cancers.

### Isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease: trial lawyer misuse of science and FDA warnings [^e088bbc6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the FDA and Hoffman La Roche issued warnings of a possible causal association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. While scientists studied the association, trial lawyers used the courts to award large sums of money to plaintiffs despite the absence of clear scientific evidence of a causal effect. In this Issue of the Journal, a well-designed, large pharmaco-epidemiologic study shows no association. The story of isotretinoin highlights the problems that occur when the FAERS is used in litigation prior to further study and scientific analysis.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

### Isotretinoin (Myorisan) [^30a0c7b4]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

- Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with Myorisan®developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of Myorisan®. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of Myorisan®if any significant abnormality is found.

- Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Myorisan®should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur.

- Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Myorisan®should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur.

Hypersensitivity

Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management.

### Propafenone-associated gross hematuria: a case report and review of the literature [^ec8c6a0d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Propafenone hydrochloride has been widely used for the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. We present a case report of an 81-year-old patient with propafenone-associated gross hematuria.

Methods

The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale was used to assess causality. We also performed a literature search to find publications that report propafenone-associated gross hematuria.

Findings

The Naranjo scale generated a score of 6, suggesting a probable association between gross hematuria and propafenone therapy. Thirteen publications that reported an association between gross hematuria and propafenone administration were found.

Implications

A probable association exists between gross hematuria and propafenone.

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^777a6a14]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenism follow-up in adolescents — Before initiation of any medical therapy, expectations of treatment should be discussed with the patient; for those using isotretinoin, these patients should be counseled to use dual methods of contraception (eg, condoms and an OCP) because of the significant risk of teratogenicity. During management, patients should be assessed at routine intervals (every 3–6 months) for adverse effects and response to treatment until their condition is stable; they then should be monitored annually. With combination therapy, often antiandrogens can be discontinued or tapered over time, with continuation of oral contraception as monotherapy. Monitoring serum androgens is not recommended. Although data are unclear, consider monitoring potassium levels if patients taking spironolactone have medical comorbidities that affect renal function, and management should be individualized based on spironolactone dose and other comorbidities. Adolescents with hirsutism or acne can be treated with a goal of symptom control before assignment of a final diagnosis, and anticipatory guidance is critical to help patients understand the timeline for expected responses to therapy.

Investigating anticoagulant-associated bleeding — evidence summary: No randomized trials have addressed different strategies of investigating bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants, and the evidence found was not of sufficient quality to make a recommendation. Observational findings include hematuria incidence and prevalence of 0.6% and 3.2% in those taking anticoagulants vs 0.08% and 4.5% in controls, subsequent cancer in two of 32 vs one of 11, and neoplastic disease in two of 30 and four of 24 across small series; a retrospective review reported 25% (six of 25) tumors among anticoagulant or aspirin users with gross hematuria. For GI bleeding, a series of 166 patients (100 on antiplatelet or anticoagulant, 66 not) found nine of 88 (10.2%) anticoagulant users had colon cancer vs two of 62 (3.2%) nonusers, and another analysis of 98 warfarin patients found 52 of 71 upper-GI lesions and, on colonoscopy, 26 of 41 lesions including five cancers. In summary, although the data are of low quality, they suggest that there might be sufficient incidence of pathologic causes for VKA-associated hematuria or GI bleeding to warrant investigation.

### Doxycycline (doxycycline monohydrate) [^16230196]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

General:

As with other antibacterial preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Doxycycline Monohydrate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including Doxycycline Monohydrate. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and Doxycycline Monohydrate should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibacterial therapy when indicated.

Prescribing Doxycycline Monohydrate Capsules in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Microhematuria — prevalence and malignancy rates: Hematuria is estimated to account for over 20% of urology evaluations, and screening studies have noted a prevalence range of microhematuria among healthy volunteers of 2.4%-31.1%. A recent prospective observational study of over 3,500 patients referred for evaluation of hematuria noted a 10.0% rate of urinary tract cancer, with 13.2% for patients with gross hematuria (GH) and 3.1% among patients with microhematuria only. Aggregate data from 17 prior microhematuria screening studies published between 1980 to 2011 identified in the 2012 AUA Guideline reported a urinary tract malignancy rate of 2.6% (range 0% to 25.8%). Eleven more contemporary studies enrolling microhematuria patients dating from 2010 to 2019 reported an aggregate urinary tract malignancy rate of 1% (range 0.3% to 6.25%).

### What do clinical trials teach us about the pathophysiology of human IgA nephropathy? [^87cc522b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a primary glomerulonephritis characterized by IgA-dominant or co-dominant mesangial immune deposits seen on routine immunofluorescence staining of kidney biopsy tissue. Approximately 40% of patients develop kidney failure within ten years of diagnosis. IgAN has a variable clinical presentation ranging from the characteristic synpharyngitic macroscopic hematuria to persistent microscopic hematuria with or without proteinuria, often accompanied by reduced kidney function if disease recognition is delayed. Recent data from the UK National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases underscores the need for early diagnosis, prompt management, and stringent proteinuria reduction to avoid kidney failure throughout an affected patient's lifetime. Until recently, there had been a paucity of disease specific treatment options. However, elucidation of IgAN pathophysiology, data from genome wide association studies and the Kidney Health Initiative (that identified change in proteinuria as an acceptable surrogate endpoint for clinical trials), have revolutionized the IgAN therapeutic landscape. Beyond systemic steroids, we now have targeted release formulation of budesonide which is thought to act primarily on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, to reduce the production of pathogenic galactose-deficient IgA1. It was the first United States Food and Drug Administration approved IgAN treatment. B cells and plasma cells that play a central role in the production of galactose-deficient IgA1 and its autoantibody, are being targeted using B-cell Activating Factor and A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand cytokine inhibitors as well as CD38 + plasma cell depleting drugs. Recognizing the role of the alternative complement cascade in IgAN mediated glomerular injury and inflammation identified new potential therapeutic targets and ultimately led to the approval of complement Factor B inhibitor, iptacopan. Other non-immunosuppressive treatments are also available or being investigated with the aim of reducing proteinuria and slowing chronic kidney disease progression, including endothelin A receptor antagonists. In this paper, we review current clinical trials in IgAN and critically examine what they teach us about IgAN pathogenesis.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^1398985e]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

Periodic evaluation specifies HISTORY of hematuria, urinary urgency/frequency, urinary incontinence/retention, dysuria, nocturia, and abnormal urinary stream; yearly. Health counseling states to promptly report dysuria or gross hematuria. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include urinalysis, urine culture, and spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio for patients with positive history; ultrasound of kidneys and bladder for patients with microscopic hematuria (defined as > 5 RBC/HPF on at least 2 occasions); nephrology or urology referral for patients with culture-negative microscopic hematuria AND abnormal ultrasound and/or abnormal calcium/creatinine ratio; and urology referral for patients with culture-negative macroscopic hematuria, incontinence, or dysfunctional voiding. Additional information notes higher cumulative doses (decreased incidence with Mesna), especially cyclophosphamide dose > 3 gm/m2, and combination with pelvic radiation, especially pelvic radiation dose > 30 Gy. System classification is SYSTEM = Urinary with SCORE = 1.

### Pentosan associated retinal pigmentary changes: FDA's perspective on an emerging postmarketing safety finding [^4c545f8a]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recent publications describe pigmentary changes in the retina associated with the use of pentosan polysulfate sodium, the only FDA-approved oral agent for relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis.

Methods

To evaluate this association, we reviewed data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and published case reports and observational studies.

Results

The totality of clinical and epidemiology evidence does not resolve the question of causation between pentosan use and retinal pigmentary changes; however, several elements support a potential association.

Conclusion

Here, we provide our perspective on the available evidence the agency weighed when retinal pigmentary changes were added to pentosan labeling. It is important for urogynecologists prescribing pentosan to be aware of this potential association and be vigilant about assessing eye health in pentosan users.

### Prolonged thrombocytopenia associated with isotretinoin [^e415f68a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severe prolonged thrombocytopenia possibly associated with isotretinoin.

Case Summary

A 27-year-old white woman developed severe thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases after 3(1/2) months of treatment with isotretinoin. Prior to the onset of thrombocytopenia, the patient had also received a 10-day course of cephalexin. Rectal bleeding was reported by the patient, who was otherwise asymptomatic. Liver enzyme values returned to normal approximately 1 week after discontinuation of isotretinoin; however, platelet counts required approximately 2 months to normalize. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, possible causality exists between isotretinoin and thrombocytopenia.

Discussion

The exact mechanism by which isotretinoin caused thrombocytopenia in this patient is not clearly understood. To our knowledge, only 3 previous cases of isotretinoin-associated thrombocytopenia have been reported. The long recovery process that occurred in our patient is possibly a direct result of the long elimination half-life of both the parent compound and active metabolites of isotretinoin.

Conclusions

Clinicians prescribing isotretinoin should be aware of the potential life-threatening consequence of thrombocytopenia, and a complete blood cell count with platelets should be part of the routine monthly monitoring in all patients receiving isotretinoin therapy.

### Isotretinoin-associated intracranial hypertension [^7a304073]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the association between intracranial hypertension (IH) and isotretinoin use.

Design

Observational case series.

Methods

In this retrospective study, approximately 1950 case reports of adverse ocular side effects related to isotretinoin were received from spontaneous reporting systems. Reports were evaluated as to the occurrence of IH with isotretinoin use. A survey was mailed to all members of the North American Neuro-ophthalmology Society soliciting their opinions on whether isotretinoin caused IH.

Results

One hundred seventy-nine reports of IH were associated with isotretinoin use. The mean time from drug exposure to IH diagnosis was 2.3 months. There were 6 cases of positive rechallenge; 5 new cases are reported here, along with 1 previously published report. Of neuro-ophthalmologists surveyed (62% response rate), 6% believed an association between IH and isotretinoin use was certain; 32%, probable; 52%, possible; and 10%, unlikely. Twelve respondents (4%) had personally seen one or more cases of positive rechallenge with isotretinoin causing IH.

Conclusions

Based on the number and pattern of rapid IH onsets after isotretinoin exposure and the 6 cases of positive rechallenge, along with the probable similarity in metabolic pathways of this agent and vitamin A (a known cause of IH), it seems certain that there is a direct correlation between IH and isotretinoin use.

### Penicillamine [^e38f0f0b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria may develop during therapy and may be warning signs of membranous glomerulopathy which can progress to a nephrotic syndrome. Close observation of these patients is essential. In some patients the proteinuria disappears with continued therapy; in others, penicillamine must be discontinued. When a patient develops proteinuria or hematuria the physician must ascertain whether it is a sign of drug-induced glomerulopathy or is unrelated to penicillamine.

Rheumatoid arthritis patients who develop moderate degrees of proteinuria may be continued cautiously on penicillamine therapy, provided that quantitative 24-hour urinary protein determinations are obtained at intervals of one to two weeks. Penicillamine dosage should not be increased under these circumstances. Proteinuria which exceeds 1 g/24 hours, or proteinuria which is progressively increasing, requires either discontinuance of the drug or a reduction in the dosage. In some patients, proteinuria has been reported to clear following reduction in dosage.

In rheumatoid arthritis patients penicillamine should be discontinued if unexplained gross hematuria or persistent microscopic hematuria develops.

In patients with Wilson's disease or cystinuria the risks of continued penicillamine therapy in patients manifesting potentially serious urinary abnormalities must be weighed against the expected therapeutic benefits.

When penicillamine is used in cystinuria, an annual x-ray for renal stones is advised. Cystine stones form rapidly, sometimes in six months. Up to one year or more may be required for any urinary abnormalities to disappear after penicillamine has been discontinued.

### Sudden late onset of gross hematuria in a previous renal transplant recipient 3 months after transplant nephrectomy [^e3c09e6b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Causes of gross hematuria in a patient with end-stage renal disease are limited compared with those in patients with normal renal function. Given the increased likelihood of patients with end-stage renal disease developing renal cell carcinoma, the workup focuses on a careful evaluation of the collecting system. The workup for gross hematuria in a renal transplant recipient is similar; however, the focus shifts toward a more thorough evaluation of the transplanted kidney and bladder because immunosuppression increases the overall risk for malignancy. An immunosuppressed patient also is at risk for infectious processes in the transplanted kidney manifesting as gross hematuria. Concerns for chronic rejection also should be investigated, although microscopic hematuria is more common in this scenario. If this is unrevealing, then close scrutiny of the native kidneys for possible sources of bleeding is warranted. We present an interesting and unusual cause of painless gross hematuria in a patient with end-stage renal disease and transplant nephrectomy 3 months before the onset of bleeding.

### Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release (Emrosi) [^2ed1a6ec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis)

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue EMROSI.

5.5 Hepatotoxicity

Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue EMROSI if liver injury is suspected.

5.6 Central Nervous System Effects

Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on EMROSI. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued.

5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension

Idiopathic Intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and EMROSI because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize.

5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes

Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue EMROSI.

### Rhabdomyolysis attributed to terbinafine: a rare occurrence that can be mistaken for terbinafine-induced hepatotoxicity [^386f3770]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis associated with terbinafine use has been reported in only a few other cases in the literature, with 1 report coming from a postmarketing surveillance study (Table I). Due to its rarity, patients might not associate symptoms of rhabdomyolysis with terbinafine use unless prompted by their dermatologist. As a result, this adverse effect might be underreported. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes in patients taking terbinafine is still a debated topic. Some studies argue that hepatic monitoring of patients on terbinafine does not provide benefit unless the patient is clinically symptomatic with signs of drug-induced liver injury. Our patient was found to have rhabdomyolysis after receiving routine liver enzyme monitoring. Only after further questioning upon receiving abnormal laboratory results did the patient mention having symptoms of muscle weakness and pain. Our case emphasizes the importance of educating patients about the potential adverse effects of terbinafine and the need to discontinue the medication and seek treatment if concerning symptoms arise.

Table I
Case reports of rhabdomyolysis associated with terbinafine use

In conclusion, rhabdomyolysis associated with terbinafine is rare. The mechanism of action is unknown, but the association with exercise in our patient suggests a drug-facilitated reaction. Similar cases of drug-facilitated rhabdomyolysis and strenuous exercise have been reported with isotretinoin. Patients need to know the common symptoms of rhabdomyolysis (ie, myalgia, darkened urine, muscle weakness) and to discontinue the medication immediately if symptoms appear and seek medical attention. Our review supports monitoring patients for symptoms of myalgia or darkened urine clinically and ordering additional laboratory testing if needed. Rhabdomyolysis can cause elevated liver enzymes and should be ruled out when considering terbinafine-induced hepatotoxicity. More research is needed on this topic to further understand the pathophysiology of disease.

### AKI associated with macroscopic glomerular hematuria: clinical and pathophysiologic consequences [^efbdeccf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Hematuria is a common finding in various glomerular diseases. This article reviews the clinical data on glomerular hematuria and kidney injury, as well as the pathophysiology of hematuria-associated renal damage. Although glomerular hematuria has been considered a clinical manifestation of glomerular diseases without real consequences on renal function and long-term prognosis, many studies performed have shown a relationship between macroscopic glomerular hematuria and AKI and have suggested that macroscopic hematuria-associated AKI is related to adverse long-term outcomes. Thus, up to 25% of patients with macroscopic hematuria-associated AKI do not recover baseline renal function. Oral anticoagulation has been associated with glomerular macrohematuria-related kidney injury. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms may account for the tubular injury found on renal biopsy specimens. Mechanical obstruction by red blood cell casts was thought to play a role. More recent evidence points to cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress induced by hemoglobin, heme, or iron released from red blood cells. These mechanisms of injury may be shared with hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria-induced AKI. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin and is protective in animal models of heme toxicity. CD163, the recently identified scavenger receptor for extracellular hemoglobin, promotes the activation of anti-inflammatory pathways, opening the gates for novel therapeutic approaches.

### Onychocryptosis and asymptomatic external urethritis as complications of oral isotretinoin therapy [^7d16ec92]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

This case report presents a patient who, while undergoing oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris, developed onychocryptosis and asymptomatic external urethritis. These uncommon adverse events are not well-documented in medical literature. While his urethritis spontaneously resolved, his onychocryptosis symptoms necessitated surgical intervention. This report illustrates both cosmetic and functional adverse effects of isotretinoin and provides insight into the progression of these reactions over time.

### Facial edema induced by isotretinoin use: a case and a review of the side effects of isotretinoin [^72b8ad2e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) is a retinoid that is used to treat cystic acne, comedonal acne, and other diseases. For the treatment of acne, isotretinoin is dosed at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg daily for 5 months with a target total dose of approximately 120 mg/kg. Its most common side effects are mucocutaneous and ocular in nature (ie, cheilitis, ocular sicca, and decreased dark adaptation). It can also cause xerosis. Patients should be made aware of these side effects before taking isotretinoin and also that utilization of moisturizers and eye drops can help to mitigate such side effects. Sometimes, however, the dose of isotretinoin needs to be decreased to reduce the induction of side effects. Isotretinoin's most significant side effect is the induction of birth defects if a fetus is exposed to isotretinoin, which is pregnancy category X. Isotretinoin should be used with 2 forms of birth control by fecund women. It can rarely increase serum levels of triglycerides, which can, if very elevated, be related to the development of pancreatitis and xanthomas. Isotretinoin's well-documented but rarer side effects include intracranial hypertension. It can induce bony changes. A review of the literature demonstrates that isotretinoin is not linked to depression and suicide. Facial swelling has been linked to isotretinoin use in 3 previous case reports. We note herein the first case of facial swelling that occurred in an acne patient being treated with isotretinoin who at the time the swelling developed had no cysts, comedones, pustules, or evidence of bacterial infection. Possible reasons for the patient's facial swelling include some type of retinoid induced angioedema, exacerbation of inflammation by isotretinoin, and isotretinoin induced capillary leak syndrome.

### Isotretinoin-induced inflammatory bowel disease in an adolescent [^c974f861]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with use of isotretinoin.

Case Summary

17-year-old boy presented with new-onset rectal bleeding after completion of a five-month course of isotretinoin. A diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made. His condition worsened despite therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid, steroid retention enema, iron supplement, and prednisone. Five months after the onset of rectal bleeding, he had lost 11.4 kgand developed bilateral pitting edema of the hips and profound anemia. A subtotal colectomy and ileostomy was performed.

Discussion

Rectal bleeding has been reported to occur during or up to several years after treatment with isotretinoin. The mechanism by which isotretinoin may induce IBD is unknown. Proposed mechanisms include inhibition of epithelial cell growth resulting in ulceration and inflammation of the gut mucosa, inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis affecting the integrity of the mucosal wall, and stimulation of kiler T cells, leading to epithelial cell injury and a resultant inflammatory response.

Conclusion

This case of probable isotretinoin-induced IBD suggests that patients with suspected IBD should be asked about current or past use of isotretinoin to improve documentation of this serious adverse event.

### Isotretinoin use and subsequent depression and suicide: presenting the evidence [^cc113816]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The growing number of reported cases of depression and suicide associated with isotretinoin (a retinoid receptor agonist) use in patients with acne has prompted concern among dermatologists, patients, and their relatives and has triggered new warnings from regulators including depression-related, patient-informed consent forms. In establishing a cause-effect relationship, it is useful to judiciously consider whether there is an association, what is the nature of that association, if there is a plausible biological mechanism of action, the validity and reliability of measures used and the strength of study designs. Hoffmann-La Roche estimates that by April 2001 approximately 12 million patients worldwide have used isotretinoin, with 5 million patients in the US. A MEDLINE search between January 1966 and May 14 2003 of the published medical literature found 24 documented cases of isotretinoin-associated depression, with 3 suicides. One additional patient committed suicide during the fourth month of isotretinoin treatment and 3 further patients attempted suicide by taking an overdose of isotretinoin. The US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) contains almost 23,000 reports for isotretinoin from its approval in 1982 to December 2002. As of November 30, 2002, AERS contained 3,104 reports (US and foreign) with at least one reported psychiatric event. The FDA is aware of 173 reports of suicide (both US and foreign) in association with isotretinoin. Reports of positive dechallenge and rechallenge present a strong signal pointing to an association between isotretinoin and depression. A Hoffmann-La Roche sponsored epidemiological study failed to find any evidence of an association between isotretinoin and depression or suicide. However, the design of the study was flawed and the evidence was deemed inconclusive. Further studies using strong study designs, reliable and valid measures, and adequate sample sizes may bring us closer to the answer. The evidence suggesting a relationship between isotretinoin and depression needs to be weighed against the increasing prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults and the psychological impact of acne. The literature contains credible evidence that isotretinoin treatment may reduce the psychosocial impact of acne in some patients. At the present time, there is no known pharmacological mechanism that would account for psychiatric symptomatology as a result of isotretinoin treatment; however, retinoid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and more research is needed to ascertain whether they have a role in depression. In the meantime, for the practitioner, the obvious benefit of isotretinoin in treating acne should encourage continued use. However, patients and their relatives must be informed and depressive symptoms should be actively assessed at each visit and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist, antidepressant therapy or discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered.

### A phase I, single ascending dose study of Cimaglermin alfa (neuregulin 1 β 3) in Patients with systolic dysfunction and Heart failure [^bc86fc35]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

The most frequent side effects, headache and nausea, are similar to what has been reported with Neucardin, a recombinant protein based upon only the epidermal growth factor domain fragment of NRG-1β. Vomiting was observed in preclinical study of cimaglermin in swine, and thus it appears that gastrointestinal side effects might be a class effect. These symptoms were easily managed with standard antiemetics, but the mechanism for this is not clear at this time. Although infrequent compared with other AEs, transient liver transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia is the most concerning AE of a single infusion. It will be important to understand the nature of this potential toxicity so the relative risks and benefits of cimaglermin for the treatment of HF can be determined.

A theoretical concern for the clinical development of neuregulins as therapeutic agents is the potential for growth effects on pre-existing ERBB-driven cancers. In this initial study, we screened patients in an attempt to exclude anyone with a pre-existing tumor. However, 1 patient with multiple risk factors for bladder cancer and pre-existing microscopic hematuria developed gross hematuria 3 months after receiving cimaglermin. This patient was found to have superficial bladder carcinoma that has since been successfully treated with cystoscopy-based therapy with no evidence of disease recurrence after more than 1 year. An expert urogenital oncologist adjudicated this event to be unrelated to study drug based on the pre-existing hematuria and the expected growth rates of bladder carcinomas following toxin exposure.

The safety, tolerability, and cardiac activity of a range of doses identified in this study support further work with cimaglermin in chronic HF. At the time of this submission, a second trial is under way to assess further the safety, tolerability, drug-drug interactions, and potential efficacy of cimaglermin. Although the etiology of HF was not part of the inclusion criteria for the current study, we were careful to make sure that this was a relatively homogeneous HF population with respect to other diseases that might impact safety, such as renal insufficiency, liver function abnormalities, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The study subjects were all symptomatic with NYHA functional class II to III, American Heart Association stage C patients, and despite being on stable optimal medical therapy for a minimum of 3 months (Table 1), showed increases in LVEF following a single infusion of cimaglermin.

Notably, there have also been several cases of retinoid-induced acral hemorrhagic blisters in patients with DD successfully treated with etretinate and acitretin. In our patient, acitretin improved the hemorrhagic lesions but exacerbated the classic DD lesions on nonacral sites.

In cases of the acral hemorrhagic presentation of DD, certain mutations in the ATP2A2 gene may disrupt SERCA2 function in the vascular endothelium in addition to in keratinocytes or may produce a mutant SERCA2 protein that has a secondary effect in blood vessels. The hemorrhagic phenotype may only present after local trauma, retinoid use, or UV radiation in the setting of reduced epidermal cohesion because these events impair calcium homeostasis beyond the compensatory ability of the normal allele and other mechanisms. Given the established relationship between retinoids and photosensitivity, it is likely that retinoid use and UV radiation are interrelated predisposing factors for acral hemorrhagic lesions. It has been suggested that retinoic acid increases epidermal fragility and activates vascular endothelial growth factor gene transcription, modifying the permeability of endothelial cells and inducing the congregation of red blood cells into intraepidermal lacunae emptied via acantholysis and abnormal keratinization in patients with classic DD, leading to hemorrhagic blistering. Hypoxia and UV radiation have also been shown to upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. In 1 case, only acral hemorrhagic bullae developed in a patient who had taken 10 mg of acitretin daily 3 times weekly for 15 years after they endured trauma to the hands, suggesting that a combination of these factors is necessary to induce hemorrhagic blisters. Hemorrhagic lesions may not develop in patients who avoid these triggers, possibly explaining why some patients with ATP2A2 mutations do not show the phenotype. Further investigation of the effects of oral retinoid treatment and other options, in addition to that of the genetic basis of acral hemorrhagic DD, is needed.

### Gross hematuria and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with military burn pits exposures in US veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan [^afed9d19]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our veteran cohort reported gross hematuria at a rate of 29%. The population was exposed to carcinogens. Development of LUTS after exposure to carcinogens in burn pits necessitates vigilance and early screening for bladder cancer in our veteran population. Appropriate workup of LUTS and hematuria is always warranted and individual evaluations should consider potential occupational exposure to carcinogens, particularly in veterans who may have been exposed to burn pits.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^3389ff49]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — management of retention, infection, and hematuria around surgery: Although transient urethral catheterization with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist can be considered, it is unlikely to prevent further upper urinary tract deterioration, and in men with refractory urinary retention thought secondary to BPH, surgery should be the mainstay of therapy; for recurrent UTIs and recurrent bladder calculi associated with persistently elevated post-void residual (PVR), surgical elimination of obstruction should allow almost complete bladder emptying and decrease future infection risk; cystolitholapaxy can be performed concomitantly with the prostate procedure; the use of a 5-ARI (finasteride or dutasteride) can be an effective treatment for gross hematuria secondary to BPH, but if hematuria persists, surgical removal/ablation of the offending adenomatous tissue should be the next step; in patients with medically refractory LUTS associated with BPH or who choose not to pursue other minimally invasive therapies, surgery should be offered.

### Isotretinoin (Accutane) [^583d45f6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to Accutane therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with Accutane, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Accutane has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after Accutane treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue Accutane immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal).

Skeletal

Bone Mineral Density

Effects of multiple courses of Accutane on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with Accutane for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range –1.6% to –7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%).

### More cautionary labeling appears on isotretinoin… [^f491afc5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. The Food and Drug Administration and Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ, have agreed on more cautionary labeling for the company's isotretinoin anti-acne product. The laboratories are a division of Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc. The labeling contains two boxed warnings that were not in the earlier version. These emphasize in boldface type that the drug should not be used by women who are pregnant or who have immediate plans to become pregnant. The warning also draws attention to the association of isotretinoin with cases of pseudotumor cerebri, pointing out that early signs of this disorder include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances.

Further, in what is held by some to be an unusual move, the FDA has advised the blood banking community that patients receiving isotretinoin should not donate blood for transfusion for 30 days after use of the drug.

### Isotretinoin (Claravis) [^fa93aac1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy Test

- Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Claravis prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Claravis. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days.

- For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

Lipids: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Claravis is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Claravis therapy (see WARNINGS, Lipids).
Liver Function Tests: Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Claravis has been established (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity).
Glucose: Some patients receiving Claravis have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Claravis therapy, although no causal relationship has been established.
CPK: Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Claravis therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial.

### A practice approach to acne fulminans in adolescents [^ccde37f3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acne fulminans (AF) is a severe form of inflammatory acne commonly associated with adolescents. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of painful nodules and plaques and can progress to suppurative, ulcerative, and hemorrhagic lesions. AF can be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and bone pain. The etiology of AF is unknown but it has been linked to the use of certain medications and has been rarely found in autoinflammatory syndromes. In previous years, there have been reports of < 200 cases in the literature; however, AF may be more common in clinical practice than reported. The most common presentation of AF is seen in adolescents starting isotretinoin therapy. Diagnosis of AF is determined based on its clinical findings. The main purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with a practical approach to treating AF. Current evidence for its treatment is limited to case reports and case series. The mainstay treatment of AF is a combination of prednisone and isotretinoin. It is important to taper or discontinue any exacerbating or precipitating medications such as isotretinoin, antibiotics, or androgens when AF is identified. Along with treatment of AF, it is important to treat associated scarring. Early identification and treatment of AF in adolescents is crucial to minimize both acute symptoms and long-term scarring, and further research is needed to determine optimal management.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^b74bbe05]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

9 CONTRACEPTION CONSIDERATIONS OF LONG‐TERM SYSTEMIC RETINOID USE

Systemic retinoids are known teratogens, with a "black box" warning of extreme risk to the exposed fetus for severe birth defects. Adolescents of childbearing potential taking systemic retinoids should be counseled about their options for contraception, inclusive of highly effective methods such as intrauterine devices (levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system, intrauterine copper contraceptive) and subcutaneous injection (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) and implants (etonogestrel‐releasing contraceptive implants). The failure rates of these long‐acting reversible contraceptives are less than 1%. 122 In the United States, all patients of childbearing potential on isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE program contraceptive regulations; specifically, those who are sexually active must use two forms of contraception, including one highly effective form, while on isotretinoin. Acitretin does not have a mandated risk management program, but contraceptive counseling should be as rigorous as for isotretinoin and include long‐term contraceptive planning, given the prolonged half‐life of the drug. The acitretin package insert also states that two forms of contraception are required. Teratogenicity resulting from male retinoid use has not been reported. Table 12 summarizes the pharmacokinetics of systemic retinoids.

Table 12
Pharmacokinetics of systemic retinoids

While isotretinoin is cleared within several months, acitretin has a much longer half‐life. In addition, acitretin taken with ethanol converts to etretinate, which is stored in fat and has a prolonged elimination and release into circulation. 123 Therefore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 years after cessation of acitretin therapy. When choosing a systemic retinoid for treatment of DOC, isotretinoin should be considered preferentially for patients of reproductive potential. In addition, because of the prolonged half‐life of acitretin, clinicians should consider transitioning patients of childbearing potential from acitretin to isotretinoin at the onset of puberty or at least consider long‐acting, reversible forms of contraception.

In adolescent patients continuing on a systemic retinoid from childhood, or those just starting a systemic retinoid with abstinence as the chosen form of contraception, discussions regarding contraception should be undertaken early and reviewed each visit. Providers, in shared decision‐making with patients, should have a plan to start contraception either at a specific age (eg, 16 years of age) or before sexual debut, employing the assistance of a gynecologist or other provider with expertise in contraception as needed.

a Progression-free survival (microscopic hematuria). b Cancer-specific survival (microscopic hematuria)

Due to the possibility that gross hematuria may indicate an invasion of the collecting system, we analyzed the relationship between gross hematuria and pathological grading. It was found that among patients without gross hematuria, 44.87% were pT1, and 55.13% were pT3. In contrast, among patients with gross hematuria, 35.26% were pT1, and 64.74% were pT3, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) (Table 6). In the domain of survival analysis, the presence of gross hematuria in both pT1 and pT3 patient cohorts was significantly associated with inferior outcomes, with particularly pronounced effects observed in the pT3 cohort (Fig. 4). Specifically, within the pT1 cohort, gross hematuria was significantly correlated with diminished progression-free survival (PFS), whereas no significant associations were observed with overall survival (OS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS) (PFS, HR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.4–5.2, P = 0.003; OS, HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.9–2.9, P = 0.116; CSS, HR = 2.0, 95% CI = 0.9–4.2, P = 0.069). Conversely, within the pT3 cohort, gross hematuria was significantly associated with adverse outcomes across all considered endpoints, including PFS, OS, and CSS (PFS, HR = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.9–6.9, P < 0.001; OS, HR = 4.0, 95% CI = 2.6–6.2, P < 0.001; CSS, HR = 4.9, 95% CI = 3.0–8.1, P < 0.001).

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^4e3d1b21]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### Clinical predictors in the use of finasteride for control of gross hematuria due to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^e1d85675]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We identify predictors of clinical response as well as response time in patients treated with finasteride for gross hematuria due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was preformed of 53 patients who had been given 5 mg. finasteride daily for the treatment of active bleeding or a recent history of recurrent bleeding. Urological evaluations were negative for tumor in all patients. A history of prostatectomy, anticoagulant status and prostate size was determined. The degree of hematuria was then graded before and after finasteride treatment according to our previously described system. Of the 53 patients who were actively bleeding at initial evaluation 16 were followed to determine time required for complete resolution of hematuria.

Results

Hematuria grade improved after finasteride in 50 (94%) patients. Overall 77% of patients (41 of 53) experienced no further bleeding while taking finasteride. Mean followup was 38 months (range 3 to 86). Of the patients 86% (12 of 14) taking coumadin, 77% (10 of 13) taking aspirin and 73% (19 of 26) on no anticoagulants had no further bleeding once on finasteride. Of the patients who had undergone prior transurethral prostatectomy 84% (26 of 31) experienced no further bleeding versus 68% (15 of 22) of those who had not undergone previous surgery. In the 16 patients who began finasteride while actively bleeding the average time to clear urine was 12 days (range 2 to 45). Prostatic volume correlated with the average time needed for resolution of hematuria, which was 2.7 days or longer for small (less than 40 gm.), 10.3 days or longer for large (40 to 100), 19 days or longer for extra large (100 to 150) and 45 days or longer for extra extra large (greater than 150) glands. Hematuria resolved an average of 5.5 days versus 18.6 days in those who had or had not undergone previous prostatectomy, respectively.

Conclusions

Our long-term followup demonstrates finasteride as a useful treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia related gross hematuria, which is effective in patients who are on anticoagulants. In patients with larger prostatic volumes a longer time to response and higher incidence of recurrent but lower grade bleeding should be anticipated compared to those who have undergone prior prostatectomy or have a smaller prostate.

### Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma: an unusual cause of gross hematuria [^dc56223f]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, even in anticoagulated patients, requires a high index of suspicion. Gross hematuria is also not infrequent in anticoagulated patients. Although urinary symptoms from a rectus sheath hematoma have been described, generally it would not be considered a common cause of gross hematuria in this population. We report here on 2 cases of spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma spontaneously fistulizing into the bladder and causing gross hematuria.
