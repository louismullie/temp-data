## Question

methylphenidate mechanism of action

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about methylphenidate's mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary pharmacodynamic targets and enantiomeric activity. Then, I should verify the distinction between mechanism and therapeutic effect. Next, I will examine dose–occupancy data and regional brain effects, followed by network-level and systems neuroscience mechanisms. After that, I need to consider secondary mechanisms and formulation differences. Finally, I should review clinical implications, safety signals, and synthesize a cautious, evidence-based conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacodynamics. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter, thereby inhibiting reuptake and increasing extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine; it also increases release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space, with the d‑enantiomer being more pharmacologically active than the l‑enantiomer, which aligns across multiple FDA labels and authoritative reviews [^112cRnkF] [^112cRnkF] [^115Ynzc4] [^116XT1BS].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between mechanism and therapeutic effect. Multiple FDA labels explicitly state that while methylphenidate's pharmacodynamics are known, the exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known, underscoring that DAT/NET blockade is necessary but not sufficient to explain clinical efficacy, and that downstream network effects likely mediate symptom improvement [^112cRnkF] [^113feSE6] [^115Ynzc4] [^116XT1BS].

> I need to check dose–occupancy data to anchor clinical relevance. PET studies show that clinically used doses of methylphenidate produce approximately 40–60% striatal DAT occupancy within 1–2 hours, with effects persisting several hours, which correlates with the time course of clinical benefit and supports the centrality of DAT blockade to acute effects [^116XXHpw] [^115EXt6j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform dopamine effects across the brain. I should confirm regional specificity. Oral methylphenidate preferentially increases dopamine in dorsal striatum and midbrain regions, with relatively less effect in ventral striatum compared with intravenous routes, a pattern that may help separate therapeutic attentional effects from reinforcing properties; this dorsal bias is consistent with human PET and mechanistic hypotheses linking dorsal striatum to executive control and attention [^115EXt6j] [^113fZ2gF].

> Next, I should review systems-level mechanisms. Let me consider large-scale brain dynamics. Recent neuroimaging work suggests methylphenidate stabilizes dynamic functional connectivity, reducing whole-brain flexibility and aligning network controllability toward typically developing patterns; these changes correlate with improved attention and task performance, indicating that catecholaminergic modulation tunes network dynamics rather than simply "increasing dopamine" uniformly [^114hq8Nt] [^112yX4zi] [^111UmRnj].

> I will now examine secondary mechanisms that might modulate response. Integrative proteomic and pharmacogenomic data suggest methylphenidate engages pathways beyond DAT/NET, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, and plasticity-related processes, and may influence Wnt signaling and neuronal differentiation in preclinical models; while translation is early, these findings plausibly contribute to interindividual variability and longer-term adaptive effects [^113feSE6] [^114i3XBc] [^116ja33Z].

> But wait, what if formulation changes the mechanism or kinetics. I should double-check formulation-specific pharmacokinetics. Immediate-release methylphenidate shows rapid absorption with a short half-life, whereas extended-release formulations produce bimodal plasma profiles and longer apparent half-lives; transdermal systems have delayed and prolonged absorption, and these PK differences can shape clinical coverage and tolerability without changing the fundamental DAT/NET blockade mechanism [^111URc4d] [^111ccJok] [^112cRnkF] [^112EfG7e].

> Let me consider clinical implications and safety signals, and I should confirm the strength of evidence. Methylphenidate improves ADHD symptoms in children and adults, but the certainty of evidence varies and is often low to very low due to bias and indirectness; benefits must be balanced against nonserious adverse effects such as appetite suppression and sleep disturbance, and rare but important cardiovascular and psychiatric risks, including small increases in arrhythmia risk and potential treatment-emergent psychosis in susceptible individuals [^115BuZ5J] [^112tnJo1] [^111bhvA4] [^116T5iBy] [^111zwrJX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought methylphenidate might directly release dopamine like amphetamine; let me reconsider and correct that. Unlike amphetamine, methylphenidate does not robustly induce reverse transport at therapeutic doses. Its dopamine increase is largely contingent on endogenous firing and vesicular release, which helps explain why its abuse liability, while present, differs from amphetamine and why oral administration yields more dorsal striatal effects than ventral, reinforcing effects [^113sNJdt] [^115EXt6j].

> I should confirm the synthesis. Methylphenidate's principal mechanism is blockade of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters with increased monoamine release, producing 40–60% striatal DAT occupancy at clinical doses; however, therapeutic effects arise from downstream normalization of corticostriatal and frontoparietal network dynamics, stabilization of functional connectivity, and enhancement of task-relevant salience, with contributions from secondary pathways and modulation by formulation kinetics and individual neurobiology [^112cRnkF] [^116XXHpw] [^114hq8Nt] [^112yX4zi] [^113feSE6].

---

Methylphenidate's **primary mechanism** is blockade of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters [^112cRnkF], increasing extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine and enhancing catecholaminergic neurotransmission [^111iVTwC]. This boosts prefrontal cortex activity, improving attention, impulse control, and executive function [^112BhVMg]. Methylphenidate also increases dopamine release and has minimal serotonin effects, contributing to its therapeutic profile and abuse potential [^113feSE6] [^115RNyyy]. The exact therapeutic mechanism in ADHD remains incompletely defined, but these effects are thought to normalize underactive frontostriatal circuits [^112cRnkF] [^114sRfhP].

---

## Primary pharmacodynamic mechanism

- **Dopamine transporter (DAT) blockade**: Methylphenidate binds DAT, inhibiting dopamine reuptake and increasing synaptic dopamine [^112cRnkF] [^1173fWAq].

- **Norepinephrine transporter (NET) blockade**: Methylphenidate also inhibits NET, increasing norepinephrine and further enhancing catecholaminergic transmission [^111iVTwC] [^117V6zu9].

- **Increased dopamine release**: Methylphenidate increases dopamine release, augmenting extracellular dopamine beyond reuptake blockade alone [^112cRnkF] [^113feSE6].

---

## Regional brain effects

Methylphenidate's effects are **regionally selective**, with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum as key targets:

| **Brain region** | **Effect of methylphenidate** |
|-|-|
| Prefrontal cortex | Increased dopamine/norepinephrine enhances attention, working memory, and executive function [^112BhVMg] [^114FBLZM] |
| Striatum | Increased dopamine improves motor control and reward processing, contributing to reduced hyperactivity/impulsivity [^113hAL7K] [^115EXt6j] |
| Midbrain (VTA, SN) | Modulates dopamine signaling, influencing motivation and reinforcement [^113fZ2gF] [^114FBLZM] |

---

## Secondary mechanisms and modulatory effects

Beyond DAT/NET blockade, methylphenidate has **additional actions** that may contribute to its clinical effects:

- **Serotonin modulation**: Minimal serotonin transporter inhibition may influence mood and anxiety, though this is not a primary mechanism [^111rVT2F] [^113feSE6].

- **Neuroplasticity**: Animal data suggest methylphenidate may enhance neuroplasticity, potentially supporting longer-term cognitive benefits [^114ASwCc] [^116ja33Z].

- **Network dynamics**: Methylphenidate stabilizes functional brain networks, improving attention and reducing distractibility [^114hq8Nt] [^112yX4zi].

---

## Therapeutic implications in ADHD

In ADHD, methylphenidate is thought to **normalize underactive frontostriatal circuits** by increasing catecholamines, thereby improving attention, impulse control, and executive function [^114sRfhP] [^114FBLZM]. Individual response varies with baseline dopamine tone, genetic factors, and age, which helps explain heterogeneity in clinical outcomes [^113hAL7K] [^116RReUP].

---

## Clinical considerations and safety

- **Abuse potential**: DAT blockade and dopamine release confer abuse liability; risk is higher with rapid-onset formulations and is mitigated by extended-release formulations and careful monitoring [^115hsRdP] [^1115cbqQ].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Sympathomimetic effects can increase heart rate and blood pressure; clinicians should assess cardiovascular risk before treatment [^111bhvA4] [^112US9BS].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Rare psychosis or mania can occur, particularly in predisposed individuals or at high doses [^116T5iBy] [^111zwrJX].

---

Methylphenidate's **core mechanism** is DAT/NET blockade with increased dopamine/norepinephrine, enhancing prefrontal and striatal function to improve ADHD symptoms. Additional modulatory effects and formulation-specific kinetics shape clinical response and safety.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

Bottom Line

Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methylphenidate is a CNS stimulant. Its mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d - and l -enantiomers. The d -enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l -enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate transdermal system when applied to the hip for 9 hours have been studied in ADHD patients 6 to 17 years old.

Absorption

The amount of methylphenidate absorbed systemically is a function of both wear time and transdermal system size. In patients with ADHD, peak plasma levels of methylphenidate are reached at about 10 hours after single application and 8 hours after repeat transdermal system applications (12.5 cm2to 37.5 cm2) when worn up to 9 hours.

On single dosing of children or adolescents with methylphenidate transdermal system, there was a delay of, on average, 2 hours before d -methylphenidate was detectable in the circulation. On repeat dosing, low concentrations (1.2–3.0 ng/mL in children and 0.5–1.7 ng/mL in adolescents, on average across the dose range) were observed earlier in the profile, due to carry-over effect. Following the application of methylphenidate transdermal system once daily with a 9-hour wear time, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of d -methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD after 4 weeks of therapy are summarized in Table 3.

Following administration of methylphenidate transdermal system 12.5 cm2to pediatric and adolescent ADHD patients daily for 7 days, there were 13% and 14% increases, respectively, in steady state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss) relative to that anticipated on the basis of single dose pharmacokinetics (AUC0-∞); after 28 days administration, these increments increased to 64% and 76%, respectively. Cmaxincreased by nearly 69% and 100% within 4 weeks of daily administration of the starting dose in children and adolescents, respectively.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride — methylphenidate hydrochloride — LA [^111URc4d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a CNS stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo enantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

A formal QT study has not been conducted in patients taking methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA).

The effect of dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d -enantiomer of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open-label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of dexmethylphenidate XR 40mg (maximum recommended adult total daily dosage) in 75 healthy volunteers. Electrocardiograms were collected up to 12 hours postdose. Frederica's method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) produces a bi-modal plasma concentration-time profile (i.e., 2 distinct peaks approximately 4 hours apart) when administered orally to children diagnosed with ADHD and healthy adults.

No accumulation of methylphenidate is expected following multiple once daily oral dosing with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA), however, there is a slight upward trend in the methylphenidate area under the curve and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax1and Cmax2) after oral administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) 20 mg and 40 mg to adults.

### Methylphenidate amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of amphetamines by increasing dopamine transporter expression [^112ruMxY]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is commonly diverted for recreational use, but the neurobiological consequences of exposure to MPH at high, abused doses are not well defined. Here we show that MPH self-administration in rats increases dopamine transporter (DAT) levels and enhances the potency of MPH and amphetamine on dopamine responses and drug-seeking behaviours, without altering cocaine effects. Genetic overexpression of the DAT in mice mimics these effects, confirming that MPH self-administration-induced increases in DAT levels are sufficient to induce the changes. Further, this work outlines a basic mechanism by which increases in DAT levels, regardless of how they occur, are capable of increasing the rewarding and reinforcing effects of select psychostimulant drugs, and suggests that individuals with elevated DAT levels, such as ADHD sufferers, may be more susceptible to the addictive effects of amphetamine-like drugs.

After oral administration of COTEMPLA XR-ODT, circulation levels of l - methylphenidate (MPH) were about 2% of total MPH.

Elimination

Plasma methylphenidate concentrations decline monophasically following oral administration of COTEMPLA XR-ODT. The mean plasma terminal elimination half-life of methylphenidate was about 4 hours in healthy volunteers following a single 51.8 mg dose administration.

Metabolism

In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid). The metabolite has little or no pharmacological activity.

Excretion

After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main primary metabolite was PPAA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: a population-based cohort study [^116T5iBy]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Longitudinal studies, have shown that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood is a risk factor for a diagnosis of psychosis in adult life. Research indicates that these disorders share common geneticand environmental aetiologies. A potential mediator of the association between ADHD and psychosis is the prescription of central stimulants for ADHD, which causes considerable concern for clinicians. Clinical guidelinesrecommend stimulant medications, including methylphenidate and dexamphetamine, as first-line treatments for ADHD. Central stimulants act as indirect dopamine agonists and are presumed to amplify neuronal signalling by prompting a marked increase in the extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Increased concentrations of synaptic dopamine have also been implicated in the generation of psychotic symptoms. Hence, the pharmacological mechanism of central stimulant medication can be viewed by clinicians as having the potential to induce psychotic symptoms and disorders.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Clinical concerns have been raised that prescribing methylphenidate, the most common pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), might increase the risk of treatment-emergent psychotic events, particularly in young people with a history of psychosis. This perceived risk can lead to clinicians withholding methylphenidate treatment or using less effective alternatives. We searched PubMed for studies published in English on or after Jan 1, 2000, that investigated the association between methylphenidate prescribing, ADHD, and psychosis. We screened abstracts for relevance by use of combinations of the search terms "methylphenidate OR stimulants", "ADHD", and "psychosis". We also reviewed clinical guidelines from national bodies, including the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and relevant Cochrane systematic reviews. There is no clear consensus as to whether methylphenidate treatment, particularly in older adolescents and young adults and in individuals with a history of psychosis, increases the risk of psychotic events. Some observational studies that report an increased risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate might be affected by confounding by indication. Clinical trial data is also relatively unhelpful in answering this question because of the routine exclusion of participants with previous psychosis, short follow-up periods, and the low incidence of psychotic events in these studies.

### Comparing the abuse potential of methylphenidate versus other stimulants: a review of available evidence and relevance to the ADHD patient [^1115cbqQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The use of psychostimulants to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been controversial for a number of reasons. In an effort to clarify the extent to which the psychostimulant methylphenidate has abuse potential, the existing published evidence has been reviewed and is summarized here, with an emphasis on delineating a number of related but independent issues that are often confused. Methylphenidate produces behavioral effects associated with abuse potential as assessed by traditional assays, but the relevance of this literature to the clinical use of the drug in the treatment of ADHD is ambiguous at best. Existing neuropharmacologic data suggest that methylphenidate has pharmacokinetic properties that reduce its abuse potential as compared with other stimulant drugs of abuse, such as cocaine.

### Methylphenidate differentially alters corticostriatal connectivity after traumatic brain injury [^114DP2XY]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Here, we use fMRI to investigate the modulatory effects of methylphenidate on corticostriatal interactions following moderate–severe TBI. In an experimental medicine add-on study to a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial, we focused on the action of methylphenidate on caudate connectivity to test the mechanism of cognitive enhancement from a network neuroscience perspective. We investigate whether methylphenidate strengthens functional connectivity to regions that support externally focused attention and decreases functional connectivity to DMN regions activated when attention is internally directed (Fig. 1A). We test the following specific hypotheses: (i) caudate functional connectivity to regions involved in executive control will be increased under methylphenidate administration compared with placebo; (ii) methylphenidate will also influence caudate functional connectivity with the DMN; (iii) post-traumatic hyperconnectivity within the DMN will be reduced following methylphenidate administration; (iv) normalization of caudate functional connectivity will be associated with improved post-traumatic cognitive function; and (v) the effects of methylphenidate on caudate functional connectivity will be influenced by dopamine levels within the caudate, measured with 123 I-Ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dopamine transporter (DAT) scanning.

The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after a single, 100 mg oral dose of JORNAY PM administered in the evening at 9 pm were studied in healthy adults. The initial absorption of methylphenidate into plasma is delayed such that no more than 5% of total drug is available within the first 10 hours after dosing. After the lag period, the absorption of methylphenidate occurs in a single peak with a median Tmax14.0 hours, followed by a gradual decline throughout the rest of the day.

Figure 1: Arithmetic Mean Plasma Methylphenidate Concentrations following a Single, Oral, 100 mg Dose of JORNAY PM (Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule) or Methylphenidate Immediate-Release Oral Product Administered in a Crossover Manner to Healthy Adult Subjects

The relative bioavailability of JORNAY PM (given once a day) compared to the same daily dose of a methylphenidate immediate-release oral product (given 3 times a day) in adults is 73.9%.

Food Effects

Compared to the fasted state, JORNAY PM taken with a high-fat meal at night exhibited similar mean AUC0-∞, a 14% lower mean Cmax, and a median Tmaxextended by approximately 2.5 hours. After JORNAY PM was taken at night, a morning meal had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate.

The pharmacokinetic parameters were similar when JORNAY PM was taken as a whole capsule or when sprinkled on applesauce.

Elimination

The apparent half-life of methylphenidate in adults following oral administration of JORNAY PM was approximately 5.9 hours.

Metabolism

In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to α-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (PPAA). The metabolite has little pharmacologic activity.

### Integrative proteomics and pharmacogenomics analysis of methylphenidate treatment response [^113feSE6]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely used stimulant for pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Its safety and efficacy for ADHD treatment in both adults and children are supported by meta-analyses; however, a considerable proportion of patients do not present a satisfactory response –. The main direct targets of MPH are the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET, respectively). In addition, the interactions of MPH with other proteins of these neurotransmission systems, such as dopaminergic, adrenergic, and AMPA receptors –, as well as the modulation of signaling of other neurotransmitters, including serotonin, glutamate, and GABA –, are suggested to be involved in its pharmacological actions. Moreover, several other pathways such as those involved in neuronal plasticity, energy metabolism, cell differentiation, circadian rhythm, and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation are also affected by MPH, as evidenced by transcriptomics and candidate gene/protein expression studies –. Although these studies used different methodologies, including in vivo and in vitro treatments, the overall evidence indicates that MPH actions involve a complex biological scenario, but the most relevant mechanisms for treatment response are still unclear.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, methylphenidate, AAP 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is a moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the patient's functioning. Weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

### Methylphenidate and short-term cardiovascular risk [^114WaYZE]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found evidence supporting a small (10%) increased risk of cardiovascular events in individuals receiving methylphenidate compared with matched controls after 6 months of treatment. The probability of finding a difference in risk between users and nonusers decreased when considering risk of 20% or larger, with no evidence of differences between those with and without a CVD history. Overall, while the findings suggest the decision to initiate methylphenidate should incorporate considerations of potential adverse cardiovascular effects, they do not establish evidence of markedly elevated cardiovascular risk. Rather, they provide probabilistic evidence most consistent with a small increased rate of cardiovascular events attributable to methylphenidate exposure over 6 months that warrants consideration among the broader benefits and risks of treatment for individual patients.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Metadate cd) [^115xttLy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo enantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following one week of once-daily doses of 20 mg or 40 mg METADATE CD to children aged 7 to12 years old with ADHD, Cmaxand AUC of methylphenidate were approximately proportional to the administered doses.

Absorption

Following administration of METADATE CD in children aged 7 to 12 years old with ADHD, the plasma concentration time profile of methylphenidate showed two phases of drug release with a sharp, initial slope similar to a methylphenidate immediate- release tablet (median Tabout 1.5 hours post dose), and a second rising portion approximately three hours later (median Tabout 4.5 hours post dose)*, followed by a gradual decline (Figure 1). The means for Cmaxand area under the curve (AUC) following a dose of 20 mg were slightly lower than those seen with 10 mg of the immediate-release formulation, dosed at 0 and 4 hours.

*25–30% of the subjects had only one observed peak (Cmax) concentration of methylphenidate.

Figure 1: Comparison of Immediate Release (IR) and METADATE CD Formulations After Repeated Doses of Methylphenidate HCl in Pediatric Patients 7 to 12 Years of Age with ADHD

Effect of Food

Ingestion of a high-fat meal with METADATE CD increased the mean Cmaxand AUC of methylphenidate by about 30% and 17%, respectively. The presence of food delayed the early peak by approximately 1 hour (range -2 to 5 hours delay) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Methylphenidate and short-term cardiovascular risk [^112US9BS]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

While the precise mechanisms by which methylphenidate could increase the risk of cardiovascular events remain elusive, it has been proposed that catecholamines may play an important role. Methylphenidate has been shown to increase catecholamine neurotransmission, which in turn can activate cardiovascular β 1 adrenoceptorsthat might predispose to a range of cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. Furthermore, the sympathomimetic actions of methylphenidate could result in an increase in circulating norepinephrine levels, with attendant effects on peripheral vascular tone and vasoconstriction. Additionally, an increase in circulating catecholamine levels has been associated with a decrease in cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, which could negatively affect the heart rate response to stress. The present study was not designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed association between methylphenidate and cardiovascular events. Future studies need to replicate our results, ideally using approaches that avoid null hypothesis significance testing and control for confounding, to determine the safety cardiovascular profile of methylphenidate and identify the underlying mechanisms.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study include the use of the PDR that allowed us to identify and include a large number of individuals receiving methylphenidate, with almost complete coverage (> 99%) of dispensed prescription drugs in Sweden. Moreover, with the inclusion of diagnoses based on inpatient and outpatient medical records, we avoided faulty recollection of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, by using a within-individual approach, we compared the rate of cardiovascular events before and after methylphenidate treatment within the same individual (ie, each individual was their own control) adjusting for unmeasured constant factors. The variance of the individual-level residual addressed the influence of both measured and unmeasured sources. Additionally, to account for the possible effect of age rather than methylphenidate treatment, individuals with ADHD were matched by sex, birth date, and county, and age was included at the start of methylphenidate treatment as a between-level variable. As age was not a significant between-level predictor, it is unlikely that we introduced bias by using a 1-year baseline period.

### A practical guide to the therapy of narcolepsy and hypersomnia syndromes [^114TCdAZ]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate

Methylphenidate shares many of the actions of amphetamines, although it does not fully substitute for catecholamines at the level of the dopamine transporter. The compound became popular for use in narcolepsy in the 1950s. It is primarily a DAT reuptake inhibitor, but it has also been shown to increase dopamine release. As an amphetamine, methylphenidate is also not fully specific for dopaminergic transmission, also affecting more mildly other monoamines. Furthermore, D-isomers have different pharmacokinetics and are more specific for dopaminergic synapses than the L-isomer. D-isomers are also more potent.

Methylphenidate has a short half-life and is water-soluble. It is readily absorbed and enters the brain effectively, also producing rapidly increasing concentration in the brain and a sensation of rush. As for amphetamine, methylphenidate is addictive and can lead to drug-seeking behaviors and tolerance. Onset of effects after oral administration is 20 minutes and duration of action is only approximately three hours.

The addictive potential of methylphenidate is highly dependent on formulation, with extended-release formulations having less potential for addiction. Because it is soluble, prescribed methylphenidate can be reformulated differently and has a street value for stimulant abusers. The large number of formulations available for methylphenidate (D- (dextro), L- (levo), both, and various release formulations) as a treatment for ADHD has also increased choice for hypersomnia therapies.

Methylphenidate has a similar side effect profile to amphetamines (e.g. cardiovascular effects, psychosis), although as it is primarily a DAT inhibitor, it has not been shown to be as cytotoxic in animal studies. As for amphetamines, methylphenidate suppresses primarily non-REM sleep, promoting wakefulness, but also REM sleep. It is mostly effective on wakefulness and has minimal effects on cataplexy and other narcolepsy symptoms. Effective doses are listed in Table 1, keeping in mind that as for the amphetamines, there is great variation in effectiveness across preparations, and it is unusual to have to go beyond 60 mg/day, preferably using long-acting formulations.

### Striatal dopamine dissociates methylphenidate effects on value-based versus surprise-based reversal learning [^113hAL7K]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Adaptive behavior requires flexible updating of our actions and predictions in response to the constant changes around us. Catecholamine transmission is well-accepted to be essential for such flexible behavior, as demonstrated by accumulating evidence from experimental psychopharmacology showing effects of catecholaminergic drugs on performance on cognitive tasks, including reversal learning, cognitive action gating and attention shifting –. Methylphenidate, a dopamine and noradrenaline transporter blocker, is the first-line pharmacological treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is characterized by cognitive deficits. In addition, it is widely used by healthy people as a psychostimulant for its cognition-enhancing effects –. However, there is large interindividual variability in the direction of the effects, and the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. This poses a major problem for treatment strategies in psychiatry and raises questions about the use of methylphenidate as a therapeutic or a smart drug.

Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms of methylphenidate's effects on reward-related reversal learning: the ability to flexibly adapt behavior based on changes in reward and punishment contingencies. While evidence from work with nonhuman animals suggests that many of methylphenidate's cognitive enhancing effects involve direct action in the prefrontal cortex, work with human volunteers has suggested a key role for dopamine in the striatum. A large body of evidence indicates that both the therapeutic effects, and potential for abuseof methylphenidate are related to its effects on reinforcement as well as surprise –, and associated striatal dopamine signaling.

A causal role for striatal dopamine in reward-based reversal learning is substantiated by a large body of evidence from studies with nonhuman primates, experimental rodents, and patients with Parkinson's disease. Studies in young healthy volunteers have shown that administration of methylphenidate modulates reversal-related BOLD signal in the striatumand impairs reversal learning in proportion to the degree that methylphenidate increased striatal dopamine release. Genetic variation in a common dopamine transporter polymorphism, affecting primarily striatal dopamine, predicted increased perseveration during reversal learning due to increased reliance on prior reinforcement. This evidence generally concurs with the observation that injection of D-amphetamine in the striatum of rats potentiates behavioral control by stimuli formerly associated with reward (i.e. conditioned reinforcement) in a dopamine-dependent manner. While these studies establish a causal role for striatal dopamine specifically in reward-driven compulsivity as measured with reversal learning, the corticostriatal mechanisms underlying the large interindividual variability in methylphenidate's effects remain unclear.

Methylphenidate — mechanism of action and clinical indications — works primarily to increase activity within the central nervous system via dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibition, to exert agonist activity at the serotonin type 1A receptor, and to redistribute VMAT-2; these effects resulted in the discovery of its benefits for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), weight loss and narcolepsy, with off label use for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and enhancing cognitive performance.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias.

Main Results

The studies. We included 38 parallel-group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries. The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). Risk of Bias. All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.90 to -0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low-quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -9.6 points (95% CI -13.75 to -6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2).

Secondary Outcomes

Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non-serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non-serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non-serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. Teacher-rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low-quality evidence). A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent-reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events. Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Given the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed consent. Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors including two review authors from the original publication participated in the update in 2022. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Data from parallel-group trials and first-period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses. We undertook separate analyses using end-of-last period data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA) to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 212 trials (16,302 participants randomised); 55 parallel-group trials (8104 participants randomised), and 156 cross-over trials (8033 participants randomised) as well as one trial with a parallel phase (114 participants randomised) and a cross-over phase (165 participants randomised). The mean age of participants was 9.8 years ranging from 3 to 18 years (two trials from 3 to 21 years). The male-female ratio was 3:1. Most trials were carried out in high-income countries, and 86/212 included trials (41%) were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Methylphenidate treatment duration ranged from 1 to 425 days, with a mean duration of 28.8 days. Trials compared methylphenidate with placebo (200 trials) and with no intervention (12 trials). Only 165/212 trials included usable data on one or more outcomes from 14,271 participants. Of the 212 trials, we assessed 191 at high risk of bias and 21 at low risk of bias. If, however, deblinding of methylphenidate due to typical adverse events is considered, then all 212 trials were at high risk of bias.

Primary Outcomes

methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.88 to -0.61; I² = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -10.58 (95% CI -12.58 to -8.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I² = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68).

Secondary Outcomes

methylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non-serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I² = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33; I² = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83; I² = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no-intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non-serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes.

### Amphetamine, past and present – a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^116Wkv7V]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

It is now just over a hundred years since amphetamine was first discovered. In that period amphetamine has transformed from a drug that was widely available without prescription for the treatment of a broad range of disorders to being highly restricted Controlled Drugs that, in Europe at least, have all but disappeared from the formularies in many countries. The very clear links between molecular structure and pharmacological mode of action and, in turn, efficacy and safety in humans, makes amphetamine a textbook example of translational validity. The primary pharmacology of these drugs is not only responsible for providing efficacy in disorders such as ADHD and narcolepsy, but also for their spectrum of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse, making the balance of benefit/risk the key challenge in their clinical use. Amphetamine ranks alongside methylphenidate as the most effective drugs available for the management of ADHD, and the advances that have been made in developing genuine once-daily medications have addressed some of the problems of therapeutic coverage, whilst at the same time reducing the risk of diversion and recreational abuse.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (methylphenidate hydrochloride CD) [^111ccJok]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not known. Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo enantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer.

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of the Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD methylphenidate hydrochloride formulation have been studied in healthy adult volunteers and in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Absorption And Distribution

Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD has a plasma/time concentration profile showing two phases of drug release with a sharp, initial slope similar to a methylphenidate immediate-release tablet, and a second rising portion approximately three hours later, followed by a gradual decline. (See Figure 1 below.)

Comparison Of Immediate Release (IR) And Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD Formulations After Repeated Doses Of Methylphenidate HCl In Children With ADHD

Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD was administered as repeated once-daily doses of 20 mg or 40 mg to children aged 7–12 years with ADHD for one week. After a dose of 20 mg, the mean (± SD) early Cmaxwas 8.6 (± 2.2) ng/mL, the later Cmaxwas 10.9 (± 3.9)1ng/mL and AUC0-9hwas 63.0 (± 16.8) ng∙h/mL. The corresponding values after a 40 mg dose were 16.8 (± 5.1) ng/mL, 15.1 (± 5.8)1ng/mL and 120 (± 39.6) ng∙h/mL, respectively. The early peak concentrations (median) were reached about 1.5 hours after dose intake, and the second peak concentrations (median) were reached about 4.5 hours after dose intake. The means for Cmaxand AUC following a dose of 20 mg were slightly lower than those seen with 10 mg of the immediate-release formulation, dosed at 0 and 4 hours.

### The pharmacogenomic era: promise for personalizing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder therapy [^11356fA4]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment is often determined empirically through trial and error until an adequate response is obtained or side effects occur. ADHD is highly heritable and individuals experience wide individual variability in response to ADHD medications, suggesting that the mechanism of action of stimulant medications may provide clues for genetic predictors of response. The promise of ADHD pharmacogenetics is far-reaching and includes the potential to develop individualized medication regimens that improve symptom response, decrease risk for side effects, improve long-term tolerability, and thus contribute to long-term treatment compliance and improved effectiveness. Early ADHD pharmacogenetic studies have focused predominantly on catecholamine pathway genes and response to methylphenidate. Future efforts will also examine a wider range of stimulant and nonstimulant medications on a range of outcome measures and durations. Based on these studies, the potential for personalizing ADHD treatment in clinical practice will be determined.

### Active emergence from propofol general anesthesia is induced by methylphenidate [^1167qiHU]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A recent study showed that methylphenidate induces emergence from isoflurane general anesthesia. Isoflurane and propofol are general anesthetics that may have distinct molecular mechanisms of action. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that methylphenidate actively induces emergence from propofol general anesthesia.

Methods

Using adult rats, the effect of methylphenidate on time to emergence after a single bolus of propofol was determined. The ability of methylphenidate to restore righting during a continuous target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol was also tested. In a separate group of rats, a TCI of propofol was established and spectral analysis was performed on electroencephalogram recordings taken before and after methylphenidate administration.

Results

Methylphenidate decreased median time to emergence after a single dose of propofol from 735 s (95% CI: 598–897 s, n = 6) to 448 s (95% CI: 371–495 s, n = 6). The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0051). During continuous propofol anesthesia with a median final target plasma concentration of 4.0 μg/ml (95% CI: 3.2–4.6, n = 6), none of the rats exhibited purposeful movements after injection of normal saline. After methylphenidate, however, all six rats promptly exhibited arousal and had restoration of righting with a median time of 82 s (95% CI: 30–166 s). Spectral analysis of electroencephalogram data demonstrated a shift in peak power from δ (less than 4 Hz) to θ (4–8 Hz) and β (12–30 Hz) after administration of methylphenidate, indicating arousal in 4/4 rats.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate decreases time to emergence after a single dose of propofol, and induces emergence during continuous propofol anesthesia in rats. Further study is warranted to test the hypothesis that methylphenidate induces emergence from propofol general anesthesia in humans.

### Debate: are stimulant medications for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (against) [^116Fmx6p]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects. Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment (that may set a maximum for effectiveness). Magnitude of effectiveness (eg, small, medium, or large effect size) depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors (including treatment adherence and study design). Third, "long term" refers to a given time frame (eg, 1 year), which can be applied to specify duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment during the follow-up after it is discontinued. Given these definitions, the following questions address long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^117Eh4hh]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Quality of evidence

For each included trial, data extractors independently evaluated all risk of bias domains (listed below), resolving any disagreements by discussion. We assigned each bias domain to one of three categories: low risk of bias, uncertain risk of bias, or high risk of bias, according to the Cochrane guidelines. Owing to the risk of overestimation of beneficial intervention effects and underestimation of harmful intervention effects in randomised clinical trials with unclear or high risk of bias, we assessed the influence of the risk of bias on our results (see subgroup analyses). We used the following domains to assess the risk of bias in the included trials: generation of allocation sequence, allocation of concealment, blinding of participants and staff, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and vested interest (trial was funded by parties that might have had a conflict of interest (for example, a manufacturer of methylphenidate) or there were potential conflicts of interests among authors because they had been working for companies producing or selling methylphenidate, or both). We considered trials with low risk of bias in all domains to be at low risk of bias and trials with one or more unclear or inadequate component to be at high risk of bias. For 32% (59/185) of the included trials we noted a specific type of bias occurring before randomisation. Non-responders to methylphenidate, responders to placebo, or participants who had adverse events due to the drug were excluded as a consequence of exclusion criteria or after a titration phase. Such trials have limited external validity and, to identify whether this cohort selection bias had an effect on estimates of effects, we did subgroup analyses (see above).

We assessed and graded the evidence according to the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity, and publication bias. The analyses were conducted with Review Manager 5.3 (Review Manager 2014) and the trial sequential analysis program.

### Serdexmethylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate (Azstarys) [^116Sorgq]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Serdexmethylphenidate is a prodrug of dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Dexmethylphenidate

Dexmethylphenidate is the more pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of racemic d, l- methylphenidate. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. In vitro studies with serdexmethylphenidate showed little or no binding of the prodrug to monoaminergic reuptake transporters.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of serdexmethylphenidate on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human abuse potential study (intranasal administration) in 46 healthy subjects. At a mean concentration 40 times the Cmaxfor the highest dose of AZSTARYS (52.3/10.4 mg base equivalent), serdexmethylphenidate does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

### Methylphenidate versus placebo for treating fatigue in patients with advanced cancer: randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial [^116jhnSG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is common and distressing. It is more prevalent and severe in patients with advanced cancerand those receiving palliative care. Treatment options are limited. Exercise has the best evidence of effectiveness; however, in patients with advanced cancer, this may not be feasible or realistic. Psychosocial interventions may help, but there is less evidence for effectiveness in advanced cancer.

Methylphenidate inhibits catecholamine reuptake, increases central dopamine and noradrenaline, and is sometimes used as a treatment for CRF. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network CRF guidelineadvises that methylphenidate can be considered in selected patients, but should be used cautiously and not until treatment and disease-specific morbidities have been characterized and excluded. Moreover, it notes that optimum dosing and schedule of methylphenidate remain uncertain. The European Society of Medical Oncology guideline on CRF is noncommittal about the issue.

### Methylphenidate enhances neuronal differentiation and reduces proliferation concomitant to activation of wnt signal transduction pathways [^116ja33Z]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is the most commonly prescribed drug in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is suggested that in vivo, methylphenidate treatment supports cortical maturation, however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms are not well understood. This study aimed to explore the potential effect of methylphenidate on cell proliferation and maturation in various cellular models, hypothesizing its interaction with the Wnt-signaling. The termination of cell proliferation concomitant to neuronal maturation following methylphenidate treatment was observed in all of the cell-models tested: murine neural stem-, rat PC12- and the human SH-SY5Y-cells. Inhibition of Wnt-signaling in SH-SY5Y cells with Dkk1 30 min before methylphenidate treatment suppressed neuronal differentiation but enhanced proliferation. The possible involvement of the dopamine-transporter in cell differentiation was discounted following the observation of opposing results after GBR-12909 treatment. Moreover, Wnt-activation via methylphenidate was confirmed in Wnt-luciferase-reporter assay. These findings reveal a new mechanism of action of methylphenidate that might explain long-term effects.

### The utility of long-term methylphenidate in preserving intellectual development in survivors of childhood brain tumour [^116HfNba]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The utility of methylphenidate

Psychostimulants have a well-established role in the first-line treatment of childhood Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). More recently, the use of psychostimulants, most notably methylphenidate, has been extended to attentional deficits secondary to childhood acquired brain injury. Despite the relatively small number of published clinical trials, methylphenidate offers promise in enhancing processing speed and attention in survivors of childhood brain tumour during early phases of recovery. Improvements to these core cognitive functions have in turn been associated with improved quality of life and social skills.

The proposed mechanism of action involves enhanced dopaminergic and noradrenergic signalling, thereby promoting the functional integrity of large-scale neural networks that underpin attention, working memory and cognitive processing. In survivors of childhood brain tumour, these networks are frequently compromised as a result of both disease- and treatment-related injury to white matter tracts. This provides a plausible neurobiological rationale for methylphenidate treatment, both in enhancing core cognitive functions as well as potentially mitigating downstream effects of disrupted network efficiency.

While short-term studies (2–14 days) demonstrate benefit to core cognitive functions, little is known about the longer-term impact of methylphenidate on broader intellectual outcomes that rely on these foundational domains. Based upon proposed conceptual modelling, we hypothesise that the sustained use of methylphenidate may help preserve age-appropriate intellectual development by enhancing the underpinning functions of attention, working memory, and processing speed. One longitudinal study in childhood ADHD provides partial support for this hypothesis, reporting modest but significant gains in intellectual ability following 12 months of methylphenidate treatment.

As such, the current study evaluates the longer-term utility of methylphenidate on intellectual developmental trajectories in survivors of childhood brain tumour over a minimum assessment period of 12 months, compared to a no-treatment control group. While previous research has examined short-term benefits of methylphenidate, and one study has reported non-significant gains to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient at 12-month follow-up, our study is the first to rigorously model longitudinal changes in multiple intellectual domains over sustained treatment, using matched controls and Bayesian analyses to evaluate treatment-related trajectories.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, handsearched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' 'generalisability'; exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity; responder selection based on previous experience with CNS stimulants; and risk of withdrawal effects. Our prespecified primary outcomes were functional outcomes, self-rated ADHD symptoms, and serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, ADHD symptoms rated by investigators and by peers such as family members, cardiovascular variables, severe psychiatric adverse events, and other adverse events.

Main Results

We included 24 trials (5066 participants), of which 21 reported outcome data for this review. We also identified one ongoing study. We included documents from six drug regulatory agencies covering eight trials. Twenty-one trials had an outpatient setting and three were conducted in prisons. They were primarily conducted in North America and Europe. The median participant age was 36 years. Twelve trials (76% of participants) were industry-sponsored, four (14% of participants) were publicly funded with industry involvement, seven (10% of participants) were publicly funded, and one had unclear funding. The median trial duration was eight weeks. One trial was rated at overall unclear risk of bias and 20 trials were rated at overall high risk of bias, primarily due to unclear blinding of participants and investigators, attrition bias, and selective outcome reporting. All trials were impaired in at least one of the three design characteristics related to 'generalisability'; for example, they excluded participants with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety, or included participants only with a previous positive response to methylphenidate, or similar drugs. This may limit the trials' usefulness for clinical practice, as they may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms. Extended-release methylphenidate versus placebo (up to 26 weeks) For the primary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' at 13-week follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.15 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.11 to 1.81; 1 trial, 409 participants) or serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, CI 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 14 trials, 4078 participants), whereas methylphenidate improved self-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.30; 16 trials, 3799 participants). For secondary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate improved self-rated quality of life (small effect; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 6 trials, 1888 participants), investigator-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.36; 18 trials, 4183 participants), ADHD symptoms rated by peers such as family members (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14; 3 trials, 1005 participants), and increased the risk of experiencing any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.37; 14 trials, 4214 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, primarily due to high risk of bias and 'indirectness of the evidence'. One trial (419 participants) had follow-up at 52 weeks and two trials (314 participants) included active comparators, hence long-term and comparative evidence is limited.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-certainty evidence that extended-release methylphenidate compared to placebo improved ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effects) measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers such as family members. Methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' or serious adverse events, the effect on quality of life was small, and it increased the risk of several adverse effects. We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, due to high risk of bias, short trial durations, and limitations to the generalisability of the results. The benefits and harms of extended-release methylphenidate therefore remain uncertain.

### A positron emission tomography study of nigro-striatal dopaminergic mechanisms underlying attention: implications for ADHD and its treatment [^115EXt6j]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases: regional dependence and therapeutic implications

Some of the present findings on effects of methylphenidate are relevant to the more general understanding of stimulant drug action in healthy humans, other than simply in patients with ADHD. Thus, here we report, for the first time, that therapeutic doses of methylphenidate administered orally reduce 18 F-fallypride binding, which can be attributed to methylphenidate-induced increases in synaptic dopamine levels. Effect sizes and rank order of 18 F-fallypride BP ND % change across subregions of the striatum and the midbrain were comparable with those documented following oral administration of amphetamine, the alternative first-line treatment for ADHD which also increases catecholamine levels, albeit via different cellular mechanisms. Consistent with previous reports, the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area showed high levels of BP ND % change, which were comparable to those observed in sensorimotor striatum.

These findings replicate the preferential effect of methylphenidate in the sensorimotor striatum when administered orally using 11 C-raclopride binding. The preferential effect of oral methylphenidate and amphetamine on dorsal compared to ventral regions of the striatum, however, is in contrast with the well-replicated finding that intravenous amphetamine leads to greater dopamine changes in ventral compared to dorsal striatum. Animal evidence suggests that the ability to increase dopamine in ventral striatum, involved with reward circuitry, is a common pharmacological effect underlying the reinforcing properties of virtually all drugs of abuse. Consistent with these data, in healthy humans, amphetamine-induced dopamine changes in ventral but not dorsal striatum were found to predict hedonic responses.

The pattern of dopamine changes observed along the ventral–dorsal gradient of the striatum following oral versus intravenous administration of methylphenidate and amphetamine may be explained in light of the different pharmacokinetics associated with each route of drug administration. Whereas oral methylphenidate penetrates the brain only slowly, peaking 60–90 min after administration, intravenous methylphenidate rapidly enters the brain, peaking in < 15 min. The large and abrupt dopamine increase after intravenous administration is perceived as reinforcing, an effect that appears to be reduced when the increase in dopamine is slow and progressive.

Overall, the differences in regional patterns of methylphenidate-induced dopamine increase following oral versus intravenous methylphenidate administration suggest that the mechanisms underlying the effects of the drug to improve attention differ from those mediating its reinforcing actions.

### Cardiovascular safety of methylphenidate among children and young people with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): nationwide self controlled case series study [^111bhvA4]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This study found a significantly increased overall risk of arrhythmia associated with treatment with methylphenidate in children and young people with ADHD. We also identified associations according to the timing of exposure for other cardiovascular adverse events. While the risk of myocardial infarction was not significant overall, we found an increased risk after the first week of treatment, which remained significantly raised for the first two months of continuous treatment. Though there was an increased risk for arrhythmia overall, the risk was substantially higher in patients with existing congenital heart disease. These results are consistent with the biological plausibility that the mechanism of action relates to the effect of methylphenidate on the heart rate. Delayed effects would be expected with myocardial infarction, while more immediate effects would be expected with arrhythmias, as we observed.

### Methylphenidate stabilizes dynamic brain network organization during tasks probing attention and reward processing in stimulant-naïve children with ADHD [^114hq8Nt]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact and conclusion

MPH is a commonly prescribed psychostimulant for children with ADHD, with increasing use in recent years. Yet it is not uniformly effective, necessitating a better understanding of how MPH changes brain function and behavior, and in which individuals it is most likely to be effective. Here, we conducted an MPH challenge in a psychostimulant-naïve sample of children with ADHD, coupled with estimations of dynamic functional connectivity and performance on tasks probing attention and reward processing, to test how MPH changes whole brain flexibility and behavior. We observed that, on a group level, MPH decreased whole brain flexibility and improved attention during both standard and rewarded go/no-go tasks. MPH additionally improved overall task accuracy, but only during the rewarded go/no-go task. Reduced MPH-induced flexibility was coupled with better task performance. Conversely, greater MPH-induced flexibility, observed in a subset of individuals, was coupled with poorer performance. Together, this research provides evidence that a mechanism through which MPH improves cognitive processes such as attention and reward processing and reduces primary ADHD symptoms may be through stabilizing whole brain network dynamics. Though we did not directly assess dopamine or norepinephrine availability, our findings extend previous prefrontal-focused theories of MPH action to large-scale brain dynamics. This work provides novel experimentally-derived insight into how MPH changes large-scale brain function and cognition and improves our understanding of MPH as a first-line treatment for children with ADHD.

### The effects of MDMA on socio-emotional processing: does MDMA differ from other stimulants? [^116Pg4th]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

± 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a popular recreational drug that enhances sociability and feelings of closeness with others. These "prosocial" effects appear to motivate the recreational use of MDMA and may also form the basis of its potential as an adjunct to psychotherapy. However, the extent to which MDMA differs from prototypic stimulant drugs, such as dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate, in either its behavioral effects or mechanisms of action, is not fully known. The purpose of this review is to evaluate human laboratory findings of the social effects of MDMA compared to other stimulants, ranging from simple subjective ratings of sociability to more complex elements of social processing and behavior. We also review the neurochemical mechanisms by which these drugs may impact sociability. Together, the findings reviewed here lay the groundwork for better understanding the socially enhancing effects of MDMA that distinguish it from other stimulant drugs, especially as these effects relate to the reinforcing and potentially therapeutic effects of the drug.

### Methylphenidate stabilizes dynamic brain network organization during tasks probing attention and reward processing in stimulant-naïve children with ADHD [^111UmRnj]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with ADHD often exhibit fluctuations in attention and heightened reward sensitivity. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate (MPH), improve these behaviors in many, but not all, children with ADHD. Given the extent to which psychostimulants are prescribed for children, coupled with variable efficacy on an individual level, a better understanding of the mechanisms through which MPH changes brain function and behavior is necessary. MPH's primary action is on catecholamines, including dopamine and norepinephrine. Catecholaminergic signaling can influence the tradeoff between flexibility and stability of brain function, which is one candidate mechanism through which MPH may alter brain function and behavior. Time-varying functional connectivity, which models how functional brain networks reconfigure on short timescales, can be used to examine brain flexibility versus stability, and is thus well-suited to test how MPH impacts brain function. Here, we scanned stimulant-naïve children with ADHD (8–12 years) on and off a single dose of MPH. In the MRI machine, participants completed two attention-demanding tasks: 1) a standard go/no-go task and 2) a rewarded go/no-go task. For both tasks, using a within-subjects design, we compared the degree to which brain organization changed throughout the course of the MRI scan, termed whole brain flexibility, on and off MPH. We found that whole brain flexibility decreased on MPH. Further, individuals with greater decreases in whole brain flexibility on MPH exhibited greater improvements in task performance. Together, these results provide novel insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of MPH administration for children with ADHD.

### Methylphenidate stabilizes dynamic brain network organization during tasks probing attention and reward processing in stimulant-naïve children with ADHD [^112BhVMg]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 11 percent of children in the United States. The primary symptoms of ADHD are inattention and hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. Foundational models of ADHD, such as the Dual Pathway Model, have proposed that ADHD symptoms arise from disruption to neurobehavioral circuits that orient attention through executive control and tune reward sensitivity through motivational control. Neuroimaging work in humans has confirmed that circuitry related to both executive control and motivational control is altered in individuals with ADHD. Notably, these alterations are not limited to specific brain networks, but instead are widespread and include networks that support externally and internally focused attention, cognitive control, self-referential processing, and reward-related processing. Recent work has further identified that it is not only the organization of these networks, but how they dynamically change across time, that may be particularly relevant for understanding the etiology of ADHD.

Children with ADHD are at an increased risk for substance use and poorer academic achievement and physical health relative to their unaffected peers. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate (MPH), are the most common effective first-line intervention for many, but not all, children with ADHD. This heterogeneity of response to MPH underscores the importance of understanding how MPH affects the brain and behavior. The primary mechanism of MPH is catecholaminergic modulation, through blocking dopamine transporters and elevating extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine. Preclinical studies of MPH action find that MPH-induced changes in extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine are pronounced in the prefrontal cortex and, even at low doses, lead to improved attention and cognition. There is also evidence that MPH, through increased dopamine signaling, makes task-relevant stimuli more salient, thus improving attention and goal-directed behavior. Neuroimaging work in humans finds that acute MPH administration leads to widespread changes in functional connectivity in individuals with ADHD and without ADHD; these changes have been linked to subsequent changes in behavior. Despite growing evidence that MPH impacts functional connectivity averaged over several minutes, the impacts are heterogeneous across studies. This may be because MPH targets the dynamics of functional connectivity, specifically how frequently functional connectivity patterns change across time.

### Headache in ADHD as comorbidity and a side effect of medications: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zFxf9]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate

Seventeen trials were included in the meta-analysis. None of them found a significant association between methylphenidate treatment and headache. Nevertheless, an increased risk of headache with methylphenidate was indicated by the pooled estimates [pooled OR (95% CI): 1.33 (1.09 − 1.63)], and also in the subgroup analysis on trials using an oral formation with monotherapy design [n = 15, pooled OR (95% CI): 1.41 (1.12 − 1.78)]. When considering the duration of drug action, long-acting formation [the osmotic-release oral system (OROS) and extended release] was significantly associated with a higher risk of headache with the treatment of methylphenidate compared to controls (Table 2). The pooled estimate of the three trials with immediate-release methylphenidate showed no significant difference between treatment and controls, but the CI was wide [pooled OR (95% CI): 1.00 (0.33–3.00)].

Modafinil

Of the six trials included in this review, none reported a significant difference in risk of headache between treatment and placebo arms. The results of the meta-analysis did not find a significant association between modafinil and headache [pooled OR (95% CI): 1.24 (0.73 − 2.13)]. However, the CI was wide due to the relatively small sample size.

### Catecholamines and cognition after traumatic brain injury [^114ASwCc]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Catecholaminergic therapies

Several catecholaminergic medications have been used to treat cognitive problems following TBI with varying degrees of success. Methylphenidate and amantadine have the most evidence for efficacy (Tables 2 and 3), with less available for dextroamphetamine, bromocriptine, atomoxetine, guanfacine and levodopa (Supplementary Tables 1–5). The majority of trials have focused on using these medications as short-term cognitive enhancers, with assessment after a single dose or a short course of treatment. However, catecholamines may also have an effect on neuroplasticity, shown for example by their role in modulating hippocampal long-term potentiation. Persistent effects once treatment has finished have been less frequently studied.

Table 2
Effect of methylphenidate on cognitive outcomes in TBI

Table 3
Effect of amantadine on cognitive outcomes in TBI

Methylphenidate

Mode of action

Methylphenidate is a psychomotor stimulant. Its primary mechanism of action is blockade of the noradrenaline and dopamine transporters, but it also increases dopamine release via D2 receptor-dependent modulation of vesicular trafficking. These mechanisms increase extracellular levels of both noradrenaline and dopamine, which is believed to be the primary mechanism by which methylphenidate improves cognition. In animal models of TBI, methylphenidate improves working memory and attention via stimulation of both D1 dopamine receptors and α-2 adrenoreceptors in the PFC.

There is also evidence that methylphenidate might increase neuroplasticity and so promote longer-term cognitive improvements. In animal models, single doses of methylphenidate do not augment either basal or evoked extracellular dopamine levels. However, 2 weeks of daily pretreatment leads to increased dopamine levels in response to the drug, implying that methylphenidate may be inducing functional changes in DAT or changes in DAT trafficking. Methylphenidate has also been shown to amplify long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, an effect modulated via activation of β adrenergic and D1/D5 receptors.

### Methylphenidate for ADHD rejected from the WHO essential medicines list due to uncertainties in benefit-harm profile [^1124UCwg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder with estimated global prevalence rates between 3% and 5% in children and 2.5% in adults, depending on the classification system used. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD. In this analysis article we describe shortly the evidence in the field, an application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised to the application and the WHO Expert Committee's decision. The application of getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overzealous in reporting potential benefits, without highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions encompassing medicines candidate to the WHO Model List should not be based on speculation about potential benefits and should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties. Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning the benefits of this medication in children, adolescents and adults with ADHD is uncertain. The decision of the committee was to not include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines 'due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit, and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm'.

### Restoring consciousness with pharmacologic therapy: mechanisms, targets, and future directions [^112F3Coh]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate inhibits dopamine reuptake, inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and is a weak agonist at the serotonin receptor. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of methylphenidate in promoting recovery from DoC, and evidence from randomized controlled trials is similarly lacking. Nevertheless, methylphenidate therapy continues to be reported as a pharmacologic neurostimulant utilized off-label in clinical practice in patients with DoC. Mechanistic support for this approach comes from a study of TBI patients without DoC, in whom methylphenidate administration increased connectivity between the ventral tegmental area and posteromedial complex (i.e. posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus).

Modafinil is believed to have therapeutic effects in patients with DoC through stimulation of histamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin neurotransmitters and potential anti-oxidative effects. Neuroimaging studies found modafinil increased cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, locus coeruleus, limbic system, and insular cortex. However, observational reports of modafinil use in patients with DoC have revealed mixed results.

Paradoxical awakening after administration of GABA A receptor agonists zolpidem and benzodiazepines or the GABA B receptor agonist baclofen have been reported, leading to intense interest in identifying patients who are physiologically receptive to GABAergic therapy. Paradoxically increased conscious behaviors after zolpidem administration have been reported to occur in approximately 5% of patients with DoC. Zolpidem's preferential binding to the GABA A omega-1 receptor subtype in the globus pallidus interna may in part explain the paradoxical effectiveness of zolpidem in patients with DoC and supports the mesocirciut model. Baclofen has been theorized to promote emergence of consciousness either 1) through modulation of impulse transmission from spine to cortex, interfering with spasticity-induced proprioceptive outputs that may interfere with maintenance of alertness and awareness; or 2) through modulation of neurotransmission and functional restoration of cortico-thalamo-cortical connections.

### Effect of methylphenidate on functional controllability: a preliminary study in medication-naïve children with ADHD [^112yX4zi]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is the recommended first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While MPH's mechanism of action as a dopamine and noradrenaline transporter blocker is well known, how this translates to ADHD-related symptom mitigation is still unclear. As functional connectivity is reliably altered in ADHD, with recent literature indicating dysfunctional connectivity dynamics as well, one possible mechanism is through altering brain network dynamics. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled MPH crossover trial, 19 medication-naïve children with ADHD underwent two functional MRI scanning sessions (one on MPH and one on placebo) that included a resting state scan and two inhibitory control tasks; 27 typically developing (TD) children completed the same protocol without medication. Network control theory, which quantifies how brain activity reacts to system inputs based on underlying connectivity, was used to assess differences in average and modal functional controllability during rest and both tasks between TD children and children with ADHD (on and off MPH) and between children with ADHD on and off MPH. Children with ADHD on placebo exhibited higher average controllability and lower modal controllability of attention, reward, and somatomotor networks than TD children. Children with ADHD on MPH were statistically indistinguishable from TD children on almost all controllability metrics. These findings suggest that MPH may stabilize functional network dynamics in children with ADHD, both reducing reactivity of brain organization and making it easier to achieve brain states necessary for cognitively demanding tasks.

### The use of methylphenidate among students: the future of enhancement? [^112QikmQ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

During the past few years considerable debate has arisen within academic journals with respect to the use of smart drugs or cognitive enhancement pharmaceuticals. The following paper seeks to examine the foundations of this cognitive enhancement debate using the example of methylphenidate use among college students. The argument taken is that much of the enhancement debate rests upon inflated assumptions about the ability of such drugs to enhance and over-estimations of either the size of the current market for such drugs or the rise in popularity as drugs for enhancing cognitive abilities. This article provides an overview of the empirical evidence that methylphenidate has the ability to significantly improve cognitive abilities in healthy individuals, and examines whether the presumed uptake of the drug is either as socially significant as implied or growing to the extent that it requires urgent regulatory attention. In addition, it reviews the evidence of side-effects for the use of methylphenidate which may be an influential factor in whether an individual decides to use such drugs. The primary conclusions are that neither drug efficacy, nor the benefit-to-risk balance, nor indicators of current or growing demand provide sufficient evidence that methylphenidate is a suitable example of a cognitive enhancer with mass appeal. In light of these empirically based conclusions, the article discusses why methylphenidate might have become seen as a smart drug or cognitive enhancer.

### Methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents-assessment of adverse events in non-randomised studies [^116uVh6z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non-serious adverse events.

Objectives

To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non-randomised studies.

Search Methods

In January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included non-randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non-comparative cohort studies, patient-control studies, patient reports/series and cross-sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow-up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co-intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Fourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life-threatening or life-changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non-serious adverse events and conducted meta-analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta-analytic estimates of prevalence from non-comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient-control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non-comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low. Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention. In the non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants). Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants). With non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non-serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non-serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non-serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here. Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large-scale, high-quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non-responders.

### Reinforcement, dopamine and rodent models in drug development for ADHD [^115RNyyy]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

At therapeutic dosages, an amphetamine is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and it is also a very weak inhibitor of serotonin reuptake. At higher doses, an amphetamine also evokes the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Similarly, methylphenidate (dl-threo-methylphenidate) is a reuptake inhibitor for dopamine and norepinephrine, while it is inactive for 5-hydroxytryptamine. Both drugs are very effective in reducing the symptoms of ADHD, but the therapeutic effects require the presence of the drug and do not outlast drug exposure.

Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a nonstimulant that acts as a presynaptic blocker of norepinephrine reuptake, increasing the duration of action of norepinephrine after its release. Atomoxetine also increases dopamine concentration because the norepinephrine transporter plays an important role in clearance of dopamine in this region, but this is not so in the striatum, and therefore, the effects on dopamine are regionally selective. Thus, atomoxetine increases dopamine, as well as norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the striatum where the dopamine transporter plays the major role in clearance.

Volkow et al. showed that a standard clinical dose of 0.5 mg/kg methylphenidate blocks approximately 60% or more of the dopamine transporter. Other studies also suggest that clinically relevant doses of methylphenidate produce their therapeutic effects by increasing extracellular dopamine. Volkow et al. proposed that the therapeutic effects of methylphenidate may be "secondary to its ability to enhance stimuli-induced dopamine increases, thus making them more motivationally salient and thereby improving performance".

Human studies support suggestions that actions on reinforcement mechanisms underlie the therapeutic effects of methylphenidate. In children with ADHD, methylphenidate has been shown to raise the breakpoint (i.e. the point at which the participant elects to stop responding) on progressive ratio tasks. Methylphenidate has also been shown to reduce delay discounting (i.e. preference for small immediate delayed reinforcers in comparison with larger delayed reinforcers in children with ADHD during a real-time discounting task.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113RrqKf]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research

Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Because of the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, "nocebo tablet" controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. Such trials ought first to be conducted in adults with ADHD. We also acknowledge that investigators can directly carry out nocebo controlled trials in children and adolescents if they can argue that young people with ADHD are different from adults with the disorder.

Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to sex, age, type of ADHD, presence of co-morbidities and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large randomised trials of non-pharmacological treatments.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate use in children and adolescents may improve the symptoms of ADHD, general behaviour, and quality of life. It does not seem to cause an increased risk of serious adverse events in the short term but was associated with a relatively high risks of non-serious adverse events. These findings should be interpreted in the light of several limitations, including the lack of blinding, outcome reporting bias, heterogeneity, and the consequent very low quality of evidence for all outcomes. More long term randomised nocebo tablet (active placebo) controlled clinical trials without risks of bias are necessary to allow firm decisions on methylphenidate treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. We believe that nocebo controlled trials should be conducted first in adults with ADHD.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^1128jSRc]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate

Methylphenidate is a stimulant approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). It is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is suggested to reduce energy intake. A prospective study on 78 adults with ADHD and severe obesity (mean BMI 42 kg/m 2) who received psychostimulants, including amphetamine, methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine, showed a total body weight loss of 12% in treated participants over a mean time of 466 days of observation. A cross-over placebo-controlled trial of 14 adults (mean BMI 25.0 (4.0) kg/m 2) with ADHD, compared methylphenidate to placebo, and showed a significant reduction in fat and energy intake 1 h after the ingestion of a buffet styled lunch. In a small trial, 9 adult men with obesity and without ADHD, were randomized to receive placebo, moderate (0.5 mg/kg) or high (1 mg/kg) dose methylphenidate. There was a significant reduction in energy intake by 23% in the intervention arms, compared to placebo (p < 0.02) as measured by pizza consumption in an acute laboratory setting 1 h after ingestion of the medication. The most common side effects associated with the use of methylphenidate are headache, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, tachycardia and anorexia.

A currently ongoing 2-month phase 3 trial compares the effect of methylphenidate at a dose of 0.50 mg/kg BID (n = 20) to placebo (n = 20) in adolescents and adults aged 16–40 years with obesity, on energy intake as a primary outcome, energy expenditure and body weight as secondary outcomes. The study completion date was December 2018, but no results are available online yet.

### Editorial: on the safety of long-term methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in early childhood [^1148wTvZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often emerge before 6 years of age, and an early onset can portend a more marked and severe clinical course. Given that untreated ADHD can have a negative impact on educational attainment and social functioning, early treatment is indicated, as it might translate into better distal outcomes. For this age group, the current recommendation from clinical guidelines and ADHD experts is to administer behavioral therapy as first-line treatment. Because only limited information has been available on the possible safety implications of long-term pharmacological treatment at young ages, the use of methylphenidate is reserved for cases with impairing ADHD symptoms unresponsive to psychosocial intervention. 1.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

During the past 15 years, several reviews investigating the efficacy of methylphenidate for ADHD (with or without meta-analyses) have been published. Fifteen reviews on the efficacy of methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD have pooled the results of ADHD rating scales. These reviews have several shortcomings, as described in our introduction. Most did not assess the risk of bias of the included studies or adverse events. Moreover, none of these reviews considered the risks of random errors. Therefore, the true estimate of the treatment is not known and information about adverse events from several randomised clinical trials is missing. All of these reviews and meta-analyses reported a large effect of methylphenidate. The meta-analysis in our review showed an effect of methylphenidate on some outcomes but because we identified that almost all of the trials have a high risk of bias, we do not know the true intervention effect. We also found a large risk of outcome reporting bias in the outcomes for both serious and non-serious adverse events

A recent Cochrane systematic review evaluated the effects of methylphenidate in adults with ADHD. The effect sizes across the different assessments of symptoms were similar to those found in our analyses (standardised mean difference 0.60). The authors noted that data on adverse events were limited by the short duration of the included trials. Despite the similar effects of methylphenidate on symptoms observed in our reviews, we have judged the quality of evidence in our own review, as well as that in Epstein 2014, to be lower than that of Epstein and colleagues'.

Implications for practice

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher reported ADHD symptoms, teacher reported general behaviour, and parent reported quality of life among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects.

Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases the risk of serious adverse events.

### Effects of methylphenidate discontinuation on cerebral blood flow in prepubescent boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115g1ypW]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Methylphenidate (MPH) is an effective symptomatic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the mechanisms of its therapeutic action have not been fully elucidated. To address this issue, we assessed the effects of discontinuation of chronic MPH treatment on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in ADHD patients.

Methods

Twenty-two prepubescent boys with ADHD (age range, 8.2–11.5 y) and 7 healthy volunteers were studied with SPECT on and off MPH. Their rCBF data were automatically normalized to whole-brain counts and coregistered with standard anatomic space. rCBF changes were evaluated with statistical parametric mapping based on voxel-by-voxel ANOVA.

Results

When the subjects were not taking MPH, rCBF was higher in the motor, premotor, and the anterior cingulate cortices (Brodmann's areas 4, 6, and 32).

Conclusion

Brief discontinuation of MPH treatment is associated with increased motor and anterior cingulate cortical activity. Our findings suggest that MPH treatment modulates motor and anterior cingulate cortical activity directly or indirectly. Alternatively, our findings may be related to MPH withdrawal. These data provide novel information on the potential mechanisms of the therapeutic action of MPH. Furthermore, they are clinically relevant to the commonly occurring brief interruptions in MPH treatment.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (methylphenidate hydrochloride CD) [^1123uKXW]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolism And Excretion

In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid). The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity.

In vitro studies showed that methylphenidate was not metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, and did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at clinically observed plasma drug concentrations.

The mean terminal half-life (t½) of methylphenidate following administration of Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD (t½ = 6.8h) is longer than the mean terminal (t½) following administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets (t½ = 2.9h) and methylphenidate hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (t½ = 3.4h) in healthy adult volunteers. This suggests that the elimination process observed for Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD is controlled by the release rate of methylphenidate from the extended-release formulation, and that the drug absorption is the rate-limiting process.

Alcohol Effect

An in vitro study was conducted to explore the effect of alcohol on the release characteristics of methylphenidate from the Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD 60 mg capsule dosage form. At an alcohol concentration of 40% there was an increase in the release rate of methylphenidate in the first hour, resulting in 84% of the methylphenidate being released. The results with the 60 mg capsule are considered to be representative of the other available capsule strengths. Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD.

### Effects of a single-dose methylphenidate challenge on resting-state functional connectivity in stimulant-treatment naive children and adults with ADHD [^116RReUP]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate acts by inhibiting dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake in the brain (Cortese et al.). As the dopamine system undergoes significant alterations throughout development (Chen et al.), methylphenidate‐induced effects on functional connectivity may be modulated by age. For example, a recent longitudinal study demonstrated an age‐dependent effect of prolonged stimulant treatment‐response on cingulo‐opercular network connectivity (Norman et al.). Moreover, exposure to stimulants during sensitive stages of maturation might cause developmental alterations, a process called neuronal imprinting (Andersen). Indeed, animal studies suggest that the age at initiation of methylphenidate‐treatment affects its influence on development in a highly specific manner (Canese et al.). In the same sample as described here, we also observed that the effects of methylphenidate may be modulated by age; we found that acute methylphenidate decreased thalamic cerebral blood flow only in children, but not in adults (Schrantee et al.). Moreover, we observed that prolonged methylphenidate‐treatment followed by an acute challenge with methylphenidate significantly influenced cerebral blood flow in the striatum and thalamus in children, but not adults, nor in the placebo conditions (Schrantee et al.).

Here, we aimed to assess the effects of a single‐dose challenge of methylphenidate on resting‐state functional MRI (rs‐fMRI) network connectivity in stimulant‐treatment naïve children and adults with ADHD using graph theoretical measures, to investigate potential age‐dependent neural mechanisms involved in stimulant‐induced changes in ADHD. Based on previous findings, we expected significant methylphenidate‐induced alterations in connectivity of the striatum, thalamus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We expected that these effects would differ between children and adults because of functional maturation of the dopamine and noradrenaline system (Chen et al.). In addition, based on studies reporting altered connectivity in individuals with ADHD compared to typically developing control participants, we hypothesized that an acute dose of methylphenidate would strengthen connectivity for these four brain regions in adults, whereas in children, we expected increased connectivity in frontal regions (PFC and dACC) and decreased connectivity in the thalamus and striatum.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^116vC4sb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention or impulsivity or both, and hyperactivity, which affect children, adolescents, and adults. In some countries, methylphenidate is the first option to treat adults with moderate or severe ADHD. However, evidence on the efficacy and adverse events of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in adults is limited and controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and harms (adverse events) of IR methylphenidate for treating ADHD in adults.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight additional databases and three trial registers. We also searched internal reports on the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration websites. We checked citations of included trials to identify additional trials not captured by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with placebo or other pharmacological interventions (including extended-release formulations of methylphenidate) for ADHD in adults. Primary outcomes comprised changes in the symptoms of ADHD (efficacy) and harms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the clinical impression of severity and improvement, level of functioning, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Outcomes could have been rated by investigators or participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently on the characteristics of the trials, participants, interventions; outcomes and financial conflict of interests. We resolved disagreements by discussion or consulting a third review author. We obtained additional, unpublished information from the authors of one included trial that had reported efficacy data in a graph. We calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized MDs (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data reported on the same or different scales, respectively. We summarized dichotomous variables as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 10 trials published between 2001 and 2016 involving 497 adults with ADHD. Three trials were conducted in Europe and one in Argentina; the remaining trials did not report their location. The RCTs compared IR methylphenidate with placebo, an osmotic-release oral system (OROS) of methylphenidate (an extended-release formulation), an extended-release formulation of bupropion, lithium, and Pycnogenol® (maritime pine bark extract). Participants comprised outpatients, inpatients in addiction treatment, and adults willing to attend an intensive outpatient program for cocaine dependence. The duration of the follow-up ranged from 6 to 18 weeks. IR methylphenidate versus placebo We found very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce symptoms of ADHD when measured with investigator-rated scales (MD -20.70, 95% CI -23.97 to -17.43; 1 trial, 146 participants; end scores; Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS), scored from 0 to 54), but the evidence is uncertain. The effect of IR methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms when measured with participant-rated scales was moderate, but the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.06; I² = 69%; 2 trials, 138 participants; end scores). There is very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce the clinical impression of the severity of ADHD symptoms (MD -0.57, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.28; 2 trials, 139 participants; I² = 0%; change and end scores; Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may slightly impact the clinical impression of an improvement in symptoms of ADHD (MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.51; 1 trial, 49 participants; end scores; CGI-Improvement scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is no clear evidence of an effect on anxiety (MD -0.20, 95% CI -4.84 to 4.44; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A; scored from 0 to 56); very low-certainty evidence) or depression (MD 2.80, 95% CI -0.09 to 5.69; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D; scored from 0 to 52); very low-certainty evidence) in analyses comparing IR methylphenidate with placebo. IR methylphenidate versus lithium Compared with lithium, it is uncertain whether IR methylphenidate increases or decreases symptoms of ADHD (MD 0.60, 95% CI -3.11 to 4.31; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (scored from 0 to 198); very low-certainty evidence); anxiety (MD -0.80, 95% CI -4.49 to 2.89; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-A; very low-certainty evidence); or depression (MD -1.20, 95% CI -3.81 to 1.41, 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-D scale; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed participant-rated changes in symptoms of ADHD, or clinical impression of severity or improvement in participants treated with IR methylphenidate compared with lithium. Adverse events were poorly assessed and reported. We rated all trials at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting of harms and masking of outcome assessors (failure to blind outcome assessor to measure adverse events). Overall, four trials with 203 participants who received IR methylphenidate and 141 participants who received placebo described the occurrence of harms. The use of IR methylphenidate in these trials increased the risk of gastrointestinal complications (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.95) and loss of appetite (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.96). Cardiovascular adverse events were reported inconsistently, preventing a comprehensive analysis. One trial comparing IR methylphenidate to lithium reported five and nine adverse events, respectively. We considered four trials to have notable concerns of vested interests influencing the evidence, and authors from two trials omitted information related to the sources of funding and conflicts of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no certain evidence that IR methylphenidate compared with placebo or lithium can reduce symptoms of ADHD in adults (low- and very low-certainty evidence). Adults treated with IR methylphenidate are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and metabolic-related harms compared with placebo. Clinicians should consider whether it is appropriate to prescribe IR methylphenidate, given its limited efficacy and increased risk of harms. Future RCTs should explore the long-term efficacy and risks of IR methylphenidate, and the influence of conflicts of interest on reported effects.

### Mechanism of action of agents used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1153AoQ9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Several medications have been demonstrated effective in treating individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There appears to be some commonality in the physiologic mechanisms of action of these agents relevant to the treatment of ADHD. Either direct or indirect attenuation of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission appears related to both the stimulant and nonstimulant medications efficacious in ADHD. However, important differences exist both between and within the specific classes of agents. Elucidating the various mechanisms of action of ADHD medications may lead to better choices in matching potential response to the characteristics (e.g., genotype) of individuals.

### Cognitive mechanisms of methylphenidate in ADHD: Do improvements in sustained attention mediate behavioral improvements in the natural environment? [^116d6HgD]. Child Neuropsychology (2021). Medium credibility.

The relation between sustained attention in the laboratory and behaviors exhibited in naturalistic settings among children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) remains unclear. Additionally, research on stimulant medication effects in these areas and their association with one another remains scarce. Twenty-one children with ADHD and 21 children without ADHD completed a novel continuous performance test (CPT) involving high cognitive demands (e.g., visual search). Participants with ADHD also attended a Summer Treatment Program and received three doses of stimulant medication (placebo, low, and high). Their behavior in classroom and peer settings was observed and recorded, and they completed the CPT in each medication condition. The CPT measures of bias and sensitivity were used in analyses. Results indicated that children with ADHD had impaired overall performance and worse bias during the second half of the task compared to controls. Methylphenidate improved both naturalistic behavior and overall CPT performance but did not specifically improve the sustained attention deficit. Despite improvements in overall CPT performance, medication-related improvement in CPT performance did not mediate medication-related improvement in observed behavior in classroom or recreational settings. As such, our findings suggest that although children with ADHD do demonstrate a sustained attention deficit, salutary psychostimulant effects on CPT performance are not indicative of, or causally linked to, psychostimulant effects on presenting problems in naturalistic settings.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^117KXWLc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed mainly in children, often persist into adulthood. Adults in this group have a high rate of other psychiatric problems and functional difficulties in a number of key areas such as academic achievement, interpersonal relationships, and employment. Although the usefulness of immediate-release methylphenidate in children has been extensively studied, studies in adults, which are few, demonstrate varying results.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in November 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and two trials registers. Biosis was searched in December 2013. We inspected references of all relevant papers to identify more studies and contacted authors of recently published trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized trials comparing immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in participants aged 18 years or older with ADHD. We excluded trials conducted on subpopulations of adults with ADHD such as adults with both ADHD and substance dependence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial risk of bias. We contacted authors of trials to ask for additional and missing data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

Results from the 11 randomized controlled trials (474 participants, counting participants from cross-over studies as a single arm, and counting both arms from parallel studies) included in the review demonstrated improvement in core clinical ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and overall improvement. We were able to pool results from 10 studies, which included 466 participants. Most included studies were judged to have unclear risk of bias for most categories. However, as all studies were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled and, in general, did not contain factors that significantly decreased the quality of the body of evidence, the quality of evidence was assessed as "high" for most outcomes according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For one outcome-inattentiveness-most information came from studies at unclear risk of bias, and so the quality of evidence for this outcome was judged as "moderate". Results are given as SMD for each of the core clinical symptoms of ADHD. In all cases, participant numbers were calculated by counting participants in a single arm from cross-over studies and in both arms from parallel studies. The SMD for the outcome of hyperactivity was -0.60 (95% CI -1.11 to -0.09, 6 studies, number of participants (n) = 245, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; the SMD for impulsivity was -0.62 (95% CI -1.08 to -0.17, 5 studies, n = 207, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; and the SMD for inattentiveness was -0.66 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.30, 7 studies, n = 391, moderate-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. Moderate to extreme statistical heterogeneity was detected for all outcomes. Subgroup analysis comparing high versus low doses did not indicate that higher doses of immediate-release methylphenidate were associated with greater efficacy. For overall change, the SMD was -0.72 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.32, 9 studies, n = 455, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. The effects of immediate-release methylphenidate on anxiety and depression as parameters of general changes in mental state were equivocal. Some trials reported reduction in depression and anxiety, others detailed no change, and still others described an increase in depressive and anxious symptoms. The most common adverse effect was loss of appetite, in some cases with weight loss. Although no study reported either of these effects as problematic or severe, the included studies were of short duration; thus clinical significance could not be properly assessed. Five studies reported changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and three reported increases in heart rate. None of these results were judged to present cause for concern. No study reported clinically significant adverse effects-cardiovascular or other. Three studies did not mention adverse effects. We were unable to determine whether adverse effects were not discussed by study authors because none occurred, or because no data on adverse effects were collected.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that immediate-release methylphenidate is efficacious for treating adults with ADHD with symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and for improving their overall clinical condition. Trial data suggest that adverse effects from immediate-release methylphenidate for adults with ADHD are not of serious clinical significance, although this conclusion may be limited, certainly in the case of weight loss, by the short duration of published studies.

### The dopamine transporter antiports potassium to increase the uptake of dopamine [^1173fWAq]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Dopaminergic signaling is involved in higher-order brain functions such as movement, mood, motivation, and learning. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for the clearance of dopamine from the extracellular space and hence plays an important role in dopamine signaling intensityand in refilling stores of dopamine. DAT malfunction has been associated with parkinsonism and ADHD. In addition, DAT is the molecular target for pharmaceutical drugs such as methylphenidate, bupropion, and modafinil, and also the rewarding and addictive effects of psychostimulants are linked to their interaction with the transporter –. The compounds that target DAT are classified into inhibitors and substrates but the underlying differences in mechanisms of drug action are generally poorly understood, including the reverse transport mode induced by amphetamine. A prerequisite for investigating the mechanisms of action of the drugs is to understand the basic transport mechanism of the transporter.

### A systematic review of the potential effects of medications and drugs of abuse on dopamine transporter imaging using [I] I-FP-CIT SPECT in routine practice [^116XXHpw]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

A major mechanism of action of methylphenidate and its diastereoisomer dexmethylphenidate is blockage of DAT (Fig. 2). Indeed, one hour after a single dose of methylphenidate, approximately 60% of striatal DAT binding is blocked, as measured in 12 healthy subjects with [11 C]C-altropane PET. Additionally, Spencer et al. reported similar results of approximately 40% striatal DAT occupancy at 10 h post administration of 38 mg methylphenidate in 21 healthy volunteers. The same research group found similar effects of 45% striatal DAT occupancy after a single dose of dexmethylphenidate in 18 healthy subjects. The study by Vles et al. reported that 3 months after the initiation of methylphenidate treatment in 6 children, a reduction of 58% in striatal [123 I]I-FP-CIT binding was observed. Crunelle et al. showed that 30 mg methylphenidate reduced [123 I]I-FP-CIT binding in the caudate nucleus with 44% in ADHD patients (n = 16) and 37% in ADHD patients (n = 8) with comorbid cocaine dependence. This is in line with the 52% DAT reductions at the left and right caudate nucleus after 3 weeks of methylphenidate treatment in the [99m Tc]Tc-TRODAT-1 study of Szobot and colleagues. Interestingly, more recent studies have also shown similar results. The use of methylphenidate was associated with a 30% decrease in striatal [123 I]I-ß-CIT binding in 13 ADHD patients. Only 2.5 h after oral intake of 30 mg methylphenidate, the striatal binding of [123 I]I-FP-CIT was reduced by 43% in 13 patients with traumatic brain injury. Akay and co-workers found that 2 months of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg/day) treatment in 20 adolescents with ADHD resulted in 7% and 9% reductions in [99m Tc]Tc-TRODAT-1 binding in the right caudate nucleus and right putamen, respectively. Two different case reports were published that showed false-positive results on visual reads of [123 I]I-FP-CIT scans, likely due to methylphenidate use. Therefore, methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are also listed in Table 2.

### Sex differences in methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases in ventral striatum [^113sNJdt]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results differ from the three prior PET studies that found no consistent sex differences in dopamine release when administering amphetamine. Two of these studies used [18 F]fallypride whereas one of them, like our study, used [11 C]raclopride and since these two radiotracers differ in their sensitivity to striatal and extra striatal dopamine this could have contributed to the differences across studies. More importantly, prior studies used amphetamine, whereas we used methylphenidate, and the differences in their mechanism of action could account for the discrepancies. Methylphenidate's primary mechanism of action is to block dopamine transporters, whereas amphetamine directly releases dopamine from cell vescicles via deacidification into the synaptic cleft via reverse transport through dopamine transporters. Therefore, amphetamine increases synaptic dopamine independent of cell firing, whereas methylphenidate increases synaptic dopamine to a degree that depends on action potential firing rate to elicit vesicular release. Since VTA dopamine neuronal firing is highest when levels of circulating estrogen peak these fluctuations would have affected the effects of methylphenidate more than those of amphetamine. Further, since estrogen modulates the reactivity of VTA dopamine neurons to drug rewards the time during the menstrual cycle at which the PET measures were obtained could have also contributed to the discrepancies between the studies. The [18 F]fallypride study that did not observe consistent sex differences included 39 females of whom 18 were on hormonal birth control, 10 were postmenopausal and 11 were studied during the luteal phase and the other included only six young women but the time of the menstrual cycle was not specified. The [11 C]raclopride study that reported greater increases in males than females included 15 young women, six of whom were studied in the luteal phase and nine in the follicular phase. While Munro and colleagues did not see differences in amphetamine-induced dopamine increases between women studied during the luteal and the follicular phase, D 2/3 receptor baseline availability was lower for women in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (though this association with baseline receptor availability was not observed more recently in a larger cohort:). Nevertheless, since this appears to be the first study to explicitly examine sex differences in dopamine release to a methylphenidate challenge, the current findings warrant replication.

### Methylphenidate stabilizes dynamic brain network organization during tasks probing attention and reward processing in stimulant-naïve children with ADHD [^117Woppz]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

There are important differences between our experiment and real-world psychostimulant use that should be considered. Although it is remarkable to observe MPH effects on brain network dynamics and behavior from a single dose of MPH, chronic psychostimulant use has also been shown to have long-lasting impacts on brain function. Therefore, it appears that both acute mechanistic effects and chronic changes associated with psychostimulant use are important for understanding treatment response in children with ADHD. It is also important to note that the task paradigms used here are quite different from the complex attention demanding tasks that children with ADHD encounter on a daily basis in their natural environment, as evidenced by more recent literature suggesting that attention-based paradigms, in isolation, should not be used as a diagnostic tool for assessing ADHD. However, task paradigms provide insight into different processes, and by isolating specific processes, such as lapses in attention or reward responsivity, we demonstrate how acute MPH effects change those behaviors and highlight how a change in brain network dynamics is linked to changes in behavior. We believe these findings offer novel insights into understanding MPH response and build toward more targeted medication treatment for children with ADHD.

### Clinical response to a single-dose methylphenidate challenge is indicative of treatment response at two months in adults with ADHD [^114FBLZM]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by developmentally inappropriate inattentive and/or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, and is one of the most common neurodevelopmental conditions. Prevalence ranges between 2–7% in childhood, and impairing symptoms persist in up to 75% of adults with childhood ADHD. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamines, represent the first line pharmacological option. Stimulants ameliorate ADHD symptoms and associated cognitive deficits by modulating dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission in cortico-striatal brain networks, which promotes engagement of task-related brain networks, reduces interference from the default mode network, and increases perceived saliency. Fronto-striatal pathways have been the most investigated in ADHD. These are GABA-glutamatergic circuits modulated by dopamine and contribute to cognitive, motor, and affective regulation by connecting the cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia and thalamus, which then projects back to the cortex. These circuits contribute to executive functions and affect regulation, which are often affected in ADHD. Additionally, ADHD has been associated with noradrenergic pathways dysfunction. These originate from the locus coeruleus (LC), which is in the brainstem and is reciprocally connected with cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. The balance between tonic and phasic noradrenaline release in the prefrontal cortex is crucial for optimal cognitive performance. Conversely, both excessive and insufficient stimulation negatively impacts on prefrontal functions and has been implicated in ADHD. By acting on catecholamine transporters, stimulants enhance endogenous dopaminergic stimulation and noradrenaline-dependent activation of post-synaptic receptors. Thus, they optimize prefrontal function by respectively reducing 'noise' and enhancing 'signal' within glutamatergic circuits, enabling effective 'top-down' regulation of response inhibition, attention, and motivation. Prescription rates of stimulants have been increasing in recent years, especially in adults. Data from the Massachusetts Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) showed that stimulant prescriptions increased 70% from 2011–2021, with a tree-time increase in adults aged 35–44 years. Similarly, the UK NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) reported that prescription rates in 2022–23 increased by 32% in adults and 12% in children as compared to the previous year and that, as a result, stimulants were among the most prescribed psychopharmacological treatments. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have clearly demonstrated superiority, at a group level, of both MPH and amphetamines over placebo across the lifespan. However, individual response varies, and this may negatively impact on outcomes, from educational attainment and occupation rates to substance misuse and legal offences. There is no current evidence to guide decision on which type of medication may be most beneficial for a specific individual. Indeed, in clinical practice, the most effective and best tolerated medication is selected using a trial-and-error approach, which may delay recovery and is not cost-effective. Therefore, there have been increasing efforts to identify pre-treatment characteristics associated with stimulant treatment response.

### A positron emission tomography study of nigro-striatal dopaminergic mechanisms underlying attention: implications for ADHD and its treatment [^113fZ2gF]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that the inverse relationship in dopamine release between substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum but not associative striatum or sensorimotor striatum following methylphenidate reflects the asymmetrical nigro-striatal projection pattern. Ventral striatum is the only striatal region whose dopamine input is unaffected by non-reciprocal connections, its dopaminergic input thus being regulated to a greater extent by synthesis- and release-regulating midbrain dopamine autoreceptors. The observed inverse correlation may thus reflect the inhibitory influences exerted by midbrain dopamine neurons to regulate dopamine levels in ventral striatum. This inverse relationship did not hold for associative striatum and sensorimotor striatum, which can be explained by the fact that, via the aforementioned feed–forward spiralling connections, associative striatum receives additional inhibitory influences from ventral striatum and sensorimotor striatum from both ventral striatum and associative striatum. These findings possibly constitute the first direct evidence in humans supporting the notion that the doses used clinically to treat ADHD exert their therapeutic actions through presynaptic mechanisms. A key finding of this study is that midbrain dopamine autoreceptor regulation was reduced in low performers, as evidenced by the significantly smaller methylphenidate-induced increases in midbrain dopamine levels observed in low compared to high performers (Fig. 12 C).

How are the changes in midbrain dopamine receptor availability related to the attention-enhancing effects of methylphenidate, whether in patients with ADHD or healthy control subjects? A plausible explanation is provided by the classical model of catecholamine neurotransmission regulation and psychostimulant action postulated by Grace. According to this model, the amplitude of the phasic dopamine response is dynamically regulated by the influence of corticostriatal activity through the modulation of tonic dopamine levels. Low tonic dopamine activity is associated with abnormally high phasic dopamine responses, resulting in distractibility and impaired attention. Stimulants enhance tonic catecholamine levels, thereby increasing postsynaptic catecholamine receptor stimulation but also triggering negative feedback mechanisms through stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors. As a result, dopamine synthesis is reduced, dopamine neuron firing inhibited and subsequent phasic (spike-dependent) transmitter release reduced.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114iYbVF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder — methylphenidate formulations recommendations state that for patients with ATS use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing a long-acting MPH formulation to promote reduced use of ATS (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians can give long-acting MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with moderate or higher frequency of ATS use at treatment start (ie, 10 or more days per month; Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians can give long-acting MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with co-occurring ADHD, as these medications can also reduce ADHD symptoms (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). When prescribing a long-acting MPH formulation, clinicians can consider dosing at or above the maximum dose approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD to effectively reduce ATS use (Low certainty, Weak Recommendation).

### Risk of hospitalisation for first-onset psychosis or mania within a year of ADHD medication initiation in adults with ADHD [^111zwrJX]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

The precise mechanism by which methylphenidate exerts its therapeutic effect remains unknown but is generally believed to be associated with inhibition of dopamine reuptake, thus correcting the presumed dopamine deficit in the synapse and thereby improving reinforcement responses. In addition to dopamine reuptake inhibition, amphetamine stimulates dopamine release, resulting in up to four times more dopamine release. Since stimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine raise the level of dopamine in key monoaminergic synapses, their use can result in psychosis or mania in predisposed individuals. Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant and has been a second- or third-line drug for ADHD in adults. Among adults in Iceland, its use has especially been aimed at those who have a recent history of active addiction. It is a potent inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter but, in contrast to the stimulants, has no direct pharmacological effects on dopaminergic receptors. Treatment with atomoxetine can also result in psychotic or manic symptoms. A study from the USA that assessed the risk of psychosis in youths aged 13–25 who received treatment with stimulants for ADHD found that the risk of psychosis was 0.10% for methylphenidate and 0.21% for amphetamines. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that the risk of psychosis and mania is increased on amphetamines with a dose–response relationship, the OR being over five for psychosis or mania for those on high doses compared with controls. A Canadian case-crossover study found that stimulant initiation in adults aged under 25 with ADHD was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation due to psychosis or mania within 60 days of prescription. One-third of those individuals were represcribed stimulants after discharge, and of these, 45% were readmitted at a median of 18 days in due course. A large nationwide population-based study in Taiwan found that methylphenidate use increased the risk of developing any psychotic disorder among individuals with ADHD. Not all studies have, though, found such an effect on the risk of psychosis among young people with ADHD. It must also be noted in this context that longitudinal studies have indicated that a childhood diagnosis of ADHD is a risk factor for a diagnosis of psychosis in adult life.

### Pharmacotherapy for stimulant-related disorders [^112Wfg2q]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Stimulant-related disorders (SRD) continue to be an important public health problem for which there are presently no approved pharmacotherapies. Although behavioral interventions provide some benefit response varies. The development of novel and effective pharmacotherapies continues to be a research priority. Understanding neural mechanisms critical to the action of stimulants has helped reveal several potential pharmacotherapies that have already shown promise in controlled clinical trials. Common to some of these medications is the ability to reverse neural deficits in individuals with SRD. Results from thoroughly conducted clinical trials continue to broaden our knowledge increasing the possibility of soon developing effective pharmacotherapies for SRD.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release [^115XzVcK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elimination

The systemic clearance is 0.40 ± 0.12 L/h/kg for d-methylphenidate and 0.73 ± 0.28 L/h/kg for l-methylphenidate.

Metabolism

Methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid), which has little or no pharmacologic activity.

Excretion

After oral administration, 78% to 97% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 1% to 3% in feces in the form of metabolites within 48 to 96 hours. Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as alpha-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid (60% to 86%). The cumulative urinary excretion of alpha-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid are not significantly different for Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

Studies in Specific Populations

Male and Female Patients

In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations of Methylphenidate hydrochloride's major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender differences were observed for Methylphenidate hydrochloride plasma concentration in the same subjects.

Racial or Ethnic Groups

There is insufficient experience with the use of Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics.

Patients with Renal Impairment

Methylphenidate hydrochloride has not been studied in renally-impaired patients. Renal impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since less than 1% of a radiolabeled dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged compound, and the major metabolite (ritalinic acid), has little or no pharmacologic activity.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Methylphenidate hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since it is metabolized primarily to ritalinic acid by nonmicrosomal hydrolytic esterases that are widely distributed throughout the body.

### Psychosis with use of amphetamine drugs, methylphenidate and atomoxetine in adolescent and adults [^111J9uM8]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

One of the leading hypotheses for schizophrenia and psychotic disorder is based on dysfunction of dopamine neurotransmission. At synaptic level, this dysfunction would be mainly presynaptic, which would affect the capacity of dopaminergic synthesis, causing an increase in intrasynaptic dopamine concentrations. This dysfunction could be more severe in mesolimbic area and hyperactivity of the dopamine pathway hypothetically accounts for positive psychotic symptoms.

Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis and with the pharmacodynamic properties of psychostimulants and their modulation of the dopaminergic system. Methylphenidate and amphetamines are structurally related and have similar effects on the central nervous system. Both block dopamine active transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), stopping the reuptake of dopamine via DAT and norepinephrine via NET. The crucial pharmacodynamical difference between these medications is that methylphenidate binds NET and DAT at sites distinct from where monoamines bind NET and DAT allosterically. Inhibition of monoamine reuptake enhances dopamine and norepinephrine release and increases concentrations of synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine.

This pharmacovigilance study supports a consistent literature of clinical cases that first alerted practitioners to this potential adverse effect of psychostimulants. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the literature has shown controversial findings about the potential link between methylphenidate, psychostimulants and the development of psychotic symptoms. In a recent study, Hollis et al used population-based observational data from three population-based registers containing data on all individuals in Sweden to identify individuals receiving methylphenidate treatment. Then Hollis et al used a within-individual design to compare the incidence of psychotic events in these individuals during the 12-week periods immediately before and after methylphenidate initiation to identify the emergence of psychotic symptoms. In this study, they found no evidence that initiation of methylphenidate treatment increases the risk of psychotic events in adolescents and young adults.

### The effects of methylphenidate on neural systems of attention in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114sRfhP]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent studies have suggested that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with abnormalities in basal ganglia and prefrontal cortical functioning. However, these studies have primarily relied upon cognitive tasks that reflect impulse control rather than attentional mechanisms.

Method

The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of selective and divided attention in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacological challenge with methylphenidate in 15 adolescents with ADHD (ages 14–17), eight adolescents with reading disorder (ages 12–17), and four adolescents with both reading disorder and ADHD (ages 14–18) who were scanned during both a methylphenidate and a placebo session. Fourteen healthy comparison subjects (ages 12–20) who were not given methylphenidate served as the primary comparison group.

Results

During the divided attention task, unmedicated subjects with ADHD or reading disorder recruited the left ventral basal ganglia significantly less than the healthy comparison subjects. Methylphenidate led to an increase in activation in this region but had no effect on task performance. Subjects with ADHD also recruited the middle temporal gyrus significantly less than the comparison subjects, but methylphenidate did not have a direct effect on activation in this region.

Conclusions

These results suggest that ADHD is associated with abnormal processing in attentional networks, with specific dysfunction in striatal circuitry. Methylphenidate may act to normalize activity within this network.

### A positron emission tomography study of nigro-striatal dopaminergic mechanisms underlying attention: implications for ADHD and its treatment [^1163o6eh]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present findings query the precise role of dopamine in the pathophysiology in adult ADHD. Although our findings are consistent with the modulation of attention by nigro-striatal dopamine and with poor attention being a key deficit in the clinical profile of ADHD, our data also suggest that dopamine dysregulation per se is unlikely to be the primary cause underlying ADHD pathology in adults. This conclusion is reinforced by evidence of structural brain changes in the same set of patients with adult ADHD.

We also conclude that a more precise explanation of the behavioural effects of psychostimulant treatment in both patients with ADHD and healthy control subjects can be derived from the combination of (i) dose and time course of methylphenidate actions; (ii) level of responsivity of the dopamine system determined by tonic dopamine levels; and (iii) baseline level of performance, possibly reflecting basal dopamine function in the striatum. The findings of reduced methylphenidate-induced midbrain dopamine increases and improved sustained attention in low performers (mostly patients with ADHD) implicate a hitherto neglected role of midbrain dopamine in the mediation of therapeutic effects of methylphenidate.

We have shown the considerable potential of combining the complementary strengths of structural MRI and neuroreceptor PET imaging in identifying and characterizing cognitive endophenotypes of ADHD, which may help our understanding of the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of ADHD.

Research has continued to suggest that osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate lessens ADHD symptoms throughout the day and has greater adherence, thought to be associated with the convenience of once-daily dosing. Dexmethylphenidate extended-release (XR) and transdermal methylphenidate also offer this benefit. Dexmethylphenidate comes in capsules that can be opened and mixed with food, and has the earliest onset of efficacy of the long-acting preparations. Transdermal methylphenidate bypasses the oral route entirely, and in short-term studies is associated with efficacy throughout the day, with improved family quality of life, and when carefully titrated, little effect on sleep. Greater absorption of medication occurs when the patch is applied to the buttocks rather than to the subscapular area.

Comorbid anxiety was not found to affect stimulant efficacy in a recent study, and some studies suggest that treatment with stimulants can help to lessen the likelihood of other psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence, including cigarette use and substance abuse. However, meta-analyses of stimulants and other ADHD medications in the treatment of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders concluded that supratherapeutic doses of dextroamphetamine should be avoided in this population. These studies also indicated that methylphenidate gave the best control for ADHD and that α-2-agonists produced the best improvement in both tics and ADHD.

The commonest side-effects of stimulants (decreased appetite, trouble with sleep onset) have also continued to receive recent research interest. Some research suggests that it is difficult to predict which children with ADHD will have adverse effects, based upon demographic and clinical characteristics. Although rare, serious cardiovascular side-effects have been identified with stimulant use; however, the common effects on blood pressure, heart rate and exercise parameters are usually of no clinical significance. Consensus has been reached in the USA, Canada and Europe that routine electrocardiography screening and/or cardiology investigations are needed before starting stimulant use only in those with a positive family or personal cardiac history. Likewise, no cytogenetic side-effects from stimulant use have been reported. However, a recent review article has shown that treatment with stimulants in childhood modestly reduced expected height and weight. These effects were dose-dependent and attenuated over time. The general consensus on cardiovascular side-effects at this point is that the short/medium term side-effects are usually of no clinical significance, but the long-term potential side-effects are less certain.

### Wake-promoting pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders [^112SMkLH]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Medications promoting wakefulness are currently used in psychopharmacology in different contexts and with different objectives. In particular, they may be used for the treatment of syndromes that primarily show significant impairment in alertness/wakefulness (e.g., excessive sleepiness and other sleep disorders) as well as for the symptomatic treatment of different neuropsychiatric disorders that, in turn, are not exclusively characterized by sleep-wake disturbances (like mood disorders, for instance). In addition, several psychotropic compounds, including some antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and anxiolytics have well-established sedating side effects that may go beyond the therapeutic target and require the symptomatic use of wake-promoting agents. Even though such a clinical scenario reflects millions of individuals affected (alterations of wakefulness have a prevalence rate of 20–43% in the general population), relatively few pharmacotherapies are available, mainly including compounds with psychostimulating effects, such as methylphenidate, modafinil, and armodafinil and some amphetaminic agents. In light of their side effects and potential for abuse, such compounds have received FDA approval only for a limited number of psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, their clinical application has recently become more widespread, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy, treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, shift work sleep disorder, schizophrenia, and addictions. Wake-promoting agents have different mechanisms of action, peculiar clinical strengths and specific limitations, with novel drugs in the field under extensive investigation. The present review is aimed to provide an updated overview of the aforementioned compounds as well as investigational drugs in the field, in terms of mechanism of action, indications and use in clinical practice.

### In utero exposure to methylphenidate, amphetamines and atomoxetine and offspring neurodevelopmental disorders-a population-based cohort study and meta-analysis [^112yXLGT]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), affecting individuals across their lifespan. With the increasing prescription rate of ADHD medications among women of reproductive age, there has been a concurrent rise in the use of these medications during pregnancy. Estimates suggest that up to 0.8% of pregnant women in the Nordic countries and over 1% of pregnant women in the United States are currently prescribed ADHD medications, making these among the most commonly used medications during pregnancy. Despite their widespread use, there is still insufficient replicated empirical evidence concerning the long-term safety of in utero exposure to ADHD medications, leading many expectant mothers to discontinue use due to concerns about potential harm to the unborn child.

Several studies have focused on short-term outcomes of in utero exposure to ADHD medications in offspring, including congenital malformations and adverse outcomes related to labour and delivery. However, long-term outcomes in the offspring have received less attention. A recent study from our group, conducted using Danish national registers, provided initial insights by investigating long-term neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes in children exposed to ADHD medication in utero. The findings indicated no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) among exposed offspring, and this finding was later replicated in a large US study using data from publicly and commercially insured pregnant women. The US study, however, included only stimulants, amphetamine/dexamfetamine and methylphenidate, whereas the Danish study also included non-stimulants (i.e. atomoxetine and clonidine), but unfortunately lacked the power to stratify the analyses by specific medication types. This distinction between medication types is crucial, as the medications operate through different mechanisms of action, potentially leading to diverse effects on foetal neurodevelopment.

### Integrative proteomics and pharmacogenomics analysis of methylphenidate treatment response [^114i3XBc]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

In general, our exploratory study unraveled several pathways from different biological processes that are modulated by MPH treatment in rats. Importantly, the findings involving processes related to synaptic neurotransmission were extended to humans for MPH treatment response. The overall evidence from previous experimental studies combined with our findings suggests that MPH response involves a complex interaction of neurotransmitter systems that go beyond the widely acknowledged dopamine and norepinephrine, especially related to GABA transmission. This translational perspective, that integrates proteomics and pharmacogenomics, can shed light on the molecular signatures of MPH and the possible biological sources of treatment response variability.

### Innovative mechanisms of action for pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement: a systematic review [^1161BcNh]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological cognitive enhancement refers to improvement in cognitive functions after drug use in healthy individuals. This popular topic attracts attention both from the general public and the scientific community. The objective was to explore innovative mechanisms of psychostimulant's action, whose potential effectiveness was assessed in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic review was carried out, using the words "attention", "memory", "learning", "executive functions", and "vigilance/wakefulness" combined to "cognitive enhancer" or "smart drug". Methylphenidate, amphetamines, modafinil, nicotine, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and antidepressants were extensively studied in previous meta-analyses and were not included in the present work. Drugs were classified according to their primary mode of action, namely catecholaminergic drugs (tolcapone, pramipexole, guanfacine), cholinergic drugs (anticholinergics), glutamatergic drugs (ampakines), histaminergic drugs, and non-specified (glucocorticoids). Overall, 50 RCTs were included in the present review. In conclusion, a number of new active drugs were found to improve some cognitive functions, in particular verbal episodic memory. However the number of RCTs was limited, and most of the studies found negative results. Future studies should assess both effectiveness and tolerance of repeated doses administration, and individual variability in dose response (including baseline characteristics and potential genetic polymorphisms). One explanation for the limited number of recent RCTs with new psychostimulants seems to be the ethical debate surrounding pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement in healthy subjects.

### Overlapping and differential neuropharmacological mechanisms of stimulants and nonstimulants for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a comparative neuroimaging analysis [^117V6zu9]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by problems of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (Battle,), which approximately affect 84.7 million individuals worldwide (Collaborators). Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate, are widely prescribed to ameliorate ADHD symptoms, at least in improving attention span and reducing distractibility (Janssen et al.). These medications work by increasing levels of specific neurotransmitters in the brain, especially dopamine and norepinephrine. For individuals who respond poorly to stimulants, nonstimulant alternatives may be considered, including norepinephrine modulators like atomoxetine and certain antidepressants such as bupropion. (Mechler, Banaschewski, Hohmann, & Häge). However, individualized management for ADHD cases in clinical settings is still hard to achieve due to the elusive neuropsychological mechanisms of first-line medications. At the same time, the factors of age and sex also complicate individual medication selection as they influence the effectiveness of medication treatment (Childress, Newcorn, & Cutler; Dafny & Yang; Wigal, Kollins, Childress, & Adeyi).

From a neurobiological perspective, psychostimulants exert their therapeutic effects as indirect catecholamine agonists by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), and atomoxetine, the most commonly used nonstimulant for ADHD treatment, is a selective NET inhibitor. Through their common neuropsychological actions and partially overlapping pharmacological targets, both psychostimulants and nonstimulants may mitigate the dysfunctional inhibition and execution processing deficits seen in ADHD (Gilbert et al.). Finding similarities of mechanisms between of stimulants and nonstimulants in clinical application may enhance the understanding of their biochemistry pathways and lead to the development of targeted medications. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found that treatment with methylphenidate and atomoxetine produces clinical improvement for ADHD via both common and divergent neurophysiologic actions in frontoparietal regions. Given that youth with ADHD may have a preferential or atypical response to either stimulants or nonstimulants based on their dissociable therapeutic targets (Elliott et al; Schulz et al.), it is reasonable that approximately 56% of ADHD cases may achieve clinical improvement with stimulants, while 45% of cases achieve so with non-stimulants (Mechler et al; Newcorn et al.).

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^112ZLrM5]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated childhood psychiatric disorders, with a prevalence of 3.4%. It is increasingly seen as a developmental disorder, which has high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is made through recognition of excessive inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children before 12 years of age, which impairs their functioning or development.

Methylphenidate has been used for the treatment of ADHD for over 50 years and is now globally the most common drug treatment for the disorder. Despite the widespread use of methylphenidate no comprehensive systematic review has been done of both benefits and harms. Fifteen reviews of the effect of methylphenidate on the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents have been published. None of them were conducted using Cochrane methodology and none prepublished a peer reviewed protocol. Thirteen did not undertake subgroup analyses on comorbidity influencing treatment effectsnor did they control for the treatment effect on subtypes of ADHD. Ten did not consider dosage. Seven meta-analyses combined outcome data across raters and observersand eight did not separate outcomes for inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity. Nine failed to present spontaneous adverse eventsand 14 did not report adverse events measured by rating scales. Eleven reviewsdid not follow 'gold standard' guidelines — that is, the Cochrane Handbook or the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Risk of random errors, risk of bias, and trial quality were not systematically assessed in 11 reviews. Language bias (exclusion of non-English publications) was present in four reviews, and narrow or unreported search strategies in four reviewsmay have compromised data collection and, ultimately the meta-analyses.

To avoid these flaws we conducted a systematic review of the benefits and harms of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD using the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. This article presents the results of a systematic review focusing on the benefits and harms of methylphenidate in randomised clinical trials. A second systematic review will focus on harms in non-randomised studies.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116ZHTCW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

Can I use doses of psychostimulants beyond the maximum licensed or recommended ones?

The maximum recommended doses of psychostimulants (which act by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine and, for amphetamines, inducing their release) for the treatment of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in guidelines or formularies may be higher than the maximum licensed doses by regulatory agencies such the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Agency. More specifically, the maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children (except for osmotic release and prolonged release formulations, see below) is 60 mg/day, while the British National formulary (BNF) recommends a dose of up to 90 mg/day, under the direction of a specialist. For osmotic-release (Concerta® XL, Janseen Cilag, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK) and prolonged-release (e.g. Xaggitin® XL, Ethypharm, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK and Delmosart® prolonged-release tablet, Accord UK Ltd, Barnstaple, Devon, UK) formulations of methylphenidate, the maximum license dose is 54 mg/day, but the BNF mentions a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta® XL, in line with other clinical guidelines, for example, those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (caddra.ca). For lisdexamfetamine, both the maximum licensed and the BNF recommended dose is 70 mg/day.

Many prescribers will use doses above the maximum licensed ones. Some of them will also use doses beyond the maximum recommended in guidelines/formularies. Currently, there is no solid, meta-analytic evidence to inform if, and to what extent, doses beyond the recommended ones are safe and bring additional efficacy/effectiveness. Some experts agree that, while it should not be a standard, routine practice, using doses beyond the maximum recommended ones could be considered when the patient has presented with a partial response, there is only some degree of improvement at the maximum recommended dose, tolerability is good, and the aim is to optimise the response. This could be considered particularly in patients with overweight when a partial response was obtained at the licensed dose. If doses beyond those recommended are used, a careful monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, height and weight should be implemented.

### Methylphenidate treatment [^112T18AL]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate is the psychotropic drug most commonly used to treat individuals suffering from developmental attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Additional attention deficit is part of numerous neurologic diseases in childhood. Despite the vast extent of scientific research on methylphenidate, the use of this stimulant in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in children with epilepsy, brain tumor, leukemia, closed brain injury, encephalitis, meningitis, or mental retardation continues to be controversial. Only few data exist about the efficacy and side effects of methylphenidate treatment in children with this neurologic illness or history. The aim of the present study is to provide a review of this important clinical topic and perhaps to stimulate further controlled investigations.
