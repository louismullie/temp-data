## Question

How do you treat bursitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying bursitis by etiology and location. Then, I should verify the universal conservative foundation. Next, I will examine site-specific nuances for olecranon, trochanteric, prepatellar, retrocalcaneal, and subacromial bursitis. After that, I need to check the role of corticosteroid injections, including guidance and dosing. Finally, I will consider surgical options, special populations, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and correcting any overstatements I might make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because treatment hinges on distinguishing aseptic from septic bursitis and on the anatomic location. Aseptic bursitis is typically inflammatory or microtraumatic, whereas septic bursitis is infectious and most often due to Staphylococcus aureus; clinically, septic bursitis more often shows erythema, warmth, tenderness, and systemic features, but overlap is substantial, so I should not rely on exam alone to exclude infection [^112EJvpa] [^113XnmfY]. I also need to remember that many "bursitis" syndromes, especially trochanteric, reflect broader entities like greater trochanteric pain syndrome with gluteal tendinopathy rather than true bursal inflammation, which changes management priorities [^1176CjXJ] [^1116VEYT].

> Next, I should review the universal conservative foundation that applies across sites. Rest and activity modification to offload the bursa, ice, elevation, and NSAIDs are first-line for aseptic bursitis; I need to ensure NSAID use follows the principle of lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and account for contraindications, and I should remember that opioids are not first-line for musculoskeletal pain like bursitis when nonopioid options are appropriate [^112EJvpa] [^116pZRYv] [^1122rTTF]. Hold on, I should verify whether guidelines universally endorse NSAIDs for aseptic olecranon bursitis; ACOEM gives no recommendation for NSAIDs in aseptic olecranon bursitis, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize and tailor NSAID use to patient risk and site-specific context [^1116PzVn].

> Now, let me consider olecranon bursitis specifically. For nonseptic cases, compression with padding, NSAIDs, and avoidance of direct pressure are standard, and I should avoid routine aspiration because of iatrogenic infection risk; if I do aspirate, it should be for diagnostic uncertainty or for symptomatic relief, and I should weigh the risk of chronic drainage or fistula [^112EJvpa] [^116mKaCA]. Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroid injection; a randomized trial showed no difference in resolution by 4 weeks among compression plus NSAIDs, aspiration alone, or aspiration plus steroid, though steroid hastened symptom resolution, and more recent reviews caution against routine injection due to complications, so I should reserve intrabursal steroids for refractory cases after shared decision-making [^116LWq3d] [^116mKaCA]. For suspected septic olecranon bursitis, I initially thought aspiration was mandatory, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; multiple ED cohorts suggest that carefully selected patients can be managed with empiric oral antibiotics without aspiration, with high rates of uncomplicated resolution, provided they are immunocompetent, have reliable follow-up, and are low risk for complications; I should still individualize and escalate to aspiration or surgical drainage if they fail to improve [^113Whfyu] [^113sGu7w] [^112qd9GH].

> Turning to greater trochanteric pain syndrome, I need to emphasize that most cases are not true bursitis and that gluteal tendinopathy and abductor weakness are central. Therefore, first-line management is education and progressive hip abductor strengthening, with NSAIDs as adjuncts for pain control; corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief but should not replace rehabilitation, and I should minimize steroid exposure in older adults or those with metabolic risk [^116DmMVj] [^116t3iWG]. Let me double-check the injection evidence; a multicenter RCT found fluoroscopically guided injections were not superior to palpation-guided injections at 1 month, and systematic reviews show short-term benefit from corticosteroids but no long-term advantage over exercise-based care, reinforcing that injections are optional and best paired with therapy [^112befHJ] [^113NmGFa]. If symptoms persist beyond 3–6 months despite conservative care, I should consider ultrasound-guided injection or PRP, acknowledging that PRP evidence is mixed and evolving, and reserve surgery for refractory cases with documented abductor pathology [^116jpGFz] [^116zi645].

> For prepatellar bursitis, I should confirm that the approach mirrors superficial bursitis principles: activity modification to avoid kneeling, ice, NSAIDs, and compression with padding are first-line. Aspiration is reasonable for large, tense effusions or diagnostic uncertainty, and corticosteroid injection may be considered in nonseptic, refractory cases, balancing infection risk and recurrence [^112EJvpa] [^113ZcVJG]. Hold on, I should verify that the evidence base is weaker here; indeed, much of the guidance is consensus-driven, so I will individualize and ensure close follow-up if I proceed with injection [^113ZcVJG].

> For retrocalcaneal bursitis, I need to ensure I do not inject the Achilles tendon. Shoe modification to remove heel counter pressure, NSAIDs, and physical therapy focused on eccentric loading are foundational, and if injection is used, it should be ultrasound-guided into the bursa, not the tendon, to mitigate rupture risk. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases with Haglund deformity or persistent symptoms despite exhaustive conservative care [^111xiSST] [^111F1ZeU]. Let me reconsider the strength of injection evidence; it is largely based on feasibility and case series, so I should counsel patients about uncertain benefit and potential complications before proceeding [^111F1ZeU].

> For subacromial bursitis within the broader context of subacromial pain, I should confirm that corticosteroid injection provides short-term pain relief and that combining injection with supervised physical therapy yields better mid-term outcomes. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy but has not consistently improved patient-relevant outcomes over landmark-guided injection, so I should balance access, cost, and expertise when choosing guidance [^1178fSjd] [^1167AWgC]. But wait, what if the pain is primarily tendinopathy rather than bursitis; I should still anchor treatment in load management and rotator cuff strengthening, using injection as an adjunct for pain flares rather than monotherapy [^1178fSjd].

> Next, I should review injection technique and dosing to minimize risk. For olecranon and other superficial bursae, a low-dose corticosteroid such as methylprednisolone acetate 20 mg is reasonable when indicated; for shoulders, 20 mg triamcinolone or equivalent is effective and higher doses are not clearly superior; I should always use sterile technique, consider image guidance for deep or anatomically complex targets, and avoid injecting through or into tendons, particularly the Achilles [^112mrmVL] [^1178fSjd] [^111F1ZeU]. Hold on, I should verify that multiple injections carry cumulative risk; yes, repeated local steroids can impair tissue integrity, so I will limit injections to the lowest effective number and interval [^114WQg7M].

> I will now examine surgical options for refractory cases. For chronic or recurrent olecranon bursitis, bursectomy is traditional but has notable complication rates; emerging options like hydrothermal ablation show promising early results with fewer complications, though I should acknowledge limited follow-up and availability [^116gLLd4]. For trochanteric pain syndrome refractory to conservative care, endoscopic bursectomy with iliotibial band release can be effective, and for retrocalcaneal bursitis with Haglund deformity, calcaneal prominence resection with bursa excision is standard when nonoperative care fails [^115A99B4] [^111xiSST]. I need to ensure patients have exhausted at least 3–6 months of conservative therapy before discussing surgery and that expectations are aligned with recovery timelines [^114udJjH].

> Special populations require extra caution. In older adults, I should minimize corticosteroid exposure due to systemic risks and prioritize strengthening and load modification. In patients with diabetes, immunocompromise, or those on systemic steroids, I should have a lower threshold to evaluate for infection and avoid elective injections. In children, bursitis is uncommon and management should be conservative, with specialist input if infection is suspected [^116DmMVj] [^112EJvpa]. For patients with inflammatory arthritis, I should treat the underlying disease and consider image-guided injections as adjuncts when inflammation is confirmed [^112WcxWf].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence. First, confirm the diagnosis and exclude infection using clinical judgment and, when uncertain, ultrasound to distinguish bursitis from cellulitis or abscess. Second, implement universal conservative measures including rest, ice, NSAIDs if appropriate, and activity modification with protective padding. Third, add site-specific measures such as abductor strengthening for GTPS, shoe modification for retrocalcaneal bursitis, and compression for olecranon. Fourth, consider a single corticosteroid injection for persistent symptoms after 4–6 weeks, using image guidance for deep targets and avoiding tendon injection. Fifth, reassess at 6–12 weeks and escalate to surgical consultation only if symptoms remain disabling despite optimized conservative care [^112EJvpa] [^116mKaCA] [^116DmMVj] [^111xiSST].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and correct any overstatements. Nonseptic bursitis is common and usually self-limited; conservative management resolves most cases, and invasive procedures should be reserved for refractory disease. Corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief but carry risks and should be used sparingly, ideally with therapy. Septic bursitis management is evolving, and in select ED patients, empiric antibiotics without aspiration can be reasonable with close follow-up, though aspiration remains appropriate when diagnostic clarity will change management or when patients are high risk or fail initial therapy [^112EJvpa] [^116LWq3d] [^113Whfyu] [^113sGu7w].

Bursitis treatment is **conservative first**, with rest, ice, NSAIDs, and activity modification [^112EJvpa] [^114WQg7M]. If symptoms persist, **corticosteroid injection** can provide short-term relief [^114ZfAdJ] [^113NmGFa]; ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and may reduce complications [^1167AWgC] [^116jpGFz]. Septic bursitis requires **antibiotics** [^112EJvpa] and aspiration for diagnosis; surgery is reserved for refractory or complicated cases [^113ZcVJG] [^114WQg7M]. Most patients improve with conservative care, but recurrence is common without ongoing activity modification [^116mKaCA] [^114WQg7M].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the cornerstone of bursitis treatment and is effective in most cases [^114WQg7M]. The following measures are recommended:

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid activities that exacerbate symptoms, such as repetitive motions or prolonged pressure on the affected bursa [^112EJvpa] [^114WQg7M].

- **Ice therapy**: Apply ice packs for 15–20 minutes several times daily to reduce inflammation and pain [^notfound].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Ibuprofen, naproxen, or indomethacin are commonly used to relieve pain and inflammation [^116pZRYv] [^113bb4wb].

- **Physical therapy**: Focused exercises to strengthen surrounding muscles, improve flexibility, and correct biomechanical imbalances are beneficial, particularly for trochanteric and subacromial bursitis [^116DmMVj] [^1178fSjd].

- **Protective padding**: Use elbow or knee pads to reduce pressure on the affected bursa during activities [^112EJvpa] [^113ZcVJG].

## Pharmacological interventions

### Corticosteroid injections

Corticosteroid injections are indicated for persistent bursitis that does not respond to conservative measures [^113bsx84]. They provide **rapid relief** of pain and inflammation but carry risks such as infection, skin atrophy, and tendon rupture [^114ZfAdJ]. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and reduces complications [^1167AWgC] [^116jpGFz].

| **Bursa location** | **Indication for injection** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Olecranon | Persistent non-septic bursitis | Grade B [^114ZfAdJ] |
| Prepatellar | Persistent non-septic bursitis | Grade B [^notfound] |
| Trochanteric | Refractory cases | Moderate evidence [^113NmGFa] |
| Subacromial | Short-term pain relief | High certainty [^1178fSjd] |

---

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are indicated for **septic bursitis**, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common pathogen [^112EJvpa]. Empiric therapy should cover this organism, and aspiration is recommended for diagnostic confirmation and to guide antibiotic selection [^112EJvpa] [^112wUjt6].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for refractory cases or complications such as chronic infection, persistent drainage, or significant functional impairment [^114WQg7M]. Common procedures include:

- **Bursectomy**: Removal of the inflamed bursa, often performed arthroscopically [^114CrexQ].

- **Debridement**: Removal of inflamed tissue and bone spurs, particularly in retrocalcaneal bursitis [^111xiSST].

- **Tendon repair**: Addressing concomitant tendon pathology, such as in trochanteric bursitis with gluteal tendon tears [^113h62oy].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies such as **platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections** and **hydrothermal ablation** have shown promise in refractory cases, but evidence remains limited and further research is needed [^116jpGFz] [^116gLLd4].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most patients experience significant improvement with conservative management, but recurrence is common without ongoing activity modification and addressing underlying biomechanical issues [^114WQg7M]. Persistent cases may require repeated injections or surgical intervention [^114WQg7M].

---

Bursitis treatment is **multimodal**, with conservative measures as first-line therapy and corticosteroid injections for refractory cases. Surgery is reserved for persistent or complicated cases.

### Clinical management of olecranon bursitis: a review [^116mKaCA]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Olecranon bursitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the olecranon bursa, most often due to microtrauma. Although it is a common condition, there is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. The condition is often self-limited and resolves with conservative methods such as rest, ice, compression, orthosis wear, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Older studies have shown resolution of symptoms with intrabursal corticosteroid injections and surgical bursectomy. More recent literature has demonstrated adverse effects of intrabursal injections and surgery compared with noninvasive management for initial treatment of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. In order to better tailor decision-making, it is important that hand surgeons understand the comparative efficacies of each option for management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis.

### A randomized trial among compression plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection for nonseptic olecranon bursitis [^116LWq3d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods

We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results

There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27–1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98–4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22–1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1–4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2–9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4–6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.

Posterior heel pain — Bursitis/Haglund's pathway outlines a parallel evaluation and stepwise care: Significant history includes acute or chronic posterior heel pain, pain aggravated by shoe pressure, morning pain, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness lateral to Achilles, posterior lateral subcutaneous bony prominence, and ± local inflammation/bursitis. Radiographs demonstrate posterior superior prominence to calcaneus — Haglund's deformity and soft tissue swelling — bursitis. Initial treatment options include patient-directed treatment options (open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics) plus orthoses, accommodative padding, oral antiinflammatories, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker, continuation of initial treatment options, and consideration of injection of bursa are directed; continued lack of improvement leads to surgery with resection Haglund's/bursa or calcaneal osteotomy. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, with a reminder to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### Indomethacin (Indomethacin er) [^113y2jnc]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of
indomethacin capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use
indomethacin. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent
with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS)

Indomethacin has been found effective in active stages of the following:

---

### Indomethacin [^113bb4wb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of indomethacin capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use indomethacin capsules. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with indomethacin, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Adverse reactions generally appear to correlate with the dose of indomethacin. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the lowest effective dosage for the individual patient.

Dosage recommendations for active stages of the following:

2.2 Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease;

Indomethacin capsules 25 mg twice a day or three times a day. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 mg or by 50 mg, if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150 mg to 200 mg is reached. Doses above this amount generally do not increase the effectiveness of the drug.

In patients who have persistent night pain and/or morning stiffness, the giving of a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily.

If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and observe the patient closely.

If severe adverse reactions occur, stop the drug. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued.

Careful instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse reactions.

As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions, indomethacin should be used with greater care in the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]

2.3 Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis)

Indomethacin capsules 75 mg to 150 mg daily in 3 or 4 divided doses.

The drug should be discontinued after the signs and symptoms of inflammation have been controlled for several days. The usual course of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1176CjXJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who have lateral hip pain historically have been diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Although this strategy is effective for most patients, a substantial number of patients continue to have pain and functional limitations. Over the past decade, our understanding of disorders occurring in the peritrochanteric space has increased dramatically. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (ie, snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, examination findings, and imaging characteristics aids the clinician in treating these patients. Open and endoscopic treatment options are available for use when nonsurgical treatment is unsuccessful.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113ZcVJG]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Bursitis

Background: A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that acts as a friction cushion between structures. There are 10 bursa within and around the knee, and the 4 major bursa are the prepatellar, suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and pes anserine bursa. When friction or trauma irritates a bursa, it can become inflamed and be a significant source of knee pain. Bursitis is clinically recognized by localized pain, point tenderness, and edema at the sight of the bursa. Septic bursitis may also present with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fevers and leukocytosis.
Etiology: Superficial to the patella is the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa, which can become inflamed with kneeling activities, and is colloquially called "housemaid's knee or carpenter's knee". Inferior to the patella are two bursae, subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which lies superficial to the patellar ligament, and the deep (subtendinous) infrapatellar bursa which lies deep to the patellar ligament. Inferomedial knee pain may be caused by anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa lies deep to the pes anserinus comprising the tendinous attachments of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius. Proximal to the anserine bursa and deep to the semimembranosus tendon is the semimembranosus bursa. There are three lateral bursae: the bursa deep to the iliotibial tract, bursa deep to the lateral collateral ligament, and the inferior subtendinous bursa deep to the biceps femoris tendon. Posteriorly, there are two subtendinous bursa, one deep to the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. A bursa can become inflamed by overuse leading to increased friction across the bursa. Septic bursitis requires bacteria to enter the bursa and is associated with trauma.
Diagnostic criteria: Physical exam is significant for pain and point tenderness overlying the affected bursa and may be associated with swelling. Prepatellar bursitis will present with egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella. Septic bursitis may present with erythema and warmth. Radiologic knee series are usually normal. Evaluation with ultrasound will show a hypoechoic fluid filled sac or discrete fluid collection at the site of pain indicating bursitis.
Treatment: The treatment of bursitis-related knee pain is typically focused on reducing the inflammation of the bursa, itself – this includes ice, NSAIDs, activity modifications (such as knee pads for prepatellar bursitis), injections of corticosteroid, and therapeutic aspiration. For patients with active lifestyle or occupational demands and non-septic bursitis, intrabursal injection of corticosteroids provides acute pain relief. If septic bursitis is suspected, infectious workup includes blood sampling for evaluation of leukocytosis and aspiration of bursal fluid with gram stain and cell count. Treat septic bursitis with antibiotics. Recurrent or persistent severe bursitis may benefit from surgical interventions such as bursectomy.

Morel-Lavallée lesions are posttraumatic hemolymphatic collections related to shearing injury and disruption of interfascial planes between subcutaneous soft tissue and muscle. We review the pathophysiology of Morel-Lavallée lesions, clinical presentation, and potential sites of involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for characterization. We present the MRI classification and highlight the key imaging features that distinguish the different types, focusing on the three most common: seroma, subacute hematoma, and chronic organizing hematoma. Potential mimics of Morel-Lavallée lesions, such as soft tissue sarcoma and hemorrhagic prepatellar bursitis, are compared and contrasted. Treatment options and a management algorithm are also briefly discussed.

### Olecranon bursitis [^113XnmfY]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bursitis is a common medical condition, and of all the bursae in the body, the olecranon bursa is one of the most frequently affected. Bursitis at this location can be acute or chronic in timing and septic or aseptic. Distinguishing between septic and aseptic bursitis can be difficult, and the current literature is not clear on the optimum length or route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases. The current literature was reviewed to clarify these points.

Methods

The reported data for olecranon bursitis were compiled from the current literature.

Results

The most common physical examination findings were tenderness (88% septic, 36% aseptic), erythema/cellulitis (83% septic, 27% aseptic), warmth (84% septic, 56% aseptic), report of trauma or evidence of a skin lesion (50% septic, 25% aseptic), and fever (38% septic, 0% aseptic). General laboratory data ranges were also summarized.

Conclusions

Distinguishing between septic and aseptic olecranon bursitis can be difficult because the physical and laboratory data overlap. Evidence for the optimum length and route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases also differs. In this review we have presented the current data of offending bacteria, frequency of key physical examination findings, ranges of reported laboratory data, and treatment practices so that clinicians might have a better guide for treatment.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^112wUjt6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Olecranon bursitis — consensus-based management includes aspiration for suspected infection or crystals and pressure avoidance: All recommendations for olecranon bursitis are made via consensus (I); aspiration with diagnostic studies for infection or crystals are recommended for potentially infectious bursal effusions; post aspiration the elbow and avoidance of direct pressure on the olecranon are recommended (I); and there is no recommendation for the use of NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroid injection for treatment of aseptic bursitis.

### Sulindac [^1127z7JH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of sulindac tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use sulindac tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with sulindac tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Sulindac tablets should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended.

In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response.

A prompt response (within one week) can be expected in about one-half of patients with osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Others may require longer to respond.

In acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according to the response. In acute painful shoulder, therapy for 7–14 days is usually adequate. In acute gouty arthritis, therapy for 7 days is usually adequate.

Incidence between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in 1% to 3% of patients are not marked with an asterisk.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^115gcDsw]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge in terms of retro-trochanteric pain syndrome, make recommendations for diagnosis and differential diagnosis and offer suggestions for treatment options. The terminology in the literature is confusing and these symptoms can be referred to as 'greater trochanteric pain syndrome', 'trochanteric bursitis' and 'trochanteritis', among other denominations. The authors focus on a special type of sciatica, i.e. retro-trochanteric pain radiating down to the lower extremity. The impact of different radiographic assessments is discussed. The authors recommend excluding pathology in the spine and pelvic area before following their suggested treatment algorithm for sciatica-like retro-trochanteric pain.

### Arthroscopic subacromial decompression for subacromial shoulder pain (CSAW): a multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-group, randomised surgical trial [^113rYttW]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Painful shoulders pose a substantial socioeconomic burden, accounting for 2.4% of all primary care consultations in the UKand 4.5 million visits to physicians annually in the USA. Subacromial pain accounts for up to 70% of all shoulder-pain problemsand can impair the ability to work or do household tasks. The mean annual total cost of treating patients with shoulder pain is estimated as €4139, with costs for sick leave and secondary care substantially adding to total costs.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Shoulder pain is common and poses a substantial burden to society. Subacromial decompression was introduced in 1972 as a treatment for subacromial shoulder pain without high-level evidence and is now one of the most common surgical procedures in orthopaedics. The rationale is that the shoulder pain is caused by physical contact during arm movement between the rotator cuff tendons and a spur of bone or associated soft tissue projecting from the acromion of the scapula, and that surgical removal of the bone spur and soft tissue (decompression) eliminates this contact and, thereby cures or reduces symptoms. In 2009, we searched the scientific literature (assisted by Arthritis Research UK) before study submission with no language restrictions for reports published between 2000–09. We searched NLH, Embase, MEDLINE, PEDro; MetaRegister of Clinical Trials (active and archived registers), Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (DARE, NHS EED and HTA), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies databases, with the search terms "arthroscopy", "arthroscopic", "arthroscope", "arthroscopies", "acromioplasty", "shoulder", "rotator cuff", "glenohumeral", "acromioclavicular", "supraspinatus", "bicipital", "subacromial", "osteoarthritis", "rheumatoid arthritis", "calcific", "tendonitis", "impingement", and "bursitis ". A systematic review of the effectiveness of surgery was limited by the quality of evidence but their findings showed no difference between patients treated with surgery and those treated with non-surgical options. The recommendation from this review is that more high-quality trials are undertaken. We did a randomised, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether decompression compared with placebo (arthroscopy only) improved pain and function, whether decompression differed in outcome to no treatment, and whether placebo differed to no treatment.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^114WQg7M]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

### Common superficial bursitis [^112EJvpa]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Superficial bursitis most often occurs in the olecranon and prepatellar bursae. Less common locations are the superficial infrapatellar and subcutaneous (superficial) calcaneal bursae. Chronic microtrauma (e.g., kneeling on the prepatellar bursa) is the most common cause of superficial bursitis. Other causes include acute trauma/hemorrhage, inflammatory disorders such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, and infection (septic bursitis). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, with a particular focus on signs of septic bursitis. Ultrasonography can help distinguish bursitis from cellulitis. Blood testing (white blood cell count, inflammatory markers) and magnetic resonance imaging can help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes. If infection is suspected, bursal aspiration should be performed and fluid examined using Gram stain, crystal analysis, glucose measurement, blood cell count, and culture. Management depends on the type of bursitis. Acute traumatic/hemorrhagic bursitis is treated conservatively with ice, elevation, rest, and analgesics; aspiration may shorten the duration of symptoms. Chronic microtraumatic bursitis should be treated conservatively, and the underlying cause addressed. Bursal aspiration of microtraumatic bursitis is generally not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic septic bursitis. Although intrabursal corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to treat microtraumatic bursitis, high-quality evidence demonstrating any benefit is unavailable. Chronic inflammatory bursitis (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis) is treated by addressing the underlying condition, and intrabursal corticosteroid injections are often used. For septic bursitis, antibiotics effective against Staphylococcus aureus are generally the initial treatment, with surgery reserved for bursitis not responsive to antibiotics or for recurrent cases. Outpatient antibiotics may be considered in those who are not acutely ill; patients who are acutely ill should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^115UrShJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) or trochanteric bursitis is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. To date, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS.

Methods:

To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes relating to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

Results:

Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

Discussion:

There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

### Ultrasound-guided pes anserine bursitis injection choices: prolotherapy or oxygen-ozone or corticosteroid: a randomized multicenter clinical trial [^116dpWRe]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pes anserine bursitis is the most common cause of periarticular knee pain. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of local injection-based therapies with different materials.

Design

The enrolled patients were randomly allocated to three groups to receive different interventions. Outcome measures included pain severity using the visual analog scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index that was evaluated before the intervention, 1 and 8 wks after that.

Results

This trial was performed on 72 participants, with male-to-female ratio of 0.14 and with a mean age of 61.49 ± 9.35 yrs. Corticosteroids in the first group, oxygen-ozone in the second group, and dextrose 20% in the third group, were injected into the pes anserine bursa under ultrasound guidance. Interaction between time and group showed a statistically significant improvement in visual analog scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (P ≤ 0.05) in favor of corticosteroids and oxygen-ozone groups after 1 wk and in favor of oxygen-ozone and prolotherapy groups after 8 wks.

Conclusions

All three treatment options are effective for patients with pes anserine bursitis. This study showed that the effects of oxygen-ozone injection and prolotherapy last longer than those of corticosteroid injection.

### Structure and function, injury, pathology, and treatment of the medial collateral ligament of the knee [^112eyzpK]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee. There is a spectrum of injury severity, and injuries may be acute or chronic. The MCL is also frequently injured in conjunction with other knee structures. Clinical evaluation of the knee is important to assess the degree of surgical acuity, but magnetic resonance imaging can provide details about the injury that may not be obvious clinically. In addition to injury, MCL bursitis can occur and may be treated with needle aspiration and corticosteroid injection. This review article covers the anatomy and biomechanics of the MCL, its injury patterns and approach to management, and MCL bursitis.

### Response to: rho et al. "Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain" [^115gjHEV]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

It was with great interest that we reviewed the article by Rho et al. "Deconstructing Chronic Low Back pain in the Older Adult-Step by Step Evidence and Expert-Based Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment. Part VIII: Lateral Hip and Thigh Pain". We applaud the authors for addressing this common issue of lateral hip pain, and their thoughtfulness and evidence supported discussion regarding the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) rather than the commonly used and inaccurate term "greater trochanteric bursitis". The authors nicely review the literature summarizing that there is a lack of findings on MRI and ultrasound, as well as in histological evidence to support the diagnosis of "bursitis" and/or "tendinitis" in the vast majority of these patients. Additionally, we fully agree with the authors' noting that there is a lack of inflammatory findings in patients suffering from GTPS and that effective treatment consists of strengthening the weak hip abductors that are often noted in these patients. We have found this to be true in the patients we have treated with GTPS. The authors also note the deficiency of evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections and both the potential systemic side effects and the now well-known toxic effects of corticosteroids to tenocytes, which they note "can potentially contribute to progressive tendinopathy and partial tears".

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116t3iWG]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A hip-strengthening program is considered to be first-line treatment for patients with GTPS since it directly addresses the biomechanical cause of pain. If a patient is resistant to engaging in a strengthening program and/or is severely limited by pain from GTPS, if possible, we prefer referral to a musculoskeletal specialist prior to considering treatment with a corticosteroid injection for two reasons. First, using ultrasound or MRI to identify whether bursitis (i.e. active inflammation) is actually present helps the clinician determine how likely the patient is to benefit from an anti-inflammatory medication such as a corticosteroid. (When available and in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer, ultrasound is superior to MRI because it is faster, cheaper, and provides real-time imaging which can also be used for visualization during injection.) Second, cadaveric studies have demonstrated that there are seven bursae surrounding the GT. Therefore, in order to maximize a clinical response to a corticosteroid injection, it should be performed under ultrasound guidance by an experienced provider into the appropriate bursa demonstrating inflammation. An experienced specialist can use ultrasound to evaluate for bursitis and accurately administer any indicated injection during a regular office visit, without the need for delay to obtain an MRI to confirm inflammation. Also, there is often concomitant gluteal tendinopathy in the form of tendon tears or tendinosis. It is possible that decreasing the inflammation of the bursa will result in incomplete pain relief. Of course, patients receiving a corticosteroid injection should still be encouraged to pursue physical therapy for hip abductor (especially gluteus medius) strengthening in order to minimize the chance for pain recurrence.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^1138bH3L]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) or trochanteric bursitis is classically described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. Although diagnosis can be made with clinical examination alone, an ultrasound or MRI is sometimes used to increase sensitivity.GTPS can include a multitude of pathologies, including gluteus medius/minimus tears, inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, and snapping hip syndrome (coxa saltans).

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common and successful operations in Canada, with over 95% of patients reporting good or excellent outcomes. However, up to 17% of patients can suffer from GTPS postoperatively.GTPS can be associated with altered hip biomechanics from implant malposition or from direct injury to the abductor musculature intraoperatively. Other causes of GTPS include inflammation of the bursa overlying the greater trochanter secondary to the surgical incision; however, histopathologic studies often find little evidence of inflammation. It has been argued that a surgical approach for THA can affect the prevalence of GTPS. Advocates for using a direct anterior approach (DAA) adduce a decrease in postoperative limp and GTPS because neither the iliotibial band nor the abductor musculature is violated. Patients who suffer from GTPS postoperatively are known to have impaired functional status with reduced walking speed and slower timed up and go tests. Recalcitrant cases of GTPS may necessitate surgical débridement, increasing the risk of surgical complications and infection.

To date, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS. Management options for GTPS are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). When considering PRP in particular, physicians can use numerous different combinations and filtration rates — rendering the injections measurably different between treatment centers. Overall, there exists a paucity of high-quality evidence surrounding the ideal management of GTPS, with a lack of a collective opinion from clinicians on the treatment of this common problem.

The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes of Canadian arthroplasty surgeons because it relates to the management of GTPS after THA. Our objectives were to understand the current practice paradigms and identify areas for future research and guideline development.

### Adhesive capsulitis: a review [^113v1hUJ]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis is a common, yet poorly understood, condition causing pain and loss of range of motion in the shoulder. It can occur in isolation or concomitantly with other shoulder conditions (e.g., rotator cuff tendinopathy, bursitis) or diabetes mellitus. It is often self-limited, but can persist for years and may never fully resolve. The diagnosis is usually clinical, although imaging can help rule out other conditions. The differential diagnosis includes acromioclavicular arthropathy, autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), biceps tendinopathy, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, neoplasm, rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear (with or without impingement), and subacromial and subdeltoid bursitis. Several treatment options are commonly used, but few have high-level evidence to support them. Because the condition is often self-limited, observation and reassurance may be considered; however, this may not be acceptable to many patients because of the painful and debilitating nature of the condition. Nonsurgical treatments include analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), oral prednisone, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Home exercise regimens and physical therapy are often prescribed. Surgical treatments include manipulation of the joint under anesthesia and capsular release.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^111B9w6a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with symptomatic olecranon bursitis commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation. Up to 50% of all olecranon bursitis cases in the ED are septic in nature. It is important to recognize and appropriately treat these cases to prevent complications including septic arthritis and sepsis.

The ED evaluation and diagnosis of septic bursitis is widely variable and often based on anecdotal evidence. Diagnostic aspiration of the olecranon bursa to assess for septic bursitis is commonly recommended and performed, despite the paucity of evidence to support this practice. Aspiration may increase the risk for complications including chronic fistula formation, infection, and need for a future bursectomy.

There are only limited studies focused on ED evaluation and management of septic bursitis. Additionally, the efficacy of conservative management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. The objective of our study was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^112trtDc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This nationally distributed survey highlights an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after THA. Most surgeons do not use imaging to aid with diagnosis, although 30% of respondents use ultrasound at least in a proportion of their cases. There was a near-equal distribution between first-line treatments, including physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, and oral anti-inflammatories (Figure 2). The use of PRP is infrequent with no surgeons using PRP as first-line treatment and uncertainty regarding its potential benefits. Ideally, consensus guidelines would direct orthopaedic surgeons with best practices for management of GTPS. However, an absence of high-quality evidence on this topic would prevent any such guideline from being created or having meaningful utility.

Figure 2
Diagram representing most common methods of diagnosis (diagnosis), most common first-line treatment options (first-line therapy), and secondary treatment options for trochanteric bursitis (second-line therapy).

The estimated proportion of GTPS seen in our survey (8%) is in line with the best available evidence (3 to 17%). Using the results of our survey, this would suggest that nearly 5,000 patients are affected by post-THA GTPS each year and nearly 1,500 patients per year receive and subsequently fail first-line therapy for post-THA GTPS in Canada alone. Given the absence of standardized diagnostic guidelines, this may be an under-representation of total burden because of underdiagnosis.

In our study, more than 60% of surgeons use corticosteroids as either a first-line or second-line treatment, providing symptomatic relief through their anti-inflammatory properties. However, a proportion of symptoms generated in GTPS do not arise from inflammation itself, as evidenced by histologic specimens collected intraoperatively in recalcitrant cases. The absence of inflammation in these cases supports the use of treatment modalities other than corticosteroids, such as physiotherapy and PRP, the latter of which may provide benefit through cellular regenerations of torn abductor tendons. Given that the use of steroids may increase the risk of postoperative infection, alternative first-line treatments should continue to be studied.

### Treatment of nonseptic olecranon bursitis… [^112mrmVL]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We enrolled 42 patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis in a double-blind prospective treatment trial to compare the efficacy of an intrabursal steroid preparation with that of an oral antiinflammatory agent. Patients were randomized into one of four treatment regimens: methylprednisolone acetate intrabursal injection and oral naproxen, methylprednisolone acetate intrabursal injection and oral placebo for 10 days, oral naproxen, and oral placebo for 10 days. The degree of swelling in millimeters was assessed at study introduction and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. At 6 months, the number of patients requiring reaspiration for bursitis recurrence was tabulated. Data at 1 week indicated that patients treated with an intrabursal methylprednisolone acetate injection demonstrated the most rapid decrease in swelling. At 6 weeks, the methylprednisolone-treated groups demonstrated sustained improvement.

At 6 months, the mean number of reaspirations per patient for reaccumulation of bursal fluid was higher in groups 3 and 4. An intrabursal methylprednisolone acetate 20-mg injection seems to be the most effective treatment regimen for nonseptic olecranon bursitis. Smith DL, McAfee JH, Lucas LM, Kumar KL, Romney DM.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113g11u7]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Rapid advancements in elucidating the mechanisms of disease, preventive and diagnostic capabilities, and therapeutic interventions have not necessarily been reflected in better treatment outcomes. Nowhere is this incongruity more evident than in the management of pain. Although the field of pain management has seen a dramatic surge in recognition, research interest, resource allocation, and treatment options, the rates of pain related disability continue to soar. This disparity has led some experts to question the relations between scientific advancements, expenditures, and quality of health care.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, also known as trochanteric bursitis, is a common medical condition with a lifetime prevalence exceeding 20%; it occurs more frequently in women, older people, and people with low back pain. Corticosteroid injections can provide considerable relief in most patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment. One epidemiological study in a primary care setting found that patients who received a corticosteroid injection had a 2.7-fold greater chance of long term recovery compared with patients who had not had an injection.

Despite the prevalence of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, only a few studies evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections have been published, none of which was controlled or used fluoroscopy or other imaging techniques (such as ultrasonography). The average success rate in these studies ranged between 50% and 70%, with follow-up ranging between two weeks and two years. Because many studies have shown that fluoroscopic guidance is necessary to ensure correct placement of the needle during many interventional pain treatments, an observational study sought to determine the accuracy of "blind" trochanteric bursa injections. Intra-bursal spread of contrast occurred in only 45% of landmark guided trochanteric bursa injections, and the authors concluded that fluoroscopic guidance is necessary to ensure placement of the needle within the bursa. However, this study did not assess outcomes.

### Do ultrasound guided trochanteric bursa injections of corticosteroid for greater trochanteric pain syndrome provide sustained benefit and are imaging features associated with treatment response? [^112qmHwp]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess intra-bursal corticosteroid injections (ICSI) efficacy and duration of action in the management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). The secondary aim was to identify patient and ultrasound (US) features predictive of treatment response.

Materials and Methods

Consecutive prospectively recruited patients undergoing US-guided ICSI therapy for GTPS received baseline pre-injection questionnaires assessing pain at rest and activity, demographics and comorbidities. Baseline US and radiography findings were reported prospectively. Follow-up was performed at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months, and change in pain scores assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Logistic regression examined associations between demographics, US findings, and a clinically significant reduction in pain score (≥ 50%).

Results

Over 6 months, 127 patients were recruited with a median age of 63.5 years and 90% were female. The greatest pain reduction was between baseline and 6 weeks at activity (median 8 versus 5, p < 0.001). The majority of patients noted a reduction in pain score, but the percentage of patients receiving a ≥ 50% reduction at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for pain at rest was 41%, 37%, and 36%, respectively. Regression models suggested only gluteus medius bursitis was weakly associated with pain reduction.

Conclusion

ICSIs confer a benefit in pain reduction to a large proportion of patients in the short term, but this may not be reduced by a clinically significant amount. This small effect size and lack of predictive imaging features suggests initial management including subsequent steroid injection could be provided without imaging guidance in the majority of cases.

Posterior heel pain — Haglund's deformity and retrocalcaneal bursitis: Haglund's deformity may occur in both sexes, and "females aged 20 to 30 years are most commonly affected". Symptoms include pain and inflammation "significantly aggravated by shoe wear", with relief as "Pain may be relieved with barefoot walking or use of open-heel shoes". Initial treatment includes "open-back shoes, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, injection therapy (with care taken not to inject the Achilles tendon)… Physical therapy also may be helpful", and imaging as "Radiographs may demonstrate prominence of the posterior superior surface of the calcaneus". If nonoperative care fails, "surgery may be considered", with the indicated procedure being "Resection of the prominent posterior superior aspect of the calcaneus and inflamed bursa", and evidence-graded options include "Open resection of the prominent posterior superior aspect of the calcaneus and inflamed bursa [Grade B recommendation]", "Endoscopic calcaneoplasty [Grade I recommendation]", and "Calcaneal osteotomy [Grade C recommendation].

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the shoulder region [^111aE5vE]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The shoulder is the site of multiple injuries and inflammatory conditions that lend themselves to diagnostic and therapeutic injection. Joint injection should be considered after other therapeutic interventions such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and activity-modification have been tried. Indications for glenohumeral joint injection include osteoarthritis, adhesive capsulitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. For the acromioclavicular joint, injection may be used for diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis and distal clavicular osteolysis. Subacromial injections are useful for a range of conditions including adhesive capsulitis, subdeltoid bursitis, impingement syndrome, and rotator cuff tendinosis. Scapulothoracic injections are reserved for inflammation of the involved bursa. Persistent pain related to inflammatory conditions of the long head of the biceps responds well to injection in the region. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Indications for intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) are described for joint and soft-tissue pain. IACS injections are employed for "arthropathy due to osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other inflammatory arthritis (crystalline, psoriatic, or spondyloarthropathy); hemophilic arthropathy; or post-traumatic arthritis", and "may also be used for recalcitrant soft tissue injuries, tendinosis, tendinitis, and bursitis". Use is typically considered when "non-pharmacological treatment and analgesics fail to provide adequate relief of the symptoms".

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^116rJkpV]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Predisposing factors that increase the risk of acquired septic olecranon bursitis are persistent pressure on the bursa (eg, due to work demands), corticosteroid therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, gout and other conditions that reduce immunity. As a child our patient had poliomyelitis, which could increase the potential for opportunistic infections due to an 'immunocompromised cutaneous district' because the virus has been shown to result in regional impairments in nerve conduction that could lead to decreased peptidergic stimulation of immunocompetent cells. Although poliomyelitis primarily affects motor neurons, there is evidence that sensory neurons are also impaired. The novel concept of a selectively diminished cutaneous and subcutaneous inflammatory response due to regional poliomyelitis-related nerve damage is further supported by case reports that detail the sparing of a poliomyelitis affected limb from psoriasis, joint sparing in a patient with unilateral psoriatic arthritis with a history of hemiplegia, and sparing of limbs affected by past infection with poliomyelitis in patients with systemic sclerosis. However, although our patient's poliomyelitis infection did permanently affect the joints of his upper extremities (primarily with mild elbow contractures), there is no clear evidence that his chronologically remote polio infection contributed to his P. acnes olecranon bursitis. A link between his P. acnes olecranon bursitis/osteomyelitis also seems unlikely because he did not have any prior history of atypical or unusual infections.

Patient's perspective

I am pleased with the final outcome, but in the first 3–4 weeks it was clear that the antibiotics choices were not working. I am grateful to return to swimming and all work-related activities.

Learning points

Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be rare pathogenic causes of olecranon bursitis and osteomyelitis due to their ubiquitous presence on the skin.
Wound cultures taken in these conditions must be held for adequate time to detect growth of these organisms and guide appropriate treatment decisions.
Penicillin-based antibiotics with a beta-lactamase inhibitor provide coverage for P. acnes and is a viable treatment option for bone and soft tissue infections with this pathogen.

### Hydrothermal ablation in recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis: a prospective study [^116gLLd4]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis can be difficult to treat, resulting in persistent or recurrent symptoms. Bursectomy is a frequently applied treatment option for refractory cases but has high complication rates. This is the first in vivo study to investigate the safety and efficacy of hydrothermal ablation, a new treatment modality for recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis that aims to cause thermal obliteration of the bursal lining by irrigation with heated saline.

Methods

First, a pilot animal trial was set up to determine a safe irrigation temperature window. Second, in a human trial the bursae of patients with chronic, recurrent, or refractory olecranon bursitis were irrigated with a 3-mL/s flow of physiological saline for a duration of 180 seconds at temperatures between 50°C and 52°C. Patients were followed up for 6 months, allowing for assessment of the surgical site to screen for adverse events, volumetric ultrasonographic assessment of the bursae, and collection of the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), Patient Global Impression Score, and Clinical Global Impression Score, as well as data on return to activities or work.

Results

Twenty-four elbows were prospectively included and underwent a full cycle of hydrothermal ablation. The mean age was 58.4 years (range 40.5–81.5), including 20 male and 4 female patients. None had clinical signs of septic bursitis. Bursal fluid cultures were positive in only 1 case. The average preoperative bursal volume was 11.18 mL (range 4.13–30.75). Eighteen of 24 elbows (75%) were successfully treated, showing a complete remission of symptoms or decided improvement within 6 weeks and without any signs of recurrence during the entire follow-up period of 6 months. The average reduction of ultrasonography-measured bursal volume was 91.9% in the group of patients who responded to treatment. In patients without recurrence, the mean QuickDASH scores before and after treatment were 13.6 (range 0–50) and 3.1 (range 0–27.5), respectively, showing a statistically significant improvement. All patients were able to fully return to work within 6 weeks after the index procedure. No serious adverse events were encountered. Moderate local adverse events were found in 2 patients. Increasing temperatures of irrigation did not result in a higher treatment efficacy.

Conclusion

Hydrothermal ablation at temperatures between 50°C and 52°C is a safe treatment option for recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis with fewer complications than open bursectomy and a comparable efficacy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1122rTTF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain (e.g. simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine.
Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g. topical or oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen) and nonpharmacologic (e.g. ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition.
Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.
When diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6).
Clinicians should prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g. hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g. one tablet every 4 hours) and encourage and recommend an opioid taper if opioids are taken around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
If patients already receiving opioids long term require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible and, if additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients meaningfully in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

### Managing shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users: a scoping review of conservative treatment interventions [^1168ScmQ]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Manual wheelchair use places considerable stress on the upper limbs, particularly the shoulder, due to the repetitive loading induced by wheelchair propulsion in addition to other activities of daily living, such as transferring and weight relief tasks. Given the limited muscle mass and low stability, yet high mobility of the shoulder girdle, these activities often lead to pain, with up to 71% of manual wheelchair users reported to have experienced shoulder pain at some point in their life. –

The most common pathologies associated with shoulder pain are shoulder impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tears and tendinopathy, bursitis, joint oedema and glenohumeral instability. – The consequences of such pathologies can be incredibly severe for wheelchair users, as it may prevent individuals from being physically active, which can negatively affect their independence and quality of life. This lack of physical activity can also lead to secondary health conditions such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. Structural changes as a result of injury within the shoulder may also develop into chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis, where joint degeneration can take place and may ultimately require shoulder arthroplasty to repair. Such invasive, surgical techniques are not without risk and should be considered a last resort given the prolonged postoperative immobilization imposed.

A variety of conservative treatment options are available as an alternative to surgery for the management of shoulder pain, including exercise, massage, electrical nerve stimulation, neuromuscular retraining and corticosteroid injections. Conservative treatment has shown to have beneficial effects on shoulder pain in non-wheelchair users; however, evidence is rated as low quality. In addition, it cannot be assumed that treatments for non-wheelchair users will also be appropriate for wheelchair users due to differences in upper and lower limb function, perceptions of pain and tasks of everyday life that might be affected by shoulder pain. A systematic review on treatment options for wheelchair users found positive outcomes on shoulder pain following conservative treatment. However, this review only explored the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments and concluded that exercise was important for managing shoulder pain without being able to offer suggestions on type, frequency or duration of exercise. Considering the varied nature and range of conservative treatments available, it is important to consider all options in addition to exercise to help determine the most appropriate treatment. Subsequently, the aim of the current scoping review was to map the existing literature that has explored conservative, noninvasive solutions for the treatment of shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users to identify gaps in the evidence base and to direct future research in this area.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Box 4 — Shoulder joints: For intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and SASDB shoulder injections, lower corticosteroid doses equivalent to 20 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone are stated to be equally effective as higher doses (level of certainty: moderate). Corticosteroid injection (CSI) of the shoulder provides short-term improvement (up to 8 weeks) in pain and disability over no treatment or placebo and should be considered for adhesive capsulitis (AC) and other painful shoulder disorders (level of certainty: high). Physical therapy and home exercise, in conjunction with CSI of the shoulder, is beneficial for painful shoulder disorders, including AC and subacromial bursitis (level of certainty: moderate). Recommendations specify the recommended initial CSI can be performed with corticosteroid equivalent not exceeding 20 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone (Grade B), that shoulder CSI should be offered for short-term pain relief of moderate-to-severe pain and disability from shoulder disorders such as AC, impingement syndrome, or subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis (Grade B), and that physical therapy or home exercises should be offered in conjunction with shoulder CSI (Grade B).

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^116DnDWK]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Graph showing the most commonly used first-line treatments of trochanteric bursitis in order of most common to least.

In patients who were resistant to physiotherapy and/or oral anti-inflammatories (54.8% and 23.3%, respectively), the most common treatment for trochanteric bursitis was corticosteroids and PRP. No other uses were reported for PRP while 31% reported using corticosteroids for both first-line and resistant cases and 9.5% used corticosteroids primarily for first-line treatment.

Among all patients with post-THA trochanteric bursitis, surgeons estimated that on average, 29.9% (SD: 25.7%) would eventually receive a corticosteroid injection. Only 0.2% of these patients (SD: 0.9%) received PRP injections. The most common number of corticosteroid injections was one injection (40%, range 1 to 3). All surgeons who provided PRP injections only provided a single injection (15%). Most injections were not administered under ultrasound guidance for either corticosteroid injections (82.5%) or PRP (75.0%).

Attitudes and Beliefs

The potential benefit of PRP in the setting of trochanteric bursitis was divided, with 54.8% of respondents being unsure, 14.3% thinking it has potential benefit, and 31% thinking that it does not. Furthermore, most of the respondents (85.7%) agreed that if high-quality evidence supported the use of PRP, and if cost was not an issue, they would use PRP in treating this condition. Finally, over half of all respondents (54.8%) stated that they would participate in a randomized trial assessing the efficacy of PRP in post-THA trochanteric bursitis.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^1154jqqf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Eighty‐eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Eighty‐nine percent of patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration is a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who have adequate access to follow‐up care, are immunocompetent, are able to tolerate oral antibiotics, and are at low risk for antibiotic complications.

### Mesotherapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in rehabilitation: the state of the art [^112ghRTA]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The data respect this systematic review suggest that mesotherapy can be recommended in the rehabilitation treatment of musculoskeletal pain. In summary, mesotherapy showed good results in reducing pain and improving function in musculoskeletal pain disorders of the spine (neck pain and low nack pain): the best result is obtained in acute pain compared to chronic pain.

Yang et aland Cui et alperformed a single mesotherapy session in acute musculoskeletal pain (neck and low back pain), with acceptable pain control and rapid recovery of function. Instead, in chronic musculoskeletal pain were dosed 3 or 5 mesotherapy sessions. Mesotherapy has found limited use but with good results even in knee pain: Saggini et aladministered 9 sessions of mesotherapy (3 times per week) for pes anserine bursitis.

In conclusion, mesotherapy could be a good option in rehabilitation field for musculoskeletal pain with good advantages and few or no side effects. Future randomized controlled trials should be desirable for have more uniform treatment protocols.

### Case report: olecranon bursitis due toin an immunocompromised patient [^113QJJBD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Human protothecosis is a rare algal infection caused by Prototheca; it is a ubiquitous achlorophyllic alga, which rarely causes human disease. Currently, the pathogenesis remains unclear and no treatment options have been elucidated. We present a case of olecranon bursitis caused by Prototheca wickerhamii in an immunocompromised patient. A 45-year-old man presented with left elbow pain after scraping his elbow on a tree. He reported significant pain and swelling of the elbow after injury, which resolved without intervention. He was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS infection and started on antiretroviral therapy. Afterward, he experienced recurrent elbow swelling and pain; an incision and drainage was performed and cultures demonstrated P. wickerhamii. Unsuccessful treatment with oral voriconazole led to an attempt at therapy with parental amphotericin and oral doxycycline; however the patient left against medical advice. He presented to our facility and both parental amphotericin and doxycycline were initiated with planned outpatient bursectomy. He clinically improved on that regimen but left against medical advice before completing his recommended course of IV amphotericin and oral doxycycline. Patients diagnosed with disseminated protothecosis can have a mortality rate upward of 67%. Given the rarity of this pathogen, no official treatment guidelines exist and there are few studies analyzing the antimicrobial susceptibility of Prototheca. Management is challenging because of slow-growing nature of the algae, paucity of research studies, and limited susceptibility of this pathogen. This case adds to the limited body of literature by demonstrating the clinical presentation of protothecosis and highlighting the pathology and current treatment options.

### Non-surgical treatment as the first step to manage peritrochanteric space disorders [^116zi645]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) or lateral hip pain terms include external snapping hip, trochanteric bursitis and gluteus medius or minimus pathology. The aim of this review is to update the most recent knowledge about non-surgical management of peritrochanteric disorders.

Methods

A literature review was performed including articles most relevant in the last years that were focused in non-surgical treatment of peritrochanteric disorders.

Results

Conservative treatment still has a place and includes activity modification, NSAIDs, analgesics, physiotherapy, home training, local corticosteroid injection (CSI) and shock wave therapy (SWT). These non-surgical alternatives have demonstrated good clinical results with low rate of complications.

Conclusion

Most patients tend to resolve GTPS or lateral hip pain with non-surgical management in the mid-term but when everything failed, surgical options should be evaluated. The next frontier that will be a game changer is to determine an individualized treatment plan based on the exact pathology.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^113uuoZG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Initial management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic management among ED patients has not been well described. Two findings in our study suggest that empiric antibiotics may be a reasonable initial management strategy, including: (1) 89% of the patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution, and (2) among patients dismissed on empiric antibiotics with follow‐up available, 88% of had an uncomplicated resolution. Additionally, if all of the 14 patients initially treated with empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration who were lost to follow‐up were assumed to have experienced a complication, 82% would have had an uncomplicated resolution. Although findings among patients referred to an orthopedic surgical department, as discussed above, also favor empiric antibiotic management without bursal aspiration, they are not definitive given that the patient population was likely biased toward those with recalcitrant or complicated courses.

Contemporary studies of olecranon bursitis management among ED patients not undergoing bursal aspiration are lacking. A study conducted among patients with septic olecranon bursitis who had been referred to a home parenteral therapy program reported that 49% of patients with suspected septic bursitis were not aspirated and were only treated with antibiotics. They reported no difference in outcome among patients who were aspirated and those who were not, although 38% of those who underwent a drainage procedure required more than one drainage procedure. Studies conducted several decades ago reported that among patients with septic bursitis treated with outpatient antibiotics, 38%–75% went on to require inpatient parenteral antibiotics. In contrast, only 6% of patients treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics in our study went on to require hospitalization for inpatient antibiotics, although they were more likely to have a subsequent bursitis‐related ED visit.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112befHJ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

In order to determine whether fluoroscopy should be routinely used during trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections, we did a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing fluoroscopically guided and blind procedures. This question is relevant for two reasons. Firstly, greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, but recent studies have shown that only a small percentage of patients who meet inclusion criteria for greater trochanteric pain syndrome have radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Extra-bursal hip injections might therefore be as effective as, or even superior to, intra-bursal trochanteric injections. Secondly, giving any injection under radiographic guidance usually requires pain management services. This adds to the cost of treatment, and the delays inherent in obtaining subspecialty care can impair outcomes of treatment.

### Indomethacin (Indomethacin er) [^112jMuYB]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Adult Use

Dosage Recommendations for Active Stages of the Following:

1.
Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic
disease; moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis; and moderate to severe
osteoarthritis.

Suggested Dosage: Indomethacin capsules 75 mg b.i.d. or
t.i.d. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 75 mg, if
required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory
response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150 mg to 200 mg is reached.
DOSES ABOVE THIS AMOUNT GENERALLY DO NOT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG.

In patients who have persistent night pain and/or morning stiffness, the
giving of a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at
bedtime may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not
exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be
necessary to increase the dosage by 75 mg daily.

If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the
dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY.

If severe adverse reactions occur, STOP THE DRUG. After the acute phase of
the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made
repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the
drug is discontinued.

Careful instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are
essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse
reactions.

As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions,
indomethacin should be used with greater care in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS:
Geriatric Use).

2.
Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis).

Initial Dose:
75 mg to 150 mg daily in 3 or 4 divided doses. The drug should be discontinued
after the signs and symptoms of inflammation have been controlled for several
days. The usual course of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

3.
Acute gouty arthritis.

Suggested Dosage: Indomethacin capsules 75 mg
t.i.d. until pain is tolerable. The dose should then be rapidly reduced to
complete cessation of the drug. Definite relief of pain has been reported within
2 to 4 hours. Tenderness and heat usually subside in 24 to 36 hours, and
swelling gradually disappears in 3 to 5 days

Lateral hip pain is debilitating, with pain located at or around the greater trochanter, and trochanteric bursitis is one of the conditions that are part of the greater trochanter pain syndrome. At times, trochanteric bursitis coexists with femoroacetabular impingement. In such cases, the arthroscope is used as a soft tissue endoscope facilitating debridement of the bursa and functional lengthening of the fascia lata. Coupled with appropriate femoroacetabular impingement treatment and rehabilitation, the procedure allows predictable functional results.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^1116VEYT]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Approach to Evaluation and Management

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45%, and it commonly occurs in people with knee OA, as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias radiating down the lateral thigh along the course of the iliotibial band. Table 2 reviews additional common pain characteristics which can be elicited during the patient history to help distinguish GTPS from other conditions.

### Conservative treatments for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a systematic review [^113NmGFa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) can have a significant effect on quality of life.

Aim

To evaluate the conservative treatments for GTPS.

Design

This systematic review assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for non-randomised studies of interventions.

Data Sources

On 13 January 2016, a comprehensive search was conducted, with no limit on year of publication for relevant studies in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED and EMBASE databases.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

English language randomised controlled trials, case-control or cohort studies reporting outcome data for conservative treatments for adults having a diagnosis of GTPS, or trochanteric bursitis, were included.

Results

8 studies (n = 696) were eligible for inclusion in the review; corticosteroid injections (CSI) (n = 6), shockwave therapy (n = 2), home training (n = 1) and orthotics (n = 1). Based on pain, CSI demonstrated superior outcomes for up to 3months compared with home training, radial shockwave therapy (RSWT) and usual care, in 4 studies demonstrating either a low or moderate risk of bias. Fluoroscopy-guided injections failed to show additional benefit. RSWT and home training had limited evidence. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the use of orthotics due to the serious risk of bias and methodological flaws within that study.

Conclusions

This review demonstrates a paucity of high-quality research for the conservative treatments of GTPS. The risk of bias was low in only one study, demonstrating no additional benefit with fluoroscopically guided injections. Risk of bias in all remaining studies was varied. Standardisation of diagnostic criteria and outcome measures is essential to enable more powerful analysis.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^114tehWW]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Resolution of Case

The patient experienced significant pain relief from the corticosteroid injection for a few weeks. However, 5 weeks after the injection her lateral hip pain returned, now with pain radiating into her left lateral thigh, knee, and lateral lower leg. On repeat exam, she now had tenderness over her left ITB, mild pain with passive hip range of motion and lumbar extension, and a positive seated slump test on the left. At this time, she was felt to have GTPS and ITBS with superimposed lumbar radicular pain. Ultrasound confirmed the recurrence of bursitis in the GT. She continued to be resistant to physical therapy, and 1 month later her pain had not improved so she requested a repeat ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection.

The clinical course of this case highlights that corticosteroid injections for GTPS, even when an inflammatory bursitis is present, usually only provide temporary relief, and more definitive management of hip abductor strengthening must be strongly encouraged. In the setting of true bursitis and severe pain, a corticosteroid injection can help facilitate active engagement in a rehabilitation program. However, in older adults who are at risk for co-morbidities such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes, and delirium, minimizing the use of corticosteroids is advantageous. This case also demonstrates that evaluation of lateral hip and thigh pain is often not straightforward. In this particular patient, she likely developed secondary lumbar pain, possibly in part due to compensatory mechanical changes in an attempt to relieve pain from her sub-optimally treated GTPS.

### Surgical options for patients with shoulder pain [^114udJjH]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in the community, which can arise from diverse causes. Regardless of the cause, mild cases can often be effectively treated conservatively, with options including rest, physiotherapy, pain relief and glucocorticoid injections. If conservative strategies fail after a 3–6 month period then surgery might be considered. Generally, the proportion of patients with shoulder pain who require surgery is small. When surgery is considered, a clear diagnosis and structural information from imaging are required. The indications for surgery, and success rate, depend on the specific diagnosis as well as on the individual clinical presentation. Evidence from case series suggest that surgical interventions for shoulder pain are effective when used appropriately. This article outlines the surgical management of the most common painful conditions that affect the shoulder, including impingement, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and calcific tendonitis.

Although ultrasound (US)-guided subacromial injection has shown increased accuracy in needle placement, whether US-guided injection produces better clinical outcome is still controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficacy of subacromial corticosteroid injection under US guidance with palpation-guided subacromial injection in patients with chronic subacromial bursitis.

Methods

Patients with chronic subacromial bursitis were randomized to a US-guided injection group and a palpation-guided injection group. The subjects in each group were injected with a mixture of 0.5 mL dexamethasone suspension and 3 mL lidocaine into the subacromial bursa. The primary outcome measures were the visual analog scale for pain and active and passive ranges of motion of the affected shoulder. Secondary outcome measures were the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire, and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The primary outcome measures were evaluated before, immediately, 1 wk, and 1 month after the injection; the secondary outcome measures were evaluated before, 1 wk, and 1 month after the injection.

Results

Of the 145 subjects screened, 46 in each group completed the study. Significantly greater improvement in passive shoulder abduction and in physical functioning and vitality scores on the SF-36 were observed in the US-guided group. The pre- and postinjection within-group comparison revealed significant improvement in the visual analog scale for pain and range of motion, as well as in the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire, and SF-36 scores, in both groups.

Conclusions

The US-guided subacromial injection technique produced significantly greater improvements in passive shoulder abduction and in some items of the SF-36. US is effective in guiding the needle into the subacromial bursa in patients with chronic subacromial bursitis.

### What's changed in the management of the frozen shoulder? [^11578tTi]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Frozen shoulder is a painful condition in which movement of the shoulder becomes restricted. It can interfere with domestic and social activities and affect the ability to work. The condition can vary from mild to severe in terms of pain and/or restricted movement. We last reviewed the management of frozen shoulder 15 years ago. We concluded then that there was no clear evidence that any treatment could shorten the natural history of the condition and found little evidence as to the best management option. Here, we review the evidence on treatment approaches published in the meantime.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^112dfeav]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — botulinum toxin injections: Botulinum toxin is used to inhibit overactive spastic muscles and may be used to alleviate pain with overactive muscle spasms or contractions, and has been reported to reduce pain in peripheral joints, in the low back, and for the buttocks (piriformis syndrome) with alleged minimal side effects. It is being investigated as a potential alternative to corticosteroids as a pain control modality. A high-quality randomized controlled trial included 61 adults (n = 31 botulinum toxin injection and n = 30 corticosteroid injection) with subacromial bursitis and subacromial impingement syndrome who had not responded to physiotherapy or analgesic treatments, and reported that botulinum toxin injections significantly reduce pain.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^113sGu7w]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We studied the management of ED patients presenting with acute olecranon bursitis and found that among 266 patients included in our study only four (1.5%) underwent bursal aspiration at the time of their initial ED visit. To our knowledge, this represents the largest study of ED patients with olecranon bursitis. Among patients who did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED and were dismissed home on oral antibiotics for suspected septic olecranon bursitis, 88% had an uncomplicated resolution, 7% were subsequently hospitalized, and 6% subsequently underwent bursal aspiration, including two patients with confirmation of septic bursitis and five patients with septic bursitis ruled out. In addition, among patients admitted for suspected septic bursitis, 89% did not undergo bursal aspiration at any point and all of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution on antibiotics. Among patients dismissed without antibiotics, only two patients (3%) required subsequent hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics for a possible, although unconfirmed, septic bursitis. None of the patients in our cohort with confirmed or suspected septic bursitis went on to develop a chronic wound or require operative management. Taken together, these findings suggest that empiric antibiotic administration for suspected septic bursitis without bursal aspiration may be an appropriate first‐line management strategy among select ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who are reliable, understand return precautions, and are at low risk of antibiotic complications and treatment failure.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115DXrvz]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Course

The patient was diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) that included an inflammatory component as evidenced by bursitis seen on ultrasound. She was educated on hip abductor strengthening exercises, but she was not interested in performing the exercises regularly. Instead she requested a corticosteroid injection, so an ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa injection was performed by the ultrasound-trained physiatrist.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^113Whfyu]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Many guidelines for septic olecranon bursitis recommend aspiration of the bursa prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy despite the absence of robust clinical data to support this practice and known risk of aspiration complications. Our objective was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among emergency department (ED) patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients presenting to an academic ED from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2018, with olecranon bursitis. The health record was reviewed to assess patient characteristics and outcomes within 6 months of the ED visit. Olecranon bursitis was considered "suspected septic" if the patient was treated with antibiotics. The primary outcome of interest was complicated versus uncomplicated bursitis resolution. Uncomplicated resolution was defined as bursitis resolution without subsequent bursal aspiration, surgery, or hospitalization.

Results

During the study period, 264 ED patients were evaluated for 266 cases of olecranon bursitis. The median age was 57 years and 85% were men. Four (1.5%) patients had bursal aspiration during their ED visit, 39 (14.7%) were admitted to the hospital, 76 (28.6%) were dismissed without antibiotic therapy, and 147 (55.3%) were dismissed with empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected septic olecranon bursitis. Among these 147 patients, 134 had follow‐up available including 118 (88.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 81.1%–92.8%) with an uncomplicated resolution, eight (6.0%, 95% CI = 2.8%–11.8%) who underwent subsequent bursal aspiration, and nine (6.7%, 95% CI = 3.3%–12.7%) who were subsequently admitted for inpatient antibiotics.

Conclusions

Eighty‐eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration may be a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

### Trochanteric bursitis after total hip arthroplasty: incidence and evaluation of response to treatment [^1141UhAe]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

We examined the efficacy of corticosteroid injection as treatment for postarthroplasty trochanteric bursitis and the risk factors for failure of nonoperative treatment. There were 32 (4.6%) cases of postsurgical trochanteric bursitis in 689 primary total hip arthroplasties. Of the 25 hips with follow-up, 11 (45%) required multiple injections. Symptoms resolved in 20 (80%) but persisted in 5. We found no statistically significant differences between patients who did and did not develop trochanteric bursitis, or between those who did and did not respond to treatment. There was a trend toward younger age and greater limb-length discrepancy in nonresponders. In conclusion, (1) corticosteroid injection(s) for postoperative trochanteric bursitis is effective; and (2) nonoperative management may be more likely to fail in young patients and those with leg-length discrepancy.

### Empirical treatment of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis without aspiration [^112qd9GH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although aspiration of septic olecranon bursitis is recommended in the literature, no high-level evidence exists to support this practice. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the results of traditional bursal aspiration (TBA) with empirical management without aspiration (EM). We hypothesized that EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis results in resolution, with fewer chronic draining sinuses and less progression to bursectomy.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all cases of septic olecranon bursitis seen by the orthopedic surgery department at a single tertiary referral center over a 5-year period. Cases were manually reviewed to determine patient demographics, management, and treatment results. The primary outcome was success of nonsurgical management versus requirement for surgical bursectomy.

Results

Thirty cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis were identified within the study period. Eleven patients were initially managed with TBA (performed by an emergency or primary care physician prior to orthopedic consultation), resulting in 11 positive cultures. Only 1 of these prompted a change of antibiotic management, and despite this information, 5 patients required a second course of antibiotics for incomplete resolution. Eight of the TBA cases went on to bursectomy. Nineteen patients underwent EM. Sixteen of these cases resolved with a single course of empirical antibiotics, and 3 (16%) cases required a second antibiotic course. One patient had a recurrence of symptoms 2 months after resolution with a single course of empirical antibiotics. This resolved with a second course of oral antibiotics. No patients who underwent EM went on to require bursectomy. The number needed to harm when aspiration was performed was 1.46.

Conclusions

We found EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis to be effective. Although 1 recurrence did occur in the EM group, no other complications occurred. Empirical management without aspiration may be considered in cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis.

### Arthroscopic bursectomy with concomitant iliotibial band release for the treatment of recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis [^115A99B4]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis with lateral hip pain is a commonly encountered orthopaedic condition. Although most patients respond to corticosteroid injections, rest, physical therapy (PT), stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require operative intervention. Studies have explored the use of the arthroscope in the treatment of these patients. However, these reports have not addressed the underlying pathology in this chronic condition. We believe that the iliotibial band must be addressed and is the main cause of pain, inflammation, and trochanteric impingement leading to the development of bursitis. We report a new technique for arthroscopic trochanteric bursectomy with iliotibial band release. Our technique involves 2 incisions — one 4 cm proximal to the greater trochanter along the anterior border of the iliotibial band, and the other 4 cm distal and along the posterior border. The 30 degrees arthroscope is introduced through the inferior portal, and a cannula is introduced through the superior portal. A 5.5-mm arthroscopic shaver is inserted through the superior cannula to clear off the surface of the iliotibial band, so that it may be adequately visualized. A hooked electrocautery probe is then used to longitudinally incise the iliotibial band until it no longer rubs, causing impingement over the greater trochanter.

### Arthroscopic management of painful and stiff scapulothoracic articulation [^117HaoiK]. Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

We present the case of a patient who had chronic refractory scapulothoracic pain accompanied by the loss of scapulothoracic motion. Despite intensive physical therapy, the insidious onset of scapulothoracic pain and stiffness progressed. A wide range of diagnostic tests did not show a systemic, anatomic, or neurologic cause for the disorder. Finally, the patient elected to undergo an arthroscopic release and decompression of the scapulothoracic articulation. The patient had a dramatic response to surgery; the pain was gone immediately, and by 4 months after surgery, her scapulothoracic motion was evaluated as symmetric. One year after the surgery, she maintained an active lifestyle and was extremely satisfied with the result. Progressive and painful loss of shoulder motion in the case reported was due to a rare adhesive inflammation of the scapulothoracic bursa, which was successfully treated using arthroscopic resection. Arthroscopy of the scapulothoracic articulation is an option to treat scapulothoracic abnormalities, especially bursitis, but long-term clinical studies are needed to strongly recommend this emerging treatment option.

### The role of arthroscopic bursectomy in the treatment of trochanteric bursitis [^114CrexQ]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The use of arthroscopy to treat recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis is reported and its role in treating this common clinical entity is discussed. During a 7-year period, 27 patients underwent this procedure. All patients complained of recurrent lateral hip pain despite at least 2 localized injections with corticosteroids. Minimum follow-up was 1 year, and the cases of 22 patients were reviewed after 5 years. Twenty-three of the 27 patients had good or excellent results immediately following the procedure and experienced no complications. At 1 year, only 1 patient had experienced symptom recurrence, and at 5 years, only 2 patients had had recurrence. All patients except 1 were satisfied with their outcome. Arthroscopically performed trochanteric bursectomy is a minimally invasive technique that appears to be both safe and effective for treating recalcitrant pain syndromes.

### Septic bursitis: a case report and primer for the emergency clinician [^114WErpg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 44-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of pain and swelling over the left elbow of 1-week duration. After olecranon bursal aspiration, synovial fluid analysis yielded an increased white blood cell count (3040 cells/mm(3)) and the presence of bacteria. Culture of the fluid later grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics for septic bursitis and returned to the orthopedics clinic for follow-up 2 days later with interval worsening of symptoms. He was subsequently admitted for parenteral antibiotics and surgical wash-out of the affected bursa. This report briefly discusses the clinical history and appropriate diagnostic evaluation for septic olecranon bursitis, as well as the shortcomings of existing treatment guidelines.

Results

Ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided iliopsoas peri-tendinous/bursal injections with local anesthetic and corticosteroids are both safe and feasible and provide good pain relief in symptomatic patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy. This procedure may also be used to exclude the iliopsoas tendon as a cause of hip or groin pain in both arthroplasty and non-arthroplasty patients. Level of evidence: 3 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Iliopsoas bursa injection under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance for treating iliopsoas tendinopathy or bursitis are feasible and accurate. However, there are no studies comparing the different injection techniques neither to compare the different outcome of palpation-guided and image-guided injections. In ultrasound-guided injections, dynamic injection with local anesthetic may be used to ensure needle placement in the bursa. Complications are rare, minor, and transient. Iliopsoas bursa injection may be useful to determine the origin of pain, particularly in patients with hip arthroplasty. Adler et al observed that ultrasound-guided iliopsoas injections with local anesthetic and steroids after hip replacement provided relief to most patients (90%) with iliopsoas tendinosis/bursitis. Authors reported a lower success rate in non-arthroplasty patients related to the several involved conditions in hip pain, although 64% of these patients responded positively thereby confirming the diagnosis of iliopsoas tendinosis and highlighting those patients who may benefit from a surgical tendon release. Han et al showed that, in 178 patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy, ultrasound-guided iliopsoas corticosteroid and local anesthetic injection improved outcomes at 6 weeks, regardless of coexisting intra-articular hip abnormalities. Patients without intra-articular hip abnormalities showed significantly greater clinical improvement than patients with intra-articular abnormalities. This suggests that the presence of underlying intra-articular hip abnormalities may limit the clinical effect of iliopsoas injections in patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy, perhaps due to the pain being multifactorial. Fluoroscopy-guided iliopsoas bursa injection demonstrated a significant clinical improvement and pain reduction at 1-month post-injection in about half of the 39 patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy tested by Agten et al. Sometimes more than one injection is required to relieve the symptoms.
A single ultrasound- or fluoroscopy-guided corticosteroid and local anesthetic injection into the symphyseal cleft and/or site of abnormality detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the rectus abdominis or adductor longus insertion may result in clinical improvement in athletes with pubalgia. Level of evidence: 4 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% A single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic injection into the area of degeneration or fraying of the rectus abdominis and/or adductor longus led to clinical improvement in 12 patients with pubalgia, with all of them having returned to their preinjury activity level. Fluoroscopy-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic peri-insertional injection into the symphyseal cleft and to the site of MRI-depicted abnormality resulted in clinical improvement in near 90% of 45 athletes with pubalgia, with a sustained response in 60% after 6 months. An isolated superior cleft sign on MRI is more frequently associated with complete recovery. Furthermore, an initial complete response seems to be a prognostic factor, capable of predicting sustained response.
Ultrasound-guided needling and autologous blood product injection are both safe and feasible and may improve the clinical symptoms in hamstring tendinopathy. Level of evidence: 3 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Percutaneous ultrasound-guided dry needling of tendons around the hip and pelvis, including hamstring tendons, may be a safe and effective treatment for tendinopathy and partial tears. In a single retrospective study, improvement of patient symptoms after ultrasound-guided fenestration has been described in 82% of patients with hip and pelvis tendon pathology for up to 70 days, with no complications. Several studies report the use of PRP in hamstring injuries but the limitations and variability in study design (platelet and leucocyte concentration in PRP, kit used to prepare the PRP from the autologous blood, the ideal PRP volume to administer, frequency of injection, post-injection rehabilitation care) may limit their validity. Pain and functional improvement after PRP infiltration varied from good results at 6-month follow-up and 1-week follow-up to no differences in clinical outcomes at 4- and 8-week follow-up. Despite limited evidence, the potential side effects of PRP are so minimal that its use for proximal hamstring pathology might be considered when other non-invasive measures are unsuccessful, but only after exhausting more established therapies.
Image- and palpation-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic injections are both feasible, safe, and effective to treat greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) providing clinical improvement up to 3–6 months. Ultrasound-guided injections seem to be more effective, compared to palpation-guided injections, when performed into the greater trochanteric bursa. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Injection therapies for trochanteric bursitis with palpation guidance or image guidance are both safe and effective for relieving GTPS, resulting in a significant reduction in pain up to three months. Ultrasound- and palpation-guided injections of the trochanteric bursa have also shown similar clinical results at 2-week and 6-month follow-up. According to some authors, benefit in pain reduction from ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa corticosteroid-anesthetic injection might decrease at 6 and 12 months. McEvoy et al reported that corticosteroid injections into the greater trochanteric bursa are more effective than injections into the subgluteus medius bursa. Some authors reported that injections for gluteus medius bursitis were weakly associated with long-term pain reduction. One randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of peri-tendinous injections of glucocorticoids around the gluteal tendons showed no statistically significant outcome difference compared with normal saline injections. Even though fluoroscopy can be used to successfully inject the trochanteric bursa or subgluteus medius bursa in patients with GTPS, in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, fluoroscopically guided injections were not associated with superior clinical outcomes at 1 month compared to palpation-guided injections alone.
Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, needling, and PRP injection for GTPS are all valuable measures to reduce pain and no clear evidence exists to define one treatment as superior to the others. PRP may have more long-lasting clinical improvement than corticosteroid injections, although high-quality evidence is still missing. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Ultrasound-guided tendon dry needling and PRP injections are valuable and relatively safe treatment strategies in patients with GTPS refractory to conservative measures. Both methods showed similar outcomes at 1 and 2 weeks and at 3 months post treatment in a single blind prospective study. According to one randomized double-blind control trial, there is no difference in pain relief and functional improvement between ultrasound-guided PRP and corticosteroid intratendinous injection for GTPS at 2–60 days. However, patients receiving PRP achieved greater clinical improvement at 12 weeks. One prospective randomized double-blind study showed better results with corticosteroid than PRP injections in the greater trochanteric bursa. Fitzpatrick et al and Begkas et al presented better and longer-lasting clinical results when treating GTPS with ultrasound-guided PRP injections compared to corticosteroid. Such results were confirmed by a systematic review, representing a safe and effective alternative to surgery. Another prospective controlled randomized study found better and longer-lasting clinical results (at 24 weeks) in patients with GTPS treated by ultrasound-guided PRP injections compared to corticosteroid injections. However, Ali et al underlined the absence of adequately powered studies providing high-quality evidence, especially when the global pathology of GTPS is considered. Thus, the role of PRP in this setting still needs further investigations. Of note, based on a single prospective randomized controlled trial, physiotherapy (education and exercise) and a single ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid and anesthetic for gluteal tendinopathy resulted in higher rates of global improvement and lower pain intensity than no treatment at 8 and 52 weeks. Education and exercise showed better global improvement than administration of a corticosteroid and anesthetic, but with no significant difference in pain intensity, thus supporting physiotherapy as an effective management approach.
Ultrasound-guided ischiogluteal bursa injections are technically feasible in cadavers but no clinical data is available. Level of evidence: 4 Agree, n = 52; disagree, n = 1; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 98% The ischiogluteal bursa is located posterior and inferior to the ischial tuberosity and deep to the inferior portion of the gluteus maximus muscle. Ischiogluteal bursitis can present as an acute or chronic condition. The etiology includes direct trauma to the ischial tuberosity, abnormal friction between the ischial tuberosity, hamstring origin, and overlying gluteus maximus, and underlying hamstring tendinopathy. Ischiogluteal bursa injection can be performed under ultrasound guidance in cadavers but there are no data about indications and procedure outcome.
Image-guided intra-articular hip injections are well-tolerated and safe procedures, which are more accurate and effective than palpation-guided injections. Level of evidence: 1 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Several studies reported that image-guided intra-articular hip injections improve the accuracy of intra-articular placement. A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that ultrasound-guided injections are significantly more accurate than palpation-guided injections (using anatomical landmarks). The accuracy of palpation-guided injections ranges from 67 to 88%, which improves to 97% when ultrasound is used. Ultrasound has also the great advantage of no ionizing radiations as compared to fluoroscopy. Intra-articular treatment with imaging guidance is well-tolerated and safe for hip osteoarthritis patients. The most common adverse effect is moderate pain during injection or lasting for a short time after injection, which usually resolves without the need for treatment.
Positive response to image-guided diagnostic intra-articular injections with anesthetics can help confirm the intra-articular origin of hip pain. Level of evidence: 3 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% When the pain generator site is unconfirmed, diagnostic injections may be used to diagnose a variety of underlying intra-articular hip pathologies. Intra-articular diagnostic injections have been reported to be a 90% reliable indicator of intra-articular abnormalities and nonresponse to injection was shown to represent a strong negative predictor of surgical outcome. Complete relief of hip pain following intracapsular injection of local anesthetic was reported associated with good surgical outcome following joint replacement. Odoom et al showed that positive response to pre-operative anesthetic injection into a hip is associated with positive prognosis after hip surgery. However, for femoroacetabular impingement, injections may be more useful in non-responders.
Image-guided corticosteroid hip injection is effective in providing short-term pain relief and can transiently improve function in patients with osteoarthritis. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Hip intra-articular corticosteroid injection may be effective in delivering short-term, but clinically significant, pain reduction in patients with hip osteoarthritis, and may also lead to transient improvement in function. The treatment effect appears to be of rapid onset with a large group of responders reported at 1-week post-injection. The magnitude of pain reduction and functional improvement decreases thereafter, although two trials reported clinically significant differences in both pain and function at 8 weeks post-injection. Some reports show that patients with less advanced disease respond better to corticosteroids compared with patients with more advanced disease. A recent study on 110 patients (52 hips and 58 knees) showed that intra-articular ketorolac or triamcinolone injections provided similar improvement. Furthermore, due to its differing mechanism of action, ketorolac may not produce additional cartilage damage.
Ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of hyaluronic acid is not different for pain and function improvement from placebo, corticosteroid (at 1 and 6 months), and PRP (at 6 and 12 months) in patients with hip osteoarthritis. No different outcomes have been observed by using different hyaluronic acid formulations. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of hyaluronic acid does not significantly reduce pain or improve function when compared to placebo in short-term follow-up, with mild impact on pain and disability up to 3 months, and no difference at 6 months. Brander et al suggested that hyaluronic acid injection significantly improved pain scores compared to baseline at 6-months, although they did not demonstrate a superior effect over placebo. A meta-analysis found that intra-articular placebo is effective for osteoarthritis, particularly with regards to self-reported pain and functional outcome measurements, probably due to the dilution of proinflammatory cytokines by saline. Regarding the different concoctions, published data showed that most hyaluronic acid formulations were not significantly different in terms of clinical and functional outcomes.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111mZibu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (Health Technology Assessment 129388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies) and adhered to an a priori protocol (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020168187).

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria and methods were influenced by the project aims, the results of an initial scoping reviewand two subsequent stakeholder workshops (n = 13). The first included nine individuals who delivered exercise therapy for tendinopathy and had an academic interest. The second included four women with lived experience. Finally, an online survey (n = 26) was conducted to gather the views of a more diverse international sample of purposefully selected clinicians and academics. A completed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis checklist for reporting of systematic reviews can be found in online supplemental file 1. The inclusion criteria were framed according to a modified PICOS (participant, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study type) approach which also included context.

Participants

This meta-analysis included people of any age or gender with a diagnosis of RCRSP, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Due to difficulty in diagnosing the patho-anatomical cause of shoulder painthe term RCRSP is defined here as pain, impaired movement and function of the shoulder from one or more structures (encompassing subacromial pain/impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis). We included studies that described participants as having tendinopathy, SIS or RCRSP, thereby acknowledging that participants may have tendinopathy+/−involvement of other structures. Full thickness or large tears were excluded, for all tendinopathies. Trial authors' diagnoses were accepted where a clearly verifiable group of clinical features was reported including: pathognomonic location of pain; a symptom altering response to applied load and/or stretch, with there being a specific test for most tendinopathies; strategies to rule out differential diagnoses; ultrasound or MRI confirmation of structural change. Typically, a minimum of two clinical features were acceptable, however often more were reported. Data from studies with mixed groups were included where there was clear reporting of the tendinopathic group, or they comprised > 90% of the investigated cohort.

### Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint: a review of anatomy, biomechanics, diagnosis, and treatment [^1121tur2]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain is a frequent presenting complaint to physiatrists. Commonly encountered pathogeneses include rotator cuff pathology, bursitis, biceps tendonitis, and labral tears. Because the majority of shoulder pain originates within the subacromial region and the glenohumeral joint, the acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, and scapulothoracic articulations may be overlooked. Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a common source of shoulder pain that is often neglected by clinicians and researchers. The proper diagnosis of acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis requires a thorough physical exam, plain-film radiograph, and a diagnostic local anesthetic injection. Current treatment options are rather limited. Initial therapies are similar to that of osteoarthritis in other joints and include oral analgesics or anti-inflammatories and an emphasis on activity modification. Physical therapy, unfortunately, has little to offer, as therapeutic exercise and range of motion play only a minor role. If a diagnostic local anesthetic injection provides relief, there may be a role for corticosteroid injections. It seems that the administration of local corticosteroids into the acromioclavicular joint may provide short-term pain relief. The judicious administration of such injections remains controversial, and most experts agree that steroid injections do not alter the natural progression of the disease. Surgical options, indicated typically after a minimum of 6 mos of unsuccessful conservative treatment consist of open or arthroscopic distal clavicle resection.

### The effects of scapulothoracic bursa injections in patients with scapular pain: a pilot study [^116niXKR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of steroid plus hyaluronate injections for scapulothoracic bursitis in patients with scapular pain.

Design

Prospective open-label unicenter trial with a 3-month follow-up.

Setting

University rehabilitation hospital.

Participants

Twenty-two cases of suspected scapulothoracic bursitis.

Intervention

Injections into scapulothoracic bursa were performed with steroid plus hyaluronate. Injections were administered once a week for 3 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual analog scale (VAS), Rubin scale, adverse events, and injection-associated complications.

Results

Mean outcome scores at 3-month follow-up visits showed significant improvements versus baseline (mean VAS increased from 7.8 to 2.2) (P < .05). Furthermore, mean VAS scores at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after treatment commencement showed significant improvements versus baseline (P < .05). No serious complication occurred during the study.

Conclusions

Scapulothoracic bursitis should be considered when treating patients with perimarginal scapular pain or subscapular pain. Our findings show that steroid plus hyaluronate injections into the scapulothoracic bursa provide an effective means of treating patients with scapulothoracic bursitis.

### Image-guided versus blind glucocorticoid injection for shoulder pain [^1167AWgC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally, glucocorticoid injection for the treatment of shoulder pain has been performed guided by anatomical landmarks alone. With the advent of readily available imaging tools such as ultrasound, image-guided injections have increasingly become accepted into routine care. While there is some evidence that the use of imaging improves accuracy, it is unclear from current evidence whether or not it improves patient-relevant outcomes.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess whether image-guided glucocorticoid injections improve patient-relevant outcomes compared to landmark-guided or systemic intramuscular injections in patients with shoulder pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid), and EMBASE (Ovid) to June 2011. We also searched the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) to identify ongoing trials and screened reference lists of retrieved review articles and trials to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared image-guided glucocorticoid injection to landmark-guided or systemic intramuscular injection. Outcomes of interest included pain, function, range of motion, proportion of participants with overall improvement and adverse events. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data and performed a risk of bias assessment. Disagreement about inclusion or exclusion of individual studies and risk of bias was resolved by a third review author.

Main Results

Five studies (290 participants) were included in the review. The image-guided groups in all trials used ultrasound to guide injection. Four studies included participants with rotator cuff disease; in three the comparator was local landmarks to direct injection into the subacromial bursa and in the fourth the comparator was systemic intramuscular injection into the upper gluteal muscles in the buttock region. One study included participants with adhesive capsulitis and injection was directed into the glenohumeral joint by either ultrasound or anatomical landmark guidance. No significant differences between groups were observed with respect to reduction in pain at one to two weeks (two trials, 146 participants, standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.44, 95% CI -4.14 to 1.26), or function at one to two weeks (two trials, 146 participants, SMD 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to 3.20; back-translated to mean difference (MD) 4 points, 95% CI -5 to 13, on a 0 to 100 point scale, higher score means better function) or six weeks (three trials, 207 participants, SMD 0.63, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.33; back-translated to MD -3 points, 95% CI -11 to 5, on a 0 to 100 point scale) and the sensitivity analyses did not alter these results. While there was a significant difference between groups with respect to reduction in pain at six weeks favouring image guidance (three trials, 207 participants, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.46 to -0.14), there was considerable statistical heterogeneity and after removing trials with inadequate allocation concealment and inadequate blinding in a sensitivity analysis, the difference was no longer significant (one trial, 106 participants, MD -0.60 points, 95% CI -1.44 to 0.24 points on a 9-point scale). No statistical difference in adverse events between groups was identified (10/104 image-guided group versus 16/103 comparator; risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.85). Minor adverse events reported included transient post-injection pain, facial redness and warmth.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon moderate evidence from five trials, our review was unable to establish any advantage in terms of pain, function, shoulder range of motion or safety, of ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection for shoulder disorders over either landmark-guided or intramuscular injection. The lack of any added benefit of ultrasound guided subacromial bursal injection over glucocorticoid injection administered into the upper gluteal muscles of the buttock suggests that the benefits of glucocorticoid may arise through systemic rather than local effects. Therefore, although ultrasound guidance may improve the accuracy of injection to the putative site of pathology in the shoulder, it is not clear that this improves its efficacy to justify the significant added cost.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VI, foot and ankle [^111F1ZeU]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

US-guided tarsal tunnel decompression associated with flexor retinaculum release was feasible in a cadaveric study without any vascular or neurological damage. However, no data is available about in-vivo feasibility and efficacy.
11 US-guided injections of bursae around the foot are technically feasible, but clinical value is unknown.

Level of evidence: 5

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

Foot bursae aspiration and injection could be performed in a wide series of rheumatologic and degenerative conditions, but evidence about the interventional approach for foot bursitis is poor. There is minor evidence for intermetatarsal bursa US-guided corticosteroid injection feasibility and its therapeutic role in Morton's syndrome.
12 US-guided deep retrocalcaneal bursa injections are feasible.

Level of evidence: 4

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

Deep retrocalcaneal bursa injections are feasible and effective both under US and fluoroscopy guidance but there is more evidence for US guidance. A direct comparison between the two methods is not available, and the evidence about injection indications is weak. Local US-guided corticosteroid injection of the retrocalcaneal bursa improves bursitis symptoms but risks Achilles tendon rupture.
13 US-guided corticosteroid injections are the most effective image-guided interventional procedure to improve pain in patients with Morton's neuroma, especially in the first 3 months.

### Editorial commentary: an optimal classification system to guide prognosis and treatment in greater trochanteric pain syndrome: now we' re speaking the same language [^1159z36o]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal classification system in arthroscopic and related surgery research and clinical practice should be clinically relevant, descriptive, reproducible, simple, inexpensive, safe, and widely applicable. For the hip, classification systems that characterize intra-articular disorders like femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, dysplasia, labral tears, and articular cartilage disease predominate the literature. Recently, awareness of peritrochanteric and other extra-articular disorders has increasingly led to greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of what has been historically known as "just bursitis". These disorders are far more complex and include greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the spectrum of gluteal tendon pathology, greater trochanteric bursitis, snapping iliotibial band (external coxa saltans), and greater trochanteric-ischial impingement. The utility of an intraoperative greater trochanteric pain syndrome classification system has now been proven using prospectively collected data, assimilating a decade-long eligibility period following open or endoscopic treatment of peritrochanteric disorders with a minimum two-year follow-up using validated patient-reported outcome scores. This classification guides prognosis and treatment, exactly as an optimal orthopedic classification system should do.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116DmMVj]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most common local cause of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults is GTPS. Gluteus medius weakness is often a significant contributor to the development of GTPS. As a result, hip abductor strengthening exercises should be the first-line treatment of this syndrome in conjunction with medication. While medications and modalities may provide temporary symptomatic relief, pain will likely recur if the underlying weakness is not addressed. Additionally, since GTPS and other lumbopelvic conditions often coexist, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical examination to evaluate for the possibility of multiple pain generators, as well.

Key Points

Lateral hip and/or thigh pain in the older adult with CLBP can be from a number of causes, with those most common being greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), hip osteoarthritis, lumbar radiculopathy/radiculitis, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Meralgia paresthetica also should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Often lateral hip and/or thigh pain is multifactorial.
Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain and is usually due to weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. Hip abductor strengthening is the first-line treatment for GTPS.
True GT bursitis causing GTPS occurs in a minority of cases; therefore, corticosteroid injections should be used sparingly, and ideally only when there is imaging evidence of bursitis. Injection should always be accompanied by a hip abductor strengthening program.
In older adults with CLBP, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is less commonly described than GTPS. However, hip abductor strengthening is part of the first-line treatment for both GTPS and ITBS.
Lumbar radiculopathy (i.e. pain + weakness) requires aggressive evaluation and treatment to avoid progressive and permanent neurologic damage. Lumbar radiculitis (pain without weakness) can be evaluated and managed more conservatively.

### Comparison of treatments for frozen shoulder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111L51PC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

There are a myriad of available treatment options for patients with frozen shoulder, which can be overwhelming to the treating health care professional.

Objective

To assess and compare the effectiveness of available treatment options for frozen shoulder to guide musculoskeletal practitioners and inform guidelines.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINHAL were searched in February 2020.

Study Selection

Studies with a randomized design of any type that compared treatment modalities for frozen shoulder with other modalities, placebo, or no treatment were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted by 2 individuals. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Random-effects models were used.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pain and function were the primary outcomes, and external rotation range of movement (ER ROM) was the secondary outcome. Results of pairwise meta-analyses were presented as mean differences (MDs) for pain and ER ROM and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for function. Length of follow-up was divided into short-term (≤ 12 weeks), mid-term (> 12 weeks to ≤ 12 months), and long-term (> 12 months) follow-up.

Results

From a total of 65 eligible studies with 4097 participants that were included in the systematic review, 34 studies with 2402 participants were included in pairwise meta-analyses and 39 studies with 2736 participants in network meta-analyses. Despite several statistically significant results in pairwise meta-analyses, only the administration of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid was associated with statistical and clinical superiority compared with other interventions in the short-term for pain (vs no treatment or placebo: MD, -1.0 visual analog scale [VAS] point; 95% CI, -1.5 to -0.5 VAS points; P < .001; vs physiotherapy: MD, -1.1 VAS points; 95% CI, -1.7 to -0.5 VAS points; P < .001) and function (vs no treatment or placebo: SMD, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9; P < .001; vs physiotherapy: SMD 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.7; P < .001). Subgroup analyses and the network meta-analysis demonstrated that the addition of a home exercise program with simple exercises and stretches and physiotherapy (electrotherapy and/or mobilizations) to IA corticosteroid may be associated with added benefits in the mid-term (eg, pain for IA coritocosteriod with home exercise vs no treatment or placebo: MD, -1.4 VAS points; 95% CI, -1.8 to -1.1 VAS points; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that the early use of IA corticosteroid in patients with frozen shoulder of less than 1-year duration is associated with better outcomes. This treatment should be accompanied by a home exercise program to maximize the chance of recovery.

### Editorial commentary: treatment of partial thickness undersurface abductor tears of the hip: like backwards a bike riding [^113h62oy]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Partial thickness undersurface abductor tears can be effectively treated with a transtendinous gluteus medius and minimus repair, with decreased pain and improvement in abductor strength. The surgical treatment of this condition runs counter to traditional treatment for "greater trochanteric bursitis", and adoption may be more difficult as a result.

Although Baker's cyst therapy depends on the primary cause, percutaneous interventions can be safely performed under US guidance. In patients with knee osteoarthritis, US-guided Baker's cyst aspiration and corticosteroid-anesthetic injection have shown significant pain relief and cyst diameters decrease up to 4 and 8 weeks. Direct Baker's cyst injection gave a greater size reduction and better clinical outcomes compared to an anterior knee joint injection at 4- and 8-week follow-up. Aspiration and corticosteroid injection performed better than stand-alone physical therapy, even though their combination further ameliorated symptoms. At long-term follow-up in patients with knee osteoarthritis or other knee pathologies, US-guided aspiration, wall fenestration in the case of multilocular cysts, and injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid showed similar clinical benefit by relieving pain and reducing cyst volume. A significant correlation exists between volume reduction and clinical improvement. Baker's cyst recurrence was noted in complex cysts, without any significant pain change between the patients with simple and complex cysts. Close follow-up may be advantageous so the treatment can be repeated in case of recurrence. In two case reports, US-guided sclerotherapy with hypertonic dextrose has been used as a treatment option for Baker's cyst treatment, but the clinical value has not still been demonstrated. US-guided intervention in Baker's cyst when visually observed by the patient can be used as a positive bio-feedback, favorably affecting the treatment outcome.
10 US-guided corticosteroid injections are more effective than blind injections to treat pes anserinus bursitis, but the added value of imaging to guide other periarticular injections (excluding patellar tendon and Baker's cyst) has not been demonstrated.

### Betamethasone acetate and betamethasone sodium phosphate (Celestone soluspan) [^116bSuYw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Bursitis, Tenosynovitis, Peritendinitis

In acute subdeltoid, subacromial, olecranon, and prepatellar bursitis, one intrabursal injection of 1.0 mL CELESTONE SOLUSPAN Injectable Suspension can relieve pain and restore full range of movement. Several intrabursal injections of corticosteroids are usually required in recurrent acute bursitis and in acute exacerbations of chronic bursitis. Partial relief of pain and some increase in mobility can be expected in both conditions after one or two injections. Chronic bursitis may be treated with reduced dosage once the acute condition is controlled. In tenosynovitis and tendinitis, three or four local injections at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks between injections are given in most cases. Injections should be made into the affected tendon sheaths rather than into the tendons themselves. In ganglions of joint capsules and tendon sheaths, injection of 0.5 mL directly into the ganglion cysts has produced marked reduction in the size of the lesions.

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis

Following intra-articular administration of 0.5 to 2.0 mL of CELESTONE SOLUSPAN Injectable Suspension, relief of pain, soreness, and stiffness may be experienced. Duration of relief varies widely in both diseases. Intra-articular Injection of CELESTONE SOLUSPAN Injectable Suspension is well tolerated in joints and periarticular tissues. There is virtually no pain on injection, and the "secondary flare" that sometimes occurs a few hours after intra-articular injection of corticosteroids has not been reported with CELESTONE SOLUSPAN Injectable Suspension. Using sterile technique, a 20- to 24-gauge needle on an empty syringe is inserted into the synovial cavity and a few drops of synovial fluid are withdrawn to confirm that the needle is in the joint. The aspirating syringe is replaced by a syringe containing CELESTONE SOLUSPAN Injectable Suspension and injection is then made into the joint.

A portion of the administered dose of CELESTONE SOLUSPAN Injectable Suspension is absorbed systemically following intra-articular injection. In patients being treated concomitantly with oral or parenteral corticosteroids, especially those receiving large doses, the systemic absorption of the drug should be considered in determining intra-articular dosage.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^112vQ2yJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While it is known that physical examination is not reliable for establishing the diagnosis of septic versus nonseptic bursitis, it has not been established if bursal aspiration is necessary for definitive diagnosis or if empiric antibiotic administration is a reasonable initial approach for management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis at the time of ED evaluation. Many guidelines advocate for bursal aspiration if there is suspicion of septic bursitis. However, aspiration of the bursa has been shown to lead to potential complications including fistula formation, infection, and future bursectomies. Fifty‐five percent of patients in our cohort were dismissed on empiric antibiotics, which is consistent with a prior ED study that found that approximately 50% of olecranon bursitis cases were septic. A recent study of 30 patients referred to an orthopedic surgical department demonstrated that, among patients who had undergone an olecranon bursal aspiration for septic bursitis, 55% developed a chronic draining wound at the aspiration site and 73% went on to eventual bursectomy. In comparison, none of the patients in that study who had been treated with empiric antibiotics went on to develop a chronic wound or require bursectomy. In another study of 31 patients admitted to the hospital for septic olecranon bursitis after undergoing bursal aspiration, 10% required an operative intervention. Similarly, in a study of 22 ED patients with septic olecranon bursitis based on bursal aspirates, three (14%) patients developed a chronic fistula tract and one (4.5%) required incision and drainage.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^113XoH6d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The complexity in both treatment and diagnosis of GTPS reflects the multiplicity of attitudes and perceptions toward this condition. In a recent systematic review of GTPS after THA, more than 10 different diagnostic criteria for trochanteric pain have been reported, but only a single tool has reported its sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. The lack of consensus in the treatment approach is evident through the multiple treatments used, including PRP, steroids, a variety of physiotherapy protocols, peripheral nerve stimulation, local anesthetic injections, and others. Five studies reported on the utility of corticosteroid injections either alone (one study) or in combination with home physiotherapy treatment protocols. Four studies reported on treatment of trochanteric bursitis resistant to nonsurgical management using either gluteal bursectomy or iliotibial band lengthening. No studies reported on outcomes with a follow-up of longer than 1year, limiting the reliability of outcome assessments.

In our study, surgical approach was not associated with a notable difference in the surgeon-perceived rates of post-THA GTPS. While it is important to consider that this is based on surgeon estimates and not real data, it is still interesting to compare these estimates across approaches. Although a lack of notable difference among the various approaches is consistent with previous clinical literature, lower rates of GTPS are sometimes touted as a potential benefit of certain approaches. Among the myriad of potential causes of GTPS, gluteus medius/minimus tears (i.e. "bald trochanter" syndrome) can occur with any surgical approach either because the insertion is not visualized or because it fails to heal after intraoperative repair.

By contrast, the literature surrounding the treatment of GTPS in patients who have not previously received total hip replacement is of considerably higher methodologic quality. Since 2002, there have been 13 randomized controlled trials evaluating nonsurgical treatment of GTPS. The best available evidence from these trials suggests that PRP and physiotherapy were likely to be somewhat more effective than corticosteroids and anti-inflammatories alone in reducing pain or increasing hip function at 3 to 6 months.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: a comprehensive review [^116XLWPL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Trochanteric Bursitis

Trochanteric bursitis (TB), or inflammation of one or more of the peri-trochanteric bursae, has historically been considered a primary source of lateral hip pain, with an approximate prevalence of 4.4% to 29% in patients post-THA. A proposed cause is repetitive friction between the GT and the iliotibial band, commonly associated with overuse, trauma, and altered gait patterns. Teng et alinvestigated the effect of performing a bursectomy during primary THA. In this study, 550 patients underwent routine bursectomy, while 400 did not. At an 11-year follow-up, the incidence of tb was unaffected by whether a bursectomy was performed. Furthermore, White et al recently conducted a risk factor analysis for the development of trochanteric bursitis TB, evaluating 1094 patients, of whom 103 (9.4%) developed TB. The incidence varied slightly by surgical approach: 8.7% for the posterior approach, 10.8% for the direct anterior approach, and 4.2% for the direct lateral approach. However, the surgical approach was not identified as a notable risk factor. Among the variables analyzed, only sex was markedly associated with increased risk; women had a 1.79 times higher risk of developing TB. Notably, changes in acetabular offset, femoral offset, total offset, and leg length between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were not associated with an increased risk of TB in either univariate or multivariate model.

Clinical Presentation

Patients usually complain of lateral thigh pain, often aggravated by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, with a tender area on the GT to palpation.

Diagnostic Studies

Although in most cases, diagnosis is made clinically, advance imaging, metal suppression MRI, or ultrasound (US) can be used to rule out concomitant abductor pathology.

Treatment

Trochanteric bursitis initially is managed conservatively with simple analgesia, NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and corticosteroid injections. For refractory cases where conservative measures have failed for a prolonged period, open techniques combining iliotibial band release with trochanteric bursectomy, an arthroscopic approach to debride and excise the inflamed bursa, are recommended. Van Hofwegen et alpresented a series including 12 patients who underwent endoscopic trochanteric bursectomy with a high patient satisfaction, where 10 out the 12 patients reported substantial pain relief.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^112WcxWf]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Targeted injection therapy

(20) Local corticosteroid injections are safe and effective and can be offered as an adjunct for the relief of inflammation and pain in the foot in IA. Image guidance using radiology or US should be considered and available if needed. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
(21) Children and young people undergoing local corticosteroid injection should be offered access to general anaesthesia or conscious sedation in a suitable paediatric environment. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 99.

Rationale

Local corticosteroid injections are widely performed in routine clinical practice to address inflammation and pain in the foot in IA, e.g. to induce remission or as a rescue treatment. The SOR is largely based on expert opinion. Weak evidence for the effectiveness of US-guided local corticosteroid injections on pain reduction for adults with heel enthesitis, tendinitis and retrocalcaneal bursitis in IA has been demonstrated in a systematic review of four uncontrolled trials and one comparative trial. US-guidance ensured selection of lesions appropriate for injection, allowing precise needle tip placement.

The GWG accepted the effectiveness of unguided (blind or palpation-guided injections) and US-guided injections to reduce pain and inflammation. While evidence that US-guided injections are more effective than palpation-guided injections in the foot is lacking, the GWG recognized the theoretical advantages of US-guided injections, including more accurate needle placement, increased feasibility of injecting structures that are difficult to access (e.g. midfoot and subtalar joints), and to avoid other structures. However, RCTs involving other areas of the body indicate that it is not certain that the accuracy established by US-guided corticosteroid injections improves outcomes compared with systemic or clinical examination-guided steroid injections, or sham lavage plus steroid. There is also weak evidence from observational studies for reduction in synovitis and a sustained clinical response in the ankle and subtalar joints following local intra-articular corticosteroid injections in children and young people with JIA.

### Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive surgical resection of retrocalcaneal bursitis: a preliminary comparison with traditional open surgery [^116NE8mC]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain is a common complaint that is often caused by overuse injuries. In such cases, the retrocalcaneal bursa is compressed and chafed repeatedly, leading to local inflammation. Sonography is a popular imaging tool used to study the pathology of soft tissues, and it can be used to assist in diagnosing bursitis because of its accuracy. Herein, we report an innovative method to treat retrocalcaneal bursitis under ultrasound guidance. Ten patients with posterior heel pain for > 6 months who failed conservative treatment received this ultrasound-guided minimally invasive surgery. An endoscopic puncher and burr were inserted under ultrasound guidance via a stabbing wound, and the swollen retrocalcaneal bursa and bony prominence were resected. The patients were able to ambulate and undergo a rehabilitation program 2 weeks postoperatively. In the patients who underwent this ultrasound-guided minimally invasive surgery, both the average surgical time and average hospital stay were shorter than in those (n = 12) who underwent open surgery. In outcome rating assessment, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) pain score and total AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score were improved in the ultrasound-guided minimally invasive surgery group compared to the open surgery group at 2 months postoperatively. Other advantages included lesser wound pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery time, and minimal blood loss. Accordingly, ultrasound-guided surgery appears to be a good option for the treatment of retrocalcaneal bursitis.
