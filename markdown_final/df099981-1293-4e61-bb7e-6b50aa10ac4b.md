## Question

Causes of orthostatic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of orthostatic hypotension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct definition, subtypes, and pathophysiology to anchor what "cause" means here. Then, I should classify etiologies into neurogenic versus non-neurogenic domains. Next, I will detail neurogenic causes, followed by non-neurogenic contributors including cardiovascular, volume, vascular/mechanical, and situational factors. After that, I will systematically examine medication-induced orthostatic hypotension and age-related physiology. Finally, I should integrate special contexts, outline a diagnostic approach, and synthesize a practical taxonomy with clinical implications, making sure to verify and correct any misstatements along the way [^1121VX2b] [^111JYUVe].

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and physiologic framework. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, with some experts recommending a 30 mmHg systolic threshold in those with supine hypertension because the magnitude of the fall is baseline dependent, and subtyping now includes initial OH, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic OH, and delayed OH as revealed by continuous beat-to-beat profiling and expert consensus, which helps differentiate mechanisms and tailor evaluation and management [^111JYUVe] [^111jn2Ym] [^114nQSqq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without revisiting normal physiology. Upon standing, venous pooling of roughly 500–1000 mL in the lower body requires baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction, increased heart rate and contractility, and skeletal muscle pump activation to maintain cerebral perfusion; OH occurs when these compensations are absent, insufficient, delayed, or pharmacologically impaired, so any cause that interferes with the baroreflex arc, intravascular volume, cardiac output, or vascular tone can precipitate the syndrome [^116MVUBT].

> I need to ensure I cleanly separate neurogenic from non-neurogenic categories because this distinction guides both diagnosis and therapy. Neurogenic OH reflects central or peripheral autonomic failure with impaired sympathetic vasoconstriction and blunted heart rate responses, whereas non-neurogenic OH reflects inadequate preload, pump failure, excessive vasodilation, or impaired venous return, a schema endorsed by society statements and guidelines and useful for structuring causal lists and directing testing for autonomic dysfunction versus hemodynamic or iatrogenic precipitants [^1121VX2b] [^111JYUVe].

> Next, I will examine neurogenic causes, starting with synucleinopathies. Wait, I should verify whether the lesion is pre- or postganglionic in different disorders: in Parkinson's disease and pure autonomic failure there is prominent postganglionic sympathetic denervation with cardiac norepinephrine loss, whereas multiple system atrophy shows more preganglionic failure; getting that wrong would mislead test selection and prognosis, so I should correct my earlier shorthand to reflect this distinction and note that OH prevalence in PD is common, roughly 30% and increasing with disease progression, often coexisting with supine hypertension and other features of baroreflex failure [^114PKoeS] [^117LLDJ2] [^114UfTN9] [^113sfH2Y] [^113ZBMJK].

> Let me consider secondary neurogenic causes as well. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy disrupts efferent sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers in the splanchnic and peripheral circulation, producing impaired vascular resistance and OH with reported prevalence ranging from about 8% to over 40% depending on the definition used; other causes include amyloidosis, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, and spinal cord injury, all of which undermine baroreflex efferent pathways and can present with concomitant supine hypertension in advanced autonomic failure [^115YB1x1] [^116MVUBT] [^113sfH2Y].

> Now I will review non-neurogenic contributors, starting with volume status. Dehydration, inadequate fluid and salt intake, and acute or chronic blood loss reduce preload and stroke volume, thereby precipitating orthostatic falls in pressure; importantly, nonpharmacologic therapy recommendations to increase water to 2–2.5 liters per day and salt above 8 grams per day implicitly highlight the causal role of volume depletion and the potential reversibility with repletion, so I should check for these modifiable factors first [^116MVUBT] [^113oZczM].

> I should also examine cardiac pump and rhythm disorders. Heart failure with reduced forward flow, ischemia impairing contractility, arrhythmias or conduction disease compromising chronotropic or inotropic responses, and significant valvular disease can all limit the compensatory rise in cardiac output upon standing, making cardiogenic contributors a core non-neurogenic cause set to be screened with exam, ECG, and targeted testing when suspected [^115w65E6].

> But wait, what about venous return and mechanical factors. Impaired venous return from venous insufficiency, prolonged bed rest with skeletal muscle deconditioning, or loss of the calf muscle pump increases dependent pooling and reduces effective preload; postprandial splanchnic pooling can precipitate postprandial hypotension especially in autonomic disorders, so timing of symptoms relative to meals and bedrest should be elicited and documented in the history [^116MVUBT] [^113ze6DC] [^112rSTnM].

> I will now examine medication-induced causes, but first I should double-check my terminology. I initially labeled "alpha-adrenergic blockers" and listed atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole as examples; hold on, I should verify the pharmacology and correct that: while these are not classic selective alpha-blockers, many antipsychotics have clinically meaningful alpha-1 adrenergic antagonism and are repeatedly associated with orthostatic hypotension, particularly during initiation and dose escalation, alongside dopaminergic agents, MAO-B inhibitors, and sedative alpha-2 agonists that lower sympathetic tone or heart rate, so a meticulous medication review with attention to timing is essential [^1153UoqX] [^113Kqj5R] [^116TDEG4] [^113FBVBW] [^115LwrAS] [^111V54Z1] [^114TkoQ5] [^1121VX2b].

> Next, I should review age-specific physiology and its clinical consequences. With aging there is baroreflex impairment, vascular stiffness, and diminished physiologic reserve, all of which blunt compensatory responses and amplify the hemodynamic impact of medications and stressors; notably, immediate orthostatic drops are common at the first measurement after standing and partly recover by 3 minutes, and delayed or prolonged OH and the magnitude of BP fall correlate with mortality risk in geriatric cohorts, underscoring the need to measure at multiple time points and to interpret findings in light of age-related risk [^1139QtjG] [^115fznvR] [^115S5L2L].

> Hold on, I should verify how concomitant hypertension interacts with OH because clinicians often fear overtreatment. High-quality meta-analyses and an individual participant data analysis indicate that more-intensive blood pressure lowering does not increase and may slightly reduce measured orthostatic hypotension overall, though some antihypertensive classes can unmask underlying autonomic impairment in susceptible patients; counseling should reflect that relative safety finding while acknowledging that absolute hypotension events may be undercounted when OH populations are excluded from trials [^113fpocK] [^116n72xC] [^1121VX2b] [^115uQM56] [^115j9vvP] [^113ELz35] [^1166KqmB] [^1173wmgx].

> I need to ensure I do not miss situation-specific contexts that raise pretest probability. OH is prevalent in stroke rehabilitation and may correlate with older age, lower functional status, and severe hemiparesis, warranting early screening and attention to mobilization protocols; in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies, neurogenic OH commonly coexists with supine hypertension, so management must balance immediate fall risk against long-term vascular risks of nocturnal hypertension [^117LtRmR] [^113sfH2Y] [^113ZBMJK].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach to identify causes in a structured manner. Let me first confirm the measurement protocol: guidelines endorse supine rest at least 5 minutes with blood pressure and heart rate measured just prior to standing and at 1 and 3 minutes after standing, with head-up tilt or continuous beat-to-beat monitoring when short-lived variations such as initial OH are suspected; a thorough history emphasizing medications, timing relative to meals and mornings, and autonomic symptoms, plus exam, ECG, and selective labs, is recommended, and reproducibility concerns justify considering home or ambulatory assessments in some patients, especially when office testing underestimates prevalence [^111JYUVe] [^111jn2Ym] [^111uYiUy] [^111Dgwb4] [^116tDm5p] [^112ZH7wi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge a practical caution about orthostatic vital signs in acute care. OVS alone do not reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope or life-threatening causes in the emergency department, so they should be integrated with history, exam, ECG, and risk stratification rather than used in isolation to explain syncope or to rule out dangerous differentials [^112wpHns].

> I will now synthesize a practical taxonomy that tracks with mechanisms and modifiable drivers. Neurogenic causes include synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and pure autonomic failure as primary forms, and secondary autonomic neuropathies such as diabetes, amyloidosis, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, and spinal cord injury; non-neurogenic causes include cardiovascular pump and rhythm disorders, volume depletion from dehydration or blood loss, impaired venous return and deconditioning, and situational postprandial hypotension; iatrogenic contributors include agents with alpha-1 antagonism among antipsychotics, dopaminergic drugs, MAO-B inhibitors, and sedative alpha-2 agonists, with dose titration and escalation windows conferring the greatest risk, especially in older adults with reduced baroreflex reserve [^114PKoeS] [^117LLDJ2] [^114UfTN9] [^115YB1x1] [^115w65E6] [^116MVUBT] [^112rSTnM] [^1153UoqX] [^113Kqj5R] [^113FBVBW] [^111V54Z1] [^114TkoQ5] [^1139QtjG].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications and ensure the multifactorial nature is explicit. Most patients, particularly older adults, have a combination of a susceptible substrate such as age-related baroreflex impairment or neurodegeneration, superimposed medication effects that lower vascular tone or intravascular volume, and contextual triggers like morning orthostasis, heat, or large carbohydrate-rich meals; therefore, evaluation should simultaneously inventory the substrate, precipitating medications, and triggering circumstances to target modifiable elements while recognizing nonmodifiable disease drivers that may need specific pharmacologic countermeasures or compression strategies [^1121VX2b] [^114nQSqq] [^113oZczM] [^112rSTnM].

> Final takeaway, and I should double-check for internal consistency. The causes of orthostatic hypotension are best organized into neurogenic autonomic failure and non-neurogenic hemodynamic categories, with a third major iatrogenic domain from medications that impair sympathetic vasoconstriction or deplete volume; age-related baroreflex dysfunction and vascular stiffness are common amplifiers, and the condition is often multifactorial, making a structured history, orthostatic measurements at 1 and 3 minutes, careful medication review, and context-aware testing the most efficient path to identifying modifiable causes and tailoring therapy [^111JYUVe] [^111jn2Ym] [^1139QtjG] [^1121VX2b].

Orthostatic hypotension is caused by **autonomic failure** (neurogenic OH) from neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple system atrophy, diabetic neuropathy) [^114nQSqq], **hypovolemia** (dehydration, blood loss, diuretics) [^116MVUBT], and medications (antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, dopaminergic agents, antipsychotics) [^1121VX2b] [^113FBVBW] [^1153UoqX]. Cardiac causes (arrhythmias, heart failure, valvular disease) [^1121VX2b] [^114ZmB6w], **endocrine disorders** (adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism) [^116MVUBT], and age-related baroreflex impairment also contribute [^1139QtjG]. Management targets the underlying cause [^114nQSqq], with nonpharmacologic measures (increased fluids/salt, compression garments, counterpressure maneuvers) [^113oZczM] [^117BWmPw] [^116vWgWS] and medications (midodrine, fludrocortisone, droxidopa) [^113sJq7p] [^115UjaoT] [^1121VX2b] as needed.

## Neurogenic causes (autonomic failure)

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) results from **impaired autonomic regulation**, most often from neurodegenerative disease:

- **Parkinson's disease (PD)**: Commonly associated with nOH due to autonomic dysfunction [^113ZBMJK] [^114nQSqq].

- **Multiple system atrophy (MSA)**: Severe autonomic failure causing profound OH [^113sfH2Y] [^114nQSqq].

- **Diabetic autonomic neuropathy**: Chronic hyperglycemia damages autonomic nerves, leading to OH [^115YB1x1] [^114nQSqq].

- **Pure autonomic failure**: Primary autonomic disorder causing OH [^114nQSqq].

---

## Non-neurogenic causes

Non-neurogenic OH arises from **factors unrelated to autonomic dysfunction**:

- **Hypovolemia**: Dehydration, blood loss, or diuretics reduce intravascular volume [^114ZmB6w] [^116MVUBT].

- **Medications**: Antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, dopaminergic agents, and antipsychotics can cause OH [^1121VX2b] [^112Vtr17] [^1153UoqX] [^113FBVBW].

- **Cardiac conditions**: Arrhythmias, heart failure, and valvular disease impair cardiac output [^114ZmB6w] [^1121VX2b].

- **Endocrine disorders**: Adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism can cause OH [^114ZmB6w] [^116MVUBT].

---

## Age-related factors

Aging significantly **increases OH risk** through:

- **Impaired baroreflex sensitivity**: Reduced autonomic responsiveness to postural changes [^1139QtjG].

- **Increased medication use**: Polypharmacy in older adults increases OH risk [^1139QtjG] [^1121VX2b].

- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are common in older adults [^1139QtjG] [^115w65E6].

---

## Clinical implications and management

OH is associated with **increased risk** of falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and mortality [^114nQSqq] [^115w65E6] [^111Dr2Pz]. Management includes:

- **Nonpharmacologic measures** include increased fluid and salt intake, compression garments, and counterpressure maneuvers [^117BWmPw] [^113oZczM] [^116vWgWS] [^114nQSqq].
- **Pharmacologic treatments** include midodrine, fludrocortisone, and droxidopa [^113sJq7p] [^115UjaoT] [^1121VX2b].

---

Orthostatic hypotension is a multifactorial condition involving neurogenic, non-neurogenic, and age-related factors. Effective management requires identifying the **underlying cause** and implementing appropriate interventions.

### Abilify [^1153UoqX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Abilify may cause orthostatic hypotension, possibly due to its alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonism. In short-term, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients on oral Abilify (n = 2,467), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events included orthostatic hypotension (1% for Abilify, 0.3% for placebo), postural dizziness (0.5% for Abilify, 0.3% for placebo), and syncope (0.5% for Abilify, 0.4% for placebo). In pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years (n = 732) on oral Abilify, the reported incidences were orthostatic hypotension (0.5% for Abilify, 0% for placebo), postural dizziness (0.4% for Abilify, 0% for placebo), and syncope (0.2% for Abilify, 0%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate ≥ 25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values, was not meaningfully different between Abilify and placebo. Among adult oral Abilify-treated patients, the incidence was 4%, compared to 2% for placebo; for pediatric oral Abilify-treated patients aged 6 to 18 years, the incidence was 0.4% compared to 1% for placebo.

	- Abilify should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (such as a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions predisposing patients to hypotension (such as dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Abilify, may lead to somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which in turn may result in falls and consequent injuries.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Orthostatic hypotension in adults with hypertension: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1121VX2b]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Although orthostatic hypotension (OH) has long been recognized as a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction, a growing body of literature has identified OH as a common comorbidity of hypertension. This connection is complex, related to pathophysiology in blood pressure regulation and the manner by which OH is derived as the difference between two blood pressure measurements.

While traditional therapeutic approaches to OH among patients with neurodegenerative disorders focus on increasing upright blood pressure to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion, the management of OH among patients with hypertension is more nuanced. Resting hypertension is itself associated with adverse outcomes among these patients. Although there is substantial evidence that intensive blood pressure treatment does not cause OH in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, some classes of antihypertensive agents may unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic impairment.

- **Practical steps**: Practical steps to manage OH among adults with hypertension start with (1) a thorough characterization of its patterns, triggers, and cause; (2) review and removal of aggravating factors, often pharmacological agents not related to hypertension treatment; (3) optimization of an antihypertensive regimen; and (4) adoption of a tailored treatment strategy that avoids exacerbating hypertension.

These strategies include countermaneuvers and short-acting vasoactive agents, such as midodrine and droxidopa. Ultimately, further research is needed on the epidemiology of OH, the impact of hypertension treatment on OH, and approaches to the screening.

### Orthostatic hypotension [^116MVUBT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a physical finding defined by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing. Common in family medicine, the condition may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In healthy individuals, muscle contractions increase venous return of blood to the heart through one-way valves that prevent blood from pooling in lower body parts. The autonomic nervous system responds to positional changes by constricting veins and arteries and increasing heart rate and cardiac contractility.

When these mechanisms malfunction or if the patient is hypovolemic, orthostatic hypotension may occur. In persons with orthostatic hypotension, gravitational opposition to venous return causes a decrease in blood pressure and threatens cerebral ischemia. Several potential causes include medications, non-neurogenic factors such as impaired venous return, hypovolemia, and cardiac insufficiency, as well as neurogenic causes like multisystem atrophy and diabetic neuropathy. Treatment generally targets the underlying cause, with various pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions available to relieve symptoms.

### Common syndromes of orthostatic intolerance [^114ZmB6w]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system, adequate blood volume, and intact skeletal and respiratory muscle pumps are essential components for rapid cardiovascular adjustments to upright posture (orthostasis). Patients lacking sufficient blood volume or having defective sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction develop orthostatic hypotension (OH), prohibiting effective upright activities. OH is one form of orthostatic intolerance (OI), defined by signs such as hypotension and symptoms like lightheadedness that occur when upright and are relieved by recumbence.

Mild OI is commonly experienced during illnesses and when standing up rapidly. The latter is denoted "initial OH" and represents a normal cardiovascular adjustment to the blood volume shifts during standing. Some people experience episodic acute OI, such as postural vasovagal syncope (fainting), or chronic OI, such as postural tachycardia syndrome, which can significantly reduce quality of life. The lifetime incidence of ≥ 1 fainting episodes is approximately 40%. For the most part, these episodes are benign and self-limited, although frequent syncope episodes can be debilitating, and injury may occur from sudden falls.

In this article, mechanisms for OI having components of adrenergic hypofunction, adrenergic hyperfunction, hyperpnea, and regional blood volume redistribution are discussed. Therapeutic strategies to cope with OI are proposed.

### Neupro [^113FBVBW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Dopaminergic agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in postural/orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's and Restless Legs Syndrome patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require (1) careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk.

An increased risk for decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position in patients treated with Neupro. In patients taking the maximum recommended Neupro dose, orthostatic (change from supine to standing) decreases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or greater) was 16% for Neupro and 14% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 32% for Neupro and 27% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 13% for Neupro and 11% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome.

More severe decreases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or greater) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or greater) also occurred more frequently (Neupro incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease during measurements when supine, standing, or changing from supine to standing.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: Orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^1139QtjG]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Impaired blood regulation is common in older people, whether due to physiological changes in the baroreflex, age-related diseases or states, or autonomic neuropathies. The consequences — OH and associated hypertension — are debilitating conditions and herald a poor prognosis. Identifying the underlying cause, understanding the associated pathophysiology, and mitigating exacerbating factors through predominantly lifestyle measures are essential. Future work should focus on identifying optimal BP targets for these individuals, particularly the frailest patients at the highest risk of falls and injury.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113sJq7p]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for orthostatic hypotension, specifically with respect to midodrine, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend administering midodrine (2.5 mg PO TID, increasing gradually up to 10 mg PO TID) as first-line treatment, either alone or combined with fludrocortisone.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111Dgwb4]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically concerning orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when it occurs while standing and there is concomitant significant orthostatic hypotension.

Suspect reflex syncope and orthostatic hypotension in the presence of features suggesting reflex syncope or orthostatic hypotension, and in the absence of features suggesting cardiac syncope.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^111JYUVe]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for orthostatic hypotension, specifically in the context of initial evaluation, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend obtaining the following as part of the initial evaluation of patients with suspected orthostatic hypotension:

- **Structured history taking**: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's medical history.
- **Detailed physical examination**: Perform a thorough physical examination.
- **Supine and upright BP measurements**: Measure blood pressure in both supine and upright positions.
- **12-lead ECG recording**: Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram recording.
- **Active standing or head-up tilt**: Ideally, conduct active standing or head-up tilt with continuous assessment of blood pressure and heart rate for 3 minutes.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uQM56]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

The management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy with adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope) differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure-lowering medications to placebo, or different blood pressure targets for falls or syncope outcomes and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis estimated a pooled treatment effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude these patients. We tested P for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

- **Results**: Forty-six trials were included, of which 18 trials excluded orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P < 0.001) but not incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P = 0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89–1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88–1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension.

### Orthostatic changes in blood pressure and mortality in the elderly: The Pro.V. A study [^111Dr2Pz]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

An extensive, albeit contrasting, literature has suggested a possible role for orthostatic hypotension as a risk factor for cardiovascular (CVD) and non-CVD mortality, while no data are available for orthostatic hypertension. We investigated whether orthostatic changes in blood pressure (BP) were associated with any increased risk of all-cause, CVD, or non-CVD mortality in a group of elderly people.

- **Methods**: Two thousand seven hundred and eighty-six community-dwelling older participants were followed for 4.4 years. Participants were grouped according to whether they had a drop of ≤ 20 mm Hg in systolic or ≤ 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP (orthostatic hypotension), an increase in mean orthostatic systolic BP ≥ 20 (orthostatic hypertension), or normal changes within 3 minutes of orthostatism.

- **Results**: During follow-up, 640 subjects died, 208 of them for CVD-related reasons. Adjusted Cox's regression analysis revealed that, compared with normal changes, orthostatic hypertension was associated with higher all-cause (HR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02–1.39) and CVD-related mortality (HR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.08–1.74), while orthostatic hypotension was only associated with a higher non-CVD mortality (HR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01–1.60). Orthostatic hypertension emerged as a predictor of all-cause mortality for participants over 75 years old, participants with a BMI below 25 kg/m², participants with no CVD or disabilities, and those taking less than three medications. Orthostatic hypertension also predicted CVD-related mortality in individuals with no hypertension, heart failure, or coronary artery disease.

### Mirapex [^115LwrAS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's disease patients and RLS patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).

In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy.

While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. Also, clinical trials in patients with RLS did not incorporate orthostatic challenges with intensive blood pressure monitoring.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and associated supine hypertension, and the associated risks of each when they manage patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is linked with a loss of baroreflex function, which normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically experience both nOH and supine hypertension.

In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Since orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension.

There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH and accept the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made for managing multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^114PKoeS]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

No other prospective population-based study with continuous follow-up has previously assessed the relation between orthostatic hypotension and Parkinson's disease. Yet, in contrast with our findings, some other studies did find an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in individuals with orthostatic hypotension. One previous study applied the MDS criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease to a population-based setting in which the presence of Parkinson's disease was assessed at 3, 5, and 10 years. This study found that symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, although the number of patients with Parkinson's disease was small (n = 20). Furthermore, one large case-control study including 8,166 patients with Parkinson's disease found a high increased risk in hypotensive patients (RR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.85–5.52). However, this study used a broad definition of hypotension, including idiopathic hypotension and dizziness after standing up. Finally, two clinic-based studies found that a substantial group of delayed or neurogenic orthostatic hypotension patients developed α-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. It should be noted, however, that these studies only included persons with orthostatic hypotension who were referred to a specialized center, thus probably representing individuals with more severe orthostatic hypotension than in the general population.

The pathophysiology of orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson's disease is incompletely understood. Several studies indicated that postganglionic sympathetic denervation in and outside the heart with a loss of norepinephrine plays a role in the development of orthostatic hypotension.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: Methodology, clinical relevance and practical application: A 2021 position paper by the Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability of the European Society of Hypertension [^116tDm5p]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common condition associated with adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Screening for orthostatic hypotension consists of blood pressure measurements in both supine (or sitting) and standing positions during clinical consultations. However, orthostatic hypotension is poorly reproducible, and assessments conducted in doctors' offices are likely to underestimate its true prevalence. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) can improve orthostatic hypotension diagnosis without compromising the quality of postural blood pressure assessment. This was demonstrated by Cremer et al, who found in a study of 505 mostly hypertensive patients that orthostatic hypotension prevalence, defined as the presence of one episode of orthostatic hypotension detected by HBPM, was 37.5%. This is significantly higher than the orthostatic hypotension prevalence measured in the same cohort in a clinic setting (15%).

Orthostatic hypotension is commonly observed in elderly patients due to their impaired baroreceptor sensitivity and is often associated with conditions such as hypertension, dementia, other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease), atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and heart failure. However, using HBPM in elderly individuals may be challenging due to physical and/or cognitive dysfunction. Thus, exploring the diagnostic accuracy of HBPM in detecting orthostatic hypotension compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is necessary. Additionally, the potential usefulness of wearable devices for self blood pressure monitoring in detecting orthostatic hypotension requires further investigation.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals.

If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in the screening questions, they should be considered at risk for OH/nOH, and a more complete evaluation including orthostatic vital signs needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of the question: "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 minutes of standing, and do they get better when you sit or lay down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate.

Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

### Timing of orthostatic hypotension and its relationship with falls in older adults [^115fznvR]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

There is inconsistent evidence on the optimal time after standing to assess for orthostatic hypotension. We determined the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension at different time points after standing in a population of older adults, as well as fall risk and symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: We performed a secondary analysis of the Study to Understand Fall Reduction and Vitamin D in You (STURDY), a randomized clinical trial funded by the National Institute on Aging, testing the effect of differing vitamin D3 doses on fall risk in older adults. STURDY occurred between July 2015 and May 2019. Secondary analysis occurred in 2022. Participants were community-dwelling adults, 70 years or older. In the orthostatic hypotension assessment, participants stood upright from a supine position and underwent six standing blood pressure measurements (M1-M6) in two clusters of three measurements (immediately and 3 minutes after standing). Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between orthostatic hypotension at each measurement and subsequent falls. Participants were followed until the earlier of their 24-month visit or study completion.

- **Results**: Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 32% of assessments at M1, and only 16% at M5 and M6. Orthostatic hypotension from average immediate (M1–3) and average delayed (M4–6) measurements, respectively, predicted higher fall risk (M1–3: 1.65 [1.08, 2.52]; M4–6: 1.73 [1.03, 2.91]) (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]). However, among individual measurements, only orthostatic hypotension at M5…

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115j9vvP]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Antihypertensive treatment and orthostatic hypotension

Eight trials (n = 59,603) reported orthostatic hypotension, and there were 2,071 orthostatic hypotension events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of orthostatic hypotension in the control group was 3.9% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared to 3.5% in trials that did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P-value = 0.91) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and orthostatic hypotension was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73–1.18) and trials that did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.90–1.37) (P-interaction = 0.26) (eFigure S4).

Antihypertensive treatment and hypotension

Thirty-seven trials (n = 202,080) reported hypotension, and there were 12,363 hypotension events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of hypotension in the control group was 1.3% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared to 6.2% in trials that did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P-value = < 0.01) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and hypotension was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.58–2.31) and trials that did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.42–2.11) (P-interaction = 0.47) (eFigure S5).

### Incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation [^117LtRmR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

To document the incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation and to determine clinical variables associated with it, a cohort study was conducted.

- **Setting**: Inpatient setting of a tertiary rehabilitation center.

- **Participants**: Seventy-one stroke patients (41 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.4 ± 10.7 years) with a first clinical stroke, admitted for rehabilitation within 4 weeks of the stroke.

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients' blood pressure was measured in a supine position and on tilting at 90 degrees within 3 days of admission. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20 mmHg or more.

- **Results**: Orthostatic hypotension was present in 37 (52.1%) patients, of whom 13 had severe hypotension (standing SBP ≤ 100 mmHg). Twelve (32.4%) patients with orthostatic hypotension were positive for hypotensive symptoms and signs, with 2 patients experiencing near syncope. Orthostatic hypotension was significantly associated with older patients, a lower admission functional status (as measured on the Modified Barthel Index), and more severe hemiparesis. It was, however, not related to the site of stroke or the use of antihypertensives. On discharge, orthostatic hypotension had resolved in 23 patients. The presence of orthostatic hypotension did not influence functional outcome or the length of stay in rehabilitation.

In conclusion, orthostatic hypotension was common in stroke patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. It should be suspected in older patients who have…

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^117LLDJ2]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unknown whether orthostatic hypotension is a marker of prodromal PD or more advanced disease. The objectives of this study were to assess whether orthostatic hypotension is a prodromal marker of PD in the general population.

- **Methods**: This study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a large prospective population-based cohort in the Netherlands. Orthostatic hypotension was measured in 6,910 participants. First, the relation between prevalent PD and orthostatic hypotension was determined using logistic regression. Second, PD-free participants were followed for the occurrence of PD until 2016. The association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of PD was studied using Cox proportional hazards models. All models were adjusted for age and sex.

- **Results**: At baseline, the mean age ± standard deviation of the study population was 69.0 ± 8.8 years, and 59.1% were women. Orthostatic hypotension was present in 1,245 participants (19.8%), and 62 participants (1.0%) had PD at the time of orthostatic hypotension measurement. Participants with PD were significantly more likely to have orthostatic hypotension (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.24). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 16.1 years (8.5–22.7 years), 122 participants were diagnosed with incident PD. Orthostatic hypotension at baseline was not associated with an increased risk of PD (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.59–1.58).

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^112rSTnM]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, particularly in the management of autonomic dysfunction, the CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend the following general measures for orthostatic hypotension:

- **Avoid aggravating factors**: Such as large meals, alcohol, exposure to warm environments, and drugs known to cause orthostatic hypotension (e.g. diuretics or antihypertensive drugs). It is also important to recognize that levodopa and dopamine agonists may worsen orthostatic hypotension.

- **Increase salt intake**: This is recommended in cases of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

- **Ensure head-up tilt of the bed at night**: This measure can help manage symptoms.

- **Wear elastic stockings**: This can aid in managing orthostatic hypotension.

- **Recognize postprandial hypotension**: In some patients, hypotension occurs only after meals. Patients should be warned about this effect and advised to take frequent small meals.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ZH7wi]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH if blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH. A complete history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory testing should focus on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Cardiac disorders, such as pacemakers, dysrhythmias, and ablation, can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, electrocardiogram, and medication review should consistently be performed.

Due to variability among patients — such as age, disease status, and medication usage — the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH. Therefore, clinical scenarios and specific presentations need to be considered.

### Orthostatic hypotension and mortality risk in geriatric outpatients: The impact of duration and magnitude of the blood pressure drop [^115S5L2L]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common condition associated with an increased mortality risk. This study investigates this association specifically in geriatric outpatients and additionally focuses on the duration and magnitude of orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: In this observational prospective cohort study with geriatric outpatients from the Amsterdam Ageing Cohort, we differentiated orthostatic hypotension into early orthostatic hypotension (EOH) and delayed/prolonged orthostatic hypotension (DPOH). The magnitude of the drop in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after either 1 or 3 minutes was quantified. Mortality data were obtained from the Dutch municipal register. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association between orthostatic hypotension and mortality, adjusted for sex and age (model 1), additionally adjusted for orthostatic hypotension-inducing drugs and SBP (model 2), and the presence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes (model 3). Stratified analyses in patients with geriatric deficits were performed.

- **Results**: We included 1240 patients (mean age 79.4 ± 6.9 years, 52.6% women). The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 443 (34.9%); 148 (11.9%) patients had EOH and 285 (23%) had DPOH. DPOH was associated with a higher mortality risk [hazard ratio, 95% CI 1.69 (1.28–2.22)], whereas EOH was not associated with mortality risk. This association did not differ in patients with geriatric deficits. Furthermore, the magnitude of the drop in both SBP and DBP was associated with a higher mortality risk.

- **Conclusion**: The presence of DPOH and the magnitude of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure drops were associated with increased mortality risk.

### Rexulti [^116TDEG4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, including Rexulti, cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti plus ADT in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti plus ADT-treated patients compared to placebo plus ADT-treated patients was: dizziness (2% versus 2%) and orthostatic hypotension (0.1% versus 0%).

In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients included: dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%). In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with Rexulti compared to patients treated with placebo was: dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%).

Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and those receiving concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medication. Patients with known cardiovascular disease, including a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities, are also at increased risk and should be monitored carefully.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^115w65E6]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common yet often overlooked disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure.

Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to reach an appropriate underlying diagnosis causing OH, alongside treating accompanying conditions and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments. A novel streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH is proposed to enhance understanding. The relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH is examined, and OH-mediated end-organ damage is discussed. Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are provided to guide clinical decision-making and patient care effectively.

- **Gaps in knowledge**: Future research directions are defined to address these gaps, enhancing understanding and management strategies.

Utilizing a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented, highlighting various presentations of OH to serve as a practical guide in evaluating and managing patients with OH.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ELz35]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy and adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope) differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure-lowering medications to placebo, or different blood pressure targets on falls or syncope outcomes and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude patients with orthostatic hypotension, and tested P for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

- **Results**: Forty-six trials were included, of which eighteen trials excluded orthostatic hypotension and twenty-eight trials did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P < 0.001) but not incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P = 0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89–1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88–1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension (P for interaction = 0.90).

### Leg blood pressure measured in orthostatic posture is associated with left ventricular mass in normotensive subjects [^111PWG5V]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Changing from a supine to an orthostatic posture is associated with substantial increments in leg blood pressure (BP) levels, which could ultimately influence the hemodynamic burden imposed on the heart. This study investigated the relationship between brachial and leg BP measurements and the left cardiac chamber's structure and assessed the role of body posture changes in this regard.

- **Methods**: One hundred and thirty normotensive, nondiabetic, nonsmoking, normolipemic subjects were evaluated by a clinical history, anthropometry, analysis of metabolic parameters, echocardiography, and the measurement of BP in the arm and the calf in both supine and orthostatic positions.

- **Results**: Significant correlation coefficients between the leg BP measurements and the cardiac structure were detected, especially between the orthostatic pulse pressure (PP) and the left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (r = 0.38; P < 0.001), the orthostatic PP and the LV mass (r = 0.37; P < 0.001), and the orthostatic systolic BP (SBP) and the left atrial size (r = 0.35; P < 0.001). Stepwise and standard regression analysis adjusted for brachial BP, anthropometric, and metabolic variables confirmed that the leg orthostatic PP was independently related to the LV wall thickness and mass. Moreover, the leg orthostatic SBP was associated with the left atrial dimension even after adding the LV mass to the statistical models. Finally, triglyceride levels and body surface area showed a significant relationship with leg orthostatic PP and SBP, whereas brachial orthostatic PP and SBP were only associated with… (text ends abruptly).

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: A systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113fpocK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH).

- **Purpose**: To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

- **Data extraction**: Two investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

- **Data synthesis**: Five trials examined BP treatment goals, and four examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18,466 participants with 127,882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered the risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included four additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

Limitations of the study include that assessments of OH were done while participants were seated to standing without further context, which might impact the generalizability of the results.

### Orthostatic circulatory disorders: From nosology to nuts and bolts [^1168S4KF]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

When patients complain of altered consciousness or discomfort in the upright posture, either relieved by recumbency or culminating in syncope, physicians may find themselves baffled. There is a wide variety of disorders that cause abnormal regulation of blood pressure and pulse rate in the upright posture. The aim of this focused review is threefold. First, to offer a classification (nosology) of these disorders; second, to illuminate the mechanisms that underlie them; and third, to assist the physician in the practical aspects of diagnosing adult orthostatic hypotension by extending clinical skills with readily available office technology.

### Orthostatic hypotension-related hospitalizations in the United States [^113btQY1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension has been commonly described in elderly persons and is associated with an increased risk of falls, syncope, and cerebrovascular events. Nevertheless, the precise burden of this condition in the US is currently unknown.

- **Methods**: We analyzed discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify orthostatic hypotension-related hospitalizations and associated comorbidities after excluding acute causes of this condition. National hospitalization rates were estimated using US census population estimates, and the medical conditions most frequently associated with orthostatic hypotension were assessed.

- **Results**: In 2004, there were an estimated 80,095 orthostatic hypotension-related hospitalizations, yielding an overall rate of 36 (95% confidence interval, 34 to 38) hospitalizations per 100,000 US adults. Orthostatic hypotension was the primary diagnosis in 35% of these hospitalizations. The number of orthostatic hypotension-related hospitalizations increased steadily with age, and patients aged 75 years or older had the highest annual hospitalization rate, 233 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval, 217 to 249). The median length of hospital stay was 3 days (IQR 2–6), and the overall in-hospital mortality was 0.9%. Caucasian males were most likely to be hospitalized with orthostatic hypotension. Syncope was the most common comorbid condition reported among orthostatic hypotension patients.

- **Conclusions**: Orthostatic hypotension is a relatively common condition among hospitalized US elderly patients. In light of the progressive aging of the population, understanding and addressing this condition is crucial for healthcare planning and management.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^116LgSGx]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Strengths of our study include our case-finding approach with continuous and long-term follow-up for PD. In addition, we used a nonselected population of 55 years and older in which orthostatic hypotension was measured using a standardized protocol. Patients with PD in our study thus represent patients in the general population instead of patients presenting at specialized clinics. Finally, our study showed reliable estimates for the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (19.8%), as our estimates were comparable to other population-based studies using a similar definition of orthostatic hypotension.

Our study was limited by the relatively low prevalence and incidence of Parkinson's disease, which could have influenced why we, contrary to expectations, did not find a significant association between prevalent PD and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension when using the ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio to determine neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Also, the small number of participants with PD prohibited us from performing additional analyses into heart rate response or from stratifying for factors such as blood pressure medication or other vascular risk factors.

Furthermore, the mean age of the study participants without PD at baseline was relatively high (68.9 years). As a result, we cannot rule out that an association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of PD does exist in younger individuals. In addition, we measured orthostatic hypotension only once in this study, so participants could have developed orthostatic hypotension after this measurement. An important final note is th…

### Latuda [^113Kqj5R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Latuda may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, possibly due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. These risks are generally greatest at the start of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, those undergoing treatment with antihypertensive medication, and those with a history of cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities) or cerebrovascular disease. Patients who are antipsychotic-naïve are also at risk. In such cases, consider using a lower starting dose, slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.

Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following changes: a decrease in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mm Hg and an increase in pulse of ≥ 10 bpm when moving from sitting to standing or supine to standing.

- **Schizophrenia**:

	- **Adults**: The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was as follows: orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508) with Latuda, 0.1% (1/708) with placebo] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508) with Latuda, 0% (0/708) with placebo].

	- In short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with Latuda 40 mg, 2.1% with Latuda 80 mg.

### Do orthostatic vital signs have utility in the evaluation of syncope [^112wpHns]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is long and includes benign conditions as well as acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

- **Objective**: The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.

- **Methods**: Three prospective cohort studies plus 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.

- **Results**: This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.

- **Conclusions**: OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that serves as an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It is characterized by impaired autonomic reflexes or depleted intravascular volume, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until its later clinical stages. Symptoms such as orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients, as individuals with orthostatic hypotension are often asymptomatic, further complicating the diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically concerning orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome when there is an orthostatic heart rate increase (> 30 bpm or > 120 bpm within 10 minutes of active standing) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Orthostatic hypotension and risk of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults [^112eEDJ6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study also has limitations. First, OH was assessed within the first 2 minutes of standing. It is unclear whether similar associations would be observed with OH identified at or beyond 3 minutes of standing. It has been hypothesized that the temporal manifestation of OH (1 versus 3 minutes) may correspond to different underlying pathophysiological features.

Second, because of the later implementation of the protocol, OH was not assessed in everyone, reducing power. Third, hs‐TnT and NT‐proBNP were not measured at the same time as the OH assessment. Thus, we cannot determine whether they were detectable or elevated at the time of the OH assessment or if these developed afterward.

Fourth, we did not have standing heart rate or assessments of symptoms related to standing, which limits our ability to further phenotype OH. Fifth, symptoms and their severity were not comprehensively assessed. As a result, we do not know who was likely to undergo treatment for OH in this population. However, we anticipate this was a small number.

Sixth, we included among our tables postural change in SBP or DBP as a continuous variable because this may be informative for clinical interpretation of postural change above or below traditional cut points. However, this implies a linear relationship that was not consistently observed with all outcomes. Seventh, although models were adjusted for numerous covariates, residual confounding is always a concern with observational studies.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SJYoy]. Age and Ageing (2021). High credibility.

Initial orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years or older, particularly when measured continuously, highlighting the need to screen and diagnose initial OH. Future research should investigate whether the inclusion of symptoms in the definition of initial OH is clinically relevant. Furthermore, there is a need to establish a consensus on the diagnosis of initial OH using continuous blood pressure devices to consistently identify participants with initial OH.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^114UfTN9]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

In this population-based cohort study, we found that individuals with Parkinson's disease were more likely to have orthostatic hypotension. In contrast, the presence of orthostatic hypotension at baseline was not associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease during long-term follow-up. Our findings suggest that orthostatic hypotension in the general population is not a prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease.

We hypothesized that the risk of Parkinson's disease would be higher in participants with orthostatic hypotension compared to those without it, especially in participants with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Our hypothesis was based on the observation that the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinson's disease is a relatively high 30% (range, 10%–65%) and increases with disease progression. However, our results did not support this hypothesis. Limiting the follow-up duration to 5 and 10 years after the blood pressure measurements also did not show an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in participants with orthostatic hypotension or neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The point estimates for neurogenic and early orthostatic hypotension even unexpectedly pointed in a contrary direction. However, the estimates of these subanalyses must be interpreted with caution because the small number of participants with neurogenic and early orthostatic hypotension developing Parkinson's disease created large confidence intervals.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166KqmB]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension from antihypertensive trials did not alter the relative effects of treatment with respect to falls or syncope. However, clinicians should be cognizant when counselling individuals with orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension, regarding the potential side effects of antihypertensive therapy. Trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension may underestimate the absolute risk of adverse effects such as symptomatic hypotension and possibly falls/syncope, as event rates were lower in trials that excluded this population.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^115Ys43s]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving both motor and nonmotor symptoms. The prodromal phase of PD can start as early as 20 years prior to diagnosis and is dominated by nonmotor signs, including constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder, and hyposmia. Orthostatic hypotension has also been described as a common nonmotor sign of PD, but it was typically attributed to a later stage of the disease.

Recent studies have suggested that orthostatic hypotension can already develop in the prodromal phase of PD. Determining whether orthostatic hypotension should be considered a prodromal marker of PD is important because prodromal markers allow earlier recognition of PD and could help identify individuals eligible for neuroprotective trials. Furthermore, early recognition and treatment of orthostatic hypotension and other nonmotor symptoms of PD are required because these symptoms negatively impact quality of life.

The association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of PD has been limitedly studied so far. Some small studies have shown an increased risk of PD in participants with orthostatic hypotension. Also, a large registry-based study has demonstrated that participants with hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, carried an increased risk of PD. However, the association between orthostatic hypotension and PD has not been prospectively studied in a large sample of the general population yet.

Thus, we aimed to identify whether orthostatic hypotension in the general population is…

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114xqVsD]. Age and Ageing (2021). High credibility.

Initial orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a clinical syndrome of exaggerated transient orthostasis associated with higher risks of falls, frailty, and syncope in older adults. The objective of this study was to provide a prevalence estimate of initial OH in adults aged 65 years or older.

A literature search of MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1947), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted until December 6, 2019, using the terms 'initial orthostatic hypotension', 'postural hypotension', and 'older adults'. Articles were included if published in English and participants were 65 years or older. Random effects models were utilized for pooled analysis.

Of 5,136 articles screened, 13 articles (10 cross-sectional; 3 longitudinal) reporting data of 5,465 individuals (54.5% female) from the general (n = 4,157), geriatric outpatient (n = 1,136), institutionalized (n = 55), and mixed (n = 117) populations were included. Blood pressure was measured continuously and intermittently in 11 and 2 studies, respectively.

- **Prevalence findings**:
	- Continuously measured initial OH had a pooled prevalence of 29.0% (95% CI: 22.1–36.9%, I² = 94.6%):
		- 27.8% in the general population (95% CI: 17.9–40.5%, I² = 96.1%)
		- 35.2% in geriatric outpatients (95% CI: 24.2–48.1%, I² = 95.3%)
		- 10.0% in institutionalized individuals (95% CI: 2.4–33.1%, I² = 0%)
		- 21.4% in the mixed population (95% CI: 7.0–49.6%, I² = 0%)

	- Intermittently measured initial OH had a pooled prevalence of 5.6% (95% CI: 1.5–18.9%, I² = 81.1%):
		- 1.0% in the general population (95% CI: 0.0–23.9%, I² = 0%)
		- 7.7% in geriatric outpatients (95% CI: 1.8–27.0%, I² = 0)

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146YqSS]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Initial orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by exaggerated transient orthostatic changes, which are associated with increased risks of falls, frailty, and syncope in older adults. This study aims to provide a prevalence estimate of initial OH in adults aged 65 years or older.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1947), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to December 6, 2019. The terms 'initial orthostatic hypotension', 'postural hypotension', and 'older adults' were used. The criteria for inclusion were articles published in English with participants aged 65 years or older. Pooled analysis was conducted using random-effects models.

Out of 5,136 articles screened, 13 articles (comprising 10 cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal studies) reported data on a total of 5,465 individuals (54.5% female). These individuals were drawn from the general population (n = 4,157), geriatric outpatients (n = 1,136), institutionalized individuals (n = 55), and mixed population groups (n = 117). Blood pressure was measured continuously in 11 studies and intermittently in 2 studies.

The pooled prevalence of continuously measured initial OH was found to be 29.0% (95% CI: 22.1–36.9%, I² = 94.6%). It was 27.8% in the general population (95% CI: 17.9–40.5%, I² = 96.1%), 35.2% in geriatric outpatients (95% CI: 24.2–48.1%, I² = 95.3%), 10.0% in institutionalized individuals (95% CI: 2.4–33.1%, I² = 0%), and 21.4% in mixed populations (95% CI: 7.0–49.6%, I² = 0%).

The pooled prevalence of intermittently measured initial OH was 5.6% (95% CI: 1.5–18.9%, I² = 81.1%); 1.0% in the general population (95% CI: 0.0–23.9%, I² = 0%) and 7.7% in geriatric outpatient settings.

### Zelapar [^111V54Z1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension**: Assessments of orthostatic (supine and standing) blood pressures at different times throughout the 12-week study period in two controlled trials showed that the frequency of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and/or > 10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure) was greater with Zelapar treatment than with placebo treatment. Patients taking Zelapar were most likely to experience a decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks (2 weeks after initiating 2.5 mg Zelapar). At that time, the incidence of systolic orthostatic hypotension was about 21% in Zelapar-treated patients and 9% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was about 12% in Zelapar-treated patients and about 4% in placebo-treated patients. Thus, it appears that there may be an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension in the period after increasing the daily dose of Zelapar from 1.25 to 2.5 mg.

	- The incidence of orthostatic hypotension was higher in geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) than in non-geriatric patients. In the geriatric patients, orthostatic hypotension occurred in about 3% of Zelapar-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

- **Dyskinesia**: Zelapar may potentiate dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. In controlled trials, the incidence of dyskinesia was 6% in Zelapar-treated patients and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may lessen dyskinesia.

### Population-based study on the prevalence and risk factors of orthostatic hypotension in subjects with pre-diabetes and diabetes [^115YB1x1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Most studies on diabetic orthostatic hypotension have adopted the postural change in systolic blood pressure as the criterion, except for one study that used mean blood pressure to define orthostatic hypotension. When the criterion was a reduction in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg, the prevalence of diabetic orthostatic hypotension varied from 8.2% to 43%. Cryer et al. reported that 18% of 100 diabetic patients had orthostatic hypotension with a decline in mean blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more. We adopted a consensus criterion of orthostatic hypotension defined as a fall in blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic from lying to upright position, and the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 25.5% in our diabetic subjects. A report on the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in pre-diabetic subjects is not available, but our study showed that the prevalence in subjects with pre-diabetes was 17.7%.

Diabetes was found to be independently associated with orthostatic hypotension in our study, which is consistent with results in the literature. Diabetic orthostatic hypotension usually has a neurogenic cause associated with efferent involvement of the baroregulatory reflex arc, with damaged sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers in the splanchnic bed, muscle, and skin. An earlier laboratory study suggested that the pathophysiological defect of diabetic orthostatic hypotension is the lack of ability to increase vascular resistance resulting from impaired sympathetic function of nerves.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies: Prioritisation of treatment targets [^113ZBMJK]. The Lancet Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension are common manifestations of cardiovascular dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. Because these disorders are haemodynamic opposites, improvement in one might be achieved at the expense of worsening of the other. Thus, management decisions necessitate assessment of the individual risks for patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. Whereas neurogenic orthostatic hypotension poses risks for falls and can be associated with cognitive impairment in the short term, chronic supine hypertension can be associated with stroke and myocardial infarction in the long term.

Few clinical trial data exist for outcomes in patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension, so clinicians need to balance the potential immediate benefits of treatment for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension with the long-term risks of supine hypertension treatment, based on comorbidities and disease staging, in each patient. Future research needs to focus on ascertaining a safe degree of supine hypertension when treating neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; the effectiveness of nocturnal antihypertensive therapy in patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension; and the prevalence, scope, and therapeutic requirements for managing neurogenic orthostatic hypotension that manifests with falls or cognitive impairment, but without postural lightheadedness or near syncope.

### Igalmi [^114TkoQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Igalmi causes dose-dependent hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and bradycardia. In clinical studies, 18%, 16%, and 9% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced orthostatic hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of standing, at 2 hours post-dose. Additionally, 7%, 6%, and 1% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced a heart rate (HR) of ≤ 50 beats per minute within 2 hours of dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In clinical studies with Igalmi, patients were excluded if they had treatment with alpha-1 noradrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics, or antipsychotic drugs four hours prior to study drug administration; had a history of syncope or syncopal attacks; SBP < 110 mmHg; DBP < 70 mmHg; HR < 55 beats per minute; or had evidence of hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia, including some resulting in fatalities, have been associated with the use of another dexmedetomidine product given intravenously. Notably, Igalmi is for sublingual or buccal use and is not approved for intravenous use. Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported following the administration of this other dexmedetomidine product to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone and when administered via rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^115s3fpu]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostasis is a frequent trigger for (pre)syncope, but some forms of orthostatic (pre)syncope have a worse prognosis than others. Routine assessment of orthostatic blood pressure in the emergency department (ED) can detect classic orthostatic hypotension but often misses these other forms of orthostatic (pre)syncope. This study aimed to determine the frequency of abnormal orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in patients with (pre)syncope by using continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study in suspected patients with (pre)syncope in the ED of a tertiary care teaching hospital between January and August 2014. Orthostatic blood pressure was measured during the active lying-to-standing test with Nexfin, a continuous non-invasive finger arterial pressure measurement device. Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns were defined as normal blood pressure recovery, initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and reflex-mediated hypotension.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients recruited, measurements in 111 patients (age 63 years, 51% male) were suitable for analysis. Classic orthostatic hypotension was the most prevalent abnormal blood pressure pattern (19%), but only half of the patients received a final diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Initial orthostatic hypotension and delayed blood pressure recovery were present in 20% of the patients with (pre)syncope, of whom 45% were diagnosed as unexplained syncope. Reflex-mediated hypotension was present in 4% of the patients.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement can potentially identify more specific and concerning causes.

### In adults with hypertension, more- vs. less-intensive BP-lowering treatment reduces orthostatic hypotension [^116n72xC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The study by Juraschek et al. investigates the effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension through a systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis. This research examines whether more-intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment reduces the incidence of orthostatic hypotension in adults with hypertension. Analysis from individual participants suggests that reducing blood pressure more intensively may decrease the risk of experiencing orthostatic hypotension. The insights from these findings could improve the management of hypertension by tailoring the intensity of treatment according to individual patient needs.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^114z8RHv]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Repeating the analysis with different cutoffs for follow-up time did not yield different results. We found no association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) if the follow-up time was restricted to 5 years (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.53–2.14), 10 years (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.63–2.02), or 15 years (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.53–1.63).

The sensitivity analyses using a modified orthostatic hypotension definition for participants with hypertension attenuated the association between prevalent PD and orthostatic hypotension, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, and early orthostatic hypotension, but strengthened the association between PD and symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. The results for incident PD remained consistent.

When we defined neurogenic orthostatic hypotension using the cutoff of 15 beats per minute in heart rate, we found that prevalent PD was significantly associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.24–3.73). This adapted definition of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension did not change the results of the prospective analyses.

The complete case analysis made the odds ratios for the analysis with prevalent PD somewhat more pronounced but did not substantially change the results for incident PD.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for orthostatic hypotension (OH), an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for the diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), specifically starting with the measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Diagnostic tests for nOH**:
	- **Blood pressure testing**: The hallmark test for OH is the measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing**:
	- **In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 and 3 minutes after standing.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173wmgx]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

**Key points**: Co-existing hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is a common management dilemma. The exclusion of this cohort from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy did not alter the relative safety effects of treatment. However, the exclusion of this cohort may under-estimate the absolute risk of adverse events such as falls.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113ze6DC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, specifically in relation to orthostatic rehabilitation, SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend considering orthostatic rehabilitation. This approach should address both deconditioning affecting skeletal muscle and deconditioning affecting autonomic postural responses in patients who have been bedbound, particularly those with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance or pre-existing postural tachycardia syndrome and/or hypermobility syndromes.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of VRAYLAR and was not more frequent on VRAYLAR than placebo. Syncope was not observed.

	Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g. elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease. Such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Seizures**: Like other antipsychotic drugs, VRAYLAR may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.
