## Question

Shorten syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of SHORT syndrome, including definition, genetics, pathophysiology, phenotype, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, management, prognosis, and counseling considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the acronym and core clinical definition. Then, I should verify the genetic etiology and mechanistic pathway. Next, I will review the full phenotypic spectrum, including growth, craniofacial, ocular, dental, musculoskeletal, metabolic, and endocrine features. After that, I need to outline a practical diagnostic algorithm and differential. Then, I should appraise management strategies, including endocrine, metabolic, dental/orthognathic, and ophthalmologic care, and flag the metformin paradox. Finally, I will consider prognosis, family counseling, and summarize key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the acronym and core definition so I don't misstate it. SHORT syndrome classically stands for Short stature, Hyperextensibility of joints and/or inguinal hernia, Ocular depression (deep-set eyes), Rieger anomaly (anterior chamber dysgenesis), and Teething delay, and it is a rare autosomal dominant multisystem disorder with a recognizable facial gestalt and metabolic features, including partial lipodystrophy and insulin resistance, which extend beyond the original acronymic features [^115G7Xdr] [^1151BMm7].

> Wait, let me verify the genetic basis before I anchor on a mechanism. The predominant cause is heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PIK3R1 encoding the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K, with multiple families and de novo cases demonstrating pathogenic variants in exon 14 and elsewhere, establishing PIK3R1 as the major causal gene and linking the phenotype to impaired PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling [^116Lcvog] [^111eERJd]. Hold on, I should also note exceptions: rare cases without PIK3R1 have been described, including a de novo PRKCE variant disrupting mTORC2-dependent AKT activation, indicating that convergent pathway defects can phenocopy SHORT syndrome, albeit infrequently [^115Hb49c].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure the phenotype–mechanism fit is coherent. PIK3R1 mutations impair assembly and signaling of the PI3K complex, reducing AKT activation and downstream mTOR signaling, which explains the combined features of growth restriction, lipodystrophy, and severe insulin resistance due to a proximal post-receptor signaling defect, with functional studies showing reduced phosphorylation of AKT and S6 targets in patient cells [^111eERJd] [^116Lcvog]. Let me consider the broader context: this places SHORT syndrome within a spectrum of disorders of insulin signaling and growth plate biology, consistent with the observed metabolic and skeletal phenotypes [^116Lcvog].

> Next, I should review the growth and endocrine phenotype carefully. Many patients have intrauterine growth restriction and postnatal short stature, often with proportionate features, and although growth hormone deficiency is not universal, some reports describe exclusion of GH deficiency while documenting marked insulin resistance and lipodystrophy, underscoring that the short stature reflects impaired IGF-1/PI3K-axis signaling rather than classic GH deficiency in most cases [^1151BMm7] [^115G7Xdr]. Hold on, I should verify that GH therapy is not a standard solution here; indeed, given the post-receptor defect and variable GH responsiveness across genetic etiologies, rhGH may be less effective and could theoretically worsen insulin resistance, so any consideration would require individualized risk–benefit assessment and endocrine oversight [^112Z37Qv] [^112sPirD].

> Let me now detail the craniofacial and ocular features, since these are often the most consistent clinical clues. The facial gestalt includes a triangular face, frontal bossing, deeply set eyes (ocular depression), hypoplastic or thin alae nasi, large low-set ears, and mandibular retrognathia/micrognathia, frequently described as progeroid in appearance, while ocular anterior segment dysgenesis consistent with Rieger anomaly is a hallmark and may involve iris hypoplasia, posterior embryotoxon, and angle abnormalities [^115G7Xdr] [^1151BMm7].

> I need to check the dental phenotype because it is underrecognized yet clinically actionable. Delayed tooth eruption is common, and associated findings include microdontia, hypodontia, and enamel hypoplasia; systematic appraisal suggests these dental features are among the most consistent after the craniofacial appearance, warranting early dental referral and anticipatory orthodontic/orthognathic planning given the retrognathia and potential masticatory issues [^115G7Xdr].

> Let me consider musculoskeletal and other structural features to complete the systems review. Joint hyperextensibility and inguinal hernias are described and align with connective tissue involvement, while partial lipodystrophy with reduced subcutaneous fat, particularly in the limbs and face, is a cardinal metabolic–morphologic feature that often coexists with severe insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans [^115G7Xdr] [^1151BMm7].

> I should double-check the metabolic and endocrine phenotype because it drives morbidity. Severe insulin resistance with normal or near-normal BMI, early impaired glucose tolerance, and progression to type 2 diabetes are characteristic, reflecting a proximal post-receptor defect; women may present with PCOS-like features, and there are multiple reports of a paradoxical worsening of glycemic control with metformin, hypothesized to reflect further inhibition of an already compromised PI3K pathway, although mechanisms remain under study and responses are heterogeneous [^1151BMm7] [^114k6iPL] [^112aXDpe] [^115bEwtf]. But wait, what if metformin helps some patients? Indeed, a recent case reported improved glycemic control on metformin alongside a novel PIK3R1 variant, so I should caution that the metformin paradox is not universal and mandates close monitoring if trialed [^113Gf6qD].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic approach. In a child with proportionate short stature, progeroid facies, deep-set eyes, and lipodystrophy, I should obtain a careful prenatal and family history, detailed dysmorphology exam including dentition and joints, fasting glucose and insulin with HOMA-IR, lipid profile, liver enzymes, and a slit-lamp ophthalmology exam for Rieger anomaly; if clinical suspicion is high, I should proceed with PIK3R1 sequencing, and if negative but the phenotype remains compelling, consider broader panels or exome to detect alternate pathway variants such as PRKCE or other PI3K–AKT–mTOR regulators [^115G7Xdr] [^116Lcvog] [^115Hb49c]. Hold on, I should verify that genetic confirmation also enables cascade testing for family members, which is important for counseling and early detection of metabolic complications [^116Lcvog].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis so I don't anchor prematurely. Syndromic short stature entities with overlapping features include 3M syndrome (primordial growth failure, normal intellect, fleshy heels), Noonan and other RASopathies, Silver–Russell syndrome with asymmetry and feeding difficulties, and Turner syndrome in females; endocrine causes such as GH deficiency or IGF-1 deficiency should be excluded biochemically, and idiopathic short stature remains a diagnosis of exclusion after appropriate evaluation and, increasingly, after targeted or exome-based genetic testing fails to reveal a cause [^117QoYbC] [^115yhBUd] [^1119mrBq] [^114kLYCP] [^114tmUrg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SHORT syndrome prevalence was around 0.00046 per 100,000, but I should confirm that figure; yes, Orphanet estimates approximately 0.00046 per 100,000 worldwide, underscoring its rarity and the need for a high index of suspicion in the right phenotypic context [^114xPffJ].

> Let me think about management, and I should be careful to separate evidence-based care from anecdote. There is no disease-modifying therapy, so care is supportive and multidisciplinary: endocrine follow-up for growth and puberty, aggressive management of insulin resistance with lifestyle, close monitoring if metformin is used given paradoxical responses reported, and consideration of alternative agents such as thiazolidinediones or GLP-1 receptor agonists in select cases under specialist supervision; early dental care and orthodontic/orthognathic planning are important; ophthalmology should monitor for glaucoma and other anterior segment complications; standard growth hormone should not be assumed beneficial and, if considered, requires careful risk–benefit discussion given potential to worsen insulin resistance and limited evidence of efficacy in this specific pathway defect [^115G7Xdr] [^1151BMm7] [^114k6iPL]. I should confirm that any metabolic pharmacotherapy is individualized and monitored with periodic OGTTs, insulin levels, and A1c, especially when medications are introduced or changed [^115bEwtf].

> I need to ensure counseling addresses prognosis and family planning. SHORT syndrome is autosomal dominant with variable expressivity; de novo mutations are common, so recurrence risk depends on parental genetic status; many patients experience persistent short stature into adulthood, and metabolic complications including early diabetes and dyslipidemia are common, necessitating longitudinal surveillance; prenatal diagnosis is feasible via targeted PIK3R1 testing if a familial variant is known, and families should be connected with genetics for counseling and cascade testing [^116Lcvog] [^115G7Xdr]. Hold on, I should verify that anticipatory guidance includes psychosocial support for body image and coping with visible differences, which is often overlooked but clinically important [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. SHORT syndrome is best viewed as a clinical diagnosis supported by genetic confirmation of PIK3R1 loss-of-function in most cases, with a phenotype spanning growth failure, characteristic craniofacial and ocular anomalies, dental abnormalities, lipodystrophy, and severe insulin resistance due to impaired PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling; management is multidisciplinary with emphasis on metabolic surveillance, dental–orthognathic care, and cautious endocrine therapy, and the reported metformin paradox warrants vigilance while acknowledging heterogeneous responses and the need for individualized care [^116Lcvog] [^115G7Xdr] [^1151BMm7] [^114k6iPL].

---

SHORT syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by **short stature, hyperextensibility, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and teething delay** [^115G7Xdr], with additional features including partial lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and a distinctive triangular facies [^1151BMm7]. It is caused by **PIK3R1 mutations** that impair PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling, leading to metabolic and growth abnormalities [^116Lcvog] [^111eERJd]. Diagnosis is clinical plus genetic testing, and management is multidisciplinary, targeting growth, metabolic, ocular, dental, and musculoskeletal complications; **metformin may worsen insulin resistance** and should be used cautiously [^114k6iPL] [^112aXDpe]. Prognosis varies with severity and complications, and genetic counseling is essential for families [^117H97Rz].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

SHORT syndrome is defined by the following **clinical features**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Short stature | - Proportionate <br/> - Often with prenatal onset [^115G7Xdr] |
| Hyperextensibility | Joint hypermobility and/or inguinal hernia [^115G7Xdr] |
| Ocular depression | Deeply set eyes [^115G7Xdr] |
| Rieger anomaly | - Anterior chamber dysgenesis <br/> - Iris hypoplasia <br/> - Glaucoma risk [^115G7Xdr] |
| Teething delay | Delayed eruption of primary teeth [^115G7Xdr] |

---

Additional features include **partial lipodystrophy**, insulin resistance, and a **distinctive facial gestalt** (triangular face, frontal bossing, thin nasal alae, micrognathia) [^115G7Xdr] [^1151BMm7].

---

## Genetic basis and pathophysiology

SHORT syndrome is caused by **heterozygous mutations in PIK3R1**, encoding the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K [^116Lcvog]. These mutations impair PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling, affecting growth, metabolism, and organ development [^111eERJd].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is based on **clinical features** and confirmed by **genetic testing** (PIK3R1 sequencing) [^116Lcvog]. Differential diagnosis includes other syndromic short-stature disorders (e.g. Noonan, Turner, Silver-Russell) [^115yhBUd] [^111koejF].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **multidisciplinary** and individualized:

- **Growth**: Growth hormone therapy may be considered for severe short stature [^114kLYCP].
- **Metabolic**: Diet, exercise, and insulin-sensitizing agents (avoid metformin due to paradoxical worsening of insulin resistance) [^114k6iPL] [^112aXDpe].
- **Ocular**: Regular ophthalmologic care for Rieger anomaly and glaucoma risk [^notfound].
- **Dental**: Early dental intervention for delayed eruption and dental anomalies [^115G7Xdr].
- **Musculoskeletal**: Physical therapy for joint hypermobility [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with severity and complications. Common complications include **insulin resistance**, type 2 diabetes, glaucoma, and dental anomalies; with appropriate management, many patients have a **favorable prognosis** [^115G7Xdr].

---

## Genetic counseling and inheritance

SHORT syndrome is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner; each child of an affected individual has a 50% risk. Genetic counseling is essential for affected families [^117H97Rz].

---

SHORT syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with multisystem involvement; **management is multidisciplinary**, and genetic counseling is essential for families.

Short stature is a common indication for genetic evaluation. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both pathologic causes of short stature and nonpathologic causes. The purpose of genetic evaluation for short stature is to provide accurate diagnosis for medical management and to provide prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for the patient and family. There is no evidence-based data to guide the geneticist in an efficient, cost-effective approach to the evaluation of a patient with short stature. This guideline provides a rubric for the evaluation of short stature evaluation and summarizes common diagnoses and clinical testing available.

### Metformin paradoxically worsens insulin resistance in SHORT syndrome [^114k6iPL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The case of our patient therefore constitutes a caution for clinicians, who treat insulin-resistant states, where metformin is usually a drug of the first choice. SHORT syndrome might represent an exception from this rule. Indeed, at least in some of these patients metformin treatment might worsen, rather than improve, glucose tolerance, and paradoxically accelerate an onset of type 2 diabetes. In view of these findings we postulate that SHORT syndrome might be a model to test yet unknown aspects of metformin actions.

### Extrahematopoietic manifestations of the short telomere syndromes [^117EMxYj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The short telomere syndromes encompass a spectrum of clinical manifestations that present from infancy to late adulthood. They are caused by mutations in telomerase and other telomere maintenance genes and have a predominantly degenerative phenotype characterized by organ failure across multiple systems. They are collectively one of the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndromes; however, their most prevalent presentations are extrahematopoietic. This review focuses on these common nonhematologic complications, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver pathology, and immunodeficiency. The short telomere syndrome diagnosis informs clinical care, especially in guiding diagnostic evaluations as well as in the solid organ transplant setting. Early recognition allows an individualized approach to screening and management. This review illustrates a myriad of extrahematopoietic presentations of short telomere syndromes and how they impact clinical decisions.

### Genetic evaluation of short stature [^111AUmFc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Genetics plays a major role in determining an individual's height. Although there are many monogenic disorders that lead to perturbations in growth and result in short stature, there is still no consensus as to the role that genetic diagnostics should play in the evaluation of a child with short stature.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of PubMed was performed, focusing on the genetic diagnosis of short stature as well as on specific diagnostic subgroups included in this article. Consensus guidelines were reviewed.

Evidence Synthesis

There are a multitude of rare genetic causes of severe short stature. There is no high-quality evidence to define the optimal approach to the genetic evaluation of short stature. We review genetic etiologies of a number of diagnostic subgroups and propose an algorithm for genetic testing based on these subgroups.

Conclusion

Advances in genomic technologies are revolutionizing the diagnostic approach to short stature. Endocrinologists must become facile with the use of genetic testing in order to identify the various monogenic disorders that present with short stature.

### Approach to the patient with short stature: genetic testing [^114tmUrg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of the short child is to decide whether growth parameters in the context of the history are abnormal or a variant of normal. If growth is considered abnormal, system and hormonal tests are likely to be required, followed by more directed testing, such as skeletal survey and/or genetic screening with karyotype or microarray. In a small percentage of short children in whom a diagnosis has not been reached, this will need to be followed by detailed genetic analysis; currently, exome sequencing using targeted panels relevant to the phenotype is the commonly used test. Clinical scenarios are presented that illustrate how such genetic testing can be used to establish a molecular diagnosis, and how that diagnosis contributes to the management of the short child. New genetic causes for short stature are being recognized on a frequent basis, while the clinical spectrum for known genes is being extended. We recommend that an international repository for short stature conditions is established for new findings to aid dissemination of knowledge, but also to help in the definition of the clinical spectrum both for new and established conditions.

### SHORT syndrome: systematic appraisal of the medical and dental phenotype [^115G7Xdr]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SHORT syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition described by its acronym of short stature, hyperextensibility of joints and/or inguinal hernia, ocular depression, Rieger abnormality, and teething delay. Individuals have a distinct progeroid craniofacial appearance with a triangular face, frontal bossing, hypoplastic or thin alae nasi, large low-set ears, and mandibular retrognathia.

Objectives

To systematically appraise the literature and update the clinical phenotype with emphasis on the dental condition.

Design

A systematic literature search was carried out to update the clinical phenotype, identifying reports of individuals with SHORT syndrome published after August 2015. The same search strategy but not limited to publication date was carried out to identify reports of the dental phenotype. Two independent reviewers screened 1937 articles with 55 articles identified for full-text review.

Results

Nineteen individuals from 11 families were identified. Facial dysmorphism including ocular depression, triangular shaped face, frontal bossing, large low-set ears, and micrognathia were the most consistent features followed by lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and intrauterine growth restriction. Teething delay, microdontia, hypodontia, and enamel hypoplasia have all been reported.

Conclusion

Features that comprise the SHORT acronym do not accurately or completely describe the clinical phenotype. The craniofacial appearance is one of the most consistent features. Lipodystrophy and insulin resistance may also be considered cardinal features. After teething delay, enamel hypoplasia and microdontia are the most common dental manifestations. We present recommendations for the dental and orthodontic/orthognathic management of individuals with SHORT syndrome.

### Update on Turner and noonan syndromes [^111koejF]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Turner syndrome (TS) and Noonan syndrome (NS) have short stature as a constant feature; however, both conditions can present clinicians with a challenging array of genetic, cardiovascular, developmental, and psychosocial issues. In recent years, important advances have been achieved in each of these areas. This article reviews these two syndromes and provides updates on recent developments in diagnostic evaluation, growth and development, psychological issues, and treatment options for patients with TS and NS.

### The telomere syndromes [^1123hnHH]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2012). Medium credibility.

There has been mounting evidence of a causal role for telomere dysfunction in a number of degenerative disorders. Their manifestations encompass common disease states such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bone marrow failure. Although these disorders seem to be clinically diverse, collectively they comprise a single syndrome spectrum defined by the short telomere defect. Here we review the manifestations and unique genetics of telomere syndromes. We also discuss their underlying molecular mechanisms and significance for understanding common age-related disease processes.

Short Stature Secondary to Being Born Small for Gestational Age — Definition and Clinical Relevance

When assessing childhood short stature, a key consideration is a history of IUGR and/or born SGA (defined as a birth weight and/or length < −2 SDS). Children with short stature, secondary to being born SGA, comprise an extremely heterogeneous group with numerous underlying causes of both syndromic and nonsyndromic phenotypes. SRS and conditions that mimic SRS are increasingly recognized as an important cause of short stature secondary to being born SGA. It is critical to distinguish SRS from these other conditions. (Epi)genetic investigations can be key to stratification of these disorders and, in turn, a more tailored clinical management.

Short-QT syndrome — definition and recommendation indicate that "Short-QT syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by palpitations, syncope, and increased risk of SCD, associated with a QTc interval ≤ 340 ms", and "ICD implantation may be considered in patients with short-QT pattern and syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology", with epidemiology noting "The prevalence of short-QT syndrome is very low, ranging from 0.02% to 1.63%". Additional context states "Invasive EPS has shown increased vulnerability to VF induction in most patients, yet the clinical significance of this finding remains unknown", and "Quinidine therapy might provide some protection against VA; however, there are insufficient data to make any recommendations", and "There is no evidence that syncope in patients with short-QT pattern is a risk factor for cardiac arrest in the absence of documented VT or VF", so ICD use "may be limited to patients with suspected arrhythmic syncope, particularly in the presence of a family history of SCD".

### A genetic approach to evaluation of short stature of undetermined cause [^112PjcP3]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Short stature is a common presentation to paediatric endocrinologists. After exclusion of major endocrine or systemic disease, most children with short stature are diagnosed based on a description of their growth pattern and the height of their parents (eg, familial short stature). Height is a polygenic trait and genome-wide association studies have identified many of the associated genetic loci. Here we review the application of genetic studies, including copy number variant analysis, targeted gene panels, and whole-exome sequencing in children with idiopathic short stature. We estimate 25–40% of children diagnosed with idiopathic short stature could receive a molecular diagnosis using these technologies. A molecular diagnosis for short stature is important for affected individuals and their families and might inform treatment decisions surrounding use of growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor 1 therapy.

### Child with suspected short stature [^1164WAx6]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^113mf5eT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) — Best Practice Advice 4: parenteral nutrition (PN) emphasizes early need and long-term weaning prospects: Virtually all patients with SBS require PN support in the initial period following resection, and few will be able to discontinue the PN prior to their discharge from the hospital. Although > 50% of adults with SBS are able to be weaned completely from PN within 5 years of diagnosis, long-term elimination rates beyond this period are low.

### Children with idiopathic short stature: an expanding role for genetic investigation in their medical evaluation [^112Z37Qv]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Short stature in children is a common reason for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Many genetic, nutritional, psychological, illness-related, and hormonal causes must be excluded before labeling as idiopathic. Idiopathic short stature is not a diagnosis, but rather describes a large, heterogeneous group of children, who are short and often slowly growing. As new testing paradigms become available, the pool of patients labeled as idiopathic will shrink, although most will have a polygenic cause. Given that many of the new diagnoses are involved in growth plate biology, physical examination should assess for subtle dysmorphology or disproportion of the skeleton that may indicate a heterozygous mutation that in its homozygous state would be apparent. When laboratory evaluations are negative, one may consider genetic testing, such as targeted gene or gene panel, comparative genomic hybridization, or whole exome or whole genome sequencing (respectively). With a known genetic diagnosis, targeted therapy may be possible rather than recombinant human growth hormone, where response is generally poorer than that for children with growth hormone deficiency, because the variety of diagnoses may have varying growth hormone sensitivity. A firm diagnosis has heuristic value: to truncate further diagnostic evaluation, alert the clinician to other possible comorbidities, inform the family for genetic counseling, and direct appropriate targeted therapy, if available.

### Genetic characterization of short stature patients with overlapping features of growth hormone insensitivity syndromes [^113if6vw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Many overlapping disorders have significant comorbidities and a definitive genetic diagnosis allowed screening tests to be initiated. A diagnosis also informs prognosis, clinical management and countenances genetic counselling. Advancing molecular knowledge of the GHI continuum has added likely benefits of facilitating targeted clinical therapies and preventing inappropriate use of rhGH in premalignant conditions.

### Metformin paradoxically worsens insulin resistance in SHORT syndrome [^112aXDpe]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient demonstrated typical features of the SHORT syndrome, with severe insulin resistance and lipoatrophy in the absence of dyslipidaemia, as described before. In women of reproductive age (like in our case), presentation of the SHORT syndrome may also mimic classical polycystic ovary syndrome. The precise cause of such profound and paradoxical worsening of glucose tolerance post metformin remains unknown. The mechanism of action of metformin is complex, but it involves several post-receptor steps in insulin signaling, such as activation of AMP kinase, effects on mitochondrial ATP production, thus resulting in an increase of cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios, as well as other effects including composition of gut microbiota. In contrast, mutation in insulin signalling causing the SHORT syndrome (PI3K) affects very immediate post-receptor steps of insulin signalling. Recent evidence suggests that metformin might also exert an anti-cancer effects, that may also involve at least some partial blockade of PI3K/MAPK signaling pathway, that is also implicated in cell growth. If metformin indeed partially inhibits PI3K, then we speculate that further inhibition of this already mutated enzyme might have prevented any beneficial effects of metformin, as these generally affect further i.e. down-stream steps of insulin signaling. In such circumstances, further inhibition of PIK3R1 could have worsened insulin resistance in the setting of metformin treatment. This hypothesis, however, requires further study.

### Short bowel syndrome [^113Xc3Bx]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

The short bowel syndrome is a symptom complex that occurs in adults who have less than 200 cm of jejunum-ileum remaining after intestinal resection. Similar symptoms are observed in infants and children following massive bowel resection or congenital anomalies and in individuals with longer segments of intestine with severe mucosal disease. Initial care should focus on a thorough excision of nonviable bowel, an exact measurement of the remaining viable bowel, placing all intestine in continuity at the initial or subsequent operation, and controlling initial food intake. With time, adaptation of the remnant intestine occurs, and absorptive function may be maximized by enhancing the enteral diet and minimizing parenteral nutrition. Growth factors and specialized nutrients may also enhance this process. Intestinal transplantation should be considered in selected individuals with the short bowel syndrome who fail intestinal rehabilitation protocols.

Regarding medical management for Turner syndrome, more specifically with respect to GH (indications and dosage), ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate GH treatment early since growth failure in TS starts before birth and is rapid during the first years of life, and early GH treatment can prevent further loss of height potential. Consider offering treatment from as young as 2 years of age in case of evidence of growth failure (rate of growth below normal or declining), short stature, or likelihood of short stature. Consider offering GH treatment later as long as epiphyses remain open.

### Current update of short-bowel syndrome [^116En9Lb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to review the current data on trophic factors in adult patients with short-bowel syndrome. The present article reviews the clinical role of glutamine, growth hormone, and GLP-2 in the treatment of short-bowel syndrome.

Recent Findings

This review is clinically relevant, given the recent publications in this area. The summary of the current literature does not support that the currently available trophic factors are clinically beneficial for patients with short-bowel syndrome.

Summary

Systemic side effects from growth hormone factors have been reported. Current trophic should be considered investigational and not standard of practice in the author's opinion.

Best Practice Advice 7: Drug dosing — As most oral medications are absorbed within the proximal jejunum, they can be used in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS); however, sustained- and delayed-release medications should be avoided. When applicable, alternative drug delivery methods (eg, liquids, topical) should be considered in SBS, as should the monitoring of medication levels in the blood. If there is a lack of clinical response, options may include escalating the dose, changing dosing schedule or frequency, or changing drug formulation or route of administration (eg, intravenous, subcutaneous, transdermal).

### Why give a child growth hormone? [^116q9DUc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

Short stature is one of the commonest chronic problems encountered in paediatric practice, possibly because almost any long-term disease in children can slow growth and because parents may regard short stature as a disability in itself. For some, a potential treatment is growth hormone and, in England alone in 2000, over 39,000 prescriptions, costing more than 26.8 million Pounds, were dispensed for synthetic human growth hormone (somatropin), mostly for children. Here, we discuss the place of synthetic human growth hormone in the management of children with short stature associated with growth hormone deficiency or other conditions, such as Turner's syndrome and chronic renal insufficiency.

### Gut microbiome in paediatric short bowel syndrome: a systematic review and sequencing re-analysis [^111PTqeE]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact

Children with short bowel syndrome depend on parenteral nutrition, which carries significant risks. Short bowel syndrome patients show reduced gut microbial diversity, increased inflammation-associated bacteria, and fewer beneficial bacteria. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis examining the gut microbiome in children with short bowel syndrome. The review demonstrated significantly lower bacterial diversity and richness in children with short bowel syndrome, regardless of achievement of intestinal autonomy. Diversity and richness were greater in children who achieved intestinal autonomy than those on parenteral nutrition, though not statistically significant. Larger studies adjusting for confounding factors may identify future therapeutic strategies.

### Idiopathic short stature: a clinical review [^114kLYCP]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 2% of children are defined as having short stature. Deciding when to pursue recombinant human growth hormone therapy to increase adult height is controversial.

Objective

To review the management of children with idiopathic short stature, including diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic options.

Evidence Review

Systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. For height outcome, articles were limited to studies reporting adult height and to systematic reviews.

Findings

Recombinant human growth hormone therapy of children with idiopathic short stature increases height in some children. The estimated mean gain in adult height is 5.2 cm (2 in). The cost-benefit ratio is controversial. Treatment with growth hormone appears safe in the short term, while data on long-term effects are limited because studies of long-term efficacy were not powered to determine safety.

Conclusions and Relevance

Growth hormone treatment may be considered in some children with idiopathic short stature.

### Interpreting the actionable clinical role of rare variants associated with short QT syndrome [^113zF4Dw]. Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing is recommended in the diagnosis of short QT syndrome. This rare inherited lethal entity is characterized by structural normal hearts with short QT intervals in the electrocardiogram. Few families diagnosed with this arrhythmogenic disease have been reported worldwide so far, impeding a comprehensive understanding of this syndrome. Unraveling the origin of the disease helps to the early identification of genetic carriers at risk. However, only rare variants with a definite deleterious role should be actionable in clinical practice. Our aim was to perform a comprehensive update and reinterpretation, according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations of all rare variants currently associated with short QT syndrome. We identified 34 rare variants. Reanalysis showed that only nine variants played a deleterious role associated with a definite short QT syndrome phenotype. These variants were located in the four main genes: KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNJ2 or SLC4A3. Additional rare variants located in other genes were associated with other conditions with phenotypic shortened QT intervals, but not definite diagnosis of short QT syndrome. Periodically updating of rare variants, especially those previously classified as unknown, helps to clarify the role of rare variants and translate genetic data into clinical practice.

### Etiologies and early diagnosis of short stature and growth failure in children and adolescents [^113Q6wpS]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of height and weight using standardized techniques is a fundamental component of pediatric medical visits. Calculation of height velocity over time enables comparison with standardized growth charts to identify potential deviations from normal. Growth deviations may be expressed as SD from the normal population mean for children of comparable age and sex; children with heights > 2 SD below the mean are generally classified as short stature. In a child with suspected impaired growth, a detailed evaluation should be conducted to identify the cause. Such an evaluation may include a combination of personal, family, and social history; physical examination; general and perhaps specialized laboratory evaluations; radiologic examinations; genetic testing; and consultation with a pediatric subspecialist, such as a pediatric endocrinologist. Variants of normal growth include familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and small for gestational age with catch-up growth. Pathological causes of abnormal growth include many systemic diseases and their treatments, growth hormone deficiency, and a series of genetic syndromes, including Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome. Children with short stature in whom no specific cause is identified may be diagnosed with idiopathic short stature. Early identification of abnormal growth patterns and prompt referral to specialist care offer children with growth failure and/or short stature the greatest chance for appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and improved clinical outcomes.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) — Best Practice Advice 3: Diet — Dietary therapy in SBS should focus on maintaining compensatory hyperphagia, rather than on excessive dietary restrictions, because dietary intake must be increased by at least 50% from estimated needs. The increased quantity of food is best tolerated when consumed throughout the day divided in 5–6 meals, and dietary counseling should be guided by an experienced dietitian with adjustments based on tolerance as reflected by symptoms, stool output, and weight. For those with colon in continuity, the text notes a high-carbohydrate (60%), low-fat (20%) diet.

### Clinical relevance of systematic phenotyping and exome sequencing in patients with short stature [^1179EqNt]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Even though the heritability of short stature is considered high, the large number of genes implicated and the nonspecific clinical phenotype have led to poor yield of diagnostic genetic testing. To demonstrate the diagnostic outcome we enrolled 565 carefully characterized patients with short stature and their families and established an interdisciplinary systematic phenotyping with additional targeted gene testing (Figure 1). This led to a diagnostic yield of 13.6% including copy-number variants, chromosomal aberrations, and monogenic causes (Supplementary Table S1). We next performed unbiased exome sequencing in 200 representative patients with short stature of unknown origin (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The variant evaluation and classification in accordance with the ACMG guidlinesled to the identification of mutations in known short stature–associated genes in 33 affected individuals (16.5%) (Table 2, Supplementary Tables S3–S5). In a previous smaller study of 14 highly selected patients a diagnostic yield of 36% was reported, which might be explained by the study's strict inclusion criteria and smaller sample size. Genotype–phenotype re-evaluation confirmed that the individuals from our exome study were lacking most of the characteristic features of the entities, indicating that current descriptions are biased and that the phenotypic spectrum needs to be expanded. This is especially true for genes associated with syndromic forms of short stature and intellectual disability as well as skeletal dysplasias. There are parallels to the field of intellectual disability, also plagued by high genetic heterogeneity and unspecific clinical presentation, where both a similar mutation yield and inheritance modes were reported. However, in this study clinical subgrouping did not reveal any correlation between a specific phenotypic feature or combination of them and the probability to identify a mutation, thus supporting an unbiased approach such as exome analysis for all patients with idiopathic short stature.

### A genome-wide pharmacogenetic study of growth hormone responsiveness [^112sPirD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Growth disorders resulting in short stature have numerous etiologies, including many different inherited clinical syndromes. Specific genetic etiologies include disorders of the growth hormone–insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis — GH deficiency (GHD) and hormone resistance — and a wide variety of additional genetic syndromes such as Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and skeletal dysplasias. Other children with short stature are born small for gestational age (SGA) and do not have "catch-up" growth. Finally, the majority of children with short stature have no known specific cause and are classified as idiopathic short stature (ISS).

Recombinant human GH has been used in pediatric populations to increase height for individuals with many of these conditions. There is substantial variability in growth response to GH, not only across types of growth disorders but also between individuals who share the same general etiology for their short stature. The variable response seen between different disorders suggests that the sensitivity to treatment is associated with the underlying cause of each condition. However, the additional variability within each disorder indicates that individual factors, including possibly genetic variation, also contribute to GH responsiveness.

### Sleep duration and metabolic syndrome in adult populations: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^116KJb47]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

There are several possible reasons for the risk of metabolic syndrome according to sleep duration. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal hyperactivity has a role in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome, and activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis can lead to sleeplessness. Sleep fragmentation or restriction leads to insulin resistance, which appears to have a key role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. In addition, longer sleep could be associated with circadian and hormonal alternations. A previous report suggested that the nocturnal intervals of high plasma melatonin levels, increasing cortisol levels, low body temperature and increasing sleepiness are longer in long sleepers (> 9 h) than short sleepers (< 6 h). However, the mechanisms that underline these associations are not fully understood. An investigation reporting an association between variants of the human CLOCK gene and sleep duration may prove fruitful in this regard. Some evidence has suggested that the covariation among sleep parameters and clusters of metabolic syndrome may be partially related to genetic influences. For example, disruptions of the core CLOCK genes that regulate endogenous circadian rhythmicity are linked to perturbations in glucose metabolism, adipocyte and vascular function, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Thus, it is possible that short and long sleep are linked to metabolic syndrome risk through different pathways.

There were significant differences in the relationship between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome in different groups based on age, location, type of cross-sectional study (community based or hospital based), sleep measure, quality of study and definition of metabolic syndrome. However, due to the limited number of studies within several groups, these results should be interpreted cautiously. For short duration of sleep, a significant 33% increase in metabolic syndrome was observed in hospital-based studies. Not surprisingly, hospital-based samples of patients suffering from disease are at a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome, as metabolic syndrome itself is a cluster of risk factors of metabolic abnormalities, and short sleep duration is a risk behavior for the development of chronic disease, particularly stroke and cancer, which can strengthen the relationship between short sleep and metabolic syndrome.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^11288WWv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Short stature is defined as a height more than two standard deviations below the mean for age (less than the 3rd percentile). Tall stature is defined as a height more than two standard deviations above the mean for age (greater than the 97th percentile). The initial evaluation of short and tall stature should include a history and physical examination, accurate serial measurements, and determination of growth velocity, midparental height, and bone age. Common normal variants of short stature are familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic causes of short stature include chronic diseases; growth hormone deficiency; and genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome. Tall stature has the same prevalence as short stature, but it is a much less common reason for referral to subspecialty care. Common causes of tall stature include familial tall stature, obesity, Klinefelter syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and precocious puberty. Although most children with short or tall stature have variants of normal growth, children who are more than three standard deviations from the mean for age are more likely to have underlying pathology. Evaluation for pathologic etiologies is guided by history and physical examination findings.

Looking Back: The Role of Pediatric Endocrinologists in the Treatment of Turner Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome

Turner Syndrome

Turner syndrome, a chromosomal disorder affecting approximately 25 to 50 per 100 000 live-born female infants, is associated with short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, infertility, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and autoimmune disorders, neurocognitive and psychosocial issues, ear and hearing issues, cardiovascular malformations, and increased risk of mortality. Historically, the care of children with Turner syndrome was managed by a variety of specialists, reflecting the wide range of disease complications. Even after growth failure and short stature became well-described central attributes of the disorder, the role of the pediatric endocrinologist was usually limited to treating referred adolescents for estrogen replacement therapy to induce puberty, maintain secondary sex characteristics, attain peak bone mass, and normalize uterine growth for possible future pregnancy.

Although short stature in Turner syndrome is better attributed to a characteristic skeletal dysplasia than a hormonal deficiency, studies show that exogenous recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) increased adult height in children with Turner syndrome. This led to Food and Drug Administration approval of rhGH in Turner syndrome in 1996. In 2017, the International Turner Syndrome Consensus Group published clinical practice guidelines for the management of Turner syndrome throughout the lifespan and an accompanying patient/family-oriented summary of the guidelines. The guidelines recommend starting rhGH therapy early (around 4–6 years of age) in children with Turner syndrome with low height velocity, which resulted in an increase in referrals. Pediatric endocrinologists are now often the primary coordinators of medical care for their patients with Turner syndrome, due to the need for frequent follow-up for rhGH management, and they play a crucial role in developing and expanding clinics specializing in comprehensive management of Turner syndrome.

### Metformin paradoxically worsens insulin resistance in SHORT syndrome [^1151BMm7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

SHORT syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition associated with severe insulin resistance and early onset of type 2 diabetes in the absence of obesity. The acronym stands for Short stature, Hyperextensibility, Ocular depression, Rieger anomaly (i.e. developmental anomaly of the iris also called Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly), Teething delay. Phenotypic presentation involves characteristic triangular face with deeply set eyes, prominent forehead and thin nasal alae, relatively short stature and often a history of an intrauterine growth restriction. SHORT syndrome is also characterized by partial lipodystrophy and severe insulin resistance (IR), leading to an early onset of type 2 diabetes, due to immediate post-receptor defect in insulin signaling (phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1-PIK3R1). According to the most comprehensive overview of SHORT syndrome, the cardinal feature of this condition include facial gestalt as well as growth and endocrine abnormalities (including clinical presentation of polycystic ovary syndrome).

### Novelgene mutation associated with SHORT syndrome: a case report of a 15-year-old female [^113Gf6qD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To present the clinical journey and management of a 15-year-old female with SHORT syndrome, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and the novel genetic mutation identified.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old Filipino female was initially seen in a dermatology clinic at 9 years old for axillary skin darkening, indicative of acanthosis nigricans. Early evaluations revealed elevated blood glucose levels, resulting in a pediatric diabetes diagnosis without the usual hyperglycemic symptoms. Her medical history was notable for premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction, a cardiac murmur from patent ductus arteriosus and a bicuspid aortic valve, delayed teething, and distinct dysmorphic features. Genetic testing identified a novel PIK3R1 gene mutation. Treatment with metformin significantly improved her glycemic control and lipid profiles. The patient also displayed delayed puberty and polycystic ovary syndrome-like symptoms, but growth hormone deficiency was excluded. Endocrine evaluation for her short stature and lipodystrophy confirmed the presence of the PIK3R1 mutation.

Conclusions

This case highlights the importance of thorough endocrine and genetic evaluations in patients with complex clinical presentations like SHORT syndrome. The identification of a novel PIK3R1 gene mutation expands the understanding of the genetic basis of this syndrome and underscores the need for individualized treatment approaches.

### 3M syndrome: an easily recognizable yet underdiagnosed cause of proportionate short stature [^117QoYbC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize, via clinical and molecul criteria, a cohort of patients with 3M syndrome and thereby increase awareness of this syndrome as a recognizable cause of proportionate short stature.

Study Design

We conducted a case series of patients referred to clinical genetics for proportionate short stature. CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 genes were clinically phenotyped and sequenced.

Results

In 6 Saudi families with 3M syndrome, we identified three CUL7, one OBSL1, and one CCDC8 novel mutations, which we show result in a remarkably similar clinical phenotype. Despite their typical and easily discernible clinical phenotype, all these patients have been extensively investigated for alternative causes of their short stature and received erroneous diagnoses.

Conclusion

Increased awareness about this syndrome among pediatricians and endocrinologists is needed to avoid a costly and unnecessary diagnostic odyssey.

### Branding of subjects affected with genetic syndromes of severe short stature in developing countries [^112FrxMF]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

This individual′s narrative epitomises the same story, iterated every day, in the lives of each of the subjects experiencing this disease in Ecuador. He belongs to the cohort comprising one-third of the world's population with LS, and because of the large media attention that this group of patients has drawn in the last decade, he is aware of the importance that his disease has for understanding the roots of the so called 'chronic diseases of Western societies' as well as those of longevity. He and his peers generously cooperate in every trial done in the country with these purposes. Since his height generates physical limitations, it is very difficult for him to get or keep a job and, nowadays, is unemployed as many of these individuals are.

Case presentation (2)

This second case is presented to highlight the multiple and discrete instances and events when branding of patients with severe short stature may unintentionally occur. It can happen during the processes of diagnosis, treatment and, in general, when otherwise appropriate medical care of these individuals is being delivered. It is worth noticing that it can also occur during scientific and academic discussions and, surprisingly, is present in medical journals and books. As happens with children affected with LS, this case also illustrates the daily efforts done by these families to obtain an accurate diagnosis, delivered by expensive tests, as a requirement to get access to the growth peptides needed for the treatment of their diseased children. Most of the time, these attempts fail at the end due to the unaffordable cost of these medications in our countries, as it has been recently highlighted. Ironically, the careful study of these neglected patients, most of the time disclose new subcellular mechanisms that clarify the physiology of normal people; hence, benefits us all.

### Short QT syndrome: a case report and review of literature [^117U3Fyz]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

The short QT syndrome has been recently recognised as a genetic ion channel dysfunction. This new clinical entity is associated with an incidence of sudden cardiac death, syncope, and atrial fibrillation in otherwise healthy individuals. The distinctive ECG pattern consists of an abnormally short QT interval, a short or even absent ST segment and narrow T waves. A 30-year-old resuscitated woman with short QT syndrome is described together with an example of the classic ECG characteristics. A short-coupled variant of torsade de pointes was reveal on Holter recordings. The implantable cardioveter defibrillator seems to be the therapy of choice to prevent from sudden cardiac death. Quinidine proved to be efficient in prolonging the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachyarrhythmias non-inducible in patients with a mutation in KCNH2 (HERG). Our preliminary data suggest amiodarone combined with beta-blocker may be helpful in treating episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia for patients with an unknown genotype. Because the short QT syndrome often involves young patients with an apparently normal heart, it is imperative for physicians to recognize the clinical features of the short QT syndrome in making a timely correct diagnosis.

### BMP4 loss-of-function mutations in developmental eye disorders including SHORT syndrome [^114howqr]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Analysis of other phenotypic information presented in this manuscript as well as previously reported data further supports the role of BMP4 in SHORT syndrome. The association of BMP4 with anterior segment dysgenesis (Patients 2 and 3; Chang et al; Hayashi et al; Zhang et al.), poor growth with height and/or weight measurements below the 3rd percentile (Patients 4 and 5; Hayashi et al.), macrocephaly (Patients 3 and 5) and craniofacial/dental development in human patients (Patient 2; Suzuki et al.) and animal models (Fujimori et al; Vainio et al; Zhang et al.) is consistent with features of SHORT syndrome. The fact that other patients with BMP4 deletions/mutations do not demonstrate the full SHORT syndrome phenotype may be explained by variable phenotypic expressivity of BMP4 mutations and modification of their effect(s) by other genetic factors located elsewhere in genome. The observed incomplete penetrance/variable expressivity of BMP4 mutations and their wide phenotypic spectrum are in agreement with this possibility (Bakrania et al; Lubbe et al; Suzuki et al; Weber et al; Zhang et al.). Screening of additional patients with SHORT syndrome is needed to determine the role/frequency of BMP4 mutations in this phenotype; in our study, one out of three patients diagnosed with this rare condition demonstrated BMP4 deletion.

### Turner's syndrome [^1119mrBq]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Before chromosomal analysis became available, the diagnosis of Turner's syndrome was based on the characteristics independently described by Otto Ullrich and Henry Turner, such as short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, typical, visible dysmorphic stigmata, and abnormalities in organs, which present in individuals with a female phenotype. Today, Turner's syndrome or Ullrich-Turner's syndrome may be defined as the combination of characteristic physical features and complete or part absence of one of the X chromosomes, frequently accompanied by cell-line mosaicism. The increasing interest in Turner's syndrome over the past two decades has been motivated both by the quest for a model by which the multi-faceted features of this disorder can be understood, and the endeavour to provide life-long support to the patient. New developments in research allow patients with Turner's syndrome to have multidisciplinary care.

### Metformin paradoxically worsens insulin resistance in SHORT syndrome [^115bEwtf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, regardless of a precise mechanism, we observed a severe and an unequivocal worsening of insulin resistance on metformin treatment in a patient with a classical SHORT syndrome mutation (NM_181523.2: c.1945C > T). This points to the possibility that SHORT syndrome model might be useful for further research into the insight of metformin action.

There are also clinical implications of our case. Doctors very rarely perform glucose tolerance tests on metformin, as this agent is usually stopped prior to testing, in order to avoid possible false negative results. Furthermore, in most cases OGTT is performed without concomitant insulin measurements. In this case we performed the second OGTT on metformin in order to assess the extent of improvement of insulin resistance in this case of rare genetically-determined disease associated with severe insulin resistance. Paradoxically we observed worsening of glucose tolerance with a massive release of insulin above the assay detection limit. If the second Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (i.e. on metformin treatment) had not been performed, then subsequent worsening of glucose tolerance, or even early development of type 2 diabetes would have been most likely attributed to beta-cell exhaustion due to genetically-determined insulin resistance, rather to superimposed effects of metformin treatment, that would have been missed. In case of the SHORT syndrome, most available literature data pertain to either genetic or clinical characteristics of disease with hardly any data on treatment modalities and outcome. For instance, in an extensive genetic paper by Huang-Doran et al. it is mentioned that "treatment with metformin and combined cyproterone acetate/ethinylestradiol preparation was begun", however, without any data on treatment outcome. Verge et al. report apparently successful treatment with metformin in a 14-year boy with SHORT syndrome, but this situation is difficult to compare with our case as development of type 2 diabetes was thought to be induced by growth hormone treatment (known to worsen insulin resistance), and diabetes subsided few months after discontinuation of growth hormone.

### Human growth hormone and glutamine for patients with short bowel syndrome [^116QyHEA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There has been clinical enthusiasm for treating short bowel patients with human recombinant growth hormone and/or glutamine in hopes of reducing parenteral nutrition dependency. It has been more than a decade since Byrne and colleagues reported enhanced absorption of nutrients, improved weight gain, and reduction in parenteral nutrition requirements with the administration of a combination of human growth hormone (HGH) and glutamine in patients with short bowel syndrome. Other studies have reported inconsistent results.

Objectives

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of growth hormone with or without glutamine supplementation for adult patients with short bowel syndrome.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches were performed to identify all publications describing randomised controlled trials of the use of human growth hormone with or without glutamine for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of human growth hormone with or without glutamine for patients with short bowel syndrome were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from the published studies. The statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5 software. Follmann's method was used for cross-over studies.

Main Results

Five studies were included in the review. Human growth hormone with or without glutamine appears to provide benefit in terms of increased weight (MD 1.66 Kg; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.63; P = 0.0008), lean body mass (MD 1.93 Kg; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90; P = 0.0001) energy absorption (MD 4.42 Kcal; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.58; P = 0.04) and nitrogen absorption (MD 44.85 g; 95%CI 0.20 to 9.49; P = 0.04) for patients with short bowel syndrome. The single RCT that focused on parenteral nutrition (PN) requirements demonstrated decreased PN volume and calories and number of infusions in patients who received HGH with or without glutamine supplementation. Only patients who received HGH with glutamine maintained statistically significant PN reductions at 3 month follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

The results suggest a positive effect of human growth hormone on weight gain and energy absorption. However, in the majority of trials, the effects are short-lived returning to baseline shortly after cessation of therapy. The temporary benefit calls into question the clinical utility of this treatment. To date, the evidence is inconclusive to recommend this therapy. Consideration should be made to studying patients during the active phase of intestinal adaptation rather than in the setting of chronic intestinal failure. The role of HGH in paediatric short bowel syndrome remains unknown.

### The continuum of growth hormone-IGF-I axis defects causing short stature: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges [^11344XCD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The growth hormone (GH)-IGF-I axis is essential for normal foetal and childhood growth. Defects at different sites in the axis frequently result in short stature which may compromise adult height. We describe a continuum of clinically relevant abnormalities from GH deficiency through to GH resistance and discuss the implementation and interpretation of investigations. We consider appropriate therapy for patients with abnormal auxology and subnormal adult height prognosis, highlighting new data to clarify therapeutic choices leading to optimal clinical outcome.

### 3-M syndrome-a primordial short stature disorder with novelmutation in two Indian patients [^114NXdjA]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the cause of short stature in children.

Case Presentation

Two children with suspected skeletal dysplasia and short stature were evaluated.

Conclusions

The 3-M syndrome is a primordial growth disorder manifesting severe postnatal growth restriction, skeletal anomalies and prominent fleshy heels. The 3-M syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and the phenotype is similar. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with normal intellect. Two affected children have been identified by whole-exome sequencing. One patient harboured a compound heterozygous variant and the other was a homozygous missense variant. The genetic diagnosis helped in counselling the families and facilitated prenatal diagnosis in one (case 1) family.

### Genetic characterization of short stature patients with overlapping features of growth hormone insensitivity syndromes [^112PFz2p]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The cardinal features of GHI defects are short stature, normal GH secretion, and IGF-I deficiency. Investigation of a child with short stature should follow a standard protocol leading to logical determination of GH status. If GH secretion is normal, the finding of a low serum IGF-I concentration, particularly when there is severe short stature, requires formal genetic sequencing of known GH–IGF-I axis genes.

Our group and others have reported congenital growth disorders 3M (OMIM: 273750), Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS) (OMIM: 180860), and Noonan syndrome (NS) (OMIM: 163950) presenting with features of GHI and phenotypic overlap with known GH–IGF-I axis defects. It is estimated that currently approximately 80% of children referred with short stature do not obtain identifiable primary diagnosis. Many of these children have normal GH secretion and receive a presumed designation of GHI, but no specific diagnosis is reached. The identification of an underlying genetic defect will enable access to effective treatment, specific genetic counselling, early detection of likely comorbidities, and will inform prognosis.

Our center is an international referral center for patients with undiagnosed short stature, many with mild to moderate GHI features. The present study reports the clinical, endocrine, and genetic characterization of a series of patients, with suspected GHI, referred for genetic sequencing.

### Jonathan E rhoads lecture: experiences and observations in the management of patients with short bowel syndrome [^111P7BLE]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

In an era before parenteral nutrition (PN) was made practical by Stanley Dudrick, MD, and his colleagues, patients with prolonged intestinal dysfunction or short bowel syndrome would often die of malnutrition or its sequelae. Over the past 4 decades, the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome had progressed from PN in the hospital to small bowel transplantation. Multimodal therapies have evolved in the management of these patients, including specialized diets and enteral supplements, oral rehydration fluids, antisecretory medication, and the use of growth factors. Home PN is lifesaving when these modalities are ineffective and a surgical procedure to restore or enhance gastrointestinal tract length or absorptive potential is impossible. Small intestine transplantation had been used to salvage those patients who developed life-threatening complications of home PN, but as the survival after intestinal transplant has approached that of liver transplantation, it may soon be considered as primary therapy for patients with short bowel syndrome. This article presents the author's experiences and observations after a 4-decade experience in the management of patients with short bowel syndrome.

### Short telomeres are sufficient to cause the degenerative defects associated with aging [^1123BtcQ]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Telomerase function is critical for telomere maintenance. Mutations in telomerase components lead to telomere shortening and progressive bone marrow failure in the premature aging syndrome dyskeratosis congenita. Short telomeres are also acquired with aging, yet the role that they play in mediating age-related disease is not fully known. We generated wild-type mice that have short telomeres. In these mice, we identified hematopoietic and immune defects that resembled those present in dyskeratosis congenita patients. When mice with short telomeres were interbred, telomere length was only incrementally restored, and even several generations later, wild-type mice with short telomeres still displayed degenerative defects. Our findings implicate telomere length as a unique heritable trait that, when short, is sufficient to mediate the degenerative defects of aging, even when telomerase is wild-type.

### Genotypes and phenotypes in children with short stature: clinical indicators of SHOX haploinsufficiency [^112Qr5AM]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Short stature affects approximately 2% of children, representing one of the more frequent disorders for which clinical attention is sought during childhood. Despite assumed genetic heterogeneity, mutations or deletions of the short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) are found quite frequently in subjects with short stature. Haploinsufficiency of the SHOX gene causes short stature with highly variable clinical severity, ranging from isolated short stature without dysmorphic features to Léri-Weill syndrome, and with no functional copy of the SHOX gene, Langer syndrome.

Methods

To characterise the clinical and molecular spectrum of SHOX deficiency in childhood we assessed the association between genotype and phenotype in a large cohort of children of short stature from 14 countries.

Results

Screening of 1608 unrelated individuals with sporadic or familial short stature revealed SHOX mutations or deletions in 68 individuals (4.2%): complete deletions in 48 (70.6%), partial deletions in 4 (5.9%) and point mutations in 16 individuals (23.5%). Although mean height standard deviation score (SDS) was not different between participants of short stature with or without identified SHOX gene defects (-2.6 vs -2.6), detailed examination revealed that certain bone deformities and dysmorphic signs, such as short forearm and lower leg, cubitus valgus, Madelung deformity, high-arched palate and muscular hypertrophy, differed markedly between participants with or without SHOX gene defects (p < 0.001). Phenotypic data were also compared for 33 children with Turner syndrome in whom haploinsufficiency of SHOX is thought to be responsible for the height deficit.

Conclusion

A phenotype scoring system was developed that could assist in identifying the most appropriate subjects for SHOX testing. This study offers a detailed genotype-phenotype analysis in a large cohort of children of short stature, and provides quantitative clinical guidelines for testing of the SHOX gene.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^112Q5gx2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Intestinal transplantation (ITX) in short bowel syndrome–intestinal failure (SBS-IF) is framed for earlier consideration due to late referrals and improving outcomes: the page notes that nearly 50% of candidates require simultaneous liver replacement, the risk of waiting-list mortality is much higher when liver transplantation is required, and therefore patients with SBS-IF experiencing parenteral nutrition (PN) complications are to be referred early for ITX consideration. Patients with SBS-IF with high morbidity or low acceptance of PN should also be considered for early listing on a case-by-case basis, and those with severe dysmotility with no prospect of PN weaning should be considered early for ITX even if they do not meet strict historic PN-failure criteria. In carefully selected cases, viewing early ITX as standard of care with PN as a safety net is described as a paradigm shift, and short- and medium-term outcomes are improving, with 5-year survival now routinely exceeding 65% at experienced centers, although long-term impediments (immunosuppression effects, infections, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, chronic allograft enteropathy) remain.

### Short anagen syndrome [^111uDnvY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Short anagen syndrome (SAS) is a recently described disease, but is rarely reported in the literature probably because of its under-recognized status. It is characterized by the inability to grow long hair because of an idiopathic short anagen phase. The condition is not associated with hair shaft fragility or hair unruliness. The patients complain of abnormally short scalp hair and report that they never had a haircut. The condition is benign and most of the reported cases had no associated systemic diseases or skin disorders. Hair length tends to improve spontaneously after puberty. The main differential diagnoses include loose anagen hair syndrome (LAS).

### Clinical relevance of systematic phenotyping and exome sequencing in patients with short stature [^1162sPCs]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Diagnostic yield of common and recognizable phenotypes in 565 individuals

We could establish a diagnosis after systematic phenotyping in 13.6% of patients including disorders due to variants in 10 genes, imprinting defects, large chromosomal aberrations, and 24 distinct copy-number variants (Supplementary Table 1). Copy-number variants ranging in size from 0.1 to 14.2 Mb were the most common cause of nonspecific syndromic short stature, identified in 6.9% of the patients. A syndromic form of short stature was suspected in 181 patients and confirmed in 26 of them (4.6% of the 565 patients), mostly SHOX -related short stature and Silver–Russell syndrome. Turner syndrome or Turner syndrome variants were found in 1.6% of the patients and mutations in genes associated with skeletal dysplasia in 0.5%. No diagnosis could be established in 491 (86.4%) of the patients.

### Mutations in PIK3R1 cause SHORT syndrome [^116Lcvog]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

SHORT syndrome is a rare, multisystem disease characterized by short stature, anterior-chamber eye anomalies, characteristic facial features, lipodystrophy, hernias, hyperextensibility, and delayed dentition. As part of the FORGE (Finding of Rare Disease Genes) Canada Consortium, we studied individuals with clinical features of SHORT syndrome to identify the genetic etiology of this rare disease. Whole-exome sequencing in a family trio of an affected child and unaffected parents identified a de novo frameshift insertion, c.1906_1907insC (p. Asn636Thrfs*18), in exon 14 of PIK3R1. Heterozygous mutations in exon 14 of PIK3R1 were subsequently identified by Sanger sequencing in three additional affected individuals and two affected family members. One of these mutations, c.1945C > T (p. Arg649Trp), was confirmed to be a de novo mutation in one affected individual and was also identified and shown to segregate with the phenotype in an unrelated family. The other mutation, a de novo truncating mutation (c.1971T > G [p. Tyr657*]), was identified in another affected individual. PIK3R1 is involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade and, as such, plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Functional studies on lymphoblastoid cells with the PIK3R1 c.1906_1907insC mutation showed decreased phosphorylation of the downstream S6 target of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Our findings show that PIK3R1 mutations are the major cause of SHORT syndrome and suggest that the molecular mechanism of disease might involve downregulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I care — diagnostic and outcome priorities emphasize improved diagnostics, including universal adoption of standardized IGF-I and GH assays and standards, refinement or development of GH provocative and IGF-I generation tests to better distinguish deficiency from sufficiency, and incorporation of expanding genetic testing and therapeutic responsiveness markers; imaging advances beyond current MRI for gross lesions may enable detection of subtle clinically relevant changes, while validated quality-of-life instruments and collection of long-term safety data in adults treated during childhood remain needed for defining effective, safe care.

### Pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation for athletic participants to prevent sudden death: position paper from the EHRA and the EACPR, branches of the ESC. endorsed by APHRS, HRS, and SOLAECE [^112amuJP]. Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Short QT syndrome (SQTS) — diagnosis, prevalence and exercise considerations: Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a term that identifies patients with reduced repolarization duration that pose affected individuals at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias and SCD. Current ESC guidelines propose a QTc ≤ 340 ms to diagnose SQTS, and diagnosis should be considered in the presence of a QTc ≤ 360 ms in the secondary prevention setting as well as for patients with a familiar history of SCD or SQTS or in patients with a known causing mutation; notably, secondary causes of short QT should be ruled out. The prevalence of short QT, as defined with actual guidelines, has been estimated at 1:2000 in paediatric individuals, but at about 1:1000 in adult populations including athletes, and no specific triggers for STQS arrhythmic events have been identified so the consequences of strenuous physical activity in SQTS patients remain unknown.

### Recombinant growth hormone for children and adolescents with Turner syndrome [^111JoMGH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Turner syndrome (TS) affects about one in 1500 to 2500 live-born females. One of the most prevalent and salient features of the syndrome is extremely short stature. Untreated women are approximately 20 to 21 cm shorter than normal women within their respective populations. Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) has been used to increase growth and final height in girls who have Turner syndrome.

Objectives

To assess the effects of recombinant growth hormone in children and adolescents with TS.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, LILACS, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index and reference lists were used to identify relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children with TS before achieving final height. Growth hormone had to be administered for a minimum of six months and compared with a placebo or no treatment control condition.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion criteria and for methodological quality. The primary outcomes were final height and growth. Secondary outcomes included bone age, quality of life, cognitive performance, and adverse effects.

Main Results

Four RCTs that included 365 participants after one year of treatment were included. Only one trial reported final height in 61 treated women to be 148 cm and 141 cm in 43 untreated women (mean difference (MD) seven cm, 95% CI 6 to 8). Short-term growth velocity was greater in treated than untreated girls after one year (two trials, MD three cm per year, 95% CI 2 to 4) and after two years (one trial, MD two cm per year, 95% CI 1 to 2.3). Skeletal maturity was not accelerated by treatment with recombinant growth hormone (hGH). Adverse effects were minimally reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) doses between 0.3 to 0.375 mg/kg/wk increase short-term growth in girls with Turner syndrome by approximately three (two) cm in the first (second) year of treatment. Treatment in one trial increased final height by approximately six cm over an untreated control group. Despite this increase, the final height of treated women was still outside the normal range. Additional trials of the effects of hGH carried out with control groups until final height is achieved would allow better informed decisions about whether the benefits of hGH treatment outweigh the requirement of treatment over several years at considerable cost.

### Nonclassical GH insensitivity: characterization of mild abnormalities of GH action [^116wCyRA]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

GH insensitivity (GHI) presents in childhood with growth failure and in its severe form is associated with extreme short stature and dysmorphic and metabolic abnormalities. In recent years, the clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of GHI and other overlapping short stature syndromes have rapidly expanded. This can be attributed to advancing genetic techniques and a greater awareness of this group of disorders. We review this important spectrum of defects, which present with phenotypes at the milder end of the GHI continuum. We discuss their clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. The objective of this review is to clarify the definition, identification, and investigation of this clinically relevant group of growth defects. We also review the therapeutic challenges of mild GHI.

### The role of genetic testing in pulmonary fibrosis: a perspective from the pulmonary fibrosis foundation genetic testing work group [^114KdXg6]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) — short telomere syndrome and testing guidance: DC is a short telomere syndrome with classic findings of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular skin pigmentation on the upper chest or neck, and oral leukoplakia; most patients experience bone marrow failure, the leading cause of death, and pulmonary fibrosis may present in late adolescence or early adulthood, often after bone marrow transplantation; rare variants in "at least 11 genes" have been implicated and involve X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant inheritance, with heterozygous TERT, TERC, RTEL1, and PARN variants associated with disease and biallelic variants rarely causing more severe DC or adult-onset FPF; patients with suspected DC "should undergo TL testing with or without gene sequencing", since all DC patients have short age-adjusted TL but "only 70% harbor" an identifiable pathogenic telomere gene variant; the classic DC form comprises "less than 10%" of all short telomere syndrome manifestations, with FPF being the most common form.

### APDS2 and SHORT syndrome in a teenager with PIK3R1 pathogenic variant [^113KSAPv]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Activated PI3K δ syndrome (APDS) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by heterogeneous germline gain-of-function mutations which ultimately lead to the hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase δ (PI3K δ). PI3K δ exists as a heterodimer composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. APDS type 2 is caused by mutations in the PIK3R1 gene affecting the p85α regulatory subunit. SHORT syndrome is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by short stature, hyperextensible joints, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and tooth eruption delay. The primary causes of SHORT syndrome are heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PIK3R1 gene. The combination of APDS2 and SHORT syndrome is rare, with few cases reported to date. Here we describe a 17-year-old female with phenotypic features consistent with SHORT syndrome and history of sinopulmonary infections and hypogammaglobulinemia. Invitae immunodeficiency panel genetic testing revealed a pathogenic loss-of-function variant in an intronic splice site in the gene PIK3R1 (c.1425+1G > C). This pathogenic variant had been previously associated with APDS2; however, it had not been associated with SHORT syndrome. The exact mechanisms linking both conditions are yet to be identified. This case report emphasizes the importance of screening for comorbidities associated with SHORT syndrome in APDS2 patients and vice versa.

### SHORT syndrome due to a novel de novo mutation in PRKCE (protein kinase C ɛ) impairing TORC2-dependent AKT activation [^115Hb49c]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

SHORT syndrome is a rare, recognizable syndrome resulting from heterozygous mutations in PIK3R1 encoding a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). The condition is characterized by short stature, intrauterine growth restriction, lipoatrophy and a facial gestalt involving a triangular face, deep set eyes, low hanging columella and small chin. PIK3R1 mutations in SHORT syndrome result in reduced signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. We performed whole exome sequencing for an individual with clinical features of SHORT syndrome but negative for PIK3R1 mutation and her parents. A rare de novo variant in PRKCE was identified. The gene encodes PKCε and, as such, the AKT-mTOR pathway function was assessed using phospho-specific antibodies with patient lymphoblasts and following ectopic expression of the mutant in HEK293 cells. Kinase analysis showed that the variant resulted in a partial loss-of-function. Whilst interaction with PDK1 and the mTORC2 complex component SIN1 was preserved in the mutant PKCε, it bound to SIN1 with a higher affinity than wild-type PKCε and the dynamics of mTORC2-dependent priming of mutant PKCε was altered. Further, mutant PKCε caused impaired mTORC2-dependent pAKT-S473 following rapamycin treatment. Reduced pFOXO1-S256 and pS6-S240/244 levels were also observed in the patient LCLs. To date, mutations in PIK3R1 causing impaired PI3K-dependent AKT activation are the only known cause of SHORT syndrome. We identify a SHORT syndrome child with a novel partial loss-of-function defect in PKCε. This variant causes impaired AKT activation via compromised mTORC2 complex function.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^115yhBUd]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Noonan syndrome may also be the cause of short stature after being born SGA. Activation of the RAS/Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway results in a number of overlapping syndromes, the so-called "RASopathies", including Noonan (OMIM 163950), Leopard (OMIM 151100), Costello (OMIM 218040), cardio-facio-cutaneous (OMIM 115150), and neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndromes (OMIM 601321). All have a varying degree of postnatal growth failure and, sometimes, there are no obvious clinical features.

Monogenic disorders with normal head circumference and disproportionate short stature (Table 1)

In most genetic disorders associated with disproportionate short stature, the genes are already abnormally expressed during fetal life, which often results in a lower birth length SDS than birth weight SDS. The more severe forms of skeletal dysplasia can be easily diagnosed in young children, but clinical features can be so mild that many children are initially labeled as short SGA of unknown origin. Body disproportion and skeletal abnormalities can become more abnormal when the child becomes older. When an SGA child has disproportionate short stature (sitting height/height ratio > 2 SDS and/or arm-span width > height), skeletal survey analysis and/or genetic testing can be an efficient diagnostic approach. A description of all skeletal dysplasias and their underlying genetic aberrations is beyond the scope of this guideline, but the most frequent ones in relation to SGA and short stature are presented in Table 1.

### SHORT syndrome with partial lipodystrophy due to impaired phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling [^111eERJd]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates fundamental cellular processes such as metabolism, proliferation, and survival. A central component in this pathway is the p85α regulatory subunit, encoded by PIK3R1. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a heterozygous PIK3R1 mutation (c.1945C > T [p. Arg649Trp]) in two unrelated families affected by partial lipodystrophy, low body mass index, short stature, progeroid face, and Rieger anomaly (SHORT syndrome). This mutation led to impaired interaction between p85α and IRS-1 and reduced AKT-mediated insulin signaling in fibroblasts from affected subjects and in reconstituted Pik3r1-knockout preadipocytes. Normal PI3K activity is critical for adipose differentiation and insulin signaling; the mutated PIK3R1 therefore provides a unique link among lipodystrophy, growth, and insulin signaling.

### Approach to the patient with Turner syndrome [^116QwSdH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Turner Syndrome is diagnosed in a female with partial or complete loss of the second sex chromosome and is reported in 1/2000–2500 live births. Common features include short stature and ovarian dysgenesis; subsequent ovarian insufficiency leading to delayed/absent puberty and infertility in the majority. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, due to comorbidities occurring throughout the lifespan, including congenital and acquired cardiovascular abnormalities, autoimmune disease, osteoporosis and other skeletal abnormalities, and metabolic dysfunction as well as neurocognitive challenges. Management may involve coordination of several specialties in addition to patient/relative information and support. Treatment with growth hormone during childhood and adolescence and sex hormone replacement therapy forms the cornerstone of medical treatment. Recent review of evidence and development of recommendations inform a practical approach to management with an aim to reduce morbidity and thus improve outcomes in the future.

Bowel anatomy in SBS and residual length measurement — surgeons involved with massive bowel resections should report the residual bowel length, rather than the length of bowel resected, and by convention the length of residual bowel is measured at the time of surgery along the antimesenteric border of undisturbed bowel from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocecal junction, the site of any small bowel–colon anastomosis or to the end-ostomy; based on the presence or absence of residual colon, SBS patients may be classified into 3 groups: group 1, end-jejunostomy; group 2, jejunum anastomosed to partial colon (ie, jejuno-colonic anastomosis); and group 3, jejuno-ileocolic anastomosis, retaining entire colon and ileocecal valve.

### Cognitive decline associated with anesthesia and surgery… [^112HxT4J]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Postoperative neurocognitive disorders is an overarching term that includes postoperative delirium, an acute state of confusion and inattention; and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, a prolonged state of cognitive impairment that predominantly affects higher-level cognitive skills and memory. Delirium and POCD previously were considered distinct entities, but recent data suggest an underlying relationship between them for the patient whose brain may be vulnerable to cognitive decline after the stressors of surgery and anesthesia. Proposed potential mechanisms for postoperative neurocognitive decline are speculative but include neuroinflammation as a result of perioperative stress, vascular disorders, or the acceleration of neurocognitive decline in patients with a previously undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder, such as preclinical dementia.

According to a study of patients who underwent noncardiac surgery, covert stroke occurred in 7% of 1114 older patients after surgery and was associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium and long-term cognitive deficits.
2. Among patients aged 65 years and older, up to an estimated 65% experience delirium and 10% develop long-term cognitive decline after noncardiac surgery. 1 Complications associated with delirium include longer hospitalization, more days with mechanical ventilation, and functional decline. After discharge from the hospital, patients who develop postoperative delirium are at increased risk of worsening functional and psychological health, progressive cognitive decline, dementia, and death. Although not as extensively studied as delirium, POCD is associated with a decrease in quality of life, loss of function, and increased mortality.

Postoperative neurocognitive disorders develop through a complex interaction between a patient's baseline vulnerability and other risk factors. 1 Commonly cited nonmodifiable risk factors for PNDs include age; compromised higher-level cognitive skills; procedure characteristics such as invasiveness, duration, and urgency; and postoperative admission to an intensive care unit. Moreover, the relationship between the duration of an intervention to ameliorate risk and its clinical influence is largely unknown. However, multicomponent targeted reduction of preoperative risk is recommended because most of these interventions will at least benefit the overall health of the patient.

### Trial to shorten pharmacologic treatment of newborns with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) [^112DQCbz]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Trial to Shorten Pharmacologic Treatment of Newborns With Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This will be a pragmatic, randomized, blinded trial comparing a rapid-wean intervention to a slow-wean intervention to determine whether rapid weaning will reduce the number of treatment days among infants receiving morphine or methadone orally as the primary treatment for NOWS. Participating hospitals must provide pharmacologic treatment to at least an average of 12 opioid exposed infants each year, use a scoring system to assess for signs of NOWS, and provide opioid replacement therapy with either morphine or methadone as the primary drug for treating NOWS. Hospitals may change use of these two opioids during the trial period.

The investigators will stratify randomization by hospital. The study protocol will commence after NOWS signs have been controlled with an opioid and weaning of pharmacologic treatment is to be started. At or before each 24-hour interval, clinical team members will evaluate and score infants, per hospital practice, for signs of NOWS to determine if the infant will tolerate weaning of the study drug.

Infant Level

- Gestational age ≥ 36 weeks
- Receiving scheduled pharmacological therapy with morphine or methadone as the primary drug treatment for NOWS secondary to maternal opioid use
- **Tolerating enteral feeds and medications by mouth Exclusion Criteria**: Hospital Level 1. Hospitals discharge > 10% of infants from the hospital on opioid replacement therapy on average per year. Infant Level
- Major birth defect
- Any major surgery
- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
- Seizures from etiologies other than NOWS
- Treatment with opioids for reasons other than NOWS.
- Respiratory support for > 72 hours
- Planned discharge from the hospital on opioids
- Use of other opioids as primary drugs for treatment of NOWS
- Weaning of morphine or methadone as the primary treatment of NOWS has started.

### The pathophysiology of hypersplenic thrombocytopenia… [^115ZXYFM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The pathogenesis of hypersplenic thrombocytopenia is complex. About half of these patients have shortened platelet lifespans. A few have an expansion of the intravascular platelet space, and it is likely that there is a shift of platelets from the vascular to the splenic space in most patients. Estimates of platelet production vary from normal to about twice normal in this syndrome. There remains little need to invoke a theory of suppression of platelet production by the enlarged spleen. In fact, it may be that splenectomy results in a decrease of platelet production. Cooney DP, Smith BA. The Pathophysiology of Hypersplenic Thrombocytopenia. Arch Intern Med. 1968; 121: 332–337.
