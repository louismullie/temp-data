## Question

Hctz in patients with hypokalemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients who already have hypokalemia, including whether it is safe, what the risks are, and how to manage or mitigate those risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk of HCTZ-induced hypokalemia and how that risk changes when potassium is already low. Then, I should verify the clinical consequences of hypokalemia and whether mild hypokalemia is benign. Next, I will review guideline positions and regulatory labeling for HCTZ in patients with low potassium. After that, I need to examine mitigation strategies, including dose reduction, potassium-sparing combinations, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight special scenarios like heart failure, kidney disease, and drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk signal. HCTZ commonly lowers serum potassium, with observational data showing hypokalemia in about 12.6% of HCTZ users overall, and higher risk in women, Black patients, those with low BMI, and with longer duration of therapy, which underscores a substantial background risk even before baseline potassium is low [^113yMBRg]. Hold on, I should verify comparative data: multiple large observational studies and a pragmatic randomized trial show chlorthalidone has a higher risk of hypokalemia than HCTZ, but HCTZ itself still carries a meaningful absolute risk, reinforcing caution when baseline potassium is already low [^111EyFYE] [^117D4Ytj] [^112DQyst].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance of even mild hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is associated with arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and glucose intolerance, and in treated hypertensive cohorts, incident hypokalemia correlates with higher mortality, indicating that even asymptomatic lows can carry prognostic weight. Mechanistically, thiazides increase distal sodium delivery and aldosterone, promoting kaliuresis, which can be amplified in patients with existing potassium depletion or high sodium intake [^113NFDQ5] [^114DNkci] [^116mySJB]. I should double-check that this applies across populations: yes, population-based data show an approximately 11-fold increased risk of hypokalemia with thiazides versus nonuse, and the risk remains elevated even when combined with triamterene, though attenuated, which is important when considering add-on strategies [^114bijVa].

> Next, I should review guideline and regulatory positions. Guidelines emphasize avoiding thiazide-induced hypokalemia and recommend routine electrolyte monitoring after initiation or dose changes. The 2025 ACC/AHA guidance advises checking a basic metabolic panel 2–4 weeks after starting or titrating diuretics, and to mitigate hypokalemia with dietary changes, supplementation, or complementary combinations such as ACEi/ARB plus thiazide, which can normalize potassium in some cases [^115G6JcW] [^116xsjtZ]. Hold on, I should verify labeling language: FDA labeling for HCTZ-containing products repeatedly warns about hypokalemia risk, advises periodic electrolyte monitoring, and recommends correcting hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia before initiation, which is especially pertinent when baseline potassium is already low [^113hQ7S3] [^115G6JcW] [^117T3NAd].

> I will now examine mitigation strategies. Let me think about dose first: using the lowest effective HCTZ dose, typically 12.5–25 mg daily, reduces hypokalemia risk compared with higher doses, and many combination products pair HCTZ 12.5–25 mg with ACEi/ARB to blunt potassium loss while maintaining antihypertensive efficacy, which is a practical first step when potassium is borderline low [^111ULmWA] [^111frYoM]. I should confirm whether switching the thiazide helps: chlorthalidone increases hypokalemia risk relative to HCTZ, so switching to chlorthalidone is not a strategy to reduce hypokalemia; conversely, indapamide may have a more favorable potassium profile, though head-to-head data are limited and patient-specific factors matter [^111EyFYE] [^115f546D].

> Next, I should review potassium-sparing options. Adding amiloride 5–10 mg daily or triamterene 50–100 mg daily to HCTZ can prevent or correct hypokalemia; guidelines explicitly endorse this approach for patients who develop hypokalemia on thiazide monotherapy, while cautioning to avoid these agents in significant CKD (eGFR < 45 mL/min) due to hyperkalemia risk and to monitor potassium closely when used [^112DyCwX] [^116nK1wj]. Hold on, I should verify efficacy data: randomized and observational data show amiloride restores potassium and can even enhance blood pressure control when combined with HCTZ, and triamterene/HCTZ combinations are FDA-indicated for edema with hypokalemia, supporting their use when potassium falls on thiazide therapy [^116dCWrQ] [^115H6FUB] [^1124mdUn].

> Let me consider dietary and supplemental strategies. Increasing dietary potassium intake and using oral potassium chloride supplementation are reasonable, though supplementation alone may be insufficient if renal potassium wasting persists. I need to ensure we also address hypomagnesemia, because low magnesium impedes potassium repletion and is a recognized thiazide-associated risk, so correcting magnesium can improve potassium recovery and stability [^113hQ7S3] [^11395jrp]. But wait, what if the patient is on an ACEi or ARB already? That can help offset potassium loss, yet I should confirm potassium after any thiazide initiation or dose change because the net effect is unpredictable in individual patients [^116xsjtZ].

> I should double-check special populations and scenarios. In acute heart failure, adding HCTZ to loop diuretics increases diuretic response but markedly increases hypokalemia risk, particularly when baseline potassium is ≤ 4.3 mmol/L and in the absence of MRAs; expert guidance recommends close monitoring and proactive potassium and MRA strategies in this setting, reflecting a high-risk use case for thiazides when potassium is low [^113oc3ZX] [^116E5MVj]. In CKD, thiazides can still be effective at lower GFRs, but electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, are more common, so if potassium is already low, I need to be cautious with thiazides and prioritize potassium-sparing combinations or alternative classes when appropriate [^113hJMk9]. For patients with arrhythmias, digitalis therapy, or prolonged QT risk, even mild hypokalemia can be dangerous, so I should avoid thiazides until potassium is normalized and consider alternatives or strict monitoring if thiazides are absolutely necessary [^115YAh41] [^113NFDQ5].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If a patient presents with hypokalemia and is already on HCTZ, I should confirm the severity and symptoms, correct potassium and magnesium first, and then reassess the need for ongoing thiazide therapy. If HCTZ is still indicated, I should lower the dose to 12.5–25 mg and add a potassium-sparing diuretic such as amiloride or triamterene, or switch to a fixed-dose combination with an ACEi/ARB that includes a lower HCTZ dose, while arranging lab rechecks in 2–4 weeks and periodically thereafter. If potassium remains unstable or the clinical risk is high, I should consider switching to a non-thiazide alternative or a thiazide-like agent with a more favorable potassium profile, recognizing the evidence base is stronger for amiloride combinations than for switching to chlorthalidone in this context [^115G6JcW] [^112DyCwX] [^116dCWrQ]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: I initially thought chlorthalidone might be less likely to cause hypokalemia at low doses, but that is incorrect; chlorthalidone consistently shows higher hypokalemia risk than HCTZ, so switching to chlorthalidone is not a strategy to mitigate hypokalemia [^111EyFYE] [^117D4Ytj].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the recommendation is explicit. Using HCTZ in a patient with preexisting hypokalemia is not absolutely contraindicated, but it is unsafe without correction of potassium, dose optimization, and a mitigation plan. The balance of evidence and guidance supports correcting potassium and magnesium first, using the lowest effective HCTZ dose, and adding a potassium-sparing agent or switching to a lower-dose thiazide within an ACEi/ARB combination, with mandated electrolyte monitoring and a low threshold to abandon thiazides if potassium cannot be stabilized or the patient is high risk for arrhythmias or CKD progression [^113hQ7S3] [^112DyCwX] [^115G6JcW].

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) can cause or worsen hypokalemia, especially at higher doses, with other hypokalemia-inducing drugs, or in patients with risk factors such as CKD, heart failure, or high sodium intake [^113yMBRg] [^113oc3ZX] [^116mySJB]. Hypokalemia increases the risk of arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and glucose intolerance, so **baseline potassium should be checked and rechecked 2–4 weeks after starting or changing HCTZ** [^115G6JcW] [^113NFDQ5]. If potassium falls below 3.5 mmol/L, consider dose reduction, switching to a lower dose or a potassium-sparing combination, or adding potassium supplementation, and always correct hypomagnesemia to aid potassium repletion [^112DyCwX] [^113hQ7S3] [^113NFDQ5]. In patients with persistent or severe hypokalemia, avoid HCTZ or use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^115G6JcW].

## Incidence and risk factors for hypokalemia with HCTZ

- **Incidence**: Hypokalemia occurs in 4–12% of HCTZ users, depending on dose, duration, and population [^113yMBRg] [^113hQ7S3].
- **Dose dependence**: Higher doses (e.g. 50 mg/day) increase risk; lower doses (12.5–25 mg/day) reduce but do not eliminate it [^113yMBRg] [^112uyX92].
- **Patient factors**: CKD, heart failure, high sodium intake, and concomitant drugs (e.g. loop diuretics, corticosteroids) increase risk [^113oc3ZX] [^111LR1v4].
- **Demographics**: Older adults, women, and Black patients have higher risk [^113yMBRg].

---

## Clinical significance of hypokalemia induced by HCTZ

Hypokalemia can cause **arrhythmias**, including torsades de pointes, especially with QT-prolonging drugs or underlying heart disease [^115YAh41]. It also causes **muscle cramps**, weakness, and fatigue, and can impair glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, increasing diabetes risk [^116dCWrQ].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Check serum potassium and magnesium before starting HCTZ [^115G6JcW].
- **Follow-up**: Recheck potassium 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change, then periodically [^115G6JcW].
- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or switch to lower-dose combinations if potassium falls below 3.5 mmol/L [^notfound].
- **Potassium supplementation**: Use oral potassium chloride or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone) as needed [^112DyCwX] [^116nK26Z].
- **Correct hypomagnesemia**: Magnesium repletion facilitates potassium correction [^113NFDQ5].

---

## Alternative therapies and adjustments

- **Lower doses**: Use 12.5–25 mg/day when possible to reduce hypokalemia risk [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: Pair HCTZ with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics to mitigate hypokalemia [^112DyCwX] [^116nK26Z].
- **Alternative diuretics**: Consider indapamide or chlorthalidone if HCTZ-induced hypokalemia persists, noting their own electrolyte profiles [^115f546D] [^111EyFYE].
- **Non-diuretic options**: Use calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers if diuretics are contraindicated or poorly tolerated [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **routine potassium monitoring** with thiazides and recommend correcting hypokalemia before or during therapy [^115G6JcW] [^116xsjtZ]. They also advise individualized therapy: use the lowest effective dose, consider patient-specific risk factors, and adjust therapy based on response and adverse effects [^112DyCwX] [^116xsjtZ].

---

HCTZ can cause or worsen hypokalemia, so **monitor potassium closely** and correct deficits promptly. Use the lowest effective dose, consider potassium-sparing combinations, and adjust therapy based on labs and clinical response.

Methods

The main aim of our analysis is to compare the influence of HCTZ and CTLD on systolic and diastolic BP and on the levels of serum sodium and serum potassium in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and to reinterpret evidence of interchangeability of HCTZ and CTLD.

Data sources and search strategy

We searched for evidence in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, PsyInfo, eLIBRARY.ru, as well as registries for data of clinical trials (and) (1975–2017/Dec) using the following keywords: hydrochlorothiazide, chlortalidone, diuretics, hypertension, blood pressure, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, potassium, sodium, clinical trial, controlled, randomi*, double blind. The following search strategy was applied: diuretics AND hydrochlorothiazide OR chlorthalidone AND blood pressure OR hypertension AND hypokalemia OR potassium AND hyponatremia OR sodium AND clinical trial AND controlled AND randomized OR observational OR double blind. We searched for full-text articles and abstracts published in Latin (English) and Cyrillic. Results in Cyrillic were not found.

Inclusion criteria

### Dyskalemia risk associated with fixed-dose anti-hypertensive medication combinations [^117VNGDa]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

A model-based meta-analysis quantified comparative dyskalemia risk (hyper- or hypo-kalemia) in hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide; HCTZ) as monotherapy or as fixed-dose combinations. Among 15 randomized controlled trials in a US Food and Drug Administration regulatory review database, dyskalemia events were reported by five trials (24 treatment arms, 11,030 subjects, 8-week median follow up time). The five trials evaluated monotherapy (ARB or HCTZ) alongside dual (ARB+HCTZ, ARB+CCB, or HCTZ+CCB) or triple fixed-dose combinations (ARB+CCB+HCTZ). Hypo- and hyper-kalemia rates were analyzed jointly to account for correlation. Significant drug class, drug, or dose effects were included in the final model. Effect on various drug- and dose combinations on dyskalemia risk were simulated and compared with model-estimated placebo arm dyskalemia risk. After a typical follow-up of 8 weeks, fixed-dose combinations of ARB with a high dose (25mg) of HCTZ were associated with a higher hypokalemia risk difference (RD) from placebo (e.g. Valsartan+HCTZ: 2.52%[95%CIs:1.17, 4.38%]). However, when ARB was combined with a lower, 12.5mg dose of HCTZ, hypokalemia RD from placebo was not significant (Valsartan+HCTZ: -0.03%[-0.80, 0.71%]). ARB monotherapy raised hyperkalemia RD from placebo (1.3%[0.3, 3.6%]). Hyperkalemia risk was not appreciably higher than placebo for any FDC that combined ARB with HCTZ (Valsartan+HCTZ: 0.06%[-1.48, 1.64%]). In uncomplicated hypertensive patients, ARB+12.5mg HCTZ fixed-dose combinations are safer with respect to dyskalemia than either ARB or HCTZ monotherapy for initial antihypertensive treatment.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^111ie4ew]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We did observe a higher risk of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone use compared with hydrochlorothiazide use, which is consistent with prior observational studies. In our primary analysis, we found that chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use was associated with a HR for hypokalemia of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.55–1.1.87), which is actually lower than that reported in other observational studies. This may be associated with the intention-to-treat design, as our as-treated sensitivity analysis found a HR for hypokalemia more on par those prior studies. Our study expands on these prior works by demonstrating that this increased risk for hypokalemia persists even after dose matching between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, we now demonstrate that the excess risk for hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function. Perhaps this reflects reduced drug concentrations at the nephron level in participants with CKD or reduced baseline potassium excretion as kidney function declines.

What are some potential clinical implications of a higher risk of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide? Numerous studies have demonstrated that hypokalemia in patients with hypertension receiving diuretics is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. In our study, chlorthalidone use was associated with a 70% increased risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide, which was observed primarily by participants with preserved eGFR. One could postulate that the higher rates of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone from our study (particularly among those with preserved eGFR) may have contributed to our findings regarding cardiovascular events and mortality. Notably, among participants with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m², in whom there was no significant difference in hypokalemia, we also found no significant difference in cardiovascular events or mortality. However, prospective or interventional studies will be necessary to more fully understand this link.

### Hypokalemia during decongestion with loop diuretics and hydrochlorothiazide, a post hoc analysis of the CLOROTIC trial [^113oc3ZX]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute heart failure, the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to furosemide increased the diuretic response in the CLOROTIC trial (Combining Loop with Thiazide Diuretics for Decompensated Heart Failure). The aim of this subanalysis was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for hypokalemia, and its impact on mortality and readmissions.

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of the CLOROTIC trial that randomized 230 patients with acute heart failure and volume overload to receive HCTZ or placebo in addition to intravenous furosemide. The incidence and risk factors for the development of hypokalemia (K⁺ < 3.5 mmol/L) and its association with 30- and 90-day mortality and readmissions were analyzed. The Monte Carlo simulation method was applied to predict the development of hypokalemia.

Results

The incidence of hypokalemia was significantly higher in the HCTZ group (compared with the placebo group) at 48 and 96 hours after randomization, and at discharge (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following variables were independently associated with the development of hypokalemia: baseline K⁺ values (OR per 0.1 units, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76–0.87]; P < 0.001), treatment with HCTZ (OR, 4.90 [95% CI, 2.50–9.90]; P < 0.001), and treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at baseline (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.20–0.84]; P = 0.017). There was no association between the development of hypokalemia and 30- and 90-day mortality and readmissions. The Monte Carlo simulation method predicted in patients treated with furosemide alone a higher risk of hypokalemia when baseline K⁺ values are ≤ 3.7 mmol/L. When HCTZ is added to furosemide, the risk of hypokalemia is present with higher baseline K + values (≤ 4.3 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Adding HCTZ to intravenous furosemide increases the risk of hypokalemia a especially when baseline K⁺ is ≤ 4.3 mmol/L and when patients are not treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In patients treated with furosemide and HCTZ, it is advisable to add potassium supplements and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^116ciKVY]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Many guidelines recommend CTLD and HCTZ as a first-line therapy for mild to moderate essential hypertension. However, HCTZ seems to be the more commonly used diuretic. Our meta-analysis has demonstrated a slight superiority for CTLD regarding BP control. At the same time, the two medications do not show significant differences in their safety profile although data concerning their effect on serum potassium and sodium is scarce. Additional studies investigating rates of hypokalemia and hyponatremia should be performed. Based on our results we think CTLD should be widely used as an alternative to HCTZ in clinical practice.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111kb4EC]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Hypokalemia has been associated with an increased risk of adverse CV outcomes. A meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies suggested a progressively increasing risk for mortality associated with hypokalemia starting at a potassium value of 3.5 mEq/L. Hypokalemia and its association with an increased risk for CV outcomes have been limiting factors for the use of high-dose diuretic therapy. A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs comparing high-dose vs low-dose diuretic therapy demonstrated a reduction in coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality associated with low-dose diuretics. Similarly, a secondary analysis of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial, which compared CTD with placebo in older individuals, demonstrated an increased risk of CV events in those taking CTD who developed hypokalemia (potassium level < 3.5 mEq/L) compared with those who did not. The DCP trial was a pragmatic RCT with the assumption being that the doses of CTD and HCTZ were pharmacologically comparable. This was demonstrated by similar clinical BP values observed over the course of the trial. We also assumed that hypokalemia would be the same between groups and managed similarly, but this was not the case, as evidenced by the increased incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L associated with CTD both overall in the DCP trial and specifically in participants without a prior MI or stroke. It is unclear why those with a prior MI or stroke had a greater incidence of mild hypokalemia but no greater incidence of moderate to severe hypokalemia or hospitalization for hypokalemia in the CTD group compared with the HCTZ group. Generally, patients were taking similar doses of HCTZ at baseline (6379 of 6756 [94.4%] and 6402 of 6767 [94.6%] were receiving 25 mg of HCTZ at baseline in the CTD and HCTZ group, respectively), and there was no difference in BP between treatment groups over the trial duration. Additionally, while those with prior MI or stroke were more likely to be taking an ACE inhibitor, ARB, and/or MRA at baseline, use of these classes of medications did not substantially change over the study course. On average, those in the group with prior MI or stroke had a greater number of outpatient visits over the duration of the study. The difference in use of potassium supplements without severe hypokalemia may have been the result of greater recognition of mild hypokalemia and greater treatment associated with the greater frequency of visits in this high-risk subgroup. However, the absolute number of moderate to severe hypokalemic events was greater in this group compared with the group without prior MI or stroke.

### Hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone for hypertension? | NEJM resident 360… [^111YXyQK]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The Diuretic Comparison Project investigators surmised that the discrepancy between guideline recommendations and real-world use was related to the belief that chlorthalidone was associated with a greater risk of adverse events than hydrochlorothiazide. To try and resolve this uncertainty, they compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in a large pragmatic study using the Veterans Affairs health system database. After a median of 2. 4 years, the primary composite outcome and safety outcomes were similar in the two groups. Pre- and post-trial blood pressures also remained similar in the two groups. Patients in the chlorthalidone group had more laboratory studies for potassium levels, prescriptions for potassium, and slightly more hospitalizations for hypokalemia. During median follow-up of 2.

4 years, the primary composite outcome was 10% in each group. Individual components of this endpoint occurred with virtually identical frequency in the two groups. Chlorthalidone recipients were more likely than HCTZ recipients to develop hypokalemia, but the difference was modest. Blood pressure remained similar in the two groups. Comment: HCTZ and chlorthalidone performed similarly in this trial. However, the trial included only patients who were 65 or older, so the results don't necessarily apply to younger people. Additionally, 23% of patients had glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.

73 m2 at baseline, but the paper doesn't tell us whether patients with severely impaired renal function were included; that information is important because thiazide diuretics traditionally have been thought to lose effectiveness when GFR is markedly reduced. Notably, a recent 12-week, placebo-controlled study showed that chlorthalidone did lower blood pressure in patients with GFRs between 15 and 30 mL/minute, but I'm not aware of similar data for HCTZ.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115tnqZk]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with hypertension, is chlorthalidone superior to hydrochlorothiazide at preventing kidney outcomes?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 12 265 patients aged 65 years or older with hypertension, chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide in preventing kidney outcomes. There was an increased incidence of hypokalemia events in the chlorthalidone group compared with the hydrochlorothiazide group.

Meaning

Both chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide may be used for the treatment of hypertension and kidney outcomes.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^115hxcDP]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main purpose of our meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of CTLD and HCTZ used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive treatments in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After systematic review of published data we used the reported results on changes in SBP, DBP, sodium, and potassium levels to compare both preparations. Table 3 summarizes our conclusions and emphasizes the superiority of CTLD when it comes to BP control.

Table 3
CTLD versus HCTZ — direct comparisons

CTLD at the doses studied is a more potent antihypertensive agent resulting in greater BP lowering and better outcomes so that recent data in the literature appear to favor it for lowering SBP more than HCTZ. In previous MRFIT subgroup analysis in patients with baseline rest ECG abnormalities, CTLD group had lower potassium levels and higher uric acid levels. The authors suggest that the reason for these negative findings may again relate to the potency of CTLD and the doses used in the study. Improved outcomes by CTLD may be elated to differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties between the two preparations.

Thiazide diuretics are widely used for the management of hypertension. In recent years, it has been actively debated that there is interchangeability of thiazide-type diuretics such as HCTZ and thiazide-like diuretics including INDAP and CTLD for the treatment of hypertension.

Other published meta-analysis supports our statement. Ernst et al. systematically searched and identified clinical trials, from 1948 to July 2008, using HCTZ or CTLD as monotherapies. They comment that both the agents are effective antihypertensives but factors, such as ethnicity, diet, and comorbidities, may influence response to thiazides. However pooled data showed that CTLD produces statistically greater SBP reduction than HCTZ in each dose partition. Authors report that incident hypokalemia is a dichotomous end point with thresholds usually varying from 3.0 to 3.5 mEq/l depending on the study.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^111XoXQr]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide use among older adults with varying levels of kidney function?

Findings

In this cohort study of 12 722 older adults, chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk for eGFR decline of 30% or more, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The excess risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there is no clear reason to prefer chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide, although further randomized clinical trials may provide clarity into the comparative effectiveness of these 2 medications.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^115f546D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the thiazide‐like and thiazide‐type diuretics are clinically relevant to consider. Hydrochlorothiazide has a shorter duration of action (< 24 hours) compared with that of indapamide (> 24 hours) and chlorthalidone (48–72 hours), and hydrochlorothiazide is less potent per milligram than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide has inferior 24‐hour and nighttime blood pressure control compared with chlorthalidone. When considering tolerability, chlorthalidone likely carries an increased risk of hypokalemia. Indapamide may offer the best tolerability: hypokalemia appears to occur less frequently than with hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide has neutral effects on serum glucose and lipids (whereas hydrochlorothiazide does not). It is important to consider, too, that the antihypertensive and metabolic adverse effects of the thiazide diuretics may not be the same across all racial and ethnic groups. A post hoc analysis of the PEAR (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses) and PEAR‐2 clinical trials, which randomized patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension but without diabetes or prior cardiovascular disease to hydrochlorothiazide (PEAR‐1) and chlorthalidone (PEAR‐2) or a beta blocker, found that chlorthalidone was more potent than hydrochlorothiazide in both Black and White patients; however, Black patients had robust blood pressure decreases with both hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone, resulting in a smaller differential between the 2 agents. In addition, although both Black patients and White patients had hypokalemia more frequently with chlorthalidone, Black patients were more likely to reach a serum potassium level of < 3.0 mEq/L with chlorthalidone.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115U66sn]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Other studies have demonstrated a similar increase in the incidence of hypokalemia associated with CTD compared with HCTZ. More recently, a study by Hripcsak et alusing insurance databases suggested no difference in CV outcomes between CTD and HCTZ but an increased risk of hypokalemia associated with CTD. In addition, Edwards et alsuggested in a propensity-matched cohort that CTD was associated with a greater risk for CV events and hypokalemia compared with HCTZ. It is unclear whether the overall results of the DCP trial would have been altered had hypokalemia (potassium level < 3.5 mEq/L) been more aggressively monitored and treated. A hypothesis for the differential outcome in those with prior MI or stroke is that benefits of CTD were unmasked by the prevention of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L in the CTD compared with the HCTZ group and/or by the greater use of supplemental potassium in the CTD group. There may, however, be an alternative explanation.

Results of this analysis suggest a qualitative interaction. This type of interaction is less common than a quantitative interaction, in which the treatment is beneficial (or harmful) in all subgroups but the magnitude of effect varies among subgroups. It is typically difficult to interpret subgroups with qualitative interactions to determine whether the effect is real or simply from chance. Formal tests for interaction were conducted, with results remaining significant after adjusting for multiplicity. Also, the suggestion of a qualitative interaction by baseline MI or stroke status was seen for the primary outcome and for components of the primary outcome, including acute heart failure, MI, noncancer-related death, and total mortality. Finally, adverse effects related to hypokalemia differed in those with and without MI or stroke at baseline. Despite this approach, it is possible that the observed interaction was due to chance alone.

### Race-specific comparisons of antihypertensive and metabolic effects of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone [^1162bFgk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chlorthalidone is recommended over hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as the preferred thiazide, but the supporting evidence is not robust at routinely used doses, or in whites vs blacks, in whom differences in response to thiazides are well known. We compare the efficacy and safety of HCTZ and chlorthalidone as first-line therapies for white and black hypertensive patients.

Methods

We compared treatment-related outcomes between the HCTZ arm (12.5 mg for 2–3 weeks; 25 mg for additional 6 weeks) of the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR, n = 376) and chlorthalidone arm (15 mg for 2 weeks; 25 mg for additional 6 weeks) of PEAR-2 (n = 326) clinical trials, in 17-65-year-old mild-moderate uncomplicated hypertensive whites and blacks.

Results

Mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) reduction with HCTZ vs chlorthalidone: 8 ± 8/4 ± 5 vs 12 ± 9/7 ± 5 mm Hg in whites (P < 10⁻⁶ SBP and DBP); 12 ± 10/7 ± 6 vs 15 ± 10/9 ± 6 in blacks (P = 0.008 SBP, P = 0.054 DBP). Treatment with HCTZ vs chlorthalidone in whites resulted in significantly fewer patients achieving target BP (< 140/90 mm Hg) (44% vs 57%, P = 0.018) and clinical response rate (≥ 10 mm Hg DBP reduction); and significantly higher nonresponse rate (< 6 mm Hg DBP reduction); but no significant differences in rates among blacks (eg, target-BP rate: 56% vs 63%, P = 0.31). HCTZ treatment led to significantly lower rates of hypokalemia and hyperuricemia in whites and blacks, vs chlorthalidone, and significantly lower odds of requiring potassium supplementation among blacks (odds ratio 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.37; P = 3.4×10⁻⁷).

Conclusion

Compared with HCTZ, chlorthalidone showed greater blood pressure lowering and adverse metabolic effects in whites, but similar blood pressure lowering and greater adverse effects in blacks; suggesting that the recent guideline recommendations to choose chlorthalidone over HCTZ may not be warranted in blacks.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^116mySJB]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety monitoring report

Diuretic-related side effects can be separated into several categories, including those with well–worked-out mechanisms, such as electrolyte defects and/or metabolic abnormalities. Mechanisms that contribute to the onset of hypokalemia during diuretic use include: increased flow-dependent distal nephron K⁺ secretion (more commonly observed with a high Na⁺ intake), a fall in distal tubule luminal chloride (Cl⁻) metabolic alkalosis, and/or secondary hyperaldosteronism. Sica et al. give an opinion that thiazide-related side effects are somewhat more common with longer-acting compounds, such as CTLD. In our meta-analysis as a secondary point we decided to made a statistical analysis of data concerning changes of serum potassium and serum sodium levels. Safety monitoring observation of the serum potassium levels were made in three studies. The WMD (95% CI) is −0.22 mEq/L (−0.32 ÷ −0.11 mEq/L). Dorsch et al. has the most significant weight for our analysis — 78.7%. Figure 4 shows that there is no homogeneity between the published studies. No other studies included enough data about potassium levels to be included in the analysis. Figure S3 for publication bias using funnel plot is presented in the Supplementary material file.

Fig. 4
Forest plot–weighted mean difference (WMD)–serum K⁺ (mEq/L)

Only one study directly compared the two preparations in regard to their effects on serum sodium levels. Pareek et al. conclude that there are no significant changes in serum electrolytes, blood sugar, and other laboratory parameters in patients treated with CTLD and HCTZ.

### Amlodipine valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Exforge HCT) [^113hQ7S3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Exforge HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Exforge HCT [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trial of Exforge HCT in moderate to severe hypertensive patients, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) at any time post-baseline with the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10/320/25 mg) was 10% compared to 25% with HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg), 7% with valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg), and 3% with amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg). One patient (0.2%) discontinued therapy due to an adverse event of hypokalemia in each of the Exforge HCT and HCTZ/amlodipine groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with Exforge HCT compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with the dual therapies.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Exforge HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114KJgdd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our observational analysis across 3 large and disparate databases showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide for a range of cardiovascular outcomes, but chlorthalidone had a worse safety profile, including an association with an increased risk of hypokalemia with an HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12). Other electrolyte abnormalities were also more frequent.

Our study is the largest multisite analysis of real-world evidence to address this comparison, with 36 918 records of individuals prescribed chlorthalidone and 693 337 prescribed hydrochlorothiazide across the 3 databases. We found consistent results across our 3 databases, excellent balance on more than 60 000 covariates after stratification, little bias based on our controls, little sensitivity to changes in time at risk, to inclusion of baseline blood pressure or to initial dose, and confirmation of differences in potassium by laboratory measurement.

Electrolyte Disturbances

Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use (133 [95% CI, 123–142] events per 1000 person-years vs 73 [95% CI, 70–77] events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.55–1.87]) (Figure 4 A). The increased risk of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone was more prominent in patients with higher baseline kidney function (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²: 139 [5%CI 127–151] events per 1000 person-years vs 70.2 [95% CI, 66.1–74.4] events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.67–2.08]; eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m²: 123 [95% CI, 101–145] events per 1000 person-years vs 75.4 [95% CI, 66.2–84.6] events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25–1.96]; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²: 113 [95% CI, 88–137] events per 1000 person-years vs 96.8 [95% CI, 82.4–111.3] events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.84–1.45]; P for interaction = .001). There was no significant difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide groups in risk of hyperkalemia (11.4 [95% CI, 8.7–14.0] events per 1000 person-years vs 8.84 [95% CI, 7.62–10.06] events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.79–1.39]) (Figure 4 B) or hyponatremia (39.8 [95% CI, 34.7–44.9] events per 1000 person-years vs 35.1 [95% CI, 32.7–37.6] events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.98–1.32]) (Figure 4 C), with no association modification by eGFR category (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116BVR1Y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Hypokalemia and Hypokalemic Adverse Events

There was a differential incidence of various degrees of hypokalemia by treatment group when stratified by history of MI or stroke. The incidence of a nadir potassium level between 3.1 and 3.5 mEq/L or less than 3.1 mEq/L was greater in the subgroup with prior MI or stroke than in the group without prior MI or stroke (Table 3). In the group with prior MI or stroke randomized to CTD, there was greater incidence of a nadir potassium level of 3.1 to 3.5 mEq/L compared with the HCTZ group (277 of 733 [37.8%] vs 206 of 722 [28.5%]; P < .001). However, the incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L was similar between the CTD and HCTZ groups (43 of 733 [5.9%] vs 37 of 722 [5.1%]; P = 0.57). Participants receiving CTD were more likely to be prescribed potassium supplements at a median follow-up of 2.5 years (CTD, 76 of 401 [19.0%]; HCTZ, 52 of 414 [12.6%]; P = 0.01) (Table 4). In the subgroup with a history of MI or stroke, incidence of hospitalization for primary hypokalemia did not differ between the treatment groups (CTD, 14 of 733 [1.9%]; HCTZ, 16 of 722 [2.2%]; P = 0.72) (Table 3). In the subgroup with no prior MI or stroke randomized to CTD, there was similarly a greater incidence of a nadir potassium level of 3.1 to 3.5 mEq/L compared with those in the HCTZ group (1845 of 6023 [30.6%] vs 1592 of 6045 [26.3%]; P < .001) (Table 3), but there also was a greater incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L in those randomized to CTD vs HCTZ (292 of 6023 [4.9%] vs 206 of 6045 [3.4%]; P < .001) (Table 3). Potassium supplement use was not different between treatments at a median follow-up of 2.5 years (CTD, 464 of 3463 [13.4%]; HCTZ, 417 of 3436 [12.1%]; P = 0.12) (Table 4). In addition, the frequency of hospitalizations for hypokalemia among those taking CTD was higher than that among those taking HCTZ in the subgroup without prior MI or stroke (84 of 6023 [1.4%] vs 57 of 6045 [0.9%]; P = 0.02) (Table 3).

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112BEsLr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke have a greater risk of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events.

Objective

To evaluate the association of chlorthalidone (CTD) vs hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) with CV outcomes and noncancer deaths in participants with and without prior MI or stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the Diuretic Comparison Project (DCP), a pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted within 72 participating Veterans Affairs health care systems from June 2016 to June 2021, in which patients aged 65 years or older with hypertension taking HCTZ at baseline were randomized to continue HCTZ or switch to CTD at pharmacologically comparable doses. This secondary analysis was performed from January 3, 2023, to February 29, 2024.

Exposures

Pharmacologically comparable daily dose of HCTZ or CTD and history of MI or stroke.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcome ascertainment was performed from randomization to the end of the study. The primary outcome consisted of a composite of stroke, MI, urgent coronary revascularization because of unstable angina, acute heart failure hospitalization, or noncancer death. Additional outcomes included achieved blood pressure and hypokalemia (potassium level < 3.1 mEq/L; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0).

Results

The DCP randomized 13 523 participants to CTD or HCTZ, with a mean (SD) study duration of 2.4 (1.4) years. At baseline, median age was 72 years (IQR, 69–75 years), and 96.8% were male. Treatment effect was evaluated in subgroups of participants with (n = 1455) and without (n = 12 068) prior MI or stroke at baseline. There was a significant adjusted interaction between treatment group and history of MI or stroke. Participants with prior MI or stroke randomized to CTD had a lower risk of the primary outcome than those receiving HCTZ (105 of 733 [14.3%] vs 140 of 722 [19.4%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.94; P = 0.01) compared with participants without prior MI or stroke, among whom incidence of the primary outcome was slightly higher in the CTD arm compared with the HCTZ arm (597 of 6023 [9.9%] vs 535 of 6045 [8.9%]; HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00–1.26; P = 0.054) (P = 0.01 for interaction). The incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L and hospitalization for hypokalemia differed among those with and without prior MI or stroke when comparing those randomized to CTD vs HCTZ, with a difference only among those without prior MI or stroke (potassium level < 3.1 mEq/L: prior MI or stroke, 43 of 733 [5.9%] vs 37 of 722 [5.1%] [P = 0.57]; no prior MI or stroke, 292 of 6023 [4.9%] vs 206 of 6045 [3.4%] [P < .001]; hospitalization for hypokalemia: prior MI or stroke, 14 of 733 [1.9%] vs 16 of 722 [2.2%] [P = 0.72]; no prior MI or stroke: 84 of 6023 [1.4%] vs 57 of 6045 [0.9%] [P = 0.02]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this secondary analysis of the DCP trial suggest that CTD may be associated with reduced major adverse CV events and noncancer deaths in patients with prior MI or stroke compared with HCTZ.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^115rzAjH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelinerecommends thiazide and thiazidelike diuretics as one of the first-line treatment classes. Hydrochlorothiazide is the most commonly prescribed member of the class, but the guideline states that chlorthalidone is preferred on the basis of longer half-life and proven trial reduction of cardiovascular disease. However, to our knowledge there are no large, completed randomized clinical trials comparing these medications, although one is in progress. Indirect network meta-analyses showed superior effectiveness with chlorthalidone, but a large observational study showed approximately equal effectiveness. Short-term, small randomized clinical trials, showed only nominal differences in safety issues such as hypokalemia, but the observational studyshowed a worse safety profile for chlorthalidone with higher rates of hypokalemia and hyponatremia.

Both indirect network meta-analyses and traditional observational studies are vulnerable to bias, but recent analytic methods are providing improved strategies to mitigate this risk. These strategies include the balancing of large numbers of baseline patient covariates to make comparison groups more equivalent, using many negative controls to detect and correct residual bias, and testing of the consistency among heterogeneous data sources. We used these techniques to compare chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide on 55 outcomes in 3 large observational databases of patients from the United States.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide antihypertensive treatment in high sodium intake population: a randomized double-blind trial [^117PkQRr]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of telmisartan 40mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25mg/day in high sodium intake patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in China.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, eligible patients were randomly divided into telmisartan and HCTZ groups with three follow-ups scheduled on days 15, 30, and 60 after enrollment to compare BP decrease, hypokalemia, and other adverse events after intervention.

Results

A total of 1333 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with average sodium intake of 5909mg/day were enrolled from 14 county hospitals in China. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. At 15, 30, and 60 days of follow-up, average SBP/DBP reduction in telmisartan and HCTZ group was 12.5/8.0, 14.3/9.1, 12.8/7.2, 11.0/5.8, 13.6/7.1, and 11.5/5.3mmHg, respectively. Telmisartan showed greater BP response than HCTZ at three visits, with statistical significance for DBP (P < 0.001) regardless of the adjustment for baseline BP, sodium excretion, and pulse pressure (PP). SBP reduction was positively related to increasing urinary sodium and PP levels for patients in both groups but increased faster with increasing PP in HCTZ than in telmisartan (P = 0.0238 for group×PP). Compared with telmisartan, HCTZ showed more hypokalemia (0.4 vs. 4.5%, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Both telmisartan and HCTZ were effective for the treatment of hypertensive patients with high sodium intake. Telmisartan showed better DBP-lowering effect and less hypokalemia than HCTZ among high sodium intake patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the plausible superiority effect of hydrochlorothiazide among patients with large PP.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^1176MDyD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

While all triamterene regimens reversed hypokalemia, at Week 4 the 37.5-mg regimen proved optimal compared with the other tested regimens. On this regimen, 81% of the patients had a significant (P < 0.05) reversal of hypokalemia vs. 59% of patients on the placebo/hydrochlorothiazide regimen. The mean serum potassium concentration on 37.5 mg triamterene went from 3.2 ± 0.2 mEq/L at baseline to 3.7 ± 0.3 mEq/L at Week 4, a significantly greater (P < 0.05) improvement than that achieved with placebo/hydrochlorothiazide (i.e., 3.2 ± 0.2 mEq/L at baseline and 3.5 ± 0.4 mEq/L at Week 4). Also, 51% of patients in the 37.5-mg triamterene group had an increase in serum potassium of ≥ 0.5 mEq/L at Week 4 vs. 33% in the placebo group. The 37.5-mg triamterene/25-mg hydrochlorothiazide regimen also maintained control of blood pressure; mean supine systolic blood pressure at Week 4 was 138 ± 21 mmHg while mean supine diastolic blood pressure was 87 ± 13 mmHg.

### Triamterene enhances the blood pressure lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension [^113xFHhG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Triamterene, because of its potassium-sparing properties, is frequently used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to treat patients with hypertension. By inhibiting the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct, triamterene reduces potassium secretion, thus reducing the risk of hypokalemia. Whether triamterene has an independent effect on blood pressure (BP) has not been well studied.

Objective

To determine if triamterene provides an effect to further lower BP in patients treated with HCTZ.

Design

We conducted an observational study using electronic medical record data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care. Participants were 17,291 patients with the diagnosis of hypertension between 2004 and 2012.

Main Measures

BP was the primary outcome. We compared the BP between patients who were taking HCTZ, with and without triamterene, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications, by using a propensity score analysis. For each medication combination, we estimated the propensity score (i.e., probability) of a patient receiving triamterene using a logistic regression model. Patients with similar propensity scores were stratified into subclasses and BP was compared between those taking triamterene or not within each subclass; the effect of triamterene was then assessed by combining BP differences estimated from all subclasses.

Key Results

The mean systolic BP in the triamterene + HCTZ group was 3.8 mmHg lower than in the HCTZ only group (p < 0.0001); systolic BP was similarly lower for patients taking triamterene with other medication combinations. Systolic BP reduction was consistently observed for different medication combinations. The range of systolic BP reduction was between 1 and 4 mm Hg, depending on the concurrently used medications.

Conclusions

In the present study, triamterene was found to enhance the effect of HCTZ to lower BP. In addition to its potassium-sparing action, triamterene's ability to lower BP should also be considered.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^116CZEms]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated in those patients with hypertension or with congestive heart failure who develop hypokalemia when thiazides or other kaliuretic diuretics are used alone, or in whom maintenance of normal serum potassium levels is considered to be clinically important, e.g., digitalized patients, or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias.

The use of potassium-conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet.

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used alone or as an adjunct to other antihypertensive drugs, such as methyldopa or beta blockers. Since amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide enhances the action of these agents, dosage adjustments may be necessary to avoid an excessive fall in blood pressure and other unwanted side effects.

The fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of edema or hypertension except in individuals in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1156M8CX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of the current subgroup analysis include an a priori plan to examine the subgroup with MI or stroke and use of data prior to randomization. This study also has limitations. Despite the significant interaction in an a priori subgroup, these findings may be due to chance. While the incidence of adverse events was greater in the subgroup with prior MI or stroke than in the subgroup without MI or stroke, there were few participants in this group and there were fewer events overall. It is also unclear whether the benefits seen in the group with prior MI or stroke compared with the group with no prior MI or stroke were the result of baseline risk, prevention of hypokalemia, or additional potassium supplementation in the group with prior MI or stroke. We can only conclude that the combination of all 3 was associated with an improved outcome in participants taking CTD compared with HCTZ. There may be other factors not explored here that may have led to the observed interaction.

### Thiazide-induced subtle renal injury not observed in States of equivalent hypokalemia [^114zLW8W]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is used to manage hypertension and heart failure; however, its side effects include mild hypokalemia, metabolic abnormalities, and volume depletion, which might have deleterious effects on renal and endothelial function. We studied whether HCTZ cause renal injury and/or altered vasoreactivity and if these changes are hypokalemia-dependent. Rats were given a normal diet or a diet moderately low in potassium K+ with or without HCTZ. Animals fed either a low K+ diet alone or HCTZ developed mild hypokalemia. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the different treatment groups. All three groups with hypokalemia had mild proteinuria; low K(+)-HCTZ rats had reduced creatinine clearance. HCTZ-treated rats displayed hypomagnesemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperaldosteronism. No renal injury was observed in the groups without HCTZ; however, increased kidney weight, glomerular ischemia, medullary injury, and cortical oxidative stress were seen with HCTZ treatment. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was reduced in all hypokalemic groups and correlated with reduced serum K+, serum, and urine nitric oxide. Our results show that HCTZ is associated with greater renal injury for the same degree of hypokalemia as the low K+ diet, suggesting that factors such as chronic ischemia and hyperaldosteronism due to volume depletion may be responsible agents. We also found impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was linked to mild hypokalemia.

### Hypokalaemia associated with hydrochlorothiazide used in the treatment of hypertension in NHANES 1999–2018 [^113yMBRg]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide is the most common thiazide diuretic used for hypertension in the US. Yet, hypokalaemia is a well-recognised adverse effect. To evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5mmol/L) among hydrochlorothiazide users, we included US adults aged ≥ 20 years in the 1999–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were categorised according to the use of hydrochlorothiazide and other antihypertensive agents. Factors associated with hypokalaemia, including demographics and prescription patterns (monotherapy vs single-pill fixed-dose combination vs polytherapy) were studied using multivariable logistic regression. Hypokalaemia was present in 12.6% of the hydrochlorothiazide users, equivalent to ~2.0 million US adults. Women (adjusted OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.74–2.83), non-Hispanic blacks (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.31–2.08), underweight (adjusted OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.34–13.95), and participants taking hydrochlorothiazide for five years or more (adjusted OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06–2.04) had a higher risk of hypokalaemia. Compared to monotherapy, fixed-dose combination therapy (adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21–0.48) was associated with the lowest risk. Among those taking potassium supplements, hypokalaemia was found in 27.2% of participants on monotherapy and 17.9% on polytherapy. The prevalence of hypokalaemia among hydrochlorothiazide users was considerable, even among participants who also took potassium supplements. Women, ethnic minorities, underweight, monotherapy, and participants with long-term therapy are more likely to have hypokalaemia. Regular monitoring of potassium and combination with potassium-sparing drugs are needed.

Medications that could prolong the QT interval and induce torsades de pointes (TdP) are organized by risk categories and defined as follows: "Known risk of TdP" drugs "prolong the QT interval and are clearly associated with a known risk of TdP, even when taken as recommended"; "Possible risk of TdP" drugs "can cause QT prolongation but currently lack evidence for a risk of TdP when taken as recommended"; "Conditional risk of TdP" drugs are "associated with TdP but only under certain circumstances of their use (eg, excessive dose, in patients such as those with hypokalemia, or when taken with interacting drugs) or by creating conditions that facilitate or induce TdP"; and "Drugs to avoid in congenital long QT" "pose a special risk of TdP for patients with congenital long-QT syndrome and include those in the above 3 categories plus additional drugs that do not prolong the QT interval per se but have a special risk because of their adrenaline-like actions". The table notes that "The CredibleMeds online lists are revised regularly and should be consulted before clinical decisions are made on the safe use of any of these medicines", that "†Removed from the market", and that "HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; QT, QT interval; and TdP, torsades de pointes".

### Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide (Benicar hct) [^113wtpp8]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

In a double-blind clinical trial of various doses of olmesartan
medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who
developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.4 mEq/L) was 2.1%; the incidence of
hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4%. In this trial, no patient
discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium.

Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible
electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients
receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or
electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis and hypokalemia.
Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are important when the patient is
vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms
of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of
mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion.
seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria,
tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe
cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^115V86u2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study of individuals aged 66 years and older, we found that chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The increased risk for hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide was attenuated in patients with reduced kidney function.

Our results expand on prior studies comparing safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide use. First, to our knowledge, no prior studies have compared chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide head-to-head across levels of kidney function. As thiazides are increasingly prescribed in CKD, understanding their differential outcomes associated with level of kidney function may allow for more personalized hypertension care. Second, most prior studies comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide have not accounted for their differing potencies. Chlorthalidone is 2- to 3-fold more potent (per milligram) than hydrochlorothiazide. We comprehensively examined outcomes between adults using chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide on both 1 mg:2 mg and 1 mg:3 mg dose-matching schemes with similar findings. Third, several prior studies limited the comparison between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide to their use as first-line agents, whereas they are recommended and commonly used as add-on therapy. Non–first-line thiazide use is particularly relevant in CKD, in which alternative agents, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, have well-established protective associations for the kidneys and are preferentially prescribed as first-line therapy. By allowing for thiazides as first-line or add-on therapy, our study design is more reflective of real-world practice.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116ecu1P]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Overall findings of the DCP were reported previously; the HR for the primary outcome with CTD was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.94–1.16). In this prespecified secondary analysis of the DCP, there was a significant qualitative interaction between treatment assignment and the presence or absence of MI or stroke at baseline with respect to the primary outcome. In those with a prior MI or stroke, CTD appeared to be associated with lower incidence of MACE and noncancer-related deaths and with reduced all-cause mortality (not a prespecified outcome). An overall increase in incidence of hypokalemia in those randomized to CTD was noted irrespective of how hypokalemia was defined. The incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L was not different between the CTD and HCTZ groups in those with prior MI or stroke. Among those without prior MI or stroke, there was a greater incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L in the CTD group compared with the HCTZ group. This difference likely led to more hospitalizations for hypokalemia in the CTD group. It is unclear why, in the subgroup with prior MI or stroke, there was an increased incidence of a potassium level between 3.1 and 3.5 mEq/L in the CTD group compared with the HCTZ group but this did not translate to an increased incidence of a potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L or an increased risk of hypokalemia-related hospitalizations. Of note, those taking CTD in the group with prior MI or stroke included a greater percentage of patients taking potassium supplements, which was not seen in those without prior MI or stroke. Use of medications moderating hypokalemia, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs, while greater in those with a prior MI or stroke compared with those without prior MI or stroke, was not different in those randomized to CTD compared with HCTZ over the course of the study.

### Meta-analysis of dose-response characteristics of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone: effects on systolic blood pressure and potassium [^112uyX92]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence supporting the benefit of low-dose thiazide-based regimens to reduce cardiovascular events is primarily derived from studies using chlorthalidone, yet low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (12.5–25 mg) remains more widely prescribed. We sought to describe their comparative dose-response relationships for changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and potassium.

Methods

PubMed from 1948 to July 2008 was systematically searched to identify clinical trials using either HCTZ or chlorthalidone monotherapies. A total of 108 clinical trials with HCTZ and 29 with chlorthalidone were analyzed. Data were pooled to evaluate the effects on SBP and potassium of both drugs throughout their respective dose-response curves. Equivalence analysis was performed for the clinically recommended low-dose range of 12.5–25 mg, grouped by study duration, using the two one-sided tests procedure described by Schuirmann.

Results

When evaluated on a milligram-per-milligram basis using pooled data, chlorthalidone generally produces slightly greater reductions in SBP and potassium than HCTZ. In the low-dose range of 12.5–25 mg, equivalence analysis reveals that the reductions in SBP are not equivalent between the two drugs, using upper and lower equivalence bounds of 4 mm Hg. Within the same dosing range, the mean changes in potassium were determined to be equivalent when upper and lower equivalence bounds of 0.29 mEq/l are used.

Conclusions

Equivalence analysis using data from several studies suggests that the SBP reductions achieved with HCTZ and chlorthalidone cannot be considered equivalent within the low-dose range currently recommended. However, within this dosing range, reductions in potassium can be considered equivalent.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^111EyFYE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether chlorthalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension is unclear.

Methods

In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned adults 65 years of age or older who were patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system and had been receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a daily dose of 25 or 50 mg to continue therapy with hydrochlorothiazide or to switch to chlorthalidone at a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death. Safety was also assessed.

Results

A total of 13,523 patients underwent randomization. The mean age was 72 years. At baseline, hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25 mg per day had been prescribed in 12,781 patients (94.5%). The mean baseline systolic blood pressure in each group was 139 mm Hg. At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, there was little difference in the occurrence of primary-outcome events between the chlorthalidone group (702 patients [10.4%]) and the hydrochlorothiazide group (675 patients [10.0%]) (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.16; P = 0.45). There were no between-group differences in the occurrence of any of the components of the primary outcome. The incidence of hypokalemia was higher in the chlorthalidone group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (6.0% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this large pragmatic trial of thiazide diuretics at doses commonly used in clinical practice, patients who received chlorthalidone did not have a lower occurrence of major cardiovascular outcome events or non-cancer-related deaths than patients who received hydrochlorothiazide. (Funded by the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02185417.).

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^117T3NAd]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.8 Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

Tekturna HCT

In the short-term controlled trials of various doses of Tekturna HCT, in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.2%; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L) was 0.8%. No patients discontinued due to increase or decrease of serum potassium.

Aliskiren

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)], NSAIDs, including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), or potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

HCTZ can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Tekturna HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

5.9 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole

Aliskiren

When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.10 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

HCTZ, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle- closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue HCTZ as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

### Chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^116v641V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some evidence suggests that chlorthalidone may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide in older adults.

Design

Propensity score-matched observational cohort study with up to 5 years of follow-up.

Setting

Ontario, Canada.

Patients

All individuals aged 66 years or older who were newly treated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide and were not hospitalized for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction in the prior year were eligible for inclusion. Each chlorthalidone recipient was matched to up to 2 hydrochlorothiazide recipients on the basis of age, sex, year of treatment initiation, and propensity score.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a composite of death or hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Safety outcomes included hospitalization with hypokalemia or hyponatremia.

Results

A total of 29 873 patients were studied. During follow-up, chlorthalidone recipients (n = 10 384) experienced the primary outcome at a rate of 3.2 events per 100 person-years of follow-up, and hydrochlorothiazide recipients experienced 3.4 events per 100 person-years of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.06]). Patients treated with chlorthalidone were more likely to be hospitalized with hypokalemia (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06 [CI, 2.04 to 4.58]) or hyponatremia (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.68 [CI, 1.24 to 2.28]). In 9 post hoc analyses comparing patients initially prescribed 12.5, 25, or 50 mg of chlorthalidone per day with those prescribed 12.5, 25, or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day, the former were more likely to be hospitalized with hypokalemia for all 6 comparisons in which a statistically significant association was found. The results of other effectiveness and safety outcomes were also consistent with those of the main analysis.

Limitation

Unmeasured differences in baseline characteristics or physician treatment approaches or an insufficiently large sample may have limited the ability to detect small differences in the comparative effectiveness of the drugs.

Conclusion

As typically prescribed, chlorthalidone in older adults was not associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular events or deaths than hydrochlorothiazide. However, it was associated with a greater incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^113HTak4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this population-based cohort study of older adults, we found that chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The excess risk of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function. Placed in context with prior observational studies comparing the safety and clinical outcomes associated with thiazide diuretics, these results suggest that there is no clear reason to prefer chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide on urinary calcium excretion in dent disease: an uncontrolled trial [^117W9YGw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide doses equivalent to 1 to 2 mg/kg/d of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) have been proposed to correct hypercalciuria and prevent kidney failure in patients with Dent disease. However, they can cause adverse metabolic effects in the long term. In treating hypertension in children, lower thiazide doses have been shown to be as effective and well tolerated.

Study Design

Uncontrolled trial, with forced-titration sequential open-label study design.

Setting & Participants

7 boys with genetically confirmed Dent disease and mild phenotype (neither overt sodium wasting nor kidney failure).

Intervention

After a 1-month run-in period, patients sequentially received amiloride (5 mg/d) alone (1 month) and then for 3 periods of 2 months in association with increasing doses of HCTZ (< 0.2, 0.2 to 0.4, and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg/d).

Outcomes

Urinary calcium excretion and extracellular volume indicators.

Measurements

At the end of each period, 2 daily 24-hour urinary collections were performed on the days preceding admission. Blood and spot urine samples also were collected.

Results

A greater HCTZ dose increased renin, aldosterone, and plasma protein concentrations. Amiloride alone had no effect on calcium excretion. The greatest HCTZ doses decreased spot urinary calcium excretion by 42% compared with baseline (median, 0.3; minimum, maximum, 0.2, 0.8 versus median, 0.8; minimum, maximum, 0.4, 1.1, respectively; P = 0.03). However, patients developed adverse reactions, including muscle cramps (n = 2), biological (n = 7) or symptomatic hypovolemia (n = 1), hypokalemia (n = 4), and hyponatremia (n = 1), which all corrected after treatment withdrawal.

Limitation

Small sample size and absence of a control group.

Conclusion

HCTZ doses greater than 0.4 mg/kg/d decreased calcium excretion, but were associated with significant adverse events. Thiazide diuretic therapy should be considered with caution in children with Dent disease.

### Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide [^111m9hKu]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

### Combining loop and thiazide diuretics Across the left ventricular ejection fraction spectrum: the CLOROTIC trial [^111UaZXm]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to furosemide in the CLOROTIC (Combining Loop with Thiazide Diuretics for Decompensated Heart Failure) trial improved the diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).

Objectives

This work aimed to evaluate if these results differ across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Methods

This post hoc analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CLOROTIC trial enrolled 230 patients with AHF to receive either HCTZ or a placebo in addition to an intravenous furosemide regimen. The influence of LVEF on primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated.

Results

The median LVEF was 55%: 166 (72%) patients had LVEF > 40%, and 64 (28%) had LVEF ≤ 40%. Patients with a lower LVEF were younger, more likely to be male, had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease, and had higher natriuretic peptide levels. The addition of HCTZ to furosemide was associated with the greatest weight loss at 72 of 96 hours, better metrics of diuretic response, and greater 24-hour diuresis compared with placebo, with no significant differences according to the LVEF category (using 2 LVEF cutoff points: 40% and 50%) or LVEF as a continuous variable (all P values were insignificant). There were no significant differences observed with the addition of HCTZ in terms of mortality, rehospitalizations, or safety endpoints (impaired renal function, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia) among the 2 LVEF groups (all P values were insignificant).

Conclusions

Adding HCTZ to intravenous furosemide seems to be effective strategy for improving diuretic response in AHF without treatment effect modification according to baseline LVEF.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^1128UEqz]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Add-On Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren alone or HCTZ alone may be switched to combination therapy with Tekturna HCT.

A patient whose blood pressure is controlled with HCTZ alone but who experiences hypokalemia may be switched to combination therapy with Tekturna HCT.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to Tekturna HCT containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.

Replacement Therapy

Tekturna HCT may be substituted for the titrated components.

Initial Therapy

Tekturna HCT may be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

The choice of Tekturna HCT as initial therapy should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks. Patients with Stage 2 hypertension are at a relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient's risk.

Data from the high-dose multifactorial study [see Clinical Studies (14)] provide estimates of the probability of reaching a target blood pressure with Tekturna HCT compared to aliskiren or HCTZ monotherapy. Figures 1–4 provide estimates of the likelihood of achieving systolic or diastolic blood pressure control with Tekturna HCT 300/25 mg, based upon baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The curve of each treatment group was estimated by logistic regression modeling. The estimated likelihood at the right tail of each curve is less reliable because of small numbers of subjects with high baseline blood pressures.

### Chlorthalidone No better than hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension… [^111mQnJ4]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide associated with a difference in the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events when used to treat hypertension. Bottom Line There is no difference in cardiovascular outcomes when HCTZ is compared with chlorthalidone. There is a slightly higher risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone. Synopsis There has been mixed evidence that chlorthalidone may do a better job at reducing cardiovascular events than HCTZ. Chlorthalidone has been associated with a higher likelihood of adverse events. The pragmatic trial used the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs electronic health records to identify eligible patients 65 years and older who were currently taking HCTZ at a dosage of 25 or 50 mg daily. If participation was approved by their primary care physician, patients were randomized to continue taking HCTZ or switch to chlorthalidone.

Patients in the HCTZ group continued their usual dose, and those randomized to receive chlorthalidone received a dose at one-half of their usual HCTZ dose. Most patients in the HCTZ group were taking 25 mg. This was an open-label trial, although outcome assessors were masked for some outcomes. At baseline, the mean age of the 13, 523 participants was 72 years, 97% were men, 15% were Black, and 44% had comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus. SubscribeFrom $165

### Clinical significance of incident hypokalemia and hyperkalemia in treated hypertensive patients in the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial [^114DNkci]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Concerns exist that diuretic-induced changes in serum potassium may have adverse effects in hypertensive patients. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, a large practice-based clinical trial, made it possible to examine consequences of observed changes in potassium during care in conventional practice settings. Normokalemic participants randomized to chlorthalidone (C) versus amlodipine or lisinopril as a first-step drug were stratified by year-1 potassium. Postyear-1 outcomes among hypokalemics (potassium, < 3.5 mmol/L) and hyperkalemics (potassium, > 5.4 mmol/L) were compared with normokalemics (potassium, 3.5–5.4 mmol/L). Year-1 hypokalemia incidence was 6.8%; incidence in C (12.9%) differed from amlodipine (2.1%; P < 0.001) and lisinopril (1.0%; P < 0.01). Hyperkalemia incidence (2.0%) was greater in lisinopril (3.6%) than in C (1.2%; P < 0.01) or amlodipine (1.9%; P < 0.01). Coronary heart disease occurred in 8.1% with hypokalemia, 8.0% with normokalemia, and 11.1% with hyperkalemia. Overall, mortality was higher in hypokalemics than in normokalemics (Cox hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.02–1.44]) with statistically significant (interaction, P < 0.01) disparity in hazard ratios for the 3 treatment arms (hazard ratios, C = 1.21, amlodipine = 1.60, lisinopril = 3.82). Hyperkalemia was associated with increased risk of combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.15–2.18]) without significant treatment interactions. In conventional practice settings, the uncommon appearance of hyperkalemia was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Hypokalemia was associated with increased mortality; however, the statistically significant heterogeneity in hazard ratios across treatment groups strongly suggests that the observed increase in mortality is unrelated to the specific effects of C. Thus, for most patients, concerns about potassium levels should not influence the clinician's decision about initiating hypertension treatment with low-moderate doses of thiazide diuretics (12.5–25.0 mg of C).

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^116nbza3]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hyperkalemia

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should not be used in the presence of elevated serum potassium levels (greater than 5.5 mEq per liter).

Antikaliuretic Therapy or Potassium Supplementation

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should not be given to patients receiving other potassium-conserving agents, such as spironolactone or triamterene. Potassium supplementation in the form of medication, potassium-containing salt substitutes or a potassium-rich diet should not be used with this product except in severe and/or refractory cases of hypokalemia. Such concomitant therapy can be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels. If potassium supplementation is used, careful monitoring of the serum potassium level is necessary.

Impaired Renal Function

Anuria, acute or chronic renal insufficiency, and evidence of diabetic nephropathy are contraindications to the use of amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Patients with evidence of renal function impairment (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] levels over 30 mg per 100 mL or serum creatinine levels over 1.5 mg per 100 mL) or diabetes mellitus should not receive the drug without careful, frequent and continuing monitoring of serum electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN levels. Potassium retention associated with the use of an antikaliuretic agent is accentuated in the presence of renal impairment and may result in the rapid development of hyperkalemia.

Hypersensitivity

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product, or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^1124NtNS]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10–80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5–50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10–80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25–50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.

The side effects (see WARNINGS) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose- independent or dose-dependent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

KDIGO 2021 — Diuretics and antihypertensive adverse effects in CKD — High BP due to fluid overload is common in CKD; therefore, diuretics are, in general, logical agents at appropriate dose to lower high BP, with or without the concomitant use of RASi. While thiazide diuretics decrease efficacy as GFR worsens, several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). When combined with a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The document notes common class adverse effects in CKD, including for both ACEi and ARBs, hyperkalemia as well as AKI, and for diuretics, hypokalemia, and states there are no data on clinical outcomes with loop diuretics in the treatment of high BP with or without CKD.

### Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide [^116AqwVd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide are effective treatments for hypertension. The usual dosage range of enalapril is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single or two divided doses; hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg daily. The side effects (see WARNINGS) of enalapril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects but the addition of enalapril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be given enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide 5/12.5 mg or enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide 10/25 mg. Further increases of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide or both depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. In general, patients do not require doses in excess of 20 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. The daily dosage should not exceed four tablets of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide 5/12.5 mg or two tablets of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide 10/25 mg.

Replacement Therapy

The combination may be substituted for the titrated components.

Use in Renal Impairment

The usual regimens of therapy with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide need not be adjusted as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (serum creatinine approximately less than or equal to 3 mg/dL or 265 μmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure).

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^117D4Ytj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Safety

Figure 3 shows the comparative safety profile for the 2 drugs (eAppendix, eFigure 6, and eTables 9–12 in the Supplement). Chlorthalidone shows a different safety profile compared with hydrochlorothiazide, with the following outcomes different after correction for multiple hypotheses: chlorthalidone was associated with an increased risk for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Chlorthalidone was associated with a decreased risk for diagnosed abnormal weight gain. Hypokalemia had an uncalibrated HR of 2.99 (95% CI, 2.58–3.46) and calibrated HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). The uncalibrated and calibrated HR for hyponatremia was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.20–1.53) and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.16–1.47), respectively; acute renal failure, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.18–1.72) and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.15–1.63), respectively; and abnormal weight gain, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60–0.87) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61–0.86), respectively. The following findings had CIs that excluded 1 but did not surpass the Bonferroni threshold: chlorthalidone was associated with an increased risk of hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, vomiting, syncope, gout, impotence, and anaphylactoid reaction and associated with a decreased risk of anemia, depression, dementia, and anxiety.

Furthermore, the event rates for hypokalemia were substantial. In CCAE, the rates per patient were 6.3% and 1.9% for chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves (eAppendix and eFigure 7 in the Supplement) were consistent with our assumption of proportionality for our use of the Cox proportional hazards model.

### Amiloride hydrochloride [^116F4oYW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amiloride HCl is indicated as adjunctive treatment with thiazide diuretics or other kaliuretic-diuretic agents in congestive heart failure or hypertension to:

a. help restore normal serum potassium levels in patients who develop hypokalemia on the kaliuretic diuretic.

b. prevent development of hypokalemia in patients who would be exposed to particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop, e.g., digitalized patients or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias.

The use of potassium-conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet. Amiloride HCl has little additive diuretic or antihypertensive effect when added to a thiazide diuretic.

Amiloride HCl should rarely be used alone. It has weak (compared with thiazides) diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Used as single agents, potassium sparing diuretics, including amiloride HCl, result in an increased risk of hyperkalemia (approximately 10% with amiloride). Amiloride HCl should be used alone only when persistent hypokalemia has been documented and only with careful titration of the dose and close monitoring of serum electrolytes.

### Transethnic meta-analysis suggests genetic variation in the HEME pathway influences potassium response in patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide [^114rR7kR]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a recognized adverse effect of thiazide diuretic treatment. This phenomenon, which may impair insulin secretion, has been suggested to be a reason for the adverse effects on glucose metabolism associated with thiazide diuretic treatment of hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying thiazide diuretic-induced hypokalemia are not well understood. In an effort to identify genes or genomic regions associated with potassium response to hydrochlorothiazide, without a priori knowledge of biologic effects, we performed a genome-wide association study and a multiethnic meta-analysis in 718 European- and African-American hypertensive participants from two different pharmacogenetic studies. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs10845697 (Bayes factor = 5.560) on chromosome 12, near to the HEME binding protein 1 gene, and rs11135740 (Bayes factor = 5.258) on chromosome 8, near to the Mitoferrin-1 gene, reached genome-wide association study significance (Bayes factor > 5). These results, if replicated, suggest a novel mechanism involving effects of genes in the HEME pathway influencing hydrochlorothiazide-induced renal potassium loss.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) [^111ULmWA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.

The side effects (see WARNINGS) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics.

To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/12.5 mg or lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20 mg/12.5 mg. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2–3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/12.5 mg. Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116dCWrQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

In our study we compared a potassium-sparing diuretic, a potassium-losing diuretic, and a combination of the two during 24 weeks in 441 patients who were either previously untreated or taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, or calcium-channel blockers. Our results supported our hypothesis that thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, as shown by 2 h glucose concentrations in oral glucose tolerance tests, would not occur in the absence of potassium depletion. Our results do not completely prove that potassium depletion causes the effect of thiazide on glucose tolerance, but show that it is possible to potentiate the benefit of two classes of diuretic on blood pressure while cancelling out undesired effects of thiazides on glucose and potassium concentrations.

Implications of all the available evidence

At an adequate dose (10–20 mg), amiloride is as efficacious as 25–50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and is not associated with undesirable metabolic consequences. The combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was already known, from the Medical Research Council's Elderly trial and INSIGHT, to be more efficacious than comparator drugs at preventing some complications of hypertension; however, the 2.5–5 mg dose of amiloride given in these studies was inadequate to prevent hydrochlorothiazide-associated hypokalaemia or diabetes. We propose that the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination tested in this study should be considered in patients taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, or a calcium-channel blocker as a first-line treatment for hypertension.

### Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide (Atacand HCT) [^111LR1v4]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Co-administration of ATACAND HCT with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with ATACAND HCT in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with ATACAND HCT in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide

Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics − Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) − Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.

Diazoxide − the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides.

Ion Exchange resins − Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4–6 hours after the administration of resins.

Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) − Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives.

Digitalis − Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity.

Noradrenaline – Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.

Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone – Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

Cytotoxic products – Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.

Cyclosporine − Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^114F71BM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril /HCTZ 10 /12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20 /12.5, depending on current monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured at the interdosing interval to ensure that there is an adequate antihypertensive effect at that time. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. After addition of the diuretic it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen may achieve similar or greater blood-pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to Lisinopril/HCTZ 10 /12.5.

In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally may occur following the initial dose of lisinopril. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (See WARNINGS). If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed.

If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg of lisinopril should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (See PRECAUTIONS).

Replacement Therapy

The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.

Use in Renal Impairment

Regimens of therapy with lisinopril/HCTZ need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min/1.7 m²(serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so lisinopril/HCTZ is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure).

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^115o6Vka]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

(ii) There was a trend for lower urine citrate among patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to patients receiving placebo during follow-up. Reduction of urine citrate is a well known adverse effect of thiazides. The mechanism is thought to be thiazide-induced hypokalemia resulting in intracellular acidosis, stimulating avid citrate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Indeed, patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide displayed a dose-dependent decrease in plasma potassium.

Nonadherence in NOSTONE was defined as missing > 20% of the daily doses of hydrochlorothiazide or placebo on the basis of patient report, and further separated into medical reasons (e.g. adverse effects necessitating a treatment discontinuation) and nonmedical reasons. Nonadherence was not different in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to patients receiving placebo. However, significant nonadherence was observed, ranging from 15% in the 12.5-mg hydrochlorothiazide group, to 24% in the 25-mg hydrochlorothiazide group, and to 26% in the 50-mg hydrochlorothiazide and placebo groups, respectively. To assess if nonadherence could explain the lack of a treatment benefit with hydrochlorothiazide, a per-protocol analysis was conducted. This analysis yielded very similar results as the intention-to-treat analysis, indicating that poor adherence cannot explain the trial results. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the high incidence of nonadherence may have biased the treatment effects in favor of the null hypothesis.

No significant variation was observed among the groups in terms of serious adverse events. But patients assigned to hydrochlorothiazide had a higher incidence of adverse events of particular concern, including newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia, gout, and deteriorated kidney function, than those assigned to the placebo. Clearly, these adverse events observed in a trial with a median duration of 3 years need to be reconciled with the fact that thiazides are typically prescribed on a long-term basis, and in the case of kidney stone prevention, treatment is frequently initiated in young adults.

### Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Diovan HCT) [^11395jrp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.6 Lithium Interaction

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of valsartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Diovan HCT and lithium [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.7 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trials of various doses of Diovan HCT, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 3.0%; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4%.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Diovan HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium with Diovan therapy. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or Diovan may be required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

### Use trends of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide among United States adults with hypertension: national health and nutrition examination survey 2009–2018 [^113AJ97p]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the national prevalence of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide use among adults diagnosed with hypertension by sociodemographic subgroup, healthcare access status, and clinical factors.

Methods

Data was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2009–2010 through 2017–2018 survey waves. Patients at least 20years old, diagnosed with hypertension, and on hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone were included. Uni-variable logistic regression models estimated the odds of being on chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide use by sociodemographic and clinical factors. Analyses were adjusted for multi-stage complex survey design and are nationally representative.

Results

Two thousand five hundred and eighty-five participants were included with 95.2% participants using hydrochlorothiazide and 4.8% using chlorthalidone. Participants over 65years were more likely to be on chlorthalidone compared with younger counterparts [odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–2.88]. Participants with hypokalemia (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.56–4.42) or hyponatremia [OR 2.298; 95% CI 1.23–4.30) were more likely to be using chlorthalidone compared with patients with normal levels.

Conclusion

Chlorthalidone, a potent and effective first-line antihypertensive agent and thoroughly studied thiazide diuretic with substantial cardiovascular benefits, continues to be underutilized in patients with hypertension. Findings demonstrated that individuals receiving chlorthalidone were more likely to be 65years or older and to experience hyponatremia or hypokalemia. Sociodemographic factors, healthcare access and use, clinical factors, and medical conditions did not appear to sway the choice in thiazide diuretic use.

### Aliskiren-based therapy lowers blood pressure more effectively than hydrochlorothiazide-based therapy in obese patients with hypertension: sub-analysis of a 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial [^112YG2gz]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren against the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in obese patients with hypertension.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of 396 obese patients (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) in a 52-week study in 1124 patients with hypertension was performed. Patients were randomized to receive aliskiren 150 mg or HCTZ 12.5 mg for 3 weeks, or placebo for 6 weeks. At week 3, active treatment doses were doubled. Patients receiving placebo were randomized to aliskiren 300 mg or HCTZ 25 mg at week 6. Add-on amlodipine 5–10 mg was permitted from week 12 to achieve blood pressure (BP) control (< 140/90 mmHg).

Results

In the subgroup of obese patients, aliskiren monotherapy provided significantly greater BP reductions than HCTZ at week 12 endpoint (-16.7/-12.3 vs. -12.2/-9.1 mmHg, P ≤ 0.001). Reductions were also greater with aliskiren-based therapy than HCTZ-based therapy at week 52 endpoint (-19.9/-15.5 vs. -17.5/-13.3 mmHg; P = 0.138 for systolic BP and P = 0.007 for diastolic BP). Mean BP reductions from baseline with aliskiren-based therapy were similar in obese and nonobese patients. By contrast, HCTZ-based therapy provided significantly smaller mean reductions in BP from baseline in obese patients vs. nonobese patients (P < 0.05). Aliskiren-based therapy was generally well tolerated in obese patients, and was associated with a significantly lower incidence of hypokalemia (1.0 vs. 14.0%, P < 0.0001) than HCTZ-based therapy.

Conclusion

Aliskiren-based therapy provided superior BP reductions to HCTZ-based therapy with good tolerability in obese patients with hypertension.

### Thiazides and the risk of hypokalemia in the general population [^114bijVa]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypokalemia is a frequent adverse reaction to thiazide diuretics, but is often asymptomatic. However, even asymptomatic hypokalemia may contribute to chronic disabilities and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of thiazide-induced hypokalemia in men and women in the general population.

Methods

Within the Rotterdam study, which is a population-based cohort study, the association between thiazide exposure and hypokalemia (serum potassium level < 3.5mmol/l; moderate to severe ≤ 3.0mmol/l) was studied using Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis over a 10-year period, with thiazide use as a time-varying exposure.

Results

During follow-up, 507 cases of hypokalemia occurred in 13,328 patients. Thiazide use was associated with an 11 times higher risk of hypokalemia than no use [relative risk (RR) 11.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.95, 13.96] after adjustment for sex, age, and use of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor or separate potassium-sparing diuretic. In users of a thiazide in combination with triamterene, the risk was still six times higher (RR 5.93, 95% CI 4.65, 7.55) than in nonusers. The risk of thiazide-induced hypokalemia was significantly higher in men than in women and changed significantly with age and dosage. The risk of moderate to severe hypokalemia was almost five times higher in thiazide users (RR 4.80, 95% CI 2.61, 8.84) than in nonusers.

Conclusion

The risk of thiazide-induced hypokalemia is high, and more than twice as high in men as in women. Hypokalemia risk is influenced by age and dosage, and is still increased if used in combination with triamterene.

### A thiazide test for the diagnosis of renal tubular hypokalemic disorders [^112ayWDV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome (GS) and Bartter syndrome (BS) is now feasible by genetic analysis, implementation of genetic testing for these disorders is still hampered by several difficulties, including large gene dimensions, lack of hot-spot mutations, heavy workup time, and costs. This study evaluated in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS or BS diagnostic sensibility and specificity of a diuretic test with oral hydrochlorothiazide (HCT test). Forty-one patients with GS (22 adults, aged 25 to 57; 19 children-adolescents, aged 7 to 17) and seven patients with BS (five type I, two type III) were studied; three patients with "pseudo-BS" from surreptitious diuretic intake (two patients) or vomiting (one patient) were also included. HCT test consisted of the administration of 50 mg of HCT orally (1 mg/kg in children-adolescents) and measurement of the maximal diuretic-induced increase over basal in the subsequent 3 h of chloride fractional clearance. All but three patients with GS but no patients with BS and pseudo-BS showed blunted (< 2.3%) response to HCT; patients with BS and the two patients with pseudo-BS from diuretic intake had increased response to HCT. No overlap existed between patients with GS and both patients with BS and pseudo-BS. The response to HCT test is blunted in patients with GS but not in patients with BS or nongenetic hypokalemia. In patients with the highly selected phenotype of normotensive hypokalemic alkalosis, abnormal HCT test allows prediction with a very high sensitivity and specificity of the Gitelman genotype and may avoid genotyping.

### Hydrochlorothiazide and prevention of kidney-stone recurrence [^117K4GFT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common conditions affecting the kidney and is characterized by a high risk of recurrence. Thiazide diuretic agents are widely used for prevention of the recurrence of kidney stones, but data regarding the efficacy of such agents as compared with placebo are limited. Furthermore, dose-response data are also limited.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones to receive hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg once daily or placebo once daily. The main objective was to investigate the dose-response effect for the primary end point, a composite of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence of kidney stones. Radiologic recurrence was defined as the appearance of new stones on imaging or the enlargement of preexisting stones that had been observed on the baseline image. Safety was also assessed.

Results

In all, 416 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a median of 2.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 60 of 102 patients (59%) in the placebo group, in 62 of 105 patients (59%) in the 12.5-mg hydrochlorothiazide group (rate ratio vs. placebo, 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.93), in 61 of 108 patients (56%) in the 25-mg group (rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.79), and in 49 of 101 patients (49%) in the 50-mg group (rate ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.36). There was no relation between the hydrochlorothiazide dose and the occurrence of a primary end-point event (P = 0.66). Hypokalemia, gout, new-onset diabetes mellitus, skin allergy, and a plasma creatinine level exceeding 150% of the baseline level were more common among patients who received hydrochlorothiazide than among those who received placebo.

Conclusions

Among patients with recurrent kidney stones, the incidence of recurrence did not appear to differ substantially among patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide once daily at a dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg or placebo once daily.

### Initial combination therapy for hypertension in patients of African ancestry: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JpQsF]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that consider the effect of initial dual antihypertensive combination treatment on blood pressure (BP), morbidity, or mortality in hypertensive African ancestry adults, using the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. Main outcomes were difference in means (continuous data) and risk ratio (dichotomous data). We retrieved 1728 reports yielding 13 RCTs of 4weeks to 3years duration (median 8weeks) in 3843 patients. Systolic BP was significantly higher on β-adrenergic blocker vs. other combinations, 3.80 [0.82;6.78] mmHg, but comparable for other combinations. Hypokalemia and hyperglycemia occurred with calcium channel blocker (CCB)+diuretics > diuretics+angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-II-type-1-receptor antagonist (ARB) > CCB+ACEI/ARB. An RCT including high-risk patients reported combined morbidity/mortality for hydrochlorothiazide (mg) 25+benazepril 40 vs. amlodipine 10+benazepril 40 of respectively 8.9% vs. 6.6% (n = 1414, risk ratio 1.35 [0.94;1.94]; all patients, N = 11 506, 1.23 [1.11;1.37]). We conclude that limited evidence supports CCB+ACEI rather than HCT+ACEI as first-line initial combination therapy in African ancestry patients with hypertension.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^115wdkuP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age, and most hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality occur in older individuals. The health burden related to uncontrolled hypertension has diminished over time, owing to effective pharmacotherapy. As a class, thiazide diuretics effectively lower blood pressure (BP), reduce cardiovascular events, and are recommended as first-line antihypertensive agents. However, whether a specific thiazide is preferable in terms of safety and clinical outcomes remains unclear.

Hydrochlorothiazide is the most prescribed thiazide diuretic in North America, despite being shorter-actingand less potent (per milligram), than chlorthalidone. Limited head-to-head observational studies comparing these drugs have yielded mixed results. While older studies suggested that chlorthalidone was superior in controlling BP and reducing cardiovascular events, recent studies have demonstrated equivalency in cardiovascular risk reduction but a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes and hypokalemia with chlorthalidone.

Hypertension is nearly ubiquitous in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a prevalence of more than 80%, including more than 50% requiring 3 or more antihypertensive medications. Despite early studies suggesting that thiazides have less diuretic and antihypertensive effects in CKD, recent studies have suggested that they remain effective in this population. Thiazides are now commonly prescribed to individuals with CKD. However, little is known about how chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide compare among individuals with CKD. Herein, we conducted a large population-based retrospective cohort study of older adults to compare safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use across varying levels of kidney function.

Dual nephron blockade and adjunct diuretic strategies — when high furosemide doses are not effective, dual nephron blockade with the addition of either a thiazide-like diuretic or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) can be considered. In the CLOROTIC trial of patients with acute HF, adding hydrochlorothiazide to an IV loop diuretic resulted in an increased diuretic response and more weight loss without a change in patient-reported dyspnea, although those receiving hydrochlorothiazide exhibited increases in serum creatinine, hypokalemia, and impaired kidney function compared with placebo, and the study was stopped prematurely due to slow enrollment, making clinical safety conclusions difficult to assess. Chlorothiazide has a short elimination half-life but is substantially more expensive, and observational data suggest that it does not increase net 24-hour urine output when compared with oral metolazone. Metolazone can be added to the IV loop diuretic at 2.5- to 5-mg doses once or twice daily. In the ADVOR trial, acetazolamide added to a loop diuretic for 3 days exhibited a greater rate of successful decongestion (42.2% vs 30.5%; P < 0.001) and a shorter duration of hospital stay compared with placebo, with no statistically significant differences in renal safety, hypokalemia, or hypotension between groups. The randomized PUSH-AHF trial showed greater natriuresis when diuretic agents were guided by spot urine sodium concentrations, without a difference in mortality or HF rehospitalization.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^1121x4me]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of mild hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population were slightly more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. As expected, these episodes were more common in patients receiving loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics both in patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, with no relevant difference between the groups. Few AEs of hypokalemia were reported in either group (0.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 0.2% with placebo), and did not lead to discontinuation. There were no reports of severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population.

A trend towards increased hypokalemia risk could be consistent with dapagliflozin's mild diuretic effect; however, a lack of any difference between the groups when used with typical diuretics is both reassuring and somewhat unexpected. Renal potassium excretion is a complex process that is primarily determined by the serum aldosterone concentration and driven by the sodium concentration in the distal nephron. Due to the co-transportation of sodium and glucose, transient increases in urinary sodium excretion are seen for a few days upon initiation of dapagliflozin, after which levels tend to normalize. Thus, unlike typical diuretics, long-term treatment with dapagliflozin should not affect sodium delivery to the distal nephron. However, it should be acknowledged that in a previous small exploratory study, dapagliflozin treatment increased median plasma renin activity relative to placebo, to approximately a quarter of the hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg effect, and increased median serum aldosterone activity to a similar extent as hydrochlorothiazide. A potential trend for hypokalemia does not seem to be explained by dapagliflozin's mechanism of action, which is not reported to promote kaliuresis, neither is it consistent across the SGLT2 inhibitor class, as the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia risk with canagliflozin was greater in patients with moderate renal impairment or receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics, and was more pronounced with the canagliflozin 300 mg dose than the 100 mg dose.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide) [^111frYoM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Hypertension

The usual starting dose of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is 50/12.5 (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100/25 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/12.5 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. Evaluate the clinical response to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 and, if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 once daily.

2.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on 50 mg losartan potassium, initiate treatment with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5. If additional blood pressure reduction is needed, increase the dose to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/12.5, followed by losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25. For further blood pressure reduction add other antihypertensives [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^114qfbCA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Thiazide diuretics are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, a disease highly prevalent among older individuals and in those with chronic kidney disease. How specific thiazide diuretics compare in regard to safety and clinical outcomes in these populations remains unknown.

Objective

To compare safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide use among older adults with varying levels of kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2015. Participants included adults aged 66 years or older who initiated chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide during this period. Data were analyzed from December 2019 through September 2020.

Exposures

New chlorthalidone users were matched 1:4 with new hydrochlorothiazide users by a high-dimensional propensity score. Time-to-event models accounting for competing risks examined the associations between chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use and the outcomes of interest overall and within estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories (≥ 60, 45–59, and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were adverse kidney events (ie, eGFR decline ≥ 30%, dialysis, or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation), all-cause mortality, and electrolyte anomalies (ie, sodium or potassium levels outside reference ranges).

Results

After propensity score matching, the study cohort included 12 722 adults (mean [SD] age, 74 [7] years; 7063 [56%] women; 5659 [44%] men; mean [SD] eGFR, 69 [19] mL/min/1.73 m²), including 2936 who received chlorthalidone and 9786 who received hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline of 30% or greater (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13–1.36]) and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04–1.22]) across all eGFR categories compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. Chlorthalidone use was also associated with a higher risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use, which was more pronounced among those with higher eGFR (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.67–2.08]; eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25–1.96]; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.84–1.45]; P for interaction = .001). No significant differences were observed between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide for dialysis or kidney transplantation (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 0.88–2.36]), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.93–1.29]), hyperkalemia (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.79–1.39]), or hyponatremia (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, CI 0.98–1.32]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that among older adults, chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The excess risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function. Placed in context with prior observational studies comparing the safety and clinical outcomes associated with thiazide diuretics, these results suggest that there is no evidence to prefer chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m²; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Lopressor HCT) [^111VgPtJ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.5 Major Surgery

Avoid initiation of high-dose regimen of LOPRESSOR HCT in patients with cardiovascular risk factors undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since use in such patients has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.

Chronically administered beta-adrenergic blockers should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.000000000000000e+00 6 Masked Symptoms of Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

5.7 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects

LOPRESSOR HCT contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide reduces clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.

5.000000000000000e+00 8 Renal Impairment

Patients with chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion may be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure on drugs containing hydrochlorothiazide, including LOPRESSOR HCT.

5.000000000000000e+00 9 Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease.

5.000000000000000e+00 10 Pheochromocytoma

If LOPRESSOR HCT is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115qcw8c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

There are also several weaknesses to this analysis. The trial only included individuals previously taking hydrochlorothiazide and likely limited adverse effects associated with thiazide diuretics (ie, hyponatremia). Similarly, individuals switched to chlorthalidone experienced a greater incidence of self-reported adverse events and switches back to hydrochlorothiazide. This was likely related to trial design, as those randomized to chlorthalidone started taking a new medication, whereas those randomized to hydrochlorothiazide continued taking a medication that they previously tolerated. The trial randomized patients to chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, and after randomization all follow-up was left to the primary care physician. There were no protocoled laboratory evaluations, including for kidney function or potassium levels. Results presented are from clinically evaluated laboratory values, resulting in varying numbers of laboratory values for each participant. This may have led to differential outcome ascertainment by group; however, it is likely that randomization removed both measured and unmeasured confounding for follow-up care. Dialysis initiation was ascertained using claims data, which have high specificity but lack sensitivity. Although some events may have been missed, it is likely that these missed events were balanced between groups given the randomized study design. Another limitation is that 95% of participants were initially taking the lower doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (12.5 mg/d), so any potential harmful or beneficial kidney effects of the 50- or 25-mg doses, respectively, may have been missed.

### Antihypertensive efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination therapy with losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide in Japanese patients with essential hypertension [^116wf5R8]. Hypertension Research (2007). Low credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of 8-week treatment with one of three fixed-dose combinations-losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, or losartan 25 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg-in comparison with those of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg alone, losartan 50 mg alone, or placebo in Japanese patients with essential hypertension. Significant reductions in sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were seen in all three combination groups compared with the placebo group (each p < 0.001). The greatest reductions in DBP and SBP were observed in the losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg group (12.7 and 18.0 mmHg, respectively). The reductions in the losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg group were significantly greater (each p < 0.001) than those in the placebo group and each of the monotherapy groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of clinical and laboratory drug-related adverse events between any of the combination groups and the placebo group. All combination groups showed improved hypokalemia and hyperuricemia compared to the hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg group. These results demonstrated that once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy with losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg is well tolerated and more efficacious in lowering DBP and SBP than monotherapy in Japanese hypertensive patients.

### Quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^115ZUcUq]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances:

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide.

Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^113v7Wm9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Hypertension

The usual starting dose of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is 50/12.5 (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100/25 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)].

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5 once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 100/25 once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 100/12.5 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 100/25 once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5 once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. Evaluate the clinical response to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5 and, if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 100/25 once daily.

2.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on 50 mg losartan potassium, initiate treatment with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 50/12.5. If additional blood pressure reduction is needed, increase the dose to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 100/12.5, followed by losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 100/25. For further blood pressure reduction add other antihypertensives [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with cancer (management), ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics only if needed for BP control and in patients with fluid retention because of their potential to cause unwanted effects in patients with cancer, including increases in serum calcium concentration in patients with bone metastasis, increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonging QT interval (by inducing hypokalemia), increased risk of hyponatremia, and potential worsening of hypovolemic states or dehydration.

### Same benefit with equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and HCTZ… [^116jPJqg]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is chlorthalidone safer or more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with hypertension. Bottom Line In this retrospective analysis, chlorthalidone and HCTZ produced the same clinical outcomes in older adults. In general, chlorthalidone was more likely to be associated with hospitalization for hypokalemia and hyponatremia. When comparing equivalent doses, though, the rates of these adverse effects were the same. If prescribing chlorthalidone, remember that it is 1. 5 to 2 times as potent as HCTZ, with a longer duration of action. Use 12. 5 mg as a starting dose. They included a total of 29, 873 patients who were followed for up to five years. The rates of the composite outcome of death or hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction were low and similar in both groups:

3. 2 to
3. 4 events per 100 persons per year of follow-up.

However, patients treated with chlorthalidone were more likely to be hospitalized for hypokalemia or hyponatremia. Neither hypokalemia nor hyponatremia was more common when comparing pharmacokinetically equivalent low doses, though the difference was present when the same doses were compared. The results are a little muddied because of the nature of this type of study; despite careful matching, there were differences between the two cohorts in terms of other treatments received for hypertension, which is much less likely to occur in large randomized studies.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Adding thiazide to a renin-angiotensin blocker improves left ventricular relaxation and improves heart failure in patients with hypertension [^1113AZQy]. Hypertension Research (2012). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested that BNP, the left atrial volume index, the LV mass indexand hsCRP are useful for risk stratification in patients with HF. A lower BNP, left atrial volume index or LV mass index is associated with better clinical outcomes, and lower rates of morbidity and mortality. These parameters are now regarded as excellent surrogate end points for assessing the utility of therapeutic interventions. Our results showed that BNP, the left atrial volume index and the LV mass index significantly decreased with changes from ACEi or ARB to losartan/HCTZ. Therefore, the combination of an ARB and a small dose of thiazide might be a good therapeutic choice for reducing hospitalization due to HF, and mortality in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction.

Much of the criticism against thiazides has been directed toward their adverse-effect profile. Thiazides can reduce the excretion of uric acid and thereby increase its plasma level. Our results, however, showed that there was no change in uric acid levels with changes from ACEi or ARB to losartan/HCTZ. This finding was because of the potential of losartan to augment the excretion of uric acid. Some patients with diastolic dysfunction are sensitive to preload reduction and may develop severe pre-renal azotemia. In this study, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels showed only slight increases with changes to losartan/HCTZ. New-onset diabetes has been reported in patients receiving thiazides. Maintaining potassium homeostasis is essential because epidemiologic evidence implicates hypokalemia in the pathogenesis of thiazide-induced dysglycemia. In this study, there were no changes in potassium levels or levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, serum insulin and HOMA-R after changing to losartan/HCTZ.

### Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^112TskDH]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis: Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g. AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure).

Hydrochlorothiazide: Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, namely: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance may include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, or when severe cirrhosis is present. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because captopril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with captopril reduces the diuretic-induced hypokalemia. Fewer patients may require potassium supplements and/or foods with a high potassium content (see Drug Interactions: Captopril: Agents Increasing Serum Potassium).

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^116FAYZD]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha blockers and nitric oxcide donors might be also considered as additional therapies in those uncontrolled with conventional therapies. Beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics should be used with caution; both may have unfavorable effects on glucose metabolism, and thiazide may worsen pre-existing hypokalemia. However, in selected cases, such as those patients with previous myocardial infarction, vasodilating beta-blockers (including carvedilol, labetalol, and nebivolol) may be considered, as benefits to improve cardiovascular risk related to myocardial infarction might outweigh other risks. A similar risk-benefit analysis can be applied to hydrochlorothiazide, which may be considered in those patients with kidney stones due to its effect in preventing cortisol-induced hypercalciuria.

Osteoporosis

Although recent guidelines differ in the precise indications for pharmacological intervention, in general, patients planning to start GC treatment for more than 3 months at any dose and who have experienced a prior fragility fracture should start bone protective therapy, regardless of age or GC dose. It is recommended that this should be initiated at the same time as GC treatment. Due to the reversibility of the effects of GC on bone, all current treatment guidelines suggest that bone protective therapy can be stopped after GC therapy is discontinued unless there is an additional prior indication. However, epidemiologic studies published after the guidelines were released suggest that there may be an increase in fracture risk that persists for up to 15 months after GC treatment has been stopped. Clinicians may therefore choose to continue therapy for another 3 to 6 months for lower cumulative exposures (less than 1 g. of prednisone equivalent cumulative dose) or longer periods (6–18 months after GC discontinuation) for higher cumulative exposures.
