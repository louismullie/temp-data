## Question

What's the best time to vaccinate against the flu influenza in northern hemisphere?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best time to get vaccinated against influenza in the Northern Hemisphere. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and seasonality to anchor timing. Then, I should verify the core principle of pre-season vaccination and the role of waning immunity. Next, I will review ACIP/CDC recommendations and reconcile them with recent high-quality evidence on September–October timing. After that, I need to check special populations: children requiring two doses, older adults, pregnant persons, and travelers. Finally, I will consider late-season vaccination, vaccine effectiveness considerations, and practical implementation, and I will close with a concise recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic foundation. Influenza in the Northern Hemisphere circulates seasonally, typically beginning in the fall and peaking between December and February, though activity can extend into May and the exact timing varies by year and location, which is why timing guidance must balance early protection with waning risk [^112oaFzj] [^116EZgWL] [^1156yvGp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the core principle. The overarching goal is to vaccinate before community transmission begins so that individuals are protected when risk rises, while avoiding vaccination so early that immunity wanes before the peak of activity, especially in older adults and young children [^116EZgWL] [^1156yvGp].

> Next, I should review the official recommendations. ACIP advises that most people who need only one dose should be vaccinated in September or October, with efforts to complete vaccination by the end of October; vaccination should continue thereafter as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available, and early-season vaccination in July–August is generally discouraged for most adults due to potential waning [^116H7g24] [^116EZgWL] [^111PVuj8].

> Wait, let me verify the waning data that underpin this timing. Multiple analyses show intraseason decline in vaccine effectiveness with increasing time since vaccination, with estimates around 7% per month overall and faster waning against H3N2, and some studies showing effectiveness approaching zero by roughly 3–6 months in certain contexts; this supports avoiding very early vaccination unless logistical constraints dictate otherwise [^115DGi58] [^1112XnNA] [^113kotuv].

> I will now examine the high-quality evidence refining the optimal window. A 2024 BMJ population-based cohort in young children suggests that October vaccination is associated with the lowest likelihood of influenza diagnosis, supporting the notion that October may be the sweet spot for many, while acknowledging that this quasi-experimental signal comes from a pediatric population and needs cautious extrapolation to adults [^111s5AER] [^116cNjJ5].

> But wait, what if someone proposes August or November as equally good? I should double-check the trade-offs. Modeling and observational data indicate that delaying into November risks exposure before immunity and may be associated with worse outcomes in some high-risk cohorts, whereas moving mass vaccination into August increases the risk of waning by the time of peak activity; thus, the balance still favors September–October for most adults, with programmatic flexibility to avoid missed opportunities [^113kotuv] [^116xt7BM] [^116EZgWL].

> Let me consider children who need two doses. For children aged 6 months through 8 years who have never received at least two total doses of influenza vaccine, two doses given at least 4 weeks apart are required; the first dose should be given as soon as vaccine is available so that the second dose can be completed ideally by the end of October, which may justify starting in July–August for this subgroup to ensure series completion before circulation rises [^116EZgWL] [^111PVuj8].

> I need to ensure older adults are addressed carefully. Adults aged 65 years and older are particularly vulnerable to waning and to severe outcomes; therefore, they should generally avoid July–August vaccination unless there is a credible risk of missing vaccination later, and they should preferentially receive higher-dose or adjuvanted formulations when available to optimize protection through the season [^111PVuj8].

> Next, I should review pregnancy timing. For pregnant persons, vaccination at any time during pregnancy is safe and recommended, but if the third trimester coincides with July–August, early vaccination can be considered to provide infant protection via transplacental antibodies; for those in the first or second trimester during summer, waiting until September–October is preferred if feasible to mitigate waning before the season peak [^111PVuj8] [^113KjAD8].

> Hold on, I should verify travel-related nuances. Persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during its influenza season or to the tropics where influenza circulates year-round should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before departure if not already vaccinated; if they receive a prior-season or Southern Hemisphere formulation for travel, they should still receive the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine in the subsequent fall to ensure up-to-date protection [^112oaFzj] [^116dJcuZ].

> I will now examine late-season scenarios. If someone is unvaccinated and influenza is circulating, vaccination can still reduce morbidity and mortality and should be offered; effectiveness may be lower late in the season due to waning in those vaccinated earlier, but for the unvaccinated, benefits persist, and vaccination can protect against other circulating strains that may appear later [^116EZgWL] [^1156yvGp].

> Let me reconsider vaccine effectiveness and match, because timing interacts with antigenic drift. Even in partially mismatched seasons, vaccination reduces severe outcomes, and Southern Hemisphere interim effectiveness estimates often provide an early signal for Northern Hemisphere expectations; however, early-season low estimates, as in 2014–15, underscore the importance of both timely vaccination and ongoing prevention and treatment strategies [^111pDYAv] [^116s3ySt] [^115HPRXU].

> Next, I should review practical implementation. Clinicians should use routine visits, hospitalizations, and organized campaigns to vaccinate as many eligible persons as possible by the end of October, while maintaining capacity to vaccinate through the season; missed opportunities are common, and proactive outreach improves coverage and timeliness [^116EZgWL] [^111PVuj8].

> Final synthesis: For most adolescents and adults aged 9 years and older who need only one dose, the optimal window is September–October, with a target of completing vaccination by the end of October; avoid July–August unless logistical barriers threaten access, and continue vaccinating as long as influenza viruses are circulating. For children requiring two doses, start as soon as vaccine is available to complete the series by the end of October. Older adults should avoid early-season vaccination when possible and use enhanced formulations. Pregnant persons can vaccinate at any time, but those in the first or second trimester in summer should prefer September–October if feasible. Travelers to Southern Hemisphere or tropical destinations should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before departure and update to the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine in the fall if they used a prior-season or Southern Hemisphere product [^116H7g24] [^116EZgWL] [^111PVuj8] [^112oaFzj].

The best time to get the flu shot in the Northern Hemisphere is **September–October** [^116H7g24] to ensure peak protection through the typical flu season (December–February) [^111vf34q] and avoid early-season waning [^115DGi58]. If you miss this window, **get vaccinated as soon as possible** [^114QpckQ] because flu activity can persist into May [^112oaFzj] and vaccination remains beneficial. Early vaccination in July–August is only for those who will miss later opportunities or who need two doses (e.g. children 6 months–8 years) [^111PVuj8] [^115EYtd8]. For travelers to the Southern Hemisphere or tropics, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before departure [^112oaFzj] [^116dJcuZ].

---

## Rationale for September–October vaccination

- **Peak season alignment**: Flu activity in the Northern Hemisphere typically peaks between December and February [^111vf34q]; vaccinating in September–October ensures peak antibody levels during this period [^1156yvGp].

- **Waning immunity**: Immunity from the flu vaccine wanes over time [^115DGi58]; early vaccination (July–August) may result in reduced effectiveness by the time flu activity peaks [^113kotuv].

- **CDC recommendations**: The CDC and ACIP recommend vaccination by the end of October for most individuals aged ≥ 6 months [^116H7g24] [^116EZgWL].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

### Early vaccination (July–August)

Early vaccination is appropriate for **children requiring two doses** [^111PVuj8] — those aged 6 months–8 years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or have not previously received ≥ 2 doses — to ensure completion of the two-dose series by the end of October [^115EYtd8]. It is also reasonable for individuals with **limited access** who may miss later vaccination opportunities [^115EYtd8].

---

### Late vaccination (November–March)

Late vaccination is appropriate because **ongoing benefit** persists as long as influenza viruses circulate, which can extend into May [^114QpckQ] [^112oaFzj].

---

## Impact of timing on vaccine effectiveness

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) is influenced by timing: **early vaccination** (July–August) may lead to waning immunity and reduced effectiveness later in the season [^115DGi58], whereas **timely vaccination** (September–October) balances early protection with sustained immunity through the peak season [^113kotuv].

---

## Regional and population-specific considerations

- **Geographic variation**: Influenza activity varies by region; vaccination campaigns should align with local circulation patterns [^114wkWKV] [^113wbTLX].

- **High-risk populations**: Older adults, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic conditions benefit significantly from timely vaccination [^116ymBxj] [^113KjAD8].

- **Travel considerations**: Individuals traveling to the Southern Hemisphere or tropics should vaccinate at least 2 weeks before departure [^112oaFzj] [^112tgGjN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The optimal time for influenza vaccination in the Northern Hemisphere is **September–October** [^116H7g24], balancing early protection with sustained immunity through the peak season [^111PVuj8]. Early vaccination (July–August) is reserved for specific cases, and vaccination should continue as long as influenza viruses circulate [^114QpckQ].

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^113V8hGa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 booster vaccinations mitigate transmission and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year makes it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance on how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection.

Methods

We leveraged longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. We assessed the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling a personalized assessment of optimal timing that acknowledges and respects diversity of COVID-19 immune status, addressing a substantial barrier to uptake.

Results

Yearly booster vaccination on any date is beneficial to prevention of infection. However, each location exhibits as much as a 3–4-fold range in degree of protection by date of uptake. Optimal COVID-19 booster vaccination dates are location-specific, typically in early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Infection late in the interval between boosts substantially alters the optimal boosting date.

Conclusions

Considerable benefit accrues from aptly timing COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns, which can be tailored to specific locations. Individuals can acquire the greatest benefit from booster vaccination by timing it optimally, including delaying in cases of infection late in the interval between boosts. These results provide location-specific guidance for public health policy, healthcare provider recommendations, and individual decision-making.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^116a8rTi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

For other locations in the Northern Hemisphere, probabilities of infection throughout the year were often similar, reflecting a strong relationship that supports booster vaccine administration on a date that minimizes infection risk by preceding anticipated surges in SARS-CoV-2 incidence (Figure 2). On average across locales, the optimal yearly date of booster vaccine administration preceded the highest anticipated prevalence by 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.9–3.4 months) (Supplementary Figure 1). In areas for which seasonal infection trends were more muted, there was still benefit to optimizing booster vaccination timing, but the benefit was lesser (Supplementary Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Cumulative probabilities of infection (lower to higher: blue/green/yellow/orange/red color gradient) in the year after booster vaccination occurring on the optimal date, in New York (A), South Korea (B), Yamagata (C), and Stockholm (D), when (left panels) booster vaccinated once, forgoing booster vaccination in the subsequent 2 years, and (right panels) booster vaccinated over a period of 3 years. The heights of the bars reflect projections of seasonal population-level incidence patterns under endemic conditions without incorporating a population-wide effect of booster vaccination — that is, assuming that low yearly global uptake remains unchanged.

The optimal timing of booster vaccination can be substantially altered by a breakthrough infection that occurs during the interval between yearly optimal booster vaccination dates (Figure 3; phenomenological equations, Supplementary Table 3). Indeed, in New York, a breakthrough infection occurring on any date between September through most of March has a practical equivalence of benefit to booster vaccination on the optimal yearly date of the 15th of September (Figure 3 A; Supplementary Table 4). Delay of boosting begins to substantially accrue benefits after the middle of May (Figure 3 A; Supplementary Table 4). For an individual infected in August — just before what would typically be the yearly optimal booster vaccination on the 15th of September — the next booster vaccination should be delayed and occur in late February, although similar benefits accrue to boosters obtained at any time between late January and June (Figure 3 A; Supplementary Table 4).

### Use of Northern hemisphere influenza vaccines by travelers to the Southern hemisphere [^116dJcuZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

The influenza season in temperate climates extends from October through March in the northern hemisphere and from April through September in the southern hemisphere. Recent studies indicate that influenza viruses can circulate throughout the year in the tropics and that influenza is the most frequently acquired vaccine-preventable disease among those traveling to tropical and subtropical countries. Influenza outbreaks have been reported among persons who travel from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere and among persons from the northern hemisphere on group tours. To reduce the risk for influenza during travel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that persons from the northern hemisphere who are recommended for annual vaccination or who want to avoid influenza illness but have not yet received the 2008–09 influenza vaccine should consider being vaccinated 1) before travel to the southern hemisphere during influenza season, 2) before travel to the tropics at any time of year, or 3) when traveling as part of a tour group that includes persons from areas where influenza circulates during April — September (e.g., the southern hemisphere). Vaccine formulations for each hemisphere are updated yearly but might differ according to virus surveillance information from each hemisphere.

DISCUSSION

Here we have shown that the optimal timing of yearly booster vaccination in many locations within the temperate Northern Hemisphere is typically in the autumn to early winter, with moderate variance in timing across locations. In many cases, individuals who experience breakthrough infections can beneficially delay their upcoming booster. The amount of delay that provides the greatest benefit of booster vaccination is contingent on when the breakthrough infection occurs. Minimal delay in the next booster vaccination is warranted if an infection occurs shortly after a booster vaccination on the yearly optimal date. Most breakthrough infections are likely to occur long after booster vaccination, when substantial delay is most beneficial. Identification and communication of appropriate booster timing to public health authorities, vaccine providers, and recipients — along with guidance as to how to adapt that timing in response to infection — enables more effective booster vaccinations, timed to be cognizant of typical yearly incidence and individual infection history, and therefore more universally inclusive.

Our analysis is rigorously data-driven, but is based on a number of population- and location-specific datasets that enable us to quantify a broader generality. For instance, our yearly optimal booster vaccination dates are based on endemic seasonality of COVID-19 infection. However, infection trends for the near-term may not adhere to endemic seasonality and may be subject to greater variability in surge timing and intensity. Moreover, our analysis assumes that the typical endemic seasonality is applicable each year. Seasons of endemic respiratory viruses are known to vary in severity as well as to surge early or late in some years. Indeed, the intervals between the optimal yearly booster vaccination dates and the peaks of monthly incidence were fairly consistent from location to location. This geographical consistency implies that a surge occurring earlier or later than usual at a location should be addressed by advancing or delaying the dates of booster administration in that location proportionately. Early and late surges are likely associated with factors such as temperature, humidity, as well as environmentally driven shifts in human behavior. Direct research on environmental correlates of surging infection for COVID-19 has been challenging due to pandemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, which have been strongly influenced by dramatic spatiotemporal shifts of immune status and of interventions. Therefore, accumulation of data regarding environmental correlates of endemic COVID-19 infection would empower the development of predictive seasonal incidence models that could, in turn, inform dynamic yearly recommendations regarding the timing of booster vaccination.

### Influenza activity-United States, 2014–15 season and composition of the 2015–16 influenza vaccine [^116WCNf6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. Substantial influenza activity generally begins in the fall and continues through the winter and spring months; however, the timing and severity of influenza activity varies by geographic location and season.

What is added by this report?

The 2014–15 influenza season was an influenza A (H3N2)–predominant and moderately severe season overall, but was especially severe for adults aged ≥ 65 years. This age group had the highest laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization rates and also accounted for the majority of pneumonia and influenza deaths. Antigenic and genetic characterization showed that most of the circulating influenza A (H3N2) viruses were different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines, resulting in reduced vaccine effectiveness.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness and its associated complications. Although vaccine effectiveness was reduced this season because of antigenic drift in H3N2 viruses, vaccination was still protective against vaccine-like influenza A (H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses. Timely influenza surveillance informs vaccine strain selection; the influenza A (H3) and influenza B components of the subsequent 2015–16 season vaccine have been changed to more optimally match circulating viruses. As an adjunct to vaccination, timely empiric antiviral treatment is also recommended for all patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for influenza-associated complications, including adults aged ≥ 65 years.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

Vaccination Issues for Travelers

Travelers who want to reduce the risk for influenza infection should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons residing in the United States who are at higher risk for complications of influenza and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the preceding Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships, or to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September).

Persons at higher risk who received the previous season's vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza or other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. Persons vaccinated before travel should receive the current vaccine the following fall or winter.

In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring approximately from October through May in the Northern Hemisphere and April through September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza occurs throughout the year. Travelers can be exposed to influenza when travelling to an area where influenza is circulating, or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g. on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world in which influenza viruses are circulating.

Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere formulation influenza vaccine prior to departure might be reasonable, but might not be feasible in many instances. With the exception of the Southern Hemisphere formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent (IIV4), Southern Hemisphere formulation seasonal influenza vaccines are not licensed in the U.S. and Southern Hemisphere formulations generally are not commercially available in the United States. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at.

Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications

Administration of IIV or RIV4 to persons receiving influenza antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis is acceptable. However, influenza antiviral medications may reduce the effectiveness of LAIV4 if given within 48 hours before to 14 days after LAIV4. Persons who receive influenza antiviral medications during this period surrounding receipt of LAIV4 may be revaccinated with another appropriate vaccine formulation (e.g. IIV or RIV4).

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024–25 influenza season [^112oaFzj]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaccination Issues for Travelers

In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring during approximately October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza might occur throughout the year. The timing of influenza activity and predominant types and subtypes of influenza viruses in circulation vary by geographic region. Travelers can be exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g. on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating.

Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September), or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous season's influenza vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming influenza season's vaccine is available, or who received the immediately preceding Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine, should receive the current U.S. seasonal influenza vaccine the following fall or winter.

Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation before departure might be reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they are typically not commercially available.

### Update: influenza activity-United States and worldwide, may 19-September 28, 2019, and composition of the 2020 Southern hemisphere influenza vaccine [^1139xJMm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

During May 19-September 28, 2019, low levels of influenza activity were reported in the United States, with cocirculation of influenza A and influenza B viruses. In the Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza viruses circulated widely, with influenza A(H3) predominating in many regions; however, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were predominant in some countries. In late September, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended components for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine and included an update to the A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage components. Annual influenza vaccination is the best means for preventing influenza illness and its complications, and vaccination before influenza activity increases is optimal. Health care providers should recommend vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications to vaccination (1).

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^11381bU1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Such an alternate approach has been enabled by recent research based on ample coronavirus incidence data that documented substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in peak incidence across the Northern Hemisphere. These results largely match typical respiratory virus incidence patterns, featuring peaks of "flu and cold season" with some specificity in each locality. However, in isolation, these results give no direct guidance regarding when to administer booster vaccinations. The optimal timing of booster vaccinations depends jointly on the risk of infection due to seasonality and on the long-term waning of protection subsequent to booster vaccination. Rigorous estimates of long-term protection subsequent to booster vaccination have been obtained by leveraging longitudinal antibody and reinfection data from the close evolutionary relatives of SARS-CoV-2 as well as infection and antibody data on SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the durability of immunity following natural infection, primary vaccination, and boosting. These analyses, subsequently validated by comparison to empirical data, indicate that statistical approaches derived from evolutionary medicine can illuminate reinfection risks with high accuracy and precision. Yet, the impact on yearly infection of administering yearly booster vaccinations at specific times in specific locations remains unknown — as does the impact of breakthrough infections at specific times of the year on the optimal timing of booster vaccination.

Here we integrated the waxing probabilities of infection subsequent to antigen exposure with projections of the expected seasonal variation in frequency of infection for endemic SARS-CoV-2 to perform a high-resolution investigation of prospective timings of booster vaccinations that maximally curtail infection. We evaluated the optimal boosting date over the year for individuals who have not been infected over the previous year. Then we analyzed similar optimal timings for individuals who have been infected during that year to determine any advantage to delaying the booster, depending on the date of infection. Such knowledge of optimal booster vaccination timing will be helpful for physician and individual decision-making in the context of ongoing endemic disease, and is crucial for effective vaccination policy that suppresses morbidity and mortality as a consequence of COVID-19.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2017–18 influenza season [^112pMTK2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations when vaccine is available. Vaccination efforts should be structured to ensure the vaccination of as many persons as possible before influenza activity in the community begins.

In any given season, the optimal time to vaccinate cannot be predicted precisely because influenza seasons vary in timing and duration. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 74% of influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2015–16, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 59% of seasons, the peak was in February or later.

EXPAND SEASONAL PREVENTION AND CONTROL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS, FOCUSING ON SEASONAL INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS

Progress and challenges in seasonal influenza vaccination policy recommendations.

Influenza vaccination remains the best available measure to reduce the burden of severe influenza. In 2004, PAHO's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Vaccine-Preventable Diseases recommended that all countries establish a seasonal influenza vaccination policy to vaccinate children 6–23 months of age, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illness, the elderly, and health workers. While acknowledging that surveillance is primarily for situational awareness and directing public health actions, the TAG specifically recommended that all countries strengthen surveillance systems to determine influenza disease burden, cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine introduction, and optimal vaccination strategies, including formulation and timing.

By 2004, 13 countries in the Region of the Americas had a policy for influenza vaccination. During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, the Region had one of the highest uptake of pandemic vaccines and vaccination rates; more than 145 million people were eventually immunized. Since then, seasonal influenza vaccination has continued to improve in the Americas. By 2019, 39 of the 51 (76.5%) countries and territories reported an influenza vaccination policy. Specifically, 39 countries recommend vaccinating health workers, 37 individuals with chronic diseases, 33 the elderly, 33 pregnant women, and 30 healthy children. In LAC, most countries start vaccinating in April with the southern hemisphere formulation, though there are exceptions (Figure 2).

This figure appears in color at.

In 2020, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended prioritizing risk groups for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on older adults and health workers. This would reduce influenza burden among groups who are also at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease, mitigate burden on health care systems, and protect health workers. The considerable overlap with population groups targeted for seasonal influenza vaccination offers the opportunity to leverage existing influenza vaccination programs to achieve high coverage for both vaccines.

Vaccination Issues for Travelers

In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring during approximately October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza might occur throughout the year. Travelers can be exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g. on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating.

Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September), or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous season's influenza vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming influenza season's vaccine is available should receive the current vaccine the following fall or winter.

Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation before departure might be reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they are typically not commercially available. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at.

### Spatial, temporal and evolutionary insight into seasonal epidemic influenza A virus strains near the equatorial line: the case of Ecuador [^1132QJbE]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

WHO annual Influenza vaccine recommendations are designed to ensure vaccine delivery before the winter-time peak of viral circulation in each hemisphere. However, Influenza seasonal patterns are highly diverse in tropical countries and may be out of phase with the WHO recommendations for their respective hemisphere. In fact, previous studies revealed that optimal timing for Influenza vaccination may not correspond to the one expected for their hemisphere in tropical regions of South America. In order to gain insight into IAV dynamics in a tropical country as Ecuador, we estimated the seasonal parameters and obtained the periodical time function for IAV epidemics in this country (see Fig. 1). The results of these studies revealed that although Ecuador is a tropical South American country, its epidemiology resembles that of temperate Northern Hemisphere countries, with monthly primary peaks in January (see Figs. 1 and 2).

Moreover, these results suggest that Ecuador is 'out-of-phase' from the recommendations of the use of the Southern hemisphere vaccine and more likely is suitable for receiving the vaccine initially recommended for the opposite hemisphere.

The WHO Influenza vaccine committee meet twice a year since 1999 to decide on the antigenic composition of Influenza vaccines for the next Influenza season in each hemisphere. In the case of the Northern hemisphere, globally circulating Influenza virus strains are reviewed every February, so that the vaccine can be distributed between September and October, in advance of the winter Influenza season of this hemisphere. Likewise, for the Southern hemisphere, Influenza virus circulation patterns are reviewed each September, so that vaccination can takes place between March and April of the following year. The current six-month delay between the WHO expert recommendations and vaccine availability is due to limitations of the current technology used in the manufacturing process, which represents a severe challenge for vaccine efficacy. For these reasons, it is important to investigate national patterns of Influenza virus circulation in tropical countries in order to estimate the most appropriate timing for administering the most appropriate Influenza vaccine. The results of these studies revealed that the Northern hemisphere schedule is more appropriate for Ecuador (see Figs. 1 and 2).

Implications for Public Health Practice

Interim VE estimates for the Southern Hemisphere 2025 influenza season suggest that influenza vaccines were effective in reducing influenza-associated outpatient visits and hospitalization by approximately one half. Examination of influenza VE during the Southern Hemisphere season might provide insights for health authorities who are actively preparing and planning for the upcoming Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The 2025–2026 Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine composition is the same as the 2025 Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine; health authorities in Northern Hemisphere locations might anticipate similar levels of protection against influenza illness, should the same influenza viruses circulate during the upcoming season. These findings support CDC's recommendations for all eligible persons aged ≥ 6 months to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine before the start of the Northern Hemisphere influenza season.

### Influenza vaccines for 2025–2026 in adults who are not pregnant or immunocompromised: rapid practice points from the American College of Physicians [^1156yvGp]. Ann Intern Med (2025). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — adults who are not pregnant or immunocompromised: Encourage patients to receive the influenza vaccine and address common misunderstandings that minor, short-term adverse symptoms, such as fever and injection site soreness, may be an indication of desired immune response. Recognize that the primary goal of influenza vaccination is to prevent morbidity (for example, severe disease or hospitalization) and mortality. People with egg allergies may receive egg-based or non–egg-based vaccines. Emphasize that preventive actions can reduce the spread of influenza in combination with vaccination (handwashing, covering sneezes and coughs, avoiding close contact with others if experiencing an influenza-like illness). In the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity occurs between April and September but may continue to October or November. In the Northern Hemisphere, influenza activity occurs between October and April but may continue to May. In the United States, to optimize protection against influenza, influenza vaccines should ideally be administered in September to October of each year to allow for antibody development before peak influenza season, and adults should still receive the vaccine before the end of the influenza season if not administered in that time frame.

Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2019–20

Groups Recommended for Vaccination

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow.

Timing of Vaccination

Balancing considerations regarding the unpredictability of timing of onset of the influenza season and concerns that vaccine-induced immunity might wane over the course of a season, it is recommended that vaccination should be offered by the end of October. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later) to be received by the end of October. For those requiring only 1 dose for the season, early vaccination (i.e. in July and August) is likely to be associated with suboptimal immunity before the end of the influenza season, particularly among older adults. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. No recommendation is made for revaccination later in the season of persons who have already been fully vaccinated (i.e. providing a booster dose). Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations.

Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 75% of 36 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2017–18, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 58% of seasons, the peak was in February or later. Activity most commonly peaked in February in 15 (42%) of these seasons.

Primary updates and changes to the recommendations described in this report include 1) discussion of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2021–22 influenza season; 2) the vaccine virus composition for 2021–22 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 3) recent regulatory actions, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2020–21 ACIP influenza statement; 4) considerations for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic; 5) updates to the recommendations concerning timing of vaccination; and 6) updates to the discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccines. Information relevant to these changes includes the following:

Availability of specific types and brands of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States is determined by the manufacturers of the vaccines. Information presented concerning vaccines expected to be available and their approved indications and usage reflects current knowledge and is subject to change.
Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by WHO, which organizes a consultation, generally in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information concerning the WHO meeting of February 26, 2021, for selection of the 2021–22 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition of influenza vaccines licensed and marketed in the United States. Materials from the VRBPAC discussion of March 5, 2021, during which the composition of the 2021–22 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, are available at.
Regarding recommendations concerning newly licensed influenza vaccines and changes to the licensed indications for existing vaccines, ACIP relies on FDA for review of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy and effectiveness data pertaining to licensure and labeling of influenza vaccines. Regulatory information pertinent to the change in age indication for Flucelvax Quadrivalent discussed in this report is available at.
Guidance concerning timing of influenza vaccination relative to administration of COVID-19 vaccines is coordinated with current ACIP recommendations and CDC guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines. This information might change as data and clinical experience with COVID-19 vaccines evolve. ACIP recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines are available at. Interim clinical guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines is available at. These pages should be checked periodically for updated information.
Guidance for the timing of influenza vaccination in specific populations is based on the potential timing of availability of influenza vaccines each season, typical timing of the U.S. influenza season, need for receipt of 2 doses separated by ≥ 4 weeks before the start of the influenza season for some children aged 6 months through 8 years (those who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of ≥ 2 doses), and lack of influenza vaccines for children aged < 6 months (for whom maternal vaccination offers protection against influenza).
Information regarding indications, contraindications, and precautions for influenza vaccines is reviewed. Differences between ACIP recommendations and package labeling are noted in the text. Labeled contraindications and precautions are indicated (Table 2); contraindications and precautions recommended by ACIP also are noted. Package inserts for U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are available at.

### Timing of seasonal influenza epidemics for 25 countries in Africa during 2010–19: a retrospective analysis [^114wkWKV]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Added value of this study

The extent and quality of influenza surveillance data reported by African countries to the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response network has improved substantially in the past decades. Our analysis of 10 years of high-quality laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data from 25 African countries provides novel, policy-relevant information about when to anticipate and plan to mitigate influenza epidemics. We applied three WHO-endorsed analytical methods to investigate and categorise epidemic patterns into five groups: northern hemisphere-dominant (six countries), primarily northern hemisphere with some southern hemisphere (eight countries), southern hemisphere-dominant (three countries), primarily southern hemisphere with some northern hemisphere (three countries), and no clear pattern (five countries). This information can be used to recommend when to initiate vaccination campaigns with either northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations, and when to treat empirically with antivirals.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our description of influenza epidemics can help public health officials to better identify untimely viral activity as might occur during the emergence of a novel influenza virus. Our results can also help countries better choose which WHO influenza vaccine formulation seems most appropriate for use within their jurisdictions. Such a contribution can be useful to the several African countries currently investing in influenza vaccination programmes. Our findings can also help health officials to better time handwashing and respiratory hygiene campaigns, vaccine procurement and roll-outs, and empirical antiviral treatment, so that these interventions are deployed to optimal effect.

Insufficient data in at least 22 of 48 WHO African region countries prevented their inclusion in previous analyses of influenza circulation using at least 90 weeks of data from 2011 to 2017. In 2005, global influenza surveillance garnered momentum after an upswell of global investments to strengthen national surveillance platforms and reporting to WHO. As a result, more surveillance data are now available to analyse patterns of influenza activity in countries across Africa. This analysis leverages data from these improved surveillance systems to identify and describe historical influenza epidemics, characterise typical yearly activity, and explore optimal times for interventions for countries in Africa.

Vaccination Issues for Travelers

Travelers who want to reduce the risk for influenza infection should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons residing in the United States who are at high risk for complications of influenza and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the preceding Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before departure if they plan to travel:

to the tropics,
with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships, or
to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September).

No information is available indicating a benefit to revaccinating persons before summer travel who already were vaccinated during the preceding fall. In many cases, revaccination will not be feasible as Southern Hemisphere formulations of influenza vaccine are not generally available in the United States. Persons at high risk who receive the previous season's vaccine before travel should receive the current vaccine the following fall or winter. Persons at higher risk for influenza complications should consult with their health care practitioner to discuss the risk for influenza or other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer.

In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring approximately from October through May in the Northern Hemisphere and April through September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza occurs throughout the year. Travelers can be exposed to influenza when travelling to an area where influenza is circulating, or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g. on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world in which influenza viruses are circulating. In a survey of Swiss travelers to tropical and subtropical countries, among 211 who reported febrile illness during or after travelling abroad and who provided paired serum samples, 40 demonstrated serologic evidence of influenza infection. Among 109 travelers returning to Australia from travel in Asia who reported acute respiratory infection symptoms, four (3.7%) had evidence of influenza A infection (evidenced by fourfold rise in antibody titer).

Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. However, with the exception of the Southern Hemisphere formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent (IIV4; Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), Southern Hemisphere formulation seasonal influenza vaccines are not licensed in the United States, and Southern Hemisphere formulations generally are not commercially available in the United States. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at.

### Quadrivalent influenza vaccine prevents illness and reduces healthcare utilization across diverse geographic regions during five influenza seasons: a randomized clinical trial [^1131ECLR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have previously reported the overall efficacy of the IIV4 observed in the present study, combining data from 13 temperate and sub-tropical countries across 5 influenza seasons. Here, we report VE in each seasonal cohort and the impact of vaccine match/mismatch, as well as the impact of the vaccine on healthcare utilization within different study regions. Investigating the impact of influenza vaccines in single seasons and distinct regions covering Northern and Southern hemispheres is important because temporal and geographical variability in influenza epidemiology can affect VE and effectiveness. Influenza cases consistently peak over a short period in the winter months in Northern and Southern hemispheres, but in tropical and sub-tropical countries, the peak is less pronounced and can occur at almost any time. The characteristics of influenza epidemics are more variable in tropical and sub-tropical areas than in temperate areas, and different virus subtypes and lineages are more likely to circulate independently. The emergence of antigenic variants also varies from season to season, and it is well recognized that effectiveness declines in seasons where the vaccine is poorly matched to circulating strains.

### The potential benefits of delaying seasonal influenza vaccine selections for the Northern hemisphere: a retrospective modeling study in the United States [^11247dTP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antigenic similarity between vaccine viruses and circulating viruses is crucial for achieving high vaccine effectiveness against seasonal influenza. New non-egg-based vaccine production technologies could revise current vaccine formulation schedules. We aim to assess the potential benefit of delaying seasonal influenza vaccine virus selection decisions.

Methods

We identified seasons where season-dominant viruses presented increasing prevalence after vaccine formulation had been decided in February for the Northern Hemisphere, contributing to their antigenic discrepancy with vaccine viruses. Using a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model of seasonal influenza in the United States, we evaluated the impact of updating vaccine decisions with more antigenically similar vaccine viruses on the influenza burden in the United States.

Results

In 2014–2015 and 2019–2020, the season-dominant A(H3N2) subclade and B/Victoria clade, respectively, presented increasing prevalence after vaccine decisions were already made for the Northern Hemisphere. Our model showed that the updated A(H3N2) vaccine could have averted 5000–65 000 influenza hospitalizations in the United States in 2014–2015, whereas updating the B/Victoria vaccine component did not substantially change influenza burden in the 2019–2020 season.

Conclusions

With rapid vaccine production, revising current timelines for vaccine selection could result in substantial epidemiological benefits, particularly when additional data could help improve the antigenic match between vaccine and circulating viruses.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2021–22 influenza season [^114QpckQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Variable data concerning the presence and rate of waning immunity after influenza vaccination, coupled with the unpredictable timing of the influenza season each year, prevent determination of an optimal time to vaccinate. Programmatic issues are also a consideration: although delaying vaccination might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral also might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained period. The potential contributions of these factors among persons aged ≥ 65 years have been assessed using a simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, rate of waning, and vaccine effectiveness. In this model, during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if > 14% of persons aged ≥ 65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness.

Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February or March. Providers should offer influenza vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should still offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses.

Guidance for Use in Specific Populations and Situations

### Influenza activity – United States, 2012–13 season and composition of the 2013–14 influenza vaccine [^116nxpYu]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Although summer influenza activity in the United States typically is low, cases of influenza and even sporadic outbreaks are detected in the United States throughout the summer. Health-care providers should remain vigilant and consider influenza as a potential cause of summer respiratory illnesses. They also should consider novel influenza viruses in persons with ILI and swine exposure, and those with severe acute respiratory infection after travel to China. Public health laboratories should immediately send to CDC virus specimens that they cannot type or subtype using standard methods and submit all specimens that are otherwise unusual, including all summer specimens, as soon as possible after identification.

Since 2010, CDC has recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months, preferably in the fall before the U.S. influenza season begins. However, during other times of the year, persons who have not received the vaccine for the current season should be vaccinated before traveling to parts of the world where influenza activity is ongoing. This is particularly important for persons at high risk for influenza-related complications. §§ This recommendation also applies to persons traveling within the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere or as part of large tourist groups (e.g. on cruise ships) that might include persons from other parts of the world where influenza activity is ongoing. Persons should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before travel for immunity to develop. Travelers also should be aware that all Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine manufactured for the 2012–13 season expires by June 30, 2013, after which influenza vaccines will not be available in the United States until the 2013–14 vaccine is available in the fall.

### Regional-based within-year seasonal variations in influenza-related health outcomes across mainland China: a systematic review and spatio-temporal analysis [^117YGP87]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The disparity in the timing of A/H3N2 epidemics across mainland China may have substantial implications for influenza immunisation programmes. In general, vaccinations in the northern hemisphere are administered throughout the autumn, prior to the winter epidemic; however, this style of roll-out in parts of mainland China may be less effective at reducing incidence in A/H3N2 infections throughout summer epidemics due to waning within-season vaccine effectiveness. Addressing this regional epidemiological nuance may be challenging as repeat revaccination has been shown to be ineffective at enhancing immune response. We further provide evidence that the onset of influenza epidemics tends to be staggered across mainland China. Epidemics occur first in parts of the North of the county and then several months later in the Southeast. Thus, regional-based approaches to vaccination timing may optimise levels of vaccine effectiveness, however, this should be balanced with the practicalities of vaccinating large amounts of the population and the risk of an early influenza season. With the length and intensity of epidemics also varying across the county, regions that experience short epidemics may need to be more adaptable for potential surge capacity compared to regions with a year-round burden of disease.

Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2022–23

Groups Recommended for Vaccination

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow.

Timing of Vaccination

Because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Decisions about timing necessitate balancing considerations regarding this unpredictability of the influenza season, possible waning of vaccine-induced immunity over the course of a season, and programmatic considerations. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August; however, vaccination during these months is not recommended for most groups because of the possible waning of immunity over the course of the influenza season. For most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the influenza season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available.

### Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children: population based cohort study [^112JUyDW]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that annual influenza vaccinations be administered in September or October to maximize vaccine induced immunity over the coming influenza season. Although the upcoming season's vaccine may be available in the summer months, receiving the vaccine too early may result in waning effectiveness, particularly among children and older adults, before the end of the flu season. Meanwhile, delaying vaccination may result in exposure to circulating influenza without the protection of vaccine induced immunity. As such, the CDC recommends that vaccination programs "balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs".

Annual influenza vaccination is particularly important for young children, who are at elevated risk of influenza and severe infection necessitating admission to hospital; however, little clinical evidence exists to precisely guide the timing of vaccination in this population. One way to study the optimal timing of vaccination would be to measure antibody titers or in vitro antiviral activity of immunized patients at different times following vaccination; however, this method focuses on an intermediate outcome that is imperfectly correlated with real world effectiveness and may be limited by study size and representativeness. Another way would be to examine vaccine effectiveness as a function of time since vaccination in observational data. Such studies in other age groups suggest that effectiveness peaks within several weeks of vaccination and wanes with each month; children, however, may have a longer duration of vaccine effectiveness. Such observational studies are often limited by generalizability and selection bias (for example, patients at higher risk of clinically significant infection may choose to get vaccinated earlier).

A child's birthday may influence the timing of influenza vaccination. Preventive care visits for young children are a convenient time to administer vaccines; these visits are often purposefully timed around birthdays and coordinate with the recommended childhood vaccine schedule, which includes annual influenza vaccination. As such, children who happen to be born in the fall and early winter, when the seasonal influenza vaccine becomes available, are both more likely to be vaccinated against influenza and less likely to have a diagnosis of influenza infection. Moreover, among children who are vaccinated, those born in August or September may also be vaccinated earlier owing to earlier preventive care visits. If so, earlier vaccination may be associated with waning vaccine induced immunity toward the end of the flu season, whereas children vaccinated later may have insufficient vaccine induced immunity before being exposed to the influenza virus.

During the 2021–22 influenza season, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the United States, and COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to continue. Current guidance for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines (available at) indicates that these vaccines can be administered with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines; providers should consult this page for updated information. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at. Additional discussion of coadministration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines can be found in the section on Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines.

Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 27 (75%) of 36 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2017–18, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 21 (58%) seasons, the peak was in February or later. Activity peaked in February in 15 (42%) of these seasons.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 28-December 6, 2014 [^113saV43]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality

As of December 6 (week 49), seven influenza-associated pediatric deaths that occurred in the 2014–15 season were reported to CDC. Four deaths were associated with an influenza A (H3) virus, two deaths were associated with an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed, and one death was associated with an influenza B virus. The number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported to CDC in the previous three seasons has ranged from 37 during the 2011–12 season to 171 during the 2012–13 season. During the 2009 pandemic, 358 pediatric deaths were reported from April 15, 2009, through October 2, 2010 (traditional influenza seasons include data from October [week 40] through September [week 39] of the following year).

Discussion

As monitored by all CDC influenza surveillance systems, influenza activity in the United States for the 2014–15 season is low but increasing. Although the timing of influenza activity varies from year to year, peak activity in the United States most commonly occurs during January–March, but there can be substantial influenza activity as early as November and December. From September 28 to December 6, 2014, influenza A (H3N2) viruses were identified most frequently in the United States, but pH1N1 and influenza B viruses also were reported. Antigenic or genetic characterization of influenza-positive respiratory specimens submitted to CDC indicate that over half of the recently examined influenza A (H3N2) viruses show evidence of antigenic drift from the A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) virus (the H3N2 component on the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine). Even during seasons when the match between the vaccine viruses and circulating viruses is less than optimal and protection against illness might be reduced, vaccination remains the most effective method to prevent influenza and its complications. Health care providers should recommend vaccination to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 6 months now and throughout the influenza season. In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the preferential use of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years. However, if LAIV is not available, inactivated influenza vaccine should be used, and vaccination should not be delayed to procure LAIV. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who are being vaccinated for the first time require 2 doses of influenza vaccine, administered ≥ 4 weeks apart. For children aged 6 months through 8 years who have received influenza vaccination during a previous season, health care providers should consult Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines to assess whether 1 or 2 doses are required.

### Frequent genetic mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating seasonal influenza viruses, hong kong, China, 1996–2012 [^113JgMf5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Influenza is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. The human influenza virus spreads rapidly (average reproduction number of 1.28), typically infects 5%–10% of the population during seasonal epidemics, and results in 3–5 million cases of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection and ≈500,000 deaths per year globally. Continuous evolution of the single-stranded influenza virus results in antigenic drift of its surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Antigenic drift occurs on average 2–8 years in response to host immune selection pressure and is most frequently seen in influenza A(H3N2), followed by influenza B and influenza A(H1N1). Antigenic drift confers the virus an ability to escape immunity induced by previous infection or immunization.

Effectiveness of current influenza vaccines is predominantly determined by matching between vaccines and circulating strains. To achieve the best possible vaccine matching, the World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its recommended vaccine composition 12 times for influenza A(H3N2), 10 times for influenza B, and 6 times for influenza A(H1N1) since 1998. WHO reviews influenza vaccine composition each February and September to provide timely recommendation for temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. Tropical and subtropical regions are expected to choose 1 of the 2 recommended vaccine compositions. However, influenza seasonality varies more in the tropics and subtropics, where epidemics can occur year-round. Moreover, a national policy on the choice and timing of vaccination is lacking in many tropical and subtropical countries, where 60% of the world's population resides.

We analyzed the 2 most frequently drifting influenza types, A(H3N2) and B, in Hong Kong during 1996–2012 to examine matching between vaccine strains and circulating field viruses to document the challenges faced in this region. We evaluated options on choosing the Northern or Southern Hemisphere vaccine compositions and the strategy of an annual or biannual vaccination.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2018–19 influenza season [^1112XnNA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 75% of influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2017–18, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 58% of seasons, the peak was in February or later.

A number of observational studies and a post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial have reported decreases in vaccine effectiveness (VE) within a single influenza season, with increasing time postvaccination. Waning effects have not been observed consistently across age groups, virus subtypes, and seasons; and observed declines in protection could be at least in part attributable to bias, unmeasured confounding, or the late season emergence of antigenic drift variants that are less well-matched to the vaccine strain. Some studies suggest this occurs to a greater degree with A(H3N2) viruses than with A(H1N1) or B viruses. This effect might also vary with recipient age; in some studies waning was more pronounced among older adults and younger children. Rates of decline in VE have also varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that VE declined by about 7% per month for H3N2 and influenza B, and 6%–11% per month for H1N1pdm09. VE remained greater than zero for at least 5 to 6 months after vaccination. An analysis from the 2011–12 through 2013–14 seasons noted protection ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0 through 180 postvaccination. A third multiseason analysis (2011–12 through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline in VE to 0% at 111 days postvaccination for A(H3N2) viruses. VE against B viruses declined more slowly and VE against A(H1N1) viruses remained roughly stable at 50–55% through the influenza season.

### Influenza activity and composition of the 2022–23 influenza vaccine-United States, 2021–22 season [^1176yUrF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, influenza activity in the United States typically began to increase in the fall and peaked in February. During the 2021–22 season, influenza activity began to increase in November and remained elevated until mid-June, featuring two distinct waves, with A(H3N2) viruses predominating for the entire season. This report summarizes influenza activity during October 3, 2021-June 11, 2022, in the United States and describes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2022–23 influenza vaccine. Although influenza activity is decreasing and circulation during summer is typically low, remaining vigilant for influenza infections, performing testing for seasonal influenza viruses, and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections are important. An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) is ongoing; health care providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds should remain vigilant for onset of symptoms consistent with influenza. Receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences.

### Frequent genetic mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating seasonal influenza viruses, hong kong, China, 1996–2012 [^114BQmNu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Because Hong Kong, like many other subtropical cities, faces multiple influenza peaks annually, we raised the question whether Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines would provide timely and better vaccine matching. However, we observed that most of the time composition of the Southern Hemisphere vaccine is the same as the preceding Northern Hemisphere vaccine and thus made no difference in vaccine matching. Furthermore, according to the current production schedule, Southern Hemisphere vaccines are made available in May, just after the period with highest influenza activity in Hong Kong (January–March). Therefore, to administer influenza vaccine in May requires vaccines with efficacy lasting for almost 12 months, which is not a demonstrated property of current vaccines.

Given the comparable duration of winter and summer influenza seasons in Hong Kong, the next question was whether biannual vaccination with Northern and Southern Hemisphere vaccines administered before the winter and summer seasons, respectively, would improve immunity against circulating strains. In early 2015, Hong Kong faced a strong winter influenza peak associated with a newly drifted variant, influenza A(H3N2)/Switzerland, which was not incorporated into the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. In view of a possible strong summer peak, an ad hoc vaccination campaign was conducted in May using the newly available Southern Hemisphere vaccine that incorporated the new variant. However, willingness to accept the vaccine was low among healthcare professionals, and a major proportion expressed concern. Furthermore, in recent years, concern has surfaced that repeated influenza vaccination might negatively affect current vaccine effectiveness. Although a recent meta-analysis does not support such a claim, this possibility should not be ignored when considering biannual vaccination. Although the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of a biannual vaccination strategy is yet to be assessed, our analysis does not support that an additional vaccine before summer seasons can improve matching. We observed a substantial chance of drift in predominant influenza viruses from season to season (41.2% for H3N2 and 35.3% for influenza B), and the newly available Southern Hemisphere vaccines typically had the same strain composition as the preceding Northern Hemisphere vaccine or the updated Southern Hemisphere composition still did not achieve a close match with the then-circulating viruses.

### Differences in influenza seasonality by latitude, Northern India [^115wycJq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Influenza vaccine induces a neutralizing antibody response that wanes over time. Thus, the timing of vaccination has a direct effect on vaccine effectiveness. In the northernmost part of India, peak influenza circulation occurs during the winter months; therefore, vaccination during October–November using the Northern Hemisphere vaccine formulation may be appropriate. However, this practice would not be appropriate in the Delhi metropolitan region, where influenza peaks in July–September. In addition, whereas our data points to an approximate latitude where temperate and tropical patterns for influenza peaks diverge, more robust data with multiple surveillance sites in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions in India and China are needed to define the exact latitude points for influenza circulation patterns.

Our study has limitations. First, comparative data were available only for 2 years. Additional surveillance data for multiple years and many cities around the latitude gradient are required to further corroborate these observations. Furthermore, validation of vaccine formulation will require tracking of additional circulating influenza strains over several epidemic periods.

In summary, we identified 2 distinct seasons for influenza circulation in 2 cities in India. We recommend that policy makers in India review circulation patterns closely before implementing influenza intervention plans. Our data suggest that cities in India located north of 30°N latitude can continue vaccination in the winter, but those south of 30°N, including New Delhi, should consider vaccination in May–June. Collectively, these data should help decision makers, especially regulatory authorities, choose vaccines and vaccination schedules best suited for each region.

### Timing of seasonal influenza epidemics for 25 countries in Africa during 2010–19: a retrospective analysis [^115vYZBG]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Influenza disease causes approximately 28 000–163 000 deaths in Africa annually. Influenza vaccines remain the primary method to lower the risk of severe illness and mortality;, however, few countries in Africa use influenza vaccines. While influenza vaccines and antivirals are available and accessible in some African countries, influenza-related policy data from the WHO–UNICEF Joint Reporting Form show that only five (10%) of 47 African WHO member states have a national influenza immunisation policy (Algeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa). Of these five countries, only Morocco and Algeria target all WHO-recommended groups at increased risk (ie, children aged ≤ 5 years, people with chronic illness, pregnant people, health-care workers, and older adults aged > 65 years).

Ascertaining the appropriate vaccine formulation and epidemic timing are key to successful seasonal influenza vaccination and empirical antiviral treatment. However, assessing the timing of influenza activity can be challenging in tropical countries because epidemic activity can vary each year and might not align well with the traditional northern hemisphere (October–March) or southern hemisphere (April–September) epidemic patterns. The current WHO transmission zones that inform seasonal influenza vaccination are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories that have been defined to have similar influenza transmission patterns. A modelling study of peak timing for influenza activity for 125 countries found that 62% of northern hemisphere and 53% of southern hemisphere tropical countries used vaccines that seemed out of phase with their dominant epidemic patterns. Using a long time-series of country-specific surveillance data to model influenza epidemics, countries could improve decisions about which formulations to choose, when to vaccinate, and when to treat empirically with antivirals.

### Interim effectiveness estimates of 2024 Southern hemisphere influenza vaccines in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization-REVELAC-I network, five south American countries, March-July 2024 [^111pDYAv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

To reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, countries in South America recommend annual influenza vaccination for persons at high risk for severe influenza illness, including young children, persons with preexisting health conditions, and older adults. Interim estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) from Southern Hemisphere countries can provide early information about the protective effects of vaccination and help guide Northern Hemisphere countries in advance of their season. Using data from a multicountry network, investigators estimated interim VE against influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalization using a test-negative case-control design. During March 13-July 19, 2024, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay identified 11,751 influenza-associated SARI cases; on average, 21.3% of patients were vaccinated against influenza, and the adjusted VE against hospitalization was 34.5%. The adjusted VE against the predominating subtype A(H3N2) was 36.5% and against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 37.1%. These interim VE estimates suggest that although the proportion of hospitalized patients who were vaccinated was modest, vaccination with the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine significantly lowered the risk for hospitalization. Northern Hemisphere countries should, therefore, anticipate the need for robust influenza vaccination campaigns and early antiviral treatment to achieve optimal protection against influenza-associated complications.

### Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children: population based cohort study [^116cNjJ5]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In an analysis of children aged 2–5 years who were vaccinated against influenza, birth month was associated with both timing of influenza vaccination and the likelihood of diagnosis of influenza. Children born in October, who were disproportionately likely to be vaccinated in October compared with children with other birth months, were least likely to have a diagnosis of influenza, particularly compared with children born in August, who tended to be vaccinated sooner, and those born in December, who tended to be vaccinated later. These quasi-experimental results, which rely on the observation that preventive care visits tend to occur during birth months and are a convenient time to receive the influenza vaccine, support current recommendations for October being the optimal month for influenza vaccination in young children in typical influenza seasons. Notably, the optimal timing of influenza vaccination that can be inferred from using birth month as a natural experiment differs from what would be inferred from analyses of influenza risk by actual month of vaccination.

Studies of vaccine effectiveness suggest that immunity against influenza wanes over the course of the flu season; meanwhile, vaccinated patients who are exposed to the virus before acquiring vaccine induced immunity are at higher risk of infection. This suggests that an optimal time may exist for children to be vaccinated before the flu season and how this question could be evaluated using observational data and quasi-experimental empirical methods. Under the assumption that children born in October are otherwise similar to children born in other months, our findings suggest that the specific timing of influenza vaccination among children born in October may lead to lower rates of influenza infection.

### Interim effectiveness estimates of 2023 Southern hemisphere influenza vaccines in preventing influenza-associated hospitalizations-REVELAC-I network, March-July 2023 [^113WvFk8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This interim evaluation of the 2023 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation was conducted using data from five Southern Hemisphere countries and suggests that the current season's trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines are effective in reducing influenza-associated hospitalization. In particular, interim VE estimates indicate a significant reduction in hospitalization associated with the predominant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus among young children and older adults. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza and severe associated outcomes. Health authorities worldwide should encourage influenza vaccination for persons at increased risk for severe disease, including young children, persons with preexisting health conditions, and older adults, as well as those at increased risk for exposure to or transmission of influenza virus, such as health care personnel.

Despite the encouraging influenza VE, fewer than 30% of persons identified through REVELAC–i were vaccinated against influenza before their illness onset. The current findings were consistent with an interim report from Peru, where unadjusted VE against RT-PCR–confirmed influenza illness was 62%, but only one in five persons with medically attended respiratory illness had sought vaccination during 2023, which is lower than the historical norm. Evaluations of influenza illness and vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and practices and deployment of World Health Organization (WHO) influenza post-introduction evaluations might help health authorities understand the reasons for reduced vaccination coverage since the COVID-19 pandemic and optimize influenza vaccination coverage in the future. §§

Although the timing and intensity of influenza epidemics in one hemisphere are not necessarily predictive of subsequent epidemics in the opposite hemisphere, this report might help health officials in Northern Hemisphere jurisdictions prepare for a potentially early influenza season and highlight the benefits of vaccination. In recent weeks, most influenza detections in the United States have identified A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses. This is a similar pattern to that identified among the evaluated Southern Hemisphere countries, providing an encouraging outlook for vaccine protection from current influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria, because the Northern Hemisphere vaccine formulation contains antigenically similar A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus for egg-based vaccines and A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus for cell-based vaccines. Nevertheless, whether influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 will remain the predominant virus in the United States during the October 2023–May 2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza season is unclear.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 29-December 7, 2013 [^111xJLMw]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Influenza activity so far this season has increased during the most recent weeks and is expected to continue to increase in the coming weeks. During September 29–December 7, 2013, pH1N1 viruses were identified most frequently in the United States, but influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B viruses also were reported. Antigenic characterization of influenza-positive respiratory specimens submitted to CDC indicates that 1) the majority of these isolates tested were antigenically like the components of the 2013–14 Northern Hemisphere trivalent influenza vaccine viruses and 2) all of these isolates tested were antigenically like the components of the 2013–14 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine viruses. Although the timing of influenza activity varies from year to year, peak activity in the United States most commonly occurs in February, but there can be substantial influenza activity as early as November and December, and activity can occur as late as May. Vaccination remains the most effective method to prevent influenza and its complications. Health-care providers should offer vaccine to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 6 months now and throughout the influenza season.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1-November 25, 2017 [^114pE25A]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

For the 2017–18 season, manufacturers projected they would supply the United States with 151 million–166 million doses of injectable influenza vaccine. As of November 24, 2017, approximately 148.2 million doses of vaccine had already been distributed. Influenza vaccination coverage estimates for this season show coverage similar to the same time last season among the general population. Survey data collected through early November 2017 indicate that 38.6% of all persons aged ≥ 6 months reported receiving flu vaccination (compared with 39.8% at this time last season). This leaves approximately 3 out of 5 persons in the United States unprotected against influenza. These estimates are reported on the CDC website.

The majority of influenza viruses collected this season, although small in number, have been antigenically and genetically characterized as being similar to the cell-grown reference viruses representing the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. The lack of significant antigenic drift observed for recently circulating influenza viruses further suggests that vaccination with the Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine should offer similar protection as past seasons when cell-grown reference vaccine viruses were most similar to circulating viruses. Vaccine effectiveness can vary between influenza seasons and by virus type or subtype. Studies have shown reduced vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses (30–40%), in the absence of significant antigenic drift, when compared with A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses. This reduction in effectiveness might result, in part, from the egg propagation of influenza A(H3N2) vaccine virus components required for most influenza vaccine products licensed in the United States. For example, egg adaptation of current A(H3N2) viruses typically results in a loss of N-linked glycosylation motif at residues 158–160 of the HA protein, which is within an important antibody epitope (site B). Other factors that might also contribute to the reduced effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses include the naturally occurring, high level of genetic diversity and rapid evolutionary rate of this particular subtype and modification of the immune response to vaccine because of prior infection or vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness studies are needed to ascertain the level of protection that influenza vaccination provides to the population, but these data will not be available until later in the season.

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, January 2015 [^116s3ySt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months. Each season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI) associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza. This season, early estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness are possible because of widespread, early circulation of influenza viruses. By January 3, 2015, 46 states were experiencing widespread flu activity, with predominance of influenza A (H3N2) viruses. This report presents an initial estimate of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness at preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI based on data from 2,321 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (Flu VE) during November 10, 2014-January 2, 2015. During this period, overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) (adjusted for study site, age, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and days from illness onset to enrollment) against laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended ARI was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8%-36%). Most influenza infections were due to A (H3N2) viruses. This interim VE estimate is relatively low compared with previous seasons when circulating viruses and vaccine viruses were well-matched and likely reflects the fact that more than two-thirds of circulating A (H3N2) viruses are antigenically and genetically different (drifted) from the A (H3N2) vaccine component of 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines. These early, low VE estimates underscore the need for ongoing influenza prevention and treatment measures. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination because the vaccine can still prevent some infections with the currently circulating A (H3N2) viruses as well as other viruses that might circulate later in the season, including influenza B viruses. Even when VE is reduced, vaccination still prevents some illness and serious influenza-related complications, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated, including persons who might already have been ill with influenza this season.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) – United States, 2014–15 influenza season [^116RZ5jo]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Groups Recommended for Vaccination and Timing of Vaccination

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Vaccination optimally should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. Health care providers should offer vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available (by October, if possible). Vaccination should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (see "Vaccine Dose Considerations for Children Aged 6 Months through 8 Years") should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available, and the second dose ≥ 4 weeks later. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations when vaccine is available.

Antibody levels induced by vaccine decline postvaccination. Although a 2008 literature review found no clear evidence of more rapid decline among the elderly, a 2010 study noted a statistically significant decline in titers 6 months postvaccination among persons aged ≥ 65 years (although titers still met European Medicines Agency levels considered adequate for protection). A case-control study conducted in Navarre, Spain, during the 2011–12 season revealed a decline in vaccine effectiveness primarily affecting persons aged ≥ 65 years. Although delaying vaccination might permit greater immunity later in the season, deferral might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate and difficulties in vaccinating a population within a limited time. Vaccination programs should balance maximizing likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after influenza virus circulation begins.

### Prevention of influenza during mismatched seasons in older adults with an MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine: a randomised, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 efficacy study [^117FxySQ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Background

The absolute degree of protection from influenza vaccines in older adults has not been studied since 2001. This study aimed to show the clinical efficacy of an MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV) in adults 65 years or older compared with adults not vaccinated to prevent influenza.

Methods

We did a randomised, stratified, observer-blind, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 study at 89 sites in 12 countries in 2016–17 northern hemisphere and 2017 southern hemisphere influenza seasons. We enrolled community-dwelling male and female adults aged 65 years and older who were healthy or had comorbidities that increased their risk of influenza complications. We stratified eligible participants by age (cohorts 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years) and risk of influenza complications (high and low) and randomly assigned them (1:1) via an interactive response technology to receive either aQIV or a non-influenza comparator vaccine. We masked participants and outcome assessors to the administered vaccine. Personnel administering the vaccines did not participate in endpoint assessment. The primary outcome was absolute vaccine efficacy assessed by RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to any influenza strain in the overall study population (full analysis set) from day 21 to 180 or the end of the influenza season. Vaccine efficacy was calculated on the basis of a Cox proportional hazard regression model for time to first occurrence of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to any strain of influenza. Safety outcomes were assessed in the overall study population. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02587221.

Findings

Northern hemisphere enrolment occurred between Sept 30, 2016, and Feb 28, 2017, and southern hemisphere enrolment between May 26, 2017, and 30 June 30, 2017. aQIV was administered to 3381 participants, who subsequently had 122 (3·6%) RT-PCR-confirmed influenza cases, and the comparator was administered to 3380 participants, who subsequently had 151 (4·5%) influenza cases. The majority, 214 (78·4%) of 273, were caused by influenza A H3N2. Most antigenically characterised isolates were mismatched to the vaccine strain (118 [85%] of 139). Vaccine efficacy was 19·8% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -5·3 to 38·9) against all influenza and 49·9% (-24·0 to 79·8) against antigenically matched strains, when the protocol definition of influenza-like illness was used. The most common local solicited adverse event was injection site pain, reported by 102 (16·3%) of 624 participants in the aQIV group and 71 (11·2%) of 632 of participants in the comparator group. Deaths were evenly distributed; none were considered related to study vaccines. The safety profile for aQIV was similar to previously reported trials.

Interpretation

The prespecified criterion for showing the efficacy of aQIV in older adults was not met during the influenza seasons with high amounts of vaccine strain mismatch. Vaccine efficacy was higher against influenza cases associated with higher fever, which represent more clinically significant disease.

### Intraseason waning of influenza vaccine effectiveness [^115DGi58]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, it is recommended that healthcare providers offer influenza vaccination by October, if possible. However, if the vaccine's effectiveness soon begins to wane, the optimal time for vaccination may be somewhat later. We examined whether the effectiveness of influenza vaccine wanes during the influenza season with increasing time since vaccination.

Methods

We identified persons who were vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine from 1 September 2010 to 31 March 2017 and who were subsequently tested for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by a polymerase chain reaction test. Test-confirmed influenza was the primary outcome and days-since-vaccination was the predictor of interest in conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for age and conditioned on calendar day and geographic area. RSV was used as a negative-control outcome.

Results

Compared with persons vaccinated 14 to 41 days prior to being tested, persons vaccinated 42 to 69 days prior to being tested had 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.55) times the odds of testing positive for any influenza. The odds ratio (OR) increased linearly by approximately 16% for each additional 28 days since vaccination. The OR was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.69 to 2.51) for persons vaccinated 154 or more days prior to being tested. No evidence of waning was found for RSV.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine wanes during the course of a single season. These results may lead to reconsideration of the optimal timing of seasonal influenza vaccination.

Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2021–22

Groups Recommended for Vaccination

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow.

Timing of Vaccination

Balancing considerations regarding the unpredictability of timing of onset of the influenza season and concerns that vaccine-induced immunity might wane over the course of a season, particularly for older adults, vaccination is recommended to be offered by the end of October. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (i.e. children in this age group who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of ≥ 2 doses; see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. Children of any age who require only 1 dose for the season should also ideally be vaccinated by the end of October; vaccination of these children may occur as soon as vaccine is available because there is less evidence to suggest that early vaccination is associated with waning immunity among children compared with adults. Vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available may also be considered for pregnant women during the third trimester because vaccination of pregnant women reduces risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months of life (a period during which they are too young to receive influenza vaccine). For nonpregnant adults, influenza vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Early vaccination might be associated with decreased vaccine effectiveness before the end of the influenza season, particularly among older adults. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations. No recommendation is made for revaccination (i.e. providing a booster dose) later in the season of persons who have already been fully vaccinated for the season, regardless of when the current season vaccine was received.

### Late influenza vaccination is associated with reduced effectiveness [^116xt7BM]. Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Extensive research has been carried out to quantify the efficacy and immunologic responses to influenza immunization, however, only little was reported on whether the timing of vaccine administration affects its effectiveness. The study aims were to compare post-immunization hospitalization and mortality rates among high-risk patients who were vaccinated against influenza in different periods of autumn.

Methods

Data for the current population-based historical prospective study were obtained from a large health organization in Israel insuring 1,600,000 members. Study population (n = 68,166) included high-risk patients aged 55 and above, who were immunized against influenza between October and November 2003.

Results

Although at baseline, individuals vaccinated in late November (12–25/11/2003) were significantly younger and had lower burden of illness compared to those vaccinated in early October (1–13/10/2003), they had higher hospitalization rates and longer hospital stay during the following winter (December to March). They also had an increased risk for all-cause mortality (RR = 1.78; 95%CI: 1.13–2.80). No such differences were observed during the following summer (April-August).

Conclusions

In countries where influenza generally peaks between December and early March, vaccines administered after mid-November might be less beneficial.

### Influenza vaccines in adults [^112g1MNQ]. Occupational Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Available influenza vaccines contain inactivated viruses, either whole or in parts, and are administered parenterally or intranasally. Their composition varies yearly because of viral antigenic shifts and drifts. Vaccines with a composition matching yearly World Health Organization recommendations are 72% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 54–83%] efficacious (prevention of influenza cases caused by influenza viruses A and B). Their effectiveness [capacity to prevent clinical influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI)] is lower, at 37% (95% CI = 18–52%). A decision to vaccinate an adult population has to take into account the efficacy of the vaccines and their effectiveness (the likely proportion of ILI caused by influenza A and B viruses, amenable to prevention by vaccination), as well as costs and likely compliance. As the yearly levels of circulating A and B viruses are difficult to predict during the decision time for a vaccination campaign, there is a considerable element of uncertainty regarding the likely effectiveness of 'this year's' vaccine.

### Timing of seasonal influenza epidemics for 25 countries in Africa during 2010–19: a retrospective analysis [^116sgBLr]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The northern hemisphere versus southern hemisphere geographical paradigm for classification of predominance of influenza activity is imperfect, as it is largely defined by influenza trends in countries with temperate climates but might be less applicable to other climates. Our analysis showed that the standard northern hemisphere or southern hemisphere dichotomy might not describe influenza activity well in tropical and subtropical countries, not even in those with single annual epidemics. For instance, we identified that the Central African Republic generally had a distinct single epidemic each year from July to November, which starts in the middle of the southern hemisphere epidemic period and ends well into the start of the northern hemisphere epidemic period. In addition, Tanzania and Mozambique are geographically in the southern hemisphere, yet their influenza surveillance data suggest some epidemic activity in the northern hemisphere months.

These findings have important implications for recommendations about which hemisphere vaccine formulation countries should purchase. Our findings suggest that countries could benefit from using dominant seasonal influenza patterns, ascertained through yearly surveillance data, to guide the choice of southern hemisphere versus northern hemisphere vaccine, rather than choosing on the basis of their geographical location or proximity to another country with a clearly defined season. Although it might be logistically and financially challenging, countries with multiple epidemics in a year could choose to use both northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations, or to use the most recent vaccine formulation recommended at any time of the year. For example, in our analysis, Kenya had two distinct peaks of increased influenza activity and could invest in vaccine purchases on the basis of the dominant epidemic, rather than secondary waves, to maximise the effect of vaccine campaigns. In some tropical countries, however, the season started before the availability of the recommended vaccine formulation, making it difficult for countries to use that formulation to protect their populations against influenza in the weeks before the start of the influenza season. The growing ability to rely on surveillance data rather than geography to guide vaccine formulation decisions underscores the importance of strengthened year-round sentinel surveillance to generate evidence-based classifications of epidemic patterns.

### Waning of influenza vaccine protection: exploring the trade-offs of changes in vaccination timing among older adults [^113kotuv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), lower effectiveness with increasing time since vaccination was observed, raising the question of optimal vaccination timing. We sought to evaluate the estimated number of influenza-associated hospitalizations among older adults due to potential changes in vaccination timing.

Methods

Using empirical data and a health state transition model, we estimated change in influenza-associated hospitalizations predicted to occur among the US population aged ≥ 65 years if vaccination were delayed until October 1. We assumed the vaccination timing, coverage, and effectiveness observed in 2012–2013 as a prototypical influenza season, approximately 7% monthly waning of VE, and that between 0% and 50% of individuals who usually get vaccinated earlier than October failed to get vaccinated. We also assessed change in influenza-associated hospitalizations if vaccination uptake shifted substantially toward August and September.

Results

In a typical season, delaying vaccination until October increased influenza hospitalizations if more than 14% of older adults usually vaccinated in August and September failed to get vaccinated. The consequences of delayed vaccination depended heavily on influenza season timing, rate of waning, and overall VE. A shift toward vaccination in August and September led to, on average, an increase in influenza-associated hospitalizations, but this result was also sensitive to influenza season timing.

Conclusions

Consequences of delayed vaccination varied widely. Uncertainties about vaccine waning and effects of a delay on vaccine coverage suggest it is premature to change current vaccine recommendations, although it may be prudent to prevent a substantial shift toward early vaccination.

### Influenza activity-United States, 2014–15 season and composition of the 2015–16 influenza vaccine [^114az5x1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During the 2014–15 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity increased through late November and December before peaking in late December. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated, and the prevalence of influenza B viruses increased late in the season. This influenza season, similar to previous influenza A (H3N2)-predominant seasons, was moderately severe with overall high levels of outpatient illness and influenza-associated hospitalization, especially for adults aged ≥ 65 years. The majority of circulating influenza A (H3N2) viruses were different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere seasonal vaccines, and the predominance of these drifted viruses resulted in reduced vaccine effectiveness. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2014–15 influenza season (September 28, 2014-May 23, 2015) and reports the recommendations for the components of the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, January 2015 [^113DStt4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The early onset of the 2014–15 influenza season offered an opportunity to provide an early VE estimate. Overall, the estimate suggests that the 2014–15 influenza vaccine has low effectiveness against circulating influenza A (H3N2) viruses. These early findings are consistent with laboratory data demonstrating that most influenza A (H3N2) viruses circulating in the community are antigenically and genetically different from A/Texas/50/2012, the A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. The predominant A (H3N2) viruses detected through surveillance during the 2014–15 season have been similar to the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus, the H3N2 virus selected for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. CDC will continue to closely monitor vaccine effectiveness this season, and these estimates might be updated as more data become available. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination even when there are drifted viruses circulating because the vaccine can still prevent some infections with the circulating A (H3N2) viruses and might also prevent serious complications requiring hospitalization. Also, vaccine might protect against other influenza viruses that can circulate later. As of early November, 2014, fewer than half of U.S. residents had reported receiving influenza vaccine this season. † Influenza vaccination, even when effectiveness is reduced, can prevent thousands of hospitalizations.

The severity and timing of influenza activity during the 2014–15 season has so far been similar to the moderately severe 2012–13 season, the last season when influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Rates of influenza-associated hospitalization so far this season are similar to rates during 2012–13, with highest hospitalization rates among persons aged ≥ 65 years. CDC surveillance through January 3, 2015, shows that the percentage of patient visits to doctors for influenza-like-illness (ILI) this season was almost the same as at the peak of the 2012–13 season. For the past 13 seasons, influenza seasons have ranged in duration, with an average of 13 weeks of increased ILI activity. This season, as of the week ending January 3, 2015, influenza activity has been elevated for 7 consecutive weeks, suggesting that the current influenza season might continue for several weeks. Influenza activity might continue to increase, especially in parts of the country that have seen more recent increases in activity and parts of the country that have yet to experience significant influenza activity.

### Interim effectiveness estimates of 2024 Southern hemisphere influenza vaccines in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization-REVELAC-I network, five south American countries, March-July 2024 [^114Tfws3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Influenza epidemics typically occur during the cool weather months of April–September in the Southern Hemisphere and October–May in the Northern Hemisphere. Every year, it is estimated that influenza results in 716,000–829,000 hospitalizations and 41,007–71,710 deaths throughout the Americas. To prevent influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, most countries in the Americas have implemented influenza vaccination programs. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean - influenza (Red para la Evaluación de Vacunas en Latino América y el Caribe - influenza [REVELAC-i]) † provides timely information about the vaccination status of hospitalized influenza patients and vaccine effectiveness (VE), which guides public health messaging and influenza vaccine composition decisions for each Southern Hemisphere season. Southern Hemisphere VE estimates also herald what Northern Hemisphere jurisdictions might anticipate about VE if the same influenza viruses circulate during their upcoming influenza season.

### Influenza epidemics in the United States, France, and Australia, 1972–1997 [^115jBHqG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Our study nevertheless strongly suggests that influenza epidemics are correlated in amplitude and synchronized in timing in the Northern Hemisphere, and collection and analysis of additional data is underway in other countries of Europe and North America. Prevaccination measles epidemics in different locales of the United States and the United Kingdom were also highly correlated in time and space, a situation that evolved to the observed absence of correlation in the last 2 decades after the level of vaccination increased from 50% to 90%. This lack of correlation is reportedly promoting persistence of the disease. Space and time correlations of influenza epidemics may follow the same pattern as vaccine coverage increases. How the very high rate of antigenic evolution of influenza virus, a feature not found in measles, could impact on this change requires further study, all the more as antigenic variations explain partly the impact of the disease (,–). The current plan to control influenza advocated by the World Health Organization promotes vaccine use and, in case of emergence of a pandemic virus, extensive use of antiviral drugs and vaccine, assuming that the vaccine could be produced in a timely fashion. The impact of an expected loss of correlations in influenza epidemics resulting from increased vaccine use should be further investigated, especially by mathematical modeling.

In conclusion, two factors have been reported to drive the space and time correlations of epidemics: population movements and environmental issues, such as climate or weather conditions. Population movements are assumed to play a key role, though not quantified, in the global spread of influenza epidemics, but the role of environmental factors and virus circulation between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres remains to be clarified. Large-scale molecular epidemiologic studies of influenza viruses, sampled from locations in different hemispheres, that investigate the circulation pathways could assist in the understanding of the reasons for the seasonality of the disease. Such large-scale studies seem feasible in light of the recent plan for a global sentinel laboratory that could centralize genotype and archive samples collected worldwide.

### Update: influenza activity – United States, October 4, 2015-February 6, 2016 [^114d1jiA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

From October through mid-December 2015, influenza activity remained low in most regions of the United States. Activity began to increase in late December 2015 and continued to increase slowly through early February 2016. Influenza A viruses have been most frequently identified, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominating during October until early December, and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating from mid-December until early February. Most of the influenza viruses characterized during that time are antigenically similar to vaccine virus strains recommended for inclusion in the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 4, 2015-February 6, 2016, and updates the previous summary (1).

### Modeling the impact of early vaccination in an influenza pandemic in the United States [^111E2MNC]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

We modeled the impact of initiating one-dose influenza vaccination at 3 months vs 6 months after declaration of a pandemic over a 1-year timeframe in the US population. Three vaccine effectiveness (VE) and two pandemic severity levels were considered, using an epidemic curve based on typical seasonal influenza epidemics. Vaccination from 3 months with a high, moderate, or low effectiveness vaccine would prevent ~95%, 84%, or 38% deaths post-vaccination, respectively, compared with 21%, 18%, and 8%, respectively following vaccination at 6 months, irrespective of pandemic severity. While the pandemic curve would not be flattened from vaccination from 6 months, a moderate/high effectiveness vaccine could flatten the curve if administered from 3 months. Overall, speed of initiating a vaccination campaign is more important than VE in reducing the health impacts of an influenza pandemic. Preparedness strategies may be able to minimize future pandemic impacts by prioritizing rapid vaccine roll-out.

### Interim effectiveness estimates of 2024 Southern hemisphere influenza vaccines in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization-REVELAC-I network, five south American countries, March-July 2024 [^111xCqi2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, small interim-estimate sample sizes precluded the estimation of VE against influenza B. Second, although the analyses were robust, 63% of patients were excluded because they did not receive RT-PCR results in time for the interim analysis. Third, Brazil, which is approximately three times as populous as the other countries combined, ** accounted for approximately 80% of the study population and included a higher percentage of SARI patients in the young children target group compared with that in other countries. Overall analyses were adjusted for country and target group but might still be more representative of Brazil's VE estimate. Fourth, this analysis does not distinguish between young children who received 1 or 2 vaccine doses; VE might be higher among young children who received 2 influenza vaccine doses. Finally, these results might not be generalizable to other target groups or to countries with different viral circulation and vaccination strategies.

Implications for Public Health Practice

Interim VE estimates from the REVELAC-i Network suggest that influenza vaccines are effective in preventing approximately one third of influenza-related hospitalizations among groups prioritized for vaccination. Although Southern Hemisphere influenza VE is not necessarily predictive of Northern Hemisphere VE, it can help the Northern Hemisphere plan contingencies for vaccination demand and use. These data suggest that influenza vaccine demand was still low post–COVID-19 but that vaccination prevented approximately one third of influenza-associated hospitalizations among groups at high risk for influenza-associated complications. These findings support CDC and WHO's recommendation that all eligible persons aged ≥ 6 months should receive influenza vaccination. If similar influenza viruses continue to predominate during Northern Hemisphere influenza season and the updated A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)–like antigen provides similar protection against circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses, health authorities might anticipate similar levels of protection. Nonpharmaceutical measures, such as hand washing and mask use, and early antiviral treatment can complement vaccination for stronger protection against influenza illness and its complications.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1-November 25, 2017 [^115bYWpE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Influenza activity in the United States was low during October 2017, but has been increasing since the beginning of November. Influenza A viruses have been most commonly identified, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Several influenza activity indicators were higher than is typically seen for this time of year. The majority of influenza viruses characterized during this period were genetically or antigenically similar to the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere cell-grown vaccine reference viruses. These data indicate that currently circulating viruses have not undergone significant antigenic drift; however, circulating A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically less similar to egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses used for producing the majority of influenza vaccines in the United States. It is difficult to predict which influenza viruses will predominate in the 2017–18 influenza season; however, in recent past seasons in which A(H3N2) viruses predominated, hospitalizations and deaths were more common, and the effectiveness of the vaccine was lower. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Multiple influenza vaccines are approved and recommended for use during the 2017–18 season, and vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 1-November 25, 2017 (surveillance weeks 40–47). †.

### Influenza epidemics in the United States, France, and Australia, 1972–1997 [^1118LtoM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Demography may contribute to the lack of correlation and synchrony between Australia and the United States or between Australia and France. While the age structures of the populations in the three countries are similar, the population sizes are different. Discrepancies in the levels of vaccination might also play a role. However, the number of doses of influenza vaccine distributed was similar in France and the United States from 1980 until the early 1990s but doubled in recent years in the United States. The level of vaccination in Australia was about half of that of France and the United States from 1980 until 1990 when it was similar to that of France in 1997. Therefore, no obvious link existed between trends in vaccination and our results.

An important limitation in the analysis of correlation and synchrony between countries in different hemispheres lies in the arbitrary choice for pairing epidemics. We investigated two extreme scenarios in which influenza epidemics in Australia were systematically 6 months ahead of those in France or the United States or systematically 6 months behind. We found no correlation or synchrony in either one. We cannot rule out a more complex interhemispheric pathway with recurrent changes in the leading hemisphere. We searched for an optimal theoretical pairing, allowing each epidemic in Australia in our simulations to pair with either the preceding or following epidemic in the United States (or France) to maximize the correlation in excess death. For optimal pairing, the correlation coefficients obtained were in the same order of magnitude as those observed between France and the United States (Spearman's ρ = 0.66 for the United States and Australia and Spearman's ρ = 0.71 for Australia and France).

Few reports document the circulation of influenza virus on a worldwide scale. Hope-Simpson studies of death, disease, and virologic datasets suggest that the circulation of influenza strains (and the epidemics they cause) may follow a given pathway during several years (e.g. Southern to Northern Hemisphere) and subsequently shift to the other pathway (e.g. Northern to Southern Hemisphere). This finding agrees with the absence of significant time and space correlations found in this work between countries in different hemispheres when epidemics were paired 6 months ahead or behind. If this absence of correlation between the two hemispheres, observed in death records limited to an interpandemic period and a limited set of countries, held true in the case of a pandemic, information on previous routes of transmission derived from historical epidemics could prove of little use for planning the route of future epidemics or pandemics on a worldwide scale.

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^115CLQ3g]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Influenza vaccines — clinical interpretation for adults with cancer — state that influenza vaccines improve infection-related outcomes and are recommended annually, ideally to be received by early fall in the Northern Hemisphere; patients aged 65 years and older should receive one of the preferentially recommended high-dose or adjuvanted vaccine formulations (high-dose Quadrivalent vaccine, Quadrivalent recombinant flu vaccine, and Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine); in the general adult population 50–64 years of age a recent study shows modest relative vaccine effectiveness of the high-dose recombinant vaccine compared to standard-dose (15.3% [95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8]) without significant differences in hospitalizations and deaths; the COVID-19 vaccine can be coadministered with cytotoxic chemotherapy or during the cytopenic period; and the live attenuated influenza vaccine, given as a nasal spray and approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2–49 years of age, should not be administered to patients with cancer.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2018–19 influenza season [^1173WBie]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Updates and changes to the recommendations described in this report are of four types: 1) the vaccine virus composition for 2018–19 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) a recommendation for the 2018–19 season that LAIV4 is an option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is appropriate; 3) a recommendation that persons with a history of egg allergy may receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4; and 4) recent regulatory actions, including new vaccine licensures and labeling changes for previously licensed vaccines. Information relevant to these changes included the following:

Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, generally in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. A summary of the WHO meeting for selection of the 2018–19 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition for influenza vaccines licensed and marketed in the United States. A summary of the FDA VRBPAC meeting of March 1, 2018, at which the composition of the 2018–19 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, is available at.
Regarding the recommendation for the 2018–19 season that LAIV4 is an option for influenza vaccination of those for whom it is appropriate, ACIP reviewed data from three sources in February 2018. Two were evaluations of previous seasons' data concerning LAIV effectiveness among children aged 2 through 17 years, including 1) a combined individual-patient-level analysis of data from five U.S. observational studies of LAIV effectiveness for the 2013–14 through 2015–16 seasons, and 2) a systematic review and meta-analysis of U.S. and non-U.S. observational studies of LAIV effectiveness for the 2010–11 through 2016–17 seasons (for which further details are available in the Appendix to the Background Document). These observational data indicated that LAIV was poorly effective against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses, and was significantly less effective than IIV against these viruses. However, LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses, and effectiveness of LAIV and IIV against influenza A(H3N2) viruses generally did not differ significantly. No estimates of the effectiveness of the current formulation of LAIV4, which contains a new H1N1pdm09-like vaccine virus, were available at the time of this review. The third source was manufacturer data concerning shedding and immunogenicity associated with administration of LAIV containing the new H1N1pdm09-like vaccine virus, A/Slovenia/2903/2015, among children aged 24 months through < 4 years. These data suggest that this new H1N1pdm09-like virus has improved replicative fitness over previous H1N1pdm09-like viruses included in LAIV.
Regarding recommendations for persons with a history of egg allergy, persons with egg allergy of any severity were previously recommended to receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine. Use of LAIV4 for persons with egg allergy of any severity was approved by ACIP in February 2016, prior to the recommendations made for the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons that LAIV4 not be used in any population because of effectiveness concerns. In discussing LAIV4 for egg-allergic persons in February 2016, ACIP heard data from three studies which evaluated the use of LAIV in egg-allergic children, in which no cases of anaphylaxis occurred.
With regard to recommendations for newly licensed influenza vaccines and changes to the licensed indications for existing vaccines, ACIP relies on FDA for review of safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness data pertaining to the licensure of influenza vaccines. Regulatory information pertinent to the labeling change for Afluria Quadrivalent (IIV4) is available at. Regulatory information pertinent to the labeling change for Fluarix Quadrivalent (IIV4) is available at.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^111PVuj8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Timing of Vaccination

For most persons who require only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the influenza season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available.

Vaccination during July and August is not recommended for most groups because of potential waning of vaccine-induced immunity during the influenza season, particularly among older adults. However, vaccination during July or August may be considered for any recipient if there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Considerations for timing of vaccination follow.

Most adults (particularly those aged ≥ 65 years) and pregnant women in the first or second trimester. Vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible.
Children who require 2 influenza vaccine doses. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who did not receive ≥ 2 trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine doses before July 1, 2025, or whose influenza vaccination history is unknown, require 2 doses of influenza vaccine for the season. These children should receive their first dose as early as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to permit receipt of the second dose (which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later), ideally by the end of October.
Children who require only 1 influenza vaccine dose. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. Although waning of immunity after vaccination during the season has been observed among all age groups, fewer studies report this specifically among children. Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for a medical examination before the start of school, which represents a vaccination opportunity.
Pregnant women in the third trimester. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during these months because vaccination has been associated in multiple studies with reduced risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine. For pregnant women in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting until September or October to vaccinate is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible.

### Update: influenza activity in the United States during the 2017–18 season and composition of the 2018–19 influenza vaccine [^113snZG3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The timing of the peaks for certain influenza surveillance indicators this season was unusual. Influenza activity in children typically precedes that in adults, and peak ILI and laboratory positivity percentages precede the peak in hospitalizations, followed by the mortality peak. In this season, influenza-associated hospitalizations and mortality peaked earlier than the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories and the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI. Influenza activity peaked among older adults earlier than among children and young adults; this also occurred, to a lesser extent, during the 2016–17 season.

Previous influenza A(H3N2)-predominant seasons have also been associated with increased hospitalizations and deaths; however, the 2017–18 season followed an A(H3N2)-predominant season, and all severity indicators were higher than during the 2016–17 season. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses were genetically characterized as 3C.2a clade, similar, but genetically distinct from the 3C.2a1 subclade that predominated during the 2016–17 season, and from the viruses that circulated during Australia's 2017 influenza season. Outside the United States and Canada, A(H3N2) viruses did not predominate in other Northern hemisphere temperate countries. Further studies are needed to understand the virologic, host, or environmental factors responsible for this high severity season.

The severity of this influenza season highlights the importance of public health measures to control and prevent influenza. Annual influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Although influenza activity in the United States is typically low during the summer, influenza cases and outbreaks can occur, and clinicians should consider influenza in the differential diagnosis of respiratory illnesses at any time of year. CDC recommends prompt treatment with influenza antiviral medications for persons with confirmed or suspected influenza who are severely ill or at high risk for serious influenza complications. Health care providers should consider novel influenza virus infections in persons with ILI and swine or poultry exposure, or with severe acute respiratory infection after travel to areas where avian influenza viruses have been detected. Providers should alert the local public health department if novel influenza virus infection is suspected. Clinical laboratories using a commercially available influenza diagnostic assay that includes influenza A virus subtype determination should contact their state public health laboratory to facilitate transport and additional testing of any unsubtypeable influenza A–positive specimen. Public health laboratories should immediately send unsubtypeable influenza A viruses to CDC, because early identification and investigation are critical to ensuring timely risk assessment and implementation of appropriate public health measures.

### Update: influenza activity in the United States during the 2016–17 season and composition of the 2017–18 influenza vaccine [^1132qxKL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Composition of the 2017–18 Influenza Vaccine

The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) has recommended that the 2017–18 influenza trivalent vaccine to be used in the United States contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines, which have two influenza B viruses, contain the viruses recommended for the trivalent vaccines, as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. This represents an update in the influenza A(H1N1) component compared with the composition of the 2016–17 influenza vaccines. The recommended Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 vaccine viruses are the same as the vaccine viruses recommended for inclusion in the 2017 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. These vaccine recommendations were based on a number of factors, including global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic and antigenic characterization, human serology studies, antiviral susceptibility, and the availability of candidate influenza viruses.

### Public health-driven research and innovation for next-generation influenza vaccines, European union [^114ct4X1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite existing for 80 years, influenza vaccines have substantial shortcomings related to their availability and effectiveness. The reasons include their production from embryonated eggs and a lengthy manufacturing process. Another challenge is in the efficacy of the vaccines themselves, which is related to the immune response they elicit, in particular the waning of vaccine-specific antibodies, as well as the antigenic drift and the unpredictability of annual vaccine strain selection and the lack of accurate correlates of protection for influenza vaccines. The fact that current seasonal influenza vaccines fail to protect against drifted seasonal influenza viruses or novel pandemic viruses is a major issue. During recent influenza seasons, overall vaccine effectiveness has been as low as 19% (in 2014–15 in the Northern Hemisphere). Moreover, effectiveness of influenza vaccines is particularly low in the elderly, a group that is most susceptible to the disease and its complications. Aging is associated with the progressive deterioration of the immune system, referred to as immunosenescence, and with a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state, inflammaging. These 2 interrelated phenomena are an important cause of low influenza vaccine effectiveness in this age group. In addition, uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine in risk groups in the WHO European Region is low and even declining in several EU countries.

Although the idea seems counterintuitive, recent studies point to a so-called pandemic paradox, finding that previous exposure to influenza virus strains can enhance susceptibility during pandemics. The occurrence of vaccine-associated antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection is of concern and has implications for the design of multiple boost vaccination schedules from a clinical perspective.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) also face particular challenges with influenza. These countries often have restricted funding for vaccine provision and low or absent regional vaccine manufacturing capacity, which means they often have limited capacity to stockpile influenza vaccines or to respond adequately to seasonal or pandemic influenza. Surveillance data on the influenza burden in LMICs are limited, but a recent report suggested that seasonal influenza was associated with 28,000–111,500 deaths globally from acute lower respiratory infections in children < 5 years of age and that 99% of these deaths occurred in LMICs. This stark imbalance highlights the need to improve influenza vaccination in a way that will benefit those who suffer the greatest burden. To address this situation, WHO, within the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, has reached agreements with vaccine manufacturers for pledges of over 400 million doses of pandemic vaccine in real time during the next pandemic.

### Estimating influenza illnesses averted by year-round and seasonal campaign vaccination for young children, Kenya [^112LXAcu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaccination Strategies Modeled

We modeled 2 distinct vaccination strategies: seasonal campaigns, as traditionally used in countries with a Southern or Northern Hemisphere influenza season, and year-round vaccination, as has been proposed for countries with no clear influenza season. Although the 2019–2021 demonstration project included campaigns starting in June and July, we modeled 2 variations of the seasonal campaign with starting months of April (corresponding to the usual timing of Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine availability) and October (corresponding to Northern Hemisphere vaccine availability) (Figure). We assumed each vaccination campaign would last 4 months, as in the demonstration project. For year-round vaccination, we similarly modeled initial introduction of the vaccine in both April and October for comparability across the 24-month analysis timeframe. As a sensitivity analysis, we included 2 additional start times for the seasonal campaign: June (halfway between Southern and Northern Hemisphere vaccine availability) and January (halfway between Northern and Southern Hemisphere vaccine availability).

### Estimated effectiveness of coadministration of the BNT162b2 BA.4 / 5 COVID-19 vaccine with influenza vaccine [^111888hr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Although SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate year-round, in the Northern Hemisphere it has generally followed a seasonal pattern similar to other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, where activity peaks during winter. Based on this trend and accumulating evidence showing that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines wanes over time and as new variants emerge, and better-matched Omicron-adapted vaccines improve protection, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved a monovalent COVID-19 vaccine targeting Omicron XBB sublineages to be used as a booster before the 2023–2024 winter respiratory infection season. While some high-risk individuals may receive boosters more frequently, it is anticipated that COVID-19 vaccines will likely be administered annually alongside seasonal influenza vaccines (SIVs) each autumn or winter for the foreseeable future.

During the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 influenza seasons, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended COVID-19 and influenza vaccines be administered 14 or more days apart, given that no data describing the safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy of coadministering these vaccines were available at the time. Subsequently, data from clinical trials, and community settings, emerged showing the 2 vaccines could be safely coadministered. Based on these emerging safety data and evidence that coadministration improves uptake, the CDC revised COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to allow coadministration with SIVs for the 2022–2023 season.

In addition to safety data, several clinical studies have shown comparable immune responses when COVID-19 vaccines are coadministered with SIV compared with administering the vaccines separately. To our knowledge, however, there are no data evaluating the effectiveness of coadministering these 2 vaccines in the community setting. Thus, we compared the effectiveness associated with coadministering the BNT162b2 BA.4/5 bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2-biv [Pfizer-BioNTech]) with SIV vs the effectiveness associated with giving the 2 vaccines separately among US adults aged 18 years or older enrolled in large nationwide health plans.

### Update: influenza activity in the United States during the 2018–19 season and composition of the 2019–20 influenza vaccine [^115RS8VG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Composition of the 2019–20 Influenza Vaccines

Vaccine recommendations were made based on factors including data from global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, and the candidate vaccine viruses that are available for production. WHO recommended the Northern Hemisphere 2019–20 influenza vaccine composition, and the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee subsequently made the influenza vaccine composition recommendation for the United States. Both agencies recommend that influenza trivalent vaccines contain an A/Brisbane/02/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Kansas/14/2017 A(H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. The quadrivalent vaccine recommendation included the trivalent vaccine viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. The A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) recommendations are an update to the 2018–19 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The decision to update the A(H1N1)pdm09 component was made because of genetic and antigenic characterization data using individual postvaccination human sera, which demonstrated significantly reduced titers (eightfold or greater) to recent 6B.1A viruses, compared with the titers against the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine virus. The decision to update the A(H3N2) component was made to address antigenic drift of the virus with emergence and spread of A/Kansas/14/2017-like viruses (3C.3a).

### Update: influenza activity – United States and worldwide, may-September 2001 [^1146x333]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2001). Low credibility.

During October 2000-May 2001, influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B viruses were identified in the Northern Hemisphere. Influenza A (H1N1) and B viruses circulated widely; influenza A (H3N2) viruses were reported infrequently and were not associated with widespread outbreaks in any country during October 2000-May 2001. Since May 2001, influenza A (H1N1) and B viruses have predominated in Asia and Oceania; influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses have predominated in Africa and South America. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States* (1) and worldwide during May-September 25; influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B viruses continued to circulate worldwide and were associated with mild to moderate levels of activity. This activity underscores the need to follow the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (2,3) for the timely vaccination of persons at high risk for influenza-related complications.

We investigated influenza seasonality in northern India and found influenza positivity peaked in Srinagar (34.09°N) in January-March but peaked in New Delhi (28.66°N) in July-September. Srinagar should consider influenza vaccination in October-November, but New Delhi should vaccinate in May-June.

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness – United States, January 2013 [^111DNJie]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months. An overall moderate effectiveness for influenza vaccines of approximately 60% has been estimated from a summary of randomized clinical trials. Influenza vaccination, even with moderate effectiveness, can reduce illness, antibiotic use, doctor visits, time lost from work, hospitalizations, and deaths.

What is added by this report?

Based on data from 1,155 children and adults with acute respiratory illness enrolled during December 3, 2012–January 2, 2013, at five study sites with outpatient medical facilities in the United States, the overall estimated effectiveness of the 2012–13 seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 62%.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Interim VE estimates indicate the 2012–13 influenza vaccine has moderate effectiveness against circulating influenza viruses, similar to a summary estimate from randomized clinical trials. Vaccination efforts should continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Any persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not received vaccination this season should be vaccinated. However, some vaccinated persons will become infected with influenza. Therefore, antiviral medication should be used as recommended for treatment in patients regardless of their vaccination status.

These early estimates indicate that some vaccinated persons will become infected with influenza, despite having been vaccinated. Therefore, antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients regardless of their vaccination status. Antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of illness and complications associated with influenza. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for persons with suspected influenza with severe or progressive illness (e.g. hospitalized persons) and those at high risk for complications from influenza, no matter how severe the illness. Antiviral treatment should be started as early as possible, preferably within 48 hours after illness onset. Among hospitalized patients, however, treatment should be initiated on admission; several studies suggest that antiviral treatment reduces mortality and illness severity among hospitalized adults, even when initiated ≥ 48 hours after illness onset. The decision to initiate antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza and should not be dependent on insensitive assays, such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^116w9Ek6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antiviral chemoprophylaxis — indications and timing — should be guided as follows: the choice of an antiviral drug for treatment or chemoprophylaxis should be based on the approved and recommended ages, route of administration, whether contraindications exist for the use of a particular product, and knowledge of antiviral resistance patterns. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts of high-risk persons while awaiting an immune response to influenza vaccination, it should be continued for 2 weeks after vaccination until an immune response is expected (6 weeks for children aged 6 months to < 9 years not previously vaccinated and who require 2 doses). Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should not be given for 2 weeks after administration of live attenuated influenza virus vaccine. If postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis is administered, it should be given within 48 hours of exposure to a person with influenza.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024–25 influenza season [^115EYtd8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August; however, vaccination during July and August is not recommended for most groups because of potential waning of immunity over the course of the influenza season, particularly among older adults. However, vaccination during July or August can be considered for any recipient for whom there is concern that they will not be vaccinated at a later date. Considerations for timing of vaccination include the following:

For most adults (particularly adults aged ≥ 65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester: Vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible.
Children who require 2 doses: Certain children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine for the season (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). These children should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. FIGURE Influenza vaccine dosing algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years* — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2024–25 influenza season. * Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. For children aged 8 years who require 2 doses of vaccine, both doses should be administered even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2.
Children who require only 1 dose: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. Although waning of immunity after vaccination over the course of the season has been observed among all age groups, there are fewer published studies reporting results specifically among children. Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for medical examinations before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity.
Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester during these months because vaccination has been associated in multiple studies with reduced risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine. For pregnant persons in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible.

### Frequent genetic mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating seasonal influenza viruses, hong kong, China, 1996–2012 [^112MHux7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Strain Drifting between Winter and Summer Seasons

Influenza A(H3N2)

In 7 of the 17 years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011), the predominant H3N2 virus strain in summer differed from that in the preceding winter. We further examined whether administration of an additional Southern Hemisphere vaccine at the beginning of summer (around May) could achieve better vaccine matching. In 5 of the 7 years, content of newly available Southern Hemisphere vaccines was identical to the preceding Northern Hemisphere vaccine composition. In 2004 and 2005, although another strain was chosen for the Southern Hemisphere vaccine, the new vaccine strain was not closely matched with circulating viruses at that time. These results suggested that additional administration of Southern Hemisphere vaccines at the beginning of summer would not have improved the immunity against the circulating H3N2 strains.

Influenza B

In 6 of the 17 years (2000, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2011), a drift occurred in the predominant influenza B variant from winter to summer seasons. Similarly, we examined the value of an additional Southern Hemisphere vaccine administered at the beginning of summer and again found no benefit. In 5 of the 6 drift years, the newly recommended Southern Hemisphere vaccine composition was identical to the previous Northern Hemisphere vaccine. In 2008, although the Southern Hemisphere vaccine contained a new virus (Yamagata, B/Florida/4/2006) that closely matched the circulating viruses detected in the first half (winter season) of the same year, the circulating strain was soon replaced by another influenza B variant not covered in the recommended Southern Hemisphere vaccine.

### Update: influenza activity in the United States during the 2017–18 season and composition of the 2018–19 influenza vaccine [^114XTFHr]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Composition of the 2018–19 Influenza Vaccine

The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee recommended that the 2018–19 trivalent vaccine to be used in the United States contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 A(H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. The quadrivalent vaccine recommendation included the trivalent vaccine viruses as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. The B component recommendation represents a change in the influenza B/Victoria lineage component recommended for the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere and 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. The B component change was made because of the increasing global circulation of an antigenically drifted B/Victoria lineage virus (V1A.1). The A(H3N2) recommendation represents an update to the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere vaccines but is the same A(H3N2) virus recommended for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere vaccine. The decision to update the A(H3N2) component was not made to address antigenic drift, but rather because the egg-propagated A/Singapore vaccine virus is antigenically more similar to circulating viruses than the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong vaccine virus recommended for the Northern Hemisphere 2017–2018 vaccine. Vaccine recommendations were based on factors including global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, and the candidate vaccine viruses that are available for production.

### Update: influenza activity-United States and worldwide, may 21-September 23, 2017 [^116uGNkU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Composition of the 2018 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine

The WHO recommendations for influenza vaccine composition for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere season were made at the WHO Vaccine Consultation meeting September 25–28, 2017, in Melbourne, Australia. The recommended components for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza trivalent vaccines are an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. For quadrivalent vaccines, an additional component, B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus, is recommended. This represents a change in the influenza A(H3N2) component and a change in the influenza B lineage included in the trivalent vaccine compared with the composition of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation. The H3N2 component was updated to address the egg-adaptive changes that occurred with the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 reference virus and to better represent genetic changes seen in recently circulating H3N2 viruses.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^113KjAD8]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Influenza vaccination — Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals ≥ 6 months of age, and individuals who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy should be immunized. The optimal interval for immunization spans the months of October and November because the flu season occurs from January through March. Injectable inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) quadrivalent and trivalent may be administered at any time during pregnancy, whereas intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines should not be administered during pregnancy and pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after intranasal vaccination. Concerns about thimerosal are not supported by evidence, and the influenza vaccine can be given to pregnant individuals whether they contain thimerosal or not.

### Maternal immunisation with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for prevention of influenza in infants in Mali: a prospective, active-controlled, observer-blind, randomised phase 4 trial [^1146oEQP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

While demonstrating the efficacy and safety of maternal influenza immunisation, we were also able to address the technical and logistical feasibility of implementation of such a programme in Mali. The trial was well received by the community as the study team worked at local health centres alongside routine prenatal care (that included the administration of tetanus toxoid) to enrol more than 4000 women. The workflow pattern for administration of study vaccine paralleled that of tetanus toxoid administration and was well accepted by local providers. Nevertheless, remaining aspects, such as the availability of an appropriate vaccine, access to prenatal care, and cost, would affect implementation of a maternal influenza immunisation programme.

We noted seasonal influenza peaks with different influenza viruses from year to year, and these fluctuations affected vaccine efficacy. Notably, vaccinated mothers were significantly protected against influenza B, whereas infants were not. The probable explanation relates to when different B-virus lineages circulated. Cases of type B laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants born to mothers vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine were Yamagata lineage infections, whereas mothers had received B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) vaccine. By the time infants born to women who received Yamagata lineage-containing vaccine (B/Wisconsin/1/2010) were exposed to influenza, little type B was circulating. This finding shows the complexity of vaccine selection and supports the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing both type-B lineages. Timeliness of importation of newly formulated vaccine, promptness of initiation of vaccination of pregnant women and the types of circulating influenza viruses in relation to vaccine viruses, all affect vaccine efficacy. If maternal vaccination is to succeed in Mali, infants born in September to October will need to be protected. Because northern hemisphere influenza vaccine becomes available in August or September, immunisation will need to be implemented almost immediately upon vaccine importation. The second peak (February to April) does not present this logistical issue. An alternative strategy for countries with an influenza epidemiology similar to Mali is to use vaccine with an extended shelf-life throughout the year. This approach would allow immunisation of Malian pregnant women in the months leading up to the September to October peak before the newer formulation is available.

Vaccine Dose Considerations for Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years

Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered ≥ 4 weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination to optimize response. Since the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus), recommendations for determining the number of doses needed have specified previous receipt of vaccine containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In light of the continuing circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the predominant influenza A(H1N1) virus since 2009, and the inclusion of an A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like virus in U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines since the 2010–2011 season, separate consideration of receipt of vaccine doses containing this virus is no longer recommended.

Several studies have suggested that for viruses which are the same in both doses of vaccine, longer intervals between the 2 doses do not compromise immune response. In a study conducted across two seasons during which the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine virus did not change but the B virus did change, children aged 10 through 24 months who received 1 dose of IIV during the fall of each season had similar immune responses to the unchanged A(H1N1) virus antigen and to the drifted A(H3N2) virus antigen, compared with children aged 6 through 24 months who received 2 doses of the same IIV during the latter season. However, the first group had significantly lower antibody responses to the B antigen. Since the 2010–11 season, guidance for determining the appropriate number of doses has taken strain changes into account. Because of the change in vaccine composition for 2015–16, children aged 6 months through 8 years will need to have received ≥ 2 doses of influenza vaccine previously to require only 1 dose for the 2015–16 season.

For 2015–16, ACIP recommends that children aged 6 months through 8 years who have previously received ≥ 2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2015, require only 1 dose for 2015–16. The two previous doses need not have been given during the same season or consecutive seasons. Children in this age group who have not previously received a total of ≥ 2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2015 require 2 doses for 2015–16. The interval between the 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks (Figure 1).

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) – United States, 2014–15 influenza season [^11153TGL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons aged ≥ 6 months without contraindications receive annual vaccinations for protection against seasonal influenza. A number of different seasonal influenza vaccine formulations are available, some of which are licensed for specific age groups or are more appropriate than others for persons with certain medical conditions.

Why are the recommendations being modified now?

CDC and ACIP issue guidance on seasonal influenza vaccination annually. The current document contains updated recommendations made by ACIP in February and June 2014, to be effective for the 2014–15 season.

What are the new recommendations?

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older, as has been recommended since the 2010–11 influenza season. This guidance contains some new information. Because the virus composition of the 2014–15 seasonal influenza vaccine is the same as it was for the 2013–14 season, children aged 6 months through 8 years need only 1 dose of vaccine in 2014–15 if they received ≥ 1 dose of 2013–14 seasonal influenza vaccine, regardless of previous vaccination history. Other information regarding determining whether 1 or 2 doses are needed is discussed in this report. There are also new recommendations regarding the use of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years. When immediately available, LAIV should be used for healthy children aged 2 years through 8 years who have no contraindications or precautions. However, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) should be used if LAIV is not immediately available. Vaccination should not be delayed to get LAIV.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^115R4Gyp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — epidemiology, burden, risk groups, and vaccine effectiveness indicate that in the United States during 2010–2016, the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza among all ages was approximately 8% and varied from 3% to 11%, and seasonal epidemics were associated each year with an estimated 4.3–16.7 million medical visits, 140 000–710 000 hospitalizations, and 12 000–56 000 respiratory and circulatory deaths; globally, modeling estimated 291 243–645 832 seasonal influenza–associated respiratory deaths annually. People at increased risk for severe and fatal influenza include children aged < 5 years (but especially < 2 years) and adults aged ≥ 65 years, among other high-risk groups. Appropriate diagnosis of influenza and timely use of antiviral medications may decrease unnecessary testing and empiric antibiotic use, duration of symptoms, hospitalization, the need for critical care, and mortality. Because influenza vaccine effectiveness is widely variable — approximately 40%–60% in well-matched seasons — a history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza.

### Redefining influenza seasonality at a global scale and aligning it to the influenza vaccine manufacturing cycle: a descriptive time series analysis [^113wbTLX]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Annual seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing cycles align with temperate country seasonality in each hemisphere, yet influenza seasonality is poorly defined for many countries. The study introduces a novel and universal approach to defining and classifying seasonality that can be used to classify any country's influenza vaccine cycle alignment.

Methods

Countries reporting to the World Health Organization's FluNet influenza virology database in 90% of weeks during 2011 through 2017 were included. A smoothed, standardised, average proportion of influenza occurring in each week of the year was used to determine degree of seasonality based on the range of average weekly variation. The proportion of activity occurring May through October was used to align influenza activity with a hemisphere's vaccine manufacturing cycle.

Results

From 84 included countries, there were 2,239,208 positive influenza results, of which 26% were influenza type B. Degree of seasonality was moderately positively correlated with absolute value of latitude (r = 0.69, p < 0.0001). Latitude was strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of influenza occurring during May through October (r = -0.83, p < 0.0001). Thirteen countries (12% of the included global population), mainly in tropical zones, had influenza occurrence aligned with the opposite hemisphere's influenza vaccine manufacturing cycle. In tropical zones, concordance in the degree of seasonality and vaccine cycle alignment within regions and between adjacent countries was limited. In temperate zones, on average, influenza B peaked four weeks later than A.

Conclusions

Influenza activity in many countries aligns with the vaccine manufacturing cycle of the opposite hemisphere. In tropical regions, there is limited scope for grouping countries for vaccine distribution and administration.

### Human swine influenza A [H1N1]: practical advice for clinicians early in the pandemic [^112eTHVo]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The influenza pandemic the world was waiting for may have arrived, but the early indications are that the first wave of human swine influenza A [H1N1], also referred to as H1N1 Mexico 09 or "swine flu", is highly transmissible but of no greater virulence than seasonal influenza to date. The new swine flu H1N1 virus is a mixture of avian, porcine and human influenza RNA. With twenty thousand confirmed cases worldwide and 117 deaths within 7 weeks of the first acknowledgement of a possible pandemic by Mexican and WHO experts, the mortality rate is less than 0.1% and the majority of deaths centred upon the origin of the epidemic in Mexico [83%]. Swine flu is thus far a relatively mild illness seen predominantly in those who are healthy and under 25 years of age, perhaps reflecting protection from previous human influenza exposure in older people. As the virus spreads internationally, border protection issues have surfaced and public health initiatives are being progressively rolled out to minimise the transmission. Vaccines are being developed which will be trialled in the coming months with a likely availability by August 2009, in time for the northern hemisphere autumn and winter. Vigilance without alarm appears to be the recommendation so far.

### Update: influenza activity-United States and worldwide, may 20-October 13, 2018 [^112W1Kjy]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Composition of the 2019 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine

The WHO recommendations for influenza vaccine composition for the Southern Hemisphere 2019 season were made at the WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines held September 24–27, 2018, in Atlanta, Georgia. The recommended components for the 2019 Southern Hemisphere egg-based influenza trivalent vaccines are an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria lineage). For egg-based quadrivalent vaccines, an additional component, B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage), is recommended. It was recommended that the A(H3N2) component of non–egg-based vaccines be an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016-like virus. Compared with the composition of the 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation, these recommendations reflect an update to the influenza A(H3N2) component for egg-based vaccines, a change in the influenza B lineage included in the trivalent vaccine and a change in the influenza B/Victoria component. Compared with the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2018–19 influenza vaccines, these recommendations reflect only one change, an update to the A(H3N2) component used in egg-based manufacturing.

Number of doses for children aged 6 months through 8 years: Evidence from several studies indicates that children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who have previously received ≥ 2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2017 require only 1 dose for 2017–18. The 2 doses of influenza vaccine do not have to have been administered in the same season or consecutive seasons. Children in this age group who have not previously received ≥ 2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2017 require 2 doses for the 2017–18 season. The interval between the 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks (Figure).

FIGURE. Influenza vaccine dosing algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2017–18 influenza season

Pregnant Women

Because pregnant and postpartum women are at higher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza than women who are not pregnant, ACIP recommends that all women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant in the influenza season receive influenza vaccine. Any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine may be used. Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time during pregnancy, before and during the influenza season. ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used in any population for the 2017–18 season. Providers should note that, as a live virus vaccine, LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy.

Although experience with the use of IIVs is substantial, and data from observational studies are available to support the safety of these vaccines in pregnancy, data are more limited for vaccination during the first trimester (see Safety of Influenza Vaccines: Pregnant Women and Neonates in the Background Document). Moreover, there is substantially less experience with more recently licensed IIV products (e.g. quadrivalent, cell culture-based, and adjuvanted vaccines) during pregnancy in general. For RIV (available as RIV3 since the 2013–14 influenza season, and as RIV3 and RIV4 for 2017–18), data are limited to reports of pregnancies occurring incidentally during clinical trials, VAERS reports, and pregnancy registry reports. Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for some products; information may be found in package inserts, available atfor trivalent vaccines andfor quadrivalent vaccines.

### Flu prevention: information for travelers | Influenza (flu) [^114axB3K]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know The risk for exposure to flu during travel depends somewhat on the time of year and destination. Travelers in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be exposed to flu during months that fall outside of those listed above, especially when traveling as part of large tourist groups that include people from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating. Overview
- In the Northern Hemisphere, the influenza season can begin as early as October and can last as late as April or May.
- In the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, flu activity typically occurs during April – September.
- In the tropics, flu activity occurs throughout the year.
- Travelers in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be exposed to flu when traveling in areas where flu activity is occurring. CDC Recommends.

People who have not gotten a flu vaccine People who have not gotten a flu vaccine for the current season and are traveling to parts of the world where flu activity is ongoing should get a flu vaccine to protect themselves during their trip.
- This is particularly important for people at higher risk of flu-related complications.
- The flu vaccine used in the Northern Hemisphere can be different from the one used in the Southern Hemisphere. But the Northern Hemisphere vaccine can provide some protection against the main viruses that are circulating in other parts of the world. Keep ReadingPeople at Increased Risk for Flu Complications. People should get vaccinated People should get vaccinated at least 2 weeks before travel because it takes time about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body that provide protection against flu illness.
- No information is available about the benefits of getting revaccinated before summer travel for those people who already were vaccinated during the preceding fall, so revaccination is not recommended.
- Keep in mind that flu vaccine manufactured for the upcoming or current season usually expires the following June. After June, flu vaccines are usually not available in the United States until flu vaccine for the next season is produced and made available in the late summer and fall.
- Also, even if you receive the previous season's vaccine before travel during the summer months, you should still receive a new flu vaccine that coming fall or winter.

### It's a good time to get your flu vaccine… [^111vf34q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Flu viruses typically spread in fall and winter, with activity peaking between December and February. Getting vaccinated in the fall can lower your chances of getting the flu. Flu is a serious disease, caused by influenza viruses, that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Every flu season is different, and the substantial health impacts can vary widely from season to season, with some flu seasons being worse than others. Your best defense against influenza disease is to get a flu vaccine approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration every year. To find a flu vaccine near you, visit this page. A Flu Vaccine Is the Best Prevention The CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. Even if you wait until after October, the vaccine will still be beneficial and provide protection. For more information on recommendations, visit this CDC page.

If you have already been sick with the flu this season without getting vaccinated, getting a flu vaccine is still important because it helps prevent disease caused by three different strains of flu viruses. You likely were infected with one type of flu virus strain, so the vaccine would offer protection against the strains that you haven't already had. The flu vaccine will trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease — it will not make you sick with the flu. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, which is an important reason to get your flu vaccine early, before flu activity starts. The task of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it's a year-round initiative.

How Vaccine Flu Virus Strains Are Selected Every year, in late February or early March, before that year's flu season ends, the FDA, the World Health Organization, the CDC and other public health experts collaborate on collecting and reviewing data from around the world to identify the flu viruses likely to cause the most illnesses during the next flu season. The closer the match between the vaccine virus strains and the circulating virus strains causing disease during flu season, the better the protection that the flu vaccine provides. Although the vaccine and circulating viruses may not be an exact match in some years, that does not mean the vaccine is not benefiting people. Available data show that the vaccine can reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.

What to know Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2025–26 Influenza Season.
- For most groups, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. Vaccination should continue throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating.
- **Timing considerations for specific groups include**:

- For most adults and during the first or second trimester of pregnancy, vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible.
- Children aged 6 months through 8 years who need 2 doses should receive dose 1 as soon as vaccine is available.
- Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who require only 1 dose, particularly if there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible.
- Vaccination in July and August can be considered during the third trimester of pregnancy.
- Available vaccines, approved ages, and dose volumes are listed in Table 1.
- ACIP recommends all recipients receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative:

- Receipt of influenza antiviral medication within the previous 48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir, 5 days for peramivir, and 17 days for baloxavir Precautions:

### 2025–2026 flu season | Influenza (flu)… [^111rhnHf]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Updates for the 2025–2026 Flu Season
- 2025–2026 influenza vaccine recommendations have been published. A summary of those recommendations also is available.
- For the 2025–2026 flu season, CDC recommends seasonal flu vaccination for children, pregnant women, and adults with only single-dose formulations of flu vaccine that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.
- In September 2024, the FDA approved FluMist, the live attenuated influenza vaccine, for self- or caregiver administration.
- On March 13, 2025, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration made recommendations to update the composition of 2025–2026 U. S. influenza vaccines.
- In March 2025, the FDA approved FluBlok, the recombinant influenza vaccine for use in people ages 9 and older. Previously this vaccine was approved for ages 18 years and older.
- Health care providers can support patients in making informed decisions about vaccinations.

FluMist for Self- or Caregiver-Administration On September 20, 2024, The Food and Drug Administration approved the nasal spray flu vaccine, FluMist, for self- or caregiver administration. FluMist is sprayed into the nose and is approved for the prevention of influenza in people 2 through 49 years of age who meet eligibility criteria. FluMist was formerly only available for administration by a health care provider in a health care setting. The option for self- or caregiver administration is available for the 2025–2026 flu season. People can administer the vaccine to themselves or it can be administered by a caregiver who is age 18 years or older. Additional information on flu vaccines for the 2025–2026 flu season Flu vaccine supply/availability during the 2025–2026 season.

There is no change in who can get flu vaccine Flu vaccination continues to be recommended for everyone 6 months and older in the United States for 2025–2026, with rare exception for people who have contraindications. This recommendation has been in place since the 2010–2011 influenza season. More information is available at ACIP Recommendations Summary | Influenza | CDC.

### 2023–2024 CDC flu vaccination recommendations adopted… [^112MPspE]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

2023–2024 CDC Flu Vaccination Recommendations Adopted Some people can be vaccinated in July, August. June 29, 2023 – CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M. D. M. P. H. adopted the 2023–2024 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendations on annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older in the United States on June 27, 2023. There were small changes to the annual recommendations around flu vaccination, including an acknowledgement of the updated flu vaccine composition for the 2023–2024 flu season and a change in the recommendations for vaccination of people with egg allergies. Dr. Walensky's adoption of the ACIP recommendations makes them official CDC policy, which will be published in an upcoming Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Recommendation Report later this summer. Providers should begin vaccinating patients according to CDC's recommended timing, which remains the same as last season.

Flu Vaccination Timing The recommended timing of flu vaccination has not changed. September and October are the best times for most people to get vaccinated. Flu vaccination in July and August is not recommended for most people, but there are several considerations regarding vaccination in July and August for specific groups of people:

- For adults and pregnant women in the first and second trimester, vaccination in July and August should be avoided unless it won't be possible to vaccinate in September or October.
- Pregnant women who are in their third trimester can get a flu vaccine in July or August in order to ensure their babies are protected from flu after birth, when they are too young to get vaccinated.
- Children who need two doses of flu vaccine should get their first dose of vaccine as soon as vaccine becomes available. The second dose should be given at least four weeks after the first.
- Vaccination in July or August can be considered for children who have health care visits during these months, if there might not be another opportunity to vaccinate them. For example, some children might have medical visits in the late summer before school starts and might not return to see a health care provider in September or October. CDC continues to recommend vaccination as long as flu viruses pose a threat. During some seasons, that can be as late as May or June. CDC has recommended annual vaccination for everyone 6 months and older since 2010. Updated Flu Vaccine for 2023–2024.
