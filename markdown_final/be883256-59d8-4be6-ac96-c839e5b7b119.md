## Question

Mrsa acute otitis media with intact tympanic membrane ear drop selection for treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate ear drop selection for treating MRSA acute otitis media in a patient with an intact tympanic membrane, specifically whether quinolone drops are suitable. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ensuring the tympanic membrane is truly intact. Then, I should verify whether MRSA is the likely pathogen and how that probability modifies treatment choices. Next, I will review the role of topical therapy versus systemic therapy when the membrane is intact, and which topical agents are appropriate and safe. Finally, I need to check safety considerations, duration, and follow-up or escalation plans if there is no improvement.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario: "MRSA acute otitis media with intact tympanic membrane" implies an acute bacterial infection of the middle ear, without a perforation or tube, where Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant) is suspected or proven. I need to ensure we are not conflating AOM with otitis externa or with tympanostomy tube otorrhea, because those entities have different management pathways and safety constraints for topical therapy [^1161poeu] [^115rZfmA] [^1161poeu].

> Wait, let me verify the integrity of the tympanic membrane before anything else, because that determines whether topical agents can reach the middle ear and which drops are safe. Pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry help establish an intact membrane, and a normal type A tympanogram generally supports an intact tympanic membrane unless there is conflicting clinical evidence, which is critical for drop selection and safety [^1161poeu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MRSA yet. The most common AOM pathogens remain Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, and MRSA is a less common cause unless there are risk factors or recurrent/resistant presentations, so I should consider the pretest probability and, if topical therapy fails or suspicion is high, obtain a culture to confirm microbiology and susceptibilities before labeling this MRSA AOM definitively [^114DqTAM] [^113VLux4].

> Next, I should review whether topical therapy is even indicated in AOM with an intact tympanic membrane. The evidence base and guidelines for acute otitis externa show topical therapy is effective when the canal is the site of infection, but for AOM with an intact membrane, systemic antibiotics remain standard first-line therapy, with topical drops typically reserved for scenarios of tympanostomy tube otorrhea or a nonintact membrane, so I need to be careful not to overextend AOE data to intact-membrane AOM [^111nP3hx] [^116ujukL] [^113deHyA].

> I will now examine whether quinolone otic drops can still be used despite an intact membrane. The FDA labeling for ofloxacin otic supports use in otitis externa and in pediatric AOM with tympanostomy tubes, but it does not establish efficacy for AOM with an intact membrane, so if I am considering a topical approach, it would be off-label and should be framed as such, balancing potential local benefit against the lack of supporting indication and evidence for intact-membrane AOM [^111LPVEs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "because the tympanic membrane is intact, there is no risk of ototoxicity", but that is not quite right. Although the main safety concern for ototoxicity arises when drops access the middle ear via a perforation or tube, even with an intact membrane, there remains a small, context-dependent risk of inadvertent middle ear exposure with deep instrumentation or unrecognized microperforation, so I should avoid ototoxic agents and favor non-ototoxic preparations if I elect to use drops, and I should confirm membrane integrity carefully before proceeding [^116yKq2Q] [^115BvDHY] [^112TDfG3].

> Let me think about practical, evidence-aligned management: for presumed MRSA AOM with an intact tympanic membrane, systemic therapy targeting MRSA is most appropriate, such as clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, guided by local resistance patterns and patient factors. Topical therapy can be considered as adjunctive symptomatic treatment, but I should not substitute it for systemic therapy when the membrane is intact and infection is in the middle ear space, and I should monitor closely for response and adverse effects [^notfound].

> If, after reassessment, the tympanic membrane is found to be perforated or a tube is present, I should pivot to non-ototoxic topical therapy as first-line treatment, because that is where topical antibiotics achieve high local concentrations and systemic therapy is often unnecessary. In that scenario, a quinolone otic preparation such as ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin with or without steroid is appropriate, with MRSA coverage supported by pharmacokinetic considerations and guideline recommendations for tube otorrhea, and with mupirocin reserved for highly resistant MRSA cases when standard drops fail or cultures dictate [^113deHyA] [^111LPVEs] [^113fghBx] [^112qy9QG].

> I should double-check the safety nuance regarding quinolones and perforation risk. Observational data suggest an association between quinolone otic drops and subsequent tympanic membrane perforation in patients with AOE and initially intact membranes, which underscores the need to avoid unnecessary topical therapy in intact-membrane disease and to confirm membrane status before exposing the middle ear to any otic medication, even though the risk signal comes from AOE cohorts rather than AOM [^112bJmRr].

> Next, I should review supportive care and follow-up: ensure adequate analgesia for otalgia, arrange reassessment within 48 to 72 hours if symptoms are not improving, and consider obtaining a culture if there is treatment failure or persistent/recurrent otorrhea, as culture-directed therapy becomes increasingly important in refractory or MRSA-suspected cases, especially if the clinical picture evolves to suggest a nonintact membrane or tube otorrhea [^111uW45J] [^116ZUjvu] [^113VLux4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis is accurate, confirm the tympanic membrane is intact, and recognize that topical quinolone drops are not indicated for AOM with an intact membrane. If MRSA AOM is suspected, treat systemically with MRSA-active agents and reserve topical therapy for adjunctive symptom control or for cases with a documented nonintact membrane or tympanostomy tube, where non-ototoxic quinolone drops are first-line and alternative agents like mupirocin can be considered for resistant isolates [^1161poeu] [^111LPVEs] [^113deHyA] [^112qy9QG].

For MRSA-associated acute otitis media with an intact tympanic membrane, **topical therapy is not indicated** because the intact membrane prevents drug penetration into the middle ear [^1161poeu]. Systemic therapy is required; **clindamycin 30–40 mg/kg/day divided Q6–8h (max 1.8 g/day) for 7–10 days** is first-line due to high MRSA activity and good middle ear penetration. If clindamycin is unsuitable, use **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 8–12 mg/kg/day of TMP component divided BID (max 320 mg TMP/day) for 7–10 days**. Reserve **linezolid or IV vancomycin** for severe or refractory cases. Avoid topical aminoglycosides or polymyxin B because of ototoxicity risk if the membrane is not fully intact [^116yKq2Q] [^112TDfG3].

---

## Clinical considerations for MRSA-associated AOM

MRSA is an uncommon but important AOM pathogen, particularly in children with recurrent infections, recent antibiotic exposure, or healthcare-associated risk factors [^notfound]. Management must balance **effective eradication** with minimizing ototoxicity and resistance.

---

## Role of topical antibiotic ear drops

Topical antibiotics are generally ineffective for AOM with an intact tympanic membrane because the membrane acts as a barrier to middle-ear penetration [^1161poeu]. They are reserved for cases with a perforated membrane or tympanostomy tubes, where direct access to the middle ear is possible [^113deHyA] [^115rZfmA].

---

## Recommended systemic antibiotic therapy

Given the intact tympanic membrane, **systemic antibiotic therapy is required** to eradicate MRSA from the middle ear. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage (pediatric)** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | 30–40 mg/kg/day divided Q6–8h (max 1.8 g/day) | 7–10 days | First-line due to high MRSA activity and good middle ear penetration |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 8–12 mg/kg/day of TMP component divided BID (max 320 mg TMP/day) | 7–10 days | Alternative if clindamycin is contraindicated or unavailable |
| Linezolid | 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (max 600 mg/dose) | 7–10 days | Reserve for severe or refractory cases due to cost and potential adverse effects |
| Vancomycin (IV) | 15–20 mg/kg every 6–8 hours (max 2 g/dose) | 7–10 days | Reserved for severe systemic illness or failure of oral therapy |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting systemic therapy

Systemic antibiotics are effective in eradicating MRSA from the middle ear, with clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole demonstrating high clinical success rates. Linezolid and vancomycin are reserved for severe or refractory cases due to their potential adverse effects and cost.

---

## Safety considerations and potential adverse effects

Clindamycin is generally well tolerated; monitor for gastrointestinal upset and rare **C. difficile colitis**. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may cause rash, hematologic abnormalities, and hypersensitivity; monitor CBC and renal function. Linezolid carries risks of hematologic toxicity and **serotonin syndrome**; monitor CBC and use caution with serotonergic drugs. Vancomycin requires monitoring for **nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity**, particularly with prolonged use or high trough levels.

---

## Role of topical antibiotic ear drops in MRSA-associated AOM

Topical antibiotic ear drops are **not recommended** for MRSA-associated AOM with an intact tympanic membrane because they cannot penetrate the middle ear space. They are reserved for cases with a perforated tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tubes, where direct access to the middle ear is possible [^113deHyA] [^115rZfmA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize systemic antibiotic therapy for MRSA-associated AOM with an intact tympanic membrane. Topical antibiotic ear drops are not recommended in this clinical scenario due to lack of efficacy and potential ototoxicity risks [^1161poeu].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Patients should be reassessed within 48–72 hours to ensure clinical improvement [^116ZUjvu]. If there is no improvement or symptoms worsen, consider alternative antibiotic therapy or further diagnostic evaluation, including tympanocentesis for culture and susceptibility testing [^113VLux4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For MRSA-associated AOM with an intact tympanic membrane, **systemic antibiotic therapy is required**. Clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are first-line options, with linezolid or vancomycin reserved for severe or refractory cases. Topical antibiotic ear drops are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and potential ototoxicity risks. Close follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure clinical improvement and prevent complications.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein. The literature supports the use of antibiotic/antiiflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112ckTkN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2–4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare "home therapies" (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

Acute otitis media (AOM) vs otitis media with effusion (OME) — clinical distinction and antibiotic stewardship: OME may occur either after an episode of AOM or from eustachian tube dysfunction related to an upper respiratory tract infection and may also precede and predispose to AOM; because OME does not represent an acute infectious process that benefits from antibiotics, clinicians should become proficient in distinguishing normal middle ear status from OME or AOM to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, adverse effects, and antimicrobial resistance.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus topical antibiotics as therapy for acute otitis media with otorrhea caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children… [^111WNY2N]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

All patients had acute-onset otorrhea associated with their AOM. Five patients had tympanostomy tubes and 1 had perforation of the tympanic membrane. None of the patients were responding to treatment with oral antibiotics or fluoroquinolone ear drops. Conclusions The rising rate of CA-MRSA as a cause for many pediatric infections is a major concern. It is very important to obtain cultures from patients with nonresponsive or persistent otorrhea with AOM to look for MRSA and determine the sensitivity of the pathogen to antibacterial therapy. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a good choice for initial, empirical therapy when combined with a topical agent for AOM with otorrhea if CA-MRSA is suspected. The topical agents used were gentamicin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate–neomycin sulfate–hydrocortisone, and ofloxacin.

The patient who received ofloxacin ear drops carried an MRSA isolate that was resistant to levofloxacin, which suggests that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone may have cleared the infection. Follow-up examinations were conducted after 2 to 3 weeks to document resolution of ear drainage. None of the patients needed tympanostomy tube removal or irrigation because they had new onset of drainage and responded to modified treatment. One observation in our study is that all the patients were initially treated with ciprofloxacin or ofoxacin ear drops. Because of their safety profiles, fluoroquinolone ear drop preparations are replacing other otic antibiotics in the treatment of otorrhea. 5, 18–22 A recent study by Weber et al23 concluded that the exposure to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin is a significant risk factor for increasing the prevalence of MRSA.

This report identifies the importance of culturing otorrhea in any patient with persistent otorrhea because of the possibility of MRSA, a pathogen that may not come to mind and that may necessitate modifying therapy. Also, this study supports the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with a topical antibiotic as initial, empirical therapy in suspected cases of CA-MRSA.

### In vitro susceptibility of ciprofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to ototopical therapy [^113fghBx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective Despite the rising incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) otologic infections, choice of treatment remains controversial. Only fluoroquinolone-containing ototopical preparations are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for middle ear application. Furthermore, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation guidelines advocate ototopical monotherapy for both tympanostomy tube otorrhea and acute otitis externa. Unfortunately, MRSA may be ciprofloxacin resistant. This causes confusion regarding antibiotic selection, because susceptibility profiles reflect a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), referenced against systemic, not ototopical, drug delivery dosing. The goal of this study is to determine the ciprofloxacin MIC for ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates from otologic infections and compare that value to the expected drug concentration achieved by fluoroquinolone ear drops and determine MRSA genotype for each isolate. Study Design In vitro assay with retrospective medical record review. Setting Tertiary care university hospital. Subjects and Methods Thirty otologically sourced ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates collected from adult and pediatric patients. MICs were calculated by broth dilution method. Isolates underwent multilocus sequence typing and polymerase chain reaction for arcA and Panton-Valentine leukocidin to establish the genotype. Results MICs ranged from 16 to 1025 µg/mL. There was a relationship between MIC and genotype; of the 7 isolates with an MIC value greater than 512 µg/mL, 6 were sequence type (ST)8. Conclusion These findings support the practice of ototopical monotherapy for patients with uncomplicated ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA otitis externa. However, they raise concern that ototopical therapy may not be adequate to treat highly resistant strains of MRSA infecting the middle ear space.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111nP3hx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111Wqo2T]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — wick placement to promote topical drug delivery is described as follows: Clinicians may place a wick in the ear canal if there is edema preventing drop entry or if most of the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized; the wick should preferably be made of compressed cellulose, ribbon gauze can be used, and some experts recommend moistening a dry wick with an aqueous solution before the first application of otic medication. A wick should not be made of a simple cotton ball. Many treatment studies uniformly use a wick to improve drug delivery, but there are no trials of wick efficacy; a wick is unnecessary once the ear canal edema subsides, which may occur within 24 hours or a few days of topical therapy, and the wick may fall out spontaneously, be removed by the patient if comfortable, or be removed by the physician by the time edema resolves. For severe external auditory canal edema when adequate aural toilet or wick placement is not possible or practical, systemic antibiotics may be considered.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Current guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

American Academy of Pediatrics evidence approach and scope — Guideline development "using an evidence-based approach requires that all evidence related to the guideline is gathered in a systematic fashion, objectively assessed, and then described so readers can easily see the links between the evidence and recommendations made". The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) framed key questions including: "Diagnosis of AOM: What are the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios) of clinical symptoms and otoscopic findings (such as bulging TM) to diagnose uncomplicated AOM and to distinguish it from OME?", "What has been the effect of the use of heptavalent PCV7 on AOM microbial epidemiology, what organisms (bacterial and viral) are associated with AOM since the introduction of PCV7, and what are the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in AOM since the introduction of PCV7?", "What is the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options for treating uncomplicated AOM in average risk children?", "What is the comparative effectiveness of different management options for recurrent OM (uncomplicated) and persistent OM or relapse of AOM?", "Do treatment outcomes in Questions 3 and 4 differ by characteristics of the condition (AOM), patient, environment, and/or health care delivery system?", and "What adverse effects have been observed for treatments for which outcomes are addressed in Questions 3 and 4?"

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^11228YG5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

Clinically, topical treatment of OM with aminoglycosides, such as neomycin, is effective, but also controversial and many otolaryngologists are concerned that aminoglycoside eardrops may be ototoxic if they enter the middle ear through a ruptured tympanic membrane (TM). Scientific evidence for this specific concern is scarce and clinicians often take precaution and best practice, avoiding the ototopical use of aminoglycosides. The present study also provides the needed justification to support the ototoxic concern upon drug selection in OM treatment in the presence of TM perforation or tympanostomy tube allowing ototoxic ear drops to land in the middle ear.

### Microbiology of acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes [^111VLurV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the types of organisms which cause acute otitis media with a tympanostomy tube and to ascertain their frequency distribution.

Study Design and Setting

Prospective, randomized, multi-institutional clinical trials. Both private and academic sites were included.

Results

1309 isolates were recovered from 956 draining ears. Streptococcus pneumonia was recovered from 17%, Staphylococcus aureus from 13%, H flu from 18% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 12%. Fungal organisms were recovered from 5% of total isolates and 4% from single isolates.

Conclusions

AOMT is microbiologically different than AOM with an intact TM. There is no evidence that resistance develops as result of topical treatment.

Significance

The study demonstrates that AOMT is frequently caused by organisms not susceptible to oral antibiotics approved for children, but which are sensitive to topical ear drops.

Initial observation for acute otitis media — control group outcomes and selection: systematic reviews comparing antibiotics versus placebo found an overall favorable natural history in control groups (NNT = 8–16). In more recent studies using stringent diagnostic criteria, approximately half of young children (younger than 2–3 years) had clinical success on placebo, and the effect of antibiotics was greater (NNT = 3–4). Observation as initial management in properly selected children does not increase suppurative complications if follow-up is ensured and a rescue antibiotic is provided for persistent or worsening symptoms.

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^115nN2h8]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Clinical effectiveness of ototopical application of mupirocin ointment in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus otorrhea [^112qy9QG]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) otorrhea has become an increasing problem with regard to infection through the tympanic membrane perforation and postsurgical infection. In particular, dry ear, at the preoperative stage, is considered to be a crucial factor in surgery. We evaluated how to control MRSA otorrhea before and after ear surgery.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-six patients having MRSA otorrhea were enrolled in the present study and randomly divided into 2 groups, namely, mupirocin ointment therapy for 16 patients and ofloxacin ear drops for 10 patients. Approximately 0.6 mg of mupirocin ointment was administered locally to the tympanic membrane and the promontory around and through the perforation with its adjacent external ear canal 1 to 4 times for 2 or 3 weeks at the clinic. On the other hand, ofloxacin ear drops were administered daily by the patients for 2 or 3 weeks at home.

Results

Complete elimination of MRSA from the ear was obtained in all patients of the mupirocin group. This showed a significant improvement (p < 0.001) as compared with the ofloxacin group (improvement + cure rate, 40%). Local application of mupirocin did not aggravate hearing acuity of any patients who were evaluated by pure-tone audiometry before and after treatment.

Conclusion

The present findings first indicate that minimally essential application of mupirocin ointment is an extremely useful ototopical agent against MRSA otorrhea without ototoxicity.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^114DqTAM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media… [^114JAvki]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion is middle ear effusion in the absence of acute infection. About 2. 2 million cases of otitis media with effusion occur annually in the United States. 5 Chronic suppurative otitis media is persistent infection and resultant perforation of the tympanic membrane. 6 This article will review recent evidence, including the evidence-based guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, about the diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. 1, 5. OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION Persistent middle ear effusion after resolution of acute otitis media does not indicate treatment failure and requires only monitoring and reassurance. Risk factors for persistent acute otitis media with effusion include hearing loss greater than 30 dB, prior tympanostomy tube placement, adenoid hypertrophy, and onset during summer or fall.

34 Clinical examination, pneumatic otoscopy, and tympanometry may be performed during the observation period. Children older than two years who have otitis media with effusion and no developmental issues must be seen at three- to six-month intervals until effusion resolves, hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected. Tympanostomy with ventilation tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of ventilation on hearing, effusion duration, language development, cognition, behavior, and quality of life show that benefits in children are marginal at best. 37, 38 Ventilation tubes may be more beneficial in young children in an environment with a high infection load and in older children with hearing loss of 25 dB or greater in both ears for at least 12 weeks.

37 Adenoidectomy may be considered in children who have recurrent otitis media with effusion after tympanostomy if chronic adenoiditis is present or if adenoidal hypertrophy causes nasal obstruction. 39 Oral or parenteral antibiotics are useful in patients with systemic sepsis or inadequate response to topical antibiotics. They should be selected on the basis of culture and sensitivity results. Tympanoplasty, with reconstruction of the ossicular chain if necessary, is an option in patients with chronic perforation and hearing loss. Mastoidectomy is often recommended for patients with chronic mastoiditis.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114Lzcn9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — diagnosis and initial observation research priorities — states there will probably never be a gold standard for diagnosis of AOM because of the continuum from otitis media with effusion (OME) to AOM, and performing tympanocentesis studies on children with uncomplicated otitis is likely not feasible because of ethical and other considerations. Devices that more accurately identify the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) and bulging that are easier to use than tympanometry during office visits would be welcome, with additional development of inexpensive, easy-to-use video pneumatic otoscopes still a goal. For less certain tympanic membrane (TM) appearances, randomized controlled trials could clarify the benefit of initial antibiotics and initial observation, and such studies must also specify severity of illness, laterality, and otorrhea, establish appropriate end points, and, when TM appearance is unimproved, require randomization to continued observation and antibiotic groups. The most efficient and acceptable methods of initial observation should continue to be studied balancing the convenience and benefits with the potential risks to the patient.

Acute TTO — indications for systemic antibiotics and management of failures: Systemic antibiotic therapy is not recommended for first-line therapy of uncomplicated acute TTO but is appropriate, with or without concurrent topical antibiotic therapy, when 1) Cellulitis of the pinna or adjacent skin is present, 2) Concurrent bacterial infection is present (eg, sinusitis, pneumonia, or streptococcal pharyngitis), 3) Signs of severe infection exist (high fever, severe otalgia, toxic appearance), 4) Acute TTO persists or worsens despite topical antibiotic therapy, 5) Administration of eardrops is not possible because of local discomfort or lack of tolerance by the child, 6) A patient has an immune-compromised state, or 7) Cost considerations prevent access to nontoxic topical antibiotic drops; children who fail topical therapy may need canal cleaning or tube lumen suctioning, topical drop concentrations at the site of infection can be up to 1000 times higher than serum-based thresholds used for resistance, About 4% to 8% of children on topical quinolone drops require additional antibiotic rescue therapy, and ear wicks have been described to manage refractory cases in 1 small case series.

### Topical antibiotics: strategies for avoiding ototoxicity [^115BvDHY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

As we continue to learn more about ototoxicity from ototopical drugs, there are several key points we must keep in mind: Aminoglycoside antibiotics used in ototopical agents do have ototoxic potential. Reported cases of ototoxicity are relatively uncommon, but the potential for serious complications does exist. Subclinical unilateral vestibular deficits do go unrecognized. Superior alternatives to aminoglycoside drops, particularly the quinolone drops, are readily available. The quinolones are superior to the aminoglycosides in terms of safety, bacterial eradication, and clinical cure and are therefore the drops of choice for treating otorrhea in an open infected ear.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1145kg14]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children — research needs emphasize diagnostic prediction and testing strategies, including whether we can "identify clinical factors that predict persistence of MEE" and define "the ideal timing of audiologic testing for a child being considered for tubes — before surgery, after surgery, or both", and how "abnormal tympanometry at the initial clinical encounter" relates to persistence of otitis media with effusion (OME). Questions address evaluation and risk prediction in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), such as the "best time to evaluate children referred for possible surgical treatment of recurrent AOM with relation to the last episode of AOM" and whether the "presence of middle ear fluid in one or both ears" predicts more AOM episodes in children with recurrent AOM. For at‑risk populations, the guideline asks about the "benefits of tympanostomy tube placement on frequency of AOM, prevalence of OME, and speech and language development", whether surgery presents "unique risks or greater complications", the "actual frequency of AOM and prevalence of OME", and the potential for "underdiagnosis of OME because of attention to other conditions or overdiagnosis of OME because of greater clinical exposure for some of the at-risk populations". Indicators for repeated intervention are prioritized, including "the clinical indicators that best predict the need for repeated tympanostomy tube placement" and the "role of allergy testing" and management for children with "recurrent tube otorrhea" or repeated placement. Device and adjunct decisions are highlighted by asking whether certain "types of long-term tubes" are more often linked to complications and "which subgroups of children should be considered for adenoidectomy at the time of the first set of tubes or when younger than age 4 years". Communication and postoperative care topics include how "face-to-face" counseling and educational resources "facilitate shared surgical decision making", indications to prescribe "postoperative ototopical antibiotics", whether limiting routine drop use changes "the incidence of postoperative otorrhea" and microbiology, predictors of failure of "ototopical therapy as initial treatment for TTO", identifying children at risk for otorrhea and criteria for "posttympanostomy water precautions", whether child water‑precaution recommendations can be "generalized to adults with tympanostomy tubes", and the "ideal follow-up schedule" for patients with tubes.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — watchful waiting versus immediate antibiotics (random assignment): In a trial of 233 patients randomly assigned to immediate antibiotics (amoxicillin, 90 mg/kg/day) or watchful waiting, inclusion required symptoms of ear infection, otoscopic evidence of AOM, and nonsevere AOM defined by a 3-item symptom score (OM-3) and an 8-item tympanic membrane appearance scale (OS-8). In the watchful waiting group, 66% of children completed the study without antibiotics, and there was no difference in parent satisfaction scores at day 12. Immediate antibiotics resolved symptoms faster than watchful waiting (P = 0.004), with a greater difference in children younger than 2 years (P = 0.008), and otoscopic and tympanogram scores were lower with antibiotics (P = 0.02 for otoscopic score, P = 0.004 for tympanogram). Failure and recurrence at 12 days were lower with antibiotics (5%) than with watchful waiting (21%), but by day 30 there was no difference (23% and 24%, respectively). Immediate antibiotics eradicated S pneumoniae carriage in the majority, but antibiotic-group day 12 isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant than those from watchful waiting.

### Acute otitis media: part II. treatment in an era of increasing… [^113VLux4]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Tympanocentesis was noted as an option in cases of treatment failure. Tympanocentesis was viewed as "particularly important if a child has recently received several courses of antimicrobial therapy and is therefore more likely to harbor a multiply-resistant strain". 25 In this context, the working group stated, "In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, clinicians treating children with acute otitis media should consider developing the capacity to perform tympanocentesis themselves or establish ready referral mechanisms to a clinician with this capacity. " If tympanocentesis is performed and S. pneumoniae is isolated, clindamycin then becomes a treatment option. Eventually almost everyone gets better. Validation of the pharmacodynamic model relies on tympanocentesis for identification of the causative bacteria and measurement of antibiotic levels in middle ear fluid.

Some antibiotics, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, concentrate intracellularly, not in middle ear fluid, and are bacteriostatic, not bactericidal. A model looking for certain drug levels and bacterial eradication may not accurately assess the efficacy of such agents. The drug levels for bacterial killing used by the CDC were based on standards that changed six months after the CDC publication. The CDC recommendations include the possibility of performing tympanocentesis in selected cases to guide management of refractory acute otitis media. Few family physicians, however, perform this procedure. Otolaryngologists are infrequently available to accommodate a same-day referral for the procedure, and still fewer have done it without the benefit of general anesthesia. Pathogen-Directed Antibiotic Selection Tympanocentesis allows isolation of the bacterial pathogen from middle ear fluid in approximately two thirds of children with acute otitis media.

30 and in 50 percent of children with persistent or recurrent otitis media. 21 Even though the otoscopic examination may show tympanic membrane inflammation, the middle ear fluid may be sterile by the time the patient seeks care. When a tympanocentesis is performed, management options include waiting for culture results before an antibiotic is selected or providing the patient with two days of empiric antibiotic treatment, then changing the prescription or discontinuing treatment, depending on the culture results. If bacteria are not isolated in the specimen, no antibiotic therapy is required.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116PfbT7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — clinical role and risk considerations — state that when children receive surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME), insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the preferred initial procedure, with candidacy dependent primarily on hearing status, associated symptoms, and the child's developmental risk. Placement of tympanostomy tubes significantly reduces middle ear effusion (MEE) prevalence, resolves hearing loss caused by MEE, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy should acute tube otorrhea occur. Tympanostomy tubes also can improve disease-specific quality of life (QOL) for children with chronic OME, recurrent AOM, or both. Risks and potential adverse events are related to general anesthesia, usually required for the procedure, and the effects of the tympanostomy tube on the tympanic membrane and middle ear, but risks associated with general anesthesia can be eliminated by inserting tubes in the office setting without general anesthesia, when appropriate, based on shared decision making between the clinician and family.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112bNnF5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115rZfmA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — care during ear drainage and use of ear drops is addressed as follows: If you see drainage from the ear, we recommend the following: Antibiotic ear drops, without oral antibiotics, are all that is needed in most cases (usually ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone). Do NOT use over the counter ear drops. Ear drainage may build up or dry at the opening of the ear canal, so remove the crusting with a cotton-tipped swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide or warm water, and if thick you can roll up a piece of tissue or toilet paper to help soak it up before using ear drops. Do not swim during infections when there is drainage or discharge coming from the ear; during bathing, use silicone ear plugs, or coat a small cotton ball with petroleum jelly and use it to cover the opening of the ear canal. Use the ear drops only for the amount of time recommended by your doctor, because using them too long could result in a yeast infection. Antibiotics taken by mouth are not needed for most ear drainage with tubes in place, although they may be needed if there is another reason to be on an antibiotic or if the infection does not go away after using only ear drops. When using ear drops, do the following to help pump the drops in the ear canal and get down to the ear tube: Have your child lay down on their side, put ear drops into opening of ear canal, then push down on tragus 4–5 times to help pump the drops into the canal. Most children do not typically have fever or pain when they have ear drainage with tubes in place.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116Cy8Fs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) in children — epidemiology and microbiology are described as follows: recurrent otorrhea affects only about 7% of patients and chronic otorrhea occurs in about 4%, acute delayed TTO is usually a manifestation of AOM and is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or typical nasopharyngeal pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable), and Moraxella catarrhalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been reported and should be suspected when otorrhea is recurrent or recalcitrant, and viral coinfection is often present in young children with acute TTO.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aMwxC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### The use of otic powder in the treatment of acute external otitis [^114kFPAJ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acute external otitis (AEO) is a painful condition that results as a secondary infection of macerated skin and subcutaneous tissues of the external auditory canal. The most commonly causative microorganisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Classic management strategies include moisture prevention, cleansing of the canal and administration of topical antimicrobial agents in drop form, such as aminoglycosides and quinolones, at times in combination with steroid solutions. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of topical otic powder, tobramycin drops and ciprofloxacin drops in patients suffering from AEO. MATERIALS AND MEASURES: A randomized prospective trial was performed to determine the efficacy of Auricularum powder (dexamethasone 10 mg, oxytetracycline HCl 90,000 U, polymyxin B Sulfate 100,000 U, nystatin 1,000,000 U; Trima, Serolam Laboratories, Germany) compared with ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) and tobramycin (Tobrex, Alcon Laboratories) drops for the treatment of AEO. One hundred twenty patients who presented with signs and symptoms of AEO were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: AEO diagnosed by an otolaryngologist, patient age 18 years, no prior treatment with other drops or systemic antibiotics, no sensitivity to any of the drugs used or their contents, and no perforation of the tympanic membrane. All patients were instructed to avoid moisture and wetness of the ear during the course of their treatment. After we received informed consent, a swab culture was taken, and the patient was randomly assigned topical treatment for 14 days.

Results

Eighty-six percent of those treated with Auricularum powder were cured at day 3–4 after initial treatment. Seventy-seven percent of those treated with ciprofloxacin drops, and fifty-six percent of those treated with tobramycin were cured at that time. All 120 patients were cured by day 14.

Conclusion

The results show that topical treatment with Auricularum powder is an effective and rapid method for the treatment of AEO. Ciloxan also was effective in the treatment of AEO and relieved symptoms quickly and efficiently in a short period of time. Tobrex was effective in treating AEO, but our results show that relief of symptoms was slower than with the other drugs.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^112UW88w]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table 2), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.

### Ototoxicity of ototopical drops – an update [^113zxbeV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Various topical preparations are widely used for treating external otitis, acute otitis media with perforation, post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea, and chronic suppurative otitis media. Solutions and suspensions that enter the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane can reach the inner ear by crossing through the round window membrane. The safety of various components of otic solutions used in this way, particularly aminoglycosides, corticosteroids, solvents, and preservatives, has been questioned in light of their ototoxic potential. The authors' objective is to review the literature discussing the safety of commonly used classes of otic preparations in settings in which the constituents can access the middle and inner ear in high concentrations and discuss their clinical experience with ototoxicity and experience with medical-legal issues.

Acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up and middle ear effusion (MEE): There is little scientific evidence for a routine 10- to 14-day reevaluation visit for all children with an episode of AOM. Persistent MEE is common and can be detected by pneumatic otoscopy (with or without verification by tympanometry) after resolution of acute symptoms, with 60% to 70% of children having MEE at two weeks after successful antibiotic treatment, decreasing to 40% at 1 month and 10% to 25% at 3 months. The presence of MEE without clinical symptoms is defined as otitis media with effusion (OME), which must be differentiated clinically from AOM and requires infrequent additional monitoring but not antibiotic therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112R4BHy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^115ZcJR7]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

We believe that our study of long-term antibiotic use is very relevant for Aboriginal and other populations at high risk of tympanic membrane perforation. Unfortunately conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has not significantly reduced ear disease in Australian Aboriginal children. A recent pediatric outreach program in Far North Queensland confirms that CSOM is the most prevalent health problem in Aboriginal children. The poor school achievement of Aboriginal children, already disadvantaged by poverty, has been partially attributed to the chronic hearing loss.

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had fewer perforations, more normal ears, less pneumococcal carriage and fewer resistant pneumococci than children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for acute illnesses but without continuous amoxicillin. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Tympanostomy tube controversies and issues: state-of-the-art review [^116qik3j]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review current pragmatic issues and controversies related to tympanostomy tubes in children, in the context of current best research evidence plus expert opinion to provide nuance, address uncertainties, and fill evidence gaps.

Methods

Each issue or controversy is followed by the relevant current best evidence, expert insight and opinion, and recommendations for action. The role of expert opinion and experience in forming conclusions is inversely related to the quality, consistency, and adequacy of published evidence. Conclusions are combined with opportunities for shared decision-making with caregivers to recommend pragmatic actions for clinicians in everyday settings.

Results

The issues and controversies discussed include (1) appropriate tube indications, (2) rationale for not recommending tubes for recurrent acute otitis media without persistent middle ear effusion, (3) role of tubes in at-risk children with otitis media with effusion, (4) role of new, automated tube insertion devices, (5) appropriateness and feasibility of in-office tube insertion in awake children, (6) managing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acute tube otorrhea, and (7) managing recurrent or persistent tube otorrhea.

Conclusions

Despite a substantial, and constantly growing, volume of high-level evidence on managing children with tympanostomy tubes, there will always be gaps, uncertainties, and controversies that benefit from clinician experience and expert opinion. In that regard, the issues discussed in this review article will hopefully aid clinicians in everyday, pragmatic management decisions.

Post–tympanostomy tube insertion management — The guideline development group is advising against routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops following tube insertion, and intraoperative management may involve saline washout, a single application of antibiotic ear drops (with or without a steroid), or no treatment; children with active acute otitis media or purulent effusions at the time of tube insertion are excluded from this recommendation. Supporting data include that a review of nearly 600 patients from 3 RCTs did not find an increase in intraluminal occlusion in patients who did not receive ear drops, although antibiotic drops decreased the rate of postoperative tube obstruction by about 12% (number needed to treat of 8).

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Overuse of tympanostomy tubes in New York metropolitan area: evidence from five hospital cohort [^111wr4ET]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Analysis based on explicit criteria

The explicit criteria classified 7.0% (48 cases) of actual surgeries as appropriate, 23.3% (159 cases) as of uncertain appropriateness, and 69.7% (475 cases) as inappropriate (table 5). Cases that were classified as appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate had on average 80, 38, and 18 days of effusion. Counting surgeries classified as appropriate or uncertain as concordant, 30.3% were concordant with the explicit criteria. We found no statistically significant differences in appropriateness between hospitals.

Table 5
Appropriateness ratings based on explicit criteria and academy guidelines. Values are numbers (percentages)

*The expert panel considered indication for surgery for recurrent acute otitis media to be of uncertain appropriateness no antibiotic prophylaxis was used to suppress reoccurrence; this analysis elevates the ratings for surgeries that failed to meet this aspect of the criteria from uncertain to appropriate (a potentially alternative view); no official guidelines on the surgical treatment of acute otitis media exist.

†Such as history of previous tubes, other surgery/procedure at time of tube insertion and "at risk conditions"; the expert panel considered only the nature and magnitude of ear disease in the decision to insert tubes and not consider these extenuating circumstances.

‡The 1994 Academy guideline covers the management of otitis media with effusion, not recurrent acute otitis media.

Cases classified with otitis media with effusion — Overall, 80% of the cases with otitis media with effusion were not concordant with the explicit criteria developed by the panel (table 5). Among children with effusion as the reason for surgery, 76% of the inappropriate cases were inappropriate primarily owing to the short duration of the effusion immediately preceding surgery.

Cases classified with acute otitis media — Overall, 48% of the cases were not concordant with the explicit criteria developed for acute otitis media (table 5). Low frequency of infection was the most common reason why the cases were not concordant with the explicit criteria. The expert panel believed that the benefit of delaying surgery until after a failure of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent acute otitis media outweighed concerns about the development of antimicrobial resistance. Evolving views on the use of antibiotics suggested that we should also present our analysis as if the expert panel had reversed its judgment, and we reanalysed the data considering frequently recurrent acute otitis media without a trial of prophylaxis to be an appropriate indication for insertion of a tympanostomy tube rather than an uncertain one. This increased the overall proportion of appropriate cases from 7% to 22.1%; the proportion concordant remained unchanged (table 5).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116KjAEU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative otorrhea prevention in children with tympanostomy tubes — saline washout versus antibiotic ear drops: The recommendation against prescribing relates to continuing use of antibiotic ear drops that may be prescribed for up to 10 days after surgery. Based on 2 low‑risk randomized controlled trials (RCTs), saline washouts reduced otorrhea incidence from 30% to 16% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.00) with a number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) of 7 children, while a single application of antibiotic‑steroid ear drops reduced otorrhea from 9% to 1% (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.57) with an NNTB of 13. In a trial of 291 children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) whose ears (N = 560) were randomized to four interventions — saline washout, oral amoxicillin for 7 days, oral amoxicillin for 7 days plus ciprofloxacin ear drops for 3 days, or observation — no significant differences in postoperative otorrhea were found, with rates ranging from 1.1% to 12.3%, supporting no added benefit from continuing antibiotic ear drops after surgery when compared with saline washout. A more recent RCT showed no benefit of routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops as compared with saline solution: Children (N = 174) were randomized to intraoperative ciprofloxacin or normal saline ear drops continued for 5 days after surgery; of the remaining 128 children, about 62% had recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), 21% chronic OME, and 48% mucoid effusions, and there were no differences at 4 or 6 weeks in the incidence, duration, and QOL impact of early tympanostomy tube otorrhea or tube patency between groups.

### Topical analgesia for acute otitis media [^1171uw5x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a spontaneously remitting disease for which pain is the most distressing symptom. Antibiotics are now known to have less benefit than previously assumed.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of topical analgesia for AOM.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to May Week 3 2006), EMBASE (1990 to December 2005) and LILACS (1982 to September 2005) without language restriction, and the reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and authors.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing an otic preparation with an analgesic effect (excluding antibiotics) versus placebo or an otic preparation with an analgesic effect (excluding antibiotics) versus any other otic preparation with an analgesic effect, in adults or children presenting at primary care settings with AOM without perforation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Potential studies were screened independently and trial quality was assessed by three authors, and differences were resolved by discussion. Data was then independently extracted from the trials selected by two authors. We contacted the authors of three trials to acquire additional information not available in published articles.

Main Results

Our searches yielded 356 records; four trials met our criteria. One trial with 54 participants compared treatment with anaesthetic ear drops versus an olive oil placebo immediately at diagnosis. All patients were also given paracetamol. There was a statistically significant pain reduction of 25% in those receiving anaesthetic drops 30 minutes after instillation. Three trials (with one common co-author) compared anaesthetic ear drops with naturopathic herbal ear drops in 274 patients. One of these trials also used antibiotics in both groups. There were statistically significant differences at instillation of drops, or 15 or 30 minutes after the instillation (or both) on one to three days after diagnosis, always favouring the naturopathic group in each trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from these four randomised controlled trials, only one of which addresses the most relevant question of primary effectiveness, is insufficient to know whether ear drops are effective or not.

### Effect of a participatory intervention in women's self-help groups for the prevention of chronic suppurative otitis media in their children in jumla Nepal: a cluster-randomised trial [^116nREwj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a multifactorial disease of poverty. Globally, CSOM affects 65 to 330 million people, of whom at least 50% suffer clinically significant hearing loss. Hearing loss can interfere with early childhood development and decrease educational and social opportunities compounding the existing disadvantage of marginalised children. Therefore, effective strategies for preventing CSOM in low resource settings are urgently needed.

Otitis media is a spectrum of disease beginning with an acute respiratory infection leading to acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, which can result in a chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane, chronic inflammation of the middle ear cavity and otorrhoea or discharge (CSOM). Appropriate treatment of acute otitis media with oral antibiotics and early treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics and ear mopping are simple, inexpensive and effective. The prevalence of CSOM in Nepal is 5 to 10% in the available studies which mostly rely on cross-sectional groups of school children in less remote settings or patients attending ear, nose and throat specialist clinics. Every study that has been conducted in Nepal has revealed a prevalence above the 4% level satisfying the WHO definition of a 'massive public health problem' requiring 'urgent attention'.

Action statement profile for Statements 8a, 8b, and 8c — medical therapy for otitis media with effusion: The quality improvement opportunity is to "Discourage medical therapy that does not affect long-term outcomes for OME… but does have significant cost and potential adverse events". Evidence is "Grade A, systematic review of well-designed RCTs", with "Level of confidence in the evidence: High". Benefits include "Avoid side effects and reduce cost by not administering medications; avoid delays in definitive therapy…; avoid social impact of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing on bacterial resistance and transmission of resistant pathogens". The assessment shows "Preponderance of benefit over harm (in recommending against therapy)", "Risks, harms, costs: None", "Role of patient preferences: Small", "Exceptions: Patients in whom any of these medications are indicated for primary management of a coexisting condition with OME", and "Policy level: Strong recommendation (against therapy)".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113boyzE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

### Risk for tympanic membrane perforation after quinolone ear drops for acute otitis externa [^112bJmRr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study examined whether the use of quinolone ear drops increased the risk of perforation with intact tympanic membranes and acute otitis externa (AOE).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid clinical encounter and pharmacy billing records from 1999 through 2010. Children and adults had to have 24 months continuous enrollment in Medicaid prior to the first antibiotic ear drop dispensing (index date), and they had to maintain their enrollment for at least 18 months thereafter. Included ear drops were ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone, and neomycin plus hydrocortisone. Tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) was identified as 2 inpatient or outpatient encounters associated with TMP diagnosis at least 30 days apart. A Cox regression model adjusting for patient demographics, calendar year, and the number of ear drop prescriptions was used to compare TMP risk between quinolone and neomycin-exposed patients.

Results

A total of 94 333 patients entered the study cohort. Use of quinolone ear drops was associated with increased risk for TMP compared with neomycin plus hydrocortisone, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34–3.83). Adjusted hazard ratios were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.27–5.05) for ofloxacin, 2.24 (95% CI, 1.03–4.85) for ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.09–4.87) for ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.

Conclusions

Use of quinolone ear drops to treat AOE is associated with a previously unreported increased risk of developing TMPs. Selection of otic preparations to treat self-limited conditions with intact tympanic membranes should consider TMP risk.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113j2WXq]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) management terminology — Key terms are defined for consistent use: "Otitis externa — an infection of the external auditory canal", "Tympanometry — measuring acoustic immittance (transfer of acoustic energy) of the ear as a function of ear canal air pressure", and "Number needed to treat (NNT) — the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent 1 additional bad outcome". Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as "treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter", whereas initial observation is "initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief, with commencement of antibiotic therapy only if the child's condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation".

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111Cda28]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We were unable to determine non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics, but our findings in a small group of children, requiring confirmation, suggest that oral antibiotics may be more effective in resolving symptoms and shortening the duration of ear discharge than antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children with AOMd. That must be balanced against the findings that eardrops are associated with reasonable symptom control, fewer total oral antibiotic courses, and less systemic side effects in case there is non-inferiority. Since we were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics in children with AOMd, current guidelines' recommendation that clinicians can consider oral antibiotics in this group of children are not unreasonable but must be balanced against the major public health threat of antibiotic resistance.

Topical analgesic ear drops for AOM — trial and review evidence: In an emergency department trial of children 3 to 17 years of age, sixty-three eligible children were randomized to receive aqueous lidocaine or normal saline ear drops up to 3 times in 24 hours, with a statistically significant 50% reduction in reported pain at 10 and 30 minutes but not at 20 minutes after application of topical lidocaine; complications were minimal with 3 children reporting some dizziness the next day and none reporting tinnitus. A Cochrane review identified 5 trials in children 3 to 18 years of age, found naturopathic drops favored 15 to 30 minutes after installation and 1 to 3 days after diagnosis but not statistically significant, and concluded limited evidence that ear drops are effective at 30 minutes.

### Overuse of tympanostomy tubes in New York metropolitan area: evidence from five hospital cohort [^116ffPg7]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

The assessment of the use of tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media is not covered by clinical society guidelines, and the research evidence of efficacy is sparse. The explicit criteria developed by the panel of experts we convened generally indicate that tympanostomy tubes should be reserved for children with at least six episodes of recurrent acute otitis media in 12 months, who had had at least one infection that broke through antibiotic prophylaxis. The use of prophylactic antibiotics has fallen out of favour because of concerns about antibiotic resistance rather than controversy about its effectiveness. When we reanalysed the data, dropping the panel's requirement for a failure of antibiotic prophylaxis, a substantial majority still failed to meet the standard for sufficient frequency and were still considered inappropriate.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116yKq2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Otitis media [^117N8kDP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is diagnosed based on visualization of a full or bulging tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion. The distribution of bacteria causing AOM in North America under the influence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and antibiotic selection pressure has resulted in a predominance of β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae followed by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although guidelines continue to endorse amoxicillin as the preferred treatment, amoxicillin/clavulanate in high dosage would be the preferred treatment based on the otopathogen mix currently. Antibiotic prophylaxis has fallen into disfavor as a preventative strategy for AOM recurrences.
