## Question

Is it possible for a patient to develop reactive arthritis following a C. difficile infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether reactive arthritis can occur after Clostridioides difficile infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what reactive arthritis is and its typical infectious triggers. Then, I should verify whether C. difficile has been directly linked to reactive arthritis in epidemiologic studies and case reports. Next, I will assess pathophysiologic plausibility and timing. After that, I need to check relevant guidelines to see what they recommend for evaluation and management. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence into practical diagnostic and treatment implications, while double-checking for any caveats or areas of uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classical paradigm of reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy that follows a preceding infection, most often enteric or genitourinary, with well-described triggers including Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Chlamydia trachomatis, and it is strongly influenced by host susceptibility such as HLA-B27, with proposed mechanisms including molecular mimicry and dysregulated innate/adaptive immune responses.

> Now, I need to ask whether C. difficile fits into this trigger spectrum. Because reactive arthritis commonly follows enteric infections, it is biologically plausible that a toxigenic colitis such as C. difficile could act similarly, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; plausibility is not proof, so I should verify direct clinical evidence linking C. difficile infection to subsequent arthritis before I infer causality or even strong association.

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic signal. A high-credibility JAMA Pediatrics cohort and nested case-control study screened 148 children with confirmed C. difficile infection and identified 26 who developed acute arthritis or tenosynovitis within a prespecified at-risk window (4 weeks before to 12 weeks after CDI), with negative synovial cultures when obtained and no alternative explanation, providing quantitative evidence for CDI-associated reactive arthritis and suggesting under-recognition in practice [^115gBueL].

> I should confirm whether there are adult corroborative data as well. Contemporary case reports describe adults with C. difficile colitis who develop clinical reactive arthritis, sometimes with HLA-B27 positivity, and expert reviews now list C. difficile among emerging or newly recognized infectious precipitants of reactive arthritis, which supports the pediatric cohort signal while acknowledging that case reports alone are low-certainty evidence [^115XC7vQ] [^111e8FrG].

> Hold on, I should verify the credibility gradient of these sources. The JAMA Pediatrics cohort is high-credibility and provides incidence estimates within defined networks, whereas single-patient case reports are low-credibility but consistent in direction, and narrative expert reviews reflect evolving consensus; taken together, the convergence of signals supports a real association but still falls short of proving causality in the Bradford Hill sense for adults specifically [^115gBueL] [^115XC7vQ] [^111e8FrG].

> Let me think about pathophysiologic plausibility to see if this fits the broader ReA framework. C. difficile pathogenesis is toxin-driven (TcdA/TcdB), provoking robust mucosal and systemic inflammatory responses; in genetically susceptible hosts, cross-reactive immune mechanisms could plausibly target synovial tissues, mirroring what is described for other enteric ReA triggers, which makes the biological mechanism coherent with the clinical observations [^117GNr3g] [^114PnSTg].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and timing so I can align recognition windows. The pediatric cohort defined an at-risk period of roughly 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after documented CDI, which mirrors the latency seen with other enteric triggers; presentations include mono- or oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, or tenosynovitis, with variable extra-articular features such as ocular inflammation or mucocutaneous lesions that are well-recognized in ReA phenotypes [^115gBueL] [^116bDssQ].

> I need to check guidelines to see whether any recommend routine CDI screening in patients with suspected reactive arthritis or prescribe specific arthritis management for CDI-triggered cases. Initially, I thought there might be guidance to screen all ReA patients for C. difficile, but let me reconsider; IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID CDI guidelines focus on CDI diagnosis and treatment rather than post-infectious arthritides, EULAR infection-screening recommendations relate to pretreatment safety before immunosuppression, and BASHH guidance pertains to sexually acquired ReA, so no current guideline specifically mandates CDI testing in ReA, though the general principle of identifying and treating the triggering infection still applies [^114ppwhS] [^113RZaKD] [^115DgiMm] [^116gvQ62] [^112HUU5c] [^111TB35j] [^115VAMd3] [^115xgwts].

> Synthesizing these data, I should conclude that yes, reactive arthritis can follow C. difficile infection, with the most robust evidence in pediatrics, corroborative adult case reports, and biologic plausibility consistent with established ReA mechanisms; the entity appears under-recognized, and clinicians should keep a low threshold to consider ReA in new-onset arthritis or tenosynovitis within approximately 12 weeks of CDI when alternative explanations are lacking [^115gBueL] [^115XC7vQ] [^111e8FrG].

> Turning to practical diagnosis, I need to ensure we exclude mimics and confirm the post-infectious pattern. In patients with recent CDI and acute arthritis, obtain a careful exposure and symptom timeline, perform joint examination, consider HLA-B27 testing as supportive (not diagnostic), analyze synovial fluid to rule out septic arthritis when appropriate, and use imaging judiciously, starting with radiographs and adding ultrasound or MRI if needed to document synovitis or detect erosions per ACR appropriateness criteria [^113hNNDq] [^112pPX98].

> For management, let me double-check that we treat both the antecedent infection and the inflammatory arthritis appropriately. CDI should be managed per contemporary guidelines favoring fidaxomicin or vancomycin as first-line agents depending on availability and severity, with metronidazole reserved as an alternative in select non-severe cases; for recurrence, options include fidaxomicin, tapered/pulsed vancomycin, and adjunctive bezlotoxumab or consideration of fecal microbiota-based therapies in suitable patients, while the arthritis itself is typically managed with NSAIDs first-line and escalation to conventional or biologic agents by rheumatology if persistent or severe, noting that prolonged antibiotics are not recommended for established enteric-triggered ReA and are discouraged in sexually acquired ReA once arthritis has manifested [^113RZaKD] [^115DgiMm] [^115rzSJH] [^113DfF86] [^114dQnbP] [^115GsL31] [^116SkKh9] [^111cen9S] [^115xgwts].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up priorities. Monitor joint symptoms for resolution in parallel with CDI outcomes, maintain vigilance for CDI recurrence where fecal microbiota-based therapies may be considered after standard-of-care antibiotics in appropriate candidates, and reassess the need for rheumatology-directed therapy if arthritis persists beyond the usual self-limited course or if axial features emerge, adjusting plans in accordance with safety screening requirements before immunosuppression [^115GsL31] [^116SkKh9] [^116gvQ62] [^112HUU5c] [^111TB35j].

---

Yes, patients can develop reactive arthritis following a C. difficile infection, though it is **rare** and most often reported in children and young adults [^115gBueL] [^111e8FrG]. The arthritis typically appears **1–4 weeks** after CDI, presenting as asymmetric oligoarthritis of the lower limbs, and is usually self-limited with NSAIDs; HLA-B27 positivity may increase risk [^115XC7vQ] [^116bDssQ] [^111fhnxc].

---

## Clinical evidence and epidemiology

- **Pediatric incidence**: A multicenter pediatric cohort found ReA in 1.4% of CDI cases (26/1,922), with a median onset of 14 days after CDI diagnosis [^115gBueL].

- **Adult cases**: Adult reports are limited to case reports and small series, suggesting ReA is rare but recognized after CDI [^111e8FrG] [^115XC7vQ].

- **Demographics**: ReA after CDI is more common in children and young adults, with a median age of 10 years in pediatric series [^115gBueL].

---

## Clinical features

Reactive arthritis following CDI **typically presents** with the following features [^116bDssQ] [^115gBueL]:

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Onset | 1–4 weeks after CDI |
| Joint involvement | Asymmetric oligoarthritis, predominantly affecting the lower limbs (knees, ankles, feet) |
| Systemic symptoms | - Fever <br/> - Malaise <br/> - Fatigue |
| Extra-articular manifestations | - Conjunctivitis <br/> - Urethritis <br/> - Skin rash (less common) |
| Laboratory findings | - Elevated ESR/CRP <br/> - Negative synovial cultures <br/> - HLA-B27 positivity in some cases |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The mechanisms of reactive arthritis following CDI are **not fully understood**. Proposed pathways include **molecular mimicry**, with immune cross-reactivity leading to autoimmune joint inflammation; deposition in the synovium of circulating immune complexes formed during CDI; and genetic susceptibility, with **HLA-B27 positivity** increasing risk [^117GNr3g] [^116n8vwQ] [^1173EFJe].

---

## Risk factors

The risk of reactive arthritis following CDI appears **higher in children and young adults** [^115gBueL]. **HLA-B27 positivity** is associated with increased susceptibility [^111fhnxc] [^1173EFJe], and severe or recurrent CDI may further elevate risk.

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis of reactive arthritis following CDI is **primarily clinical**, based on the following [^116bDssQ] [^111cen9S]:

- **Recent CDI**: Documented CDI within the preceding 1–4 weeks.

- **Arthritis**: Acute onset of asymmetric oligoarthritis, predominantly affecting lower limbs.

- **Exclusion of other causes**: Negative synovial cultures and exclusion of other infectious or inflammatory arthritides [^111cen9S].

- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), HLA-B27 positivity in some cases.

---

## Treatment and management

Management of reactive arthritis following CDI involves a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Appropriate antibiotic treatment for CDI (vancomycin or fidaxomicin) [^117X1dF1] [^115pnM2B].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: First-line therapy for arthritis symptoms [^111cen9S].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses of oral or intra-articular corticosteroids for severe or persistent arthritis [^111cen9S].

- **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: Methotrexate or sulfasalazine for chronic or refractory cases [^111cen9S].

- **Physical therapy**: Rehabilitation to maintain joint function and mobility [^116bDssQ].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most cases resolving within 3–6 months. Chronic arthritis persists in approximately 10–20% of cases, and recurrences are uncommon but may occur with recurrent CDI.

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **antibiotic stewardship** to reduce CDI risk and on strict infection control to prevent transmission. Early recognition and treatment of CDI may reduce complications [^115rzSJH] [^116MiHBW].

Reactive arthritis can develop following a **C. difficile infection**, particularly in children and young adults. It typically presents within 1–4 weeks after CDI, with asymmetric oligoarthritis of the lower limbs. The condition is usually self-limited and managed with NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and DMARDs if necessary [^115gBueL] [^115XC7vQ].

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^116ouNVd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Ten to twenty years ago, there was little interest in developing new treatment agents for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) because CDI in most patients responded to metronidazole or vancomycin therapy. The disease was common but more easily managed, and severe complicated cases of CDI were infrequent.

During the past decade, the epidemiology and clinical picture of CDI have changed dramatically, and the limitations of treatment options have become more apparent. Before the approval of fidaxomicin earlier this year, oral vancomycin was the only agent approved for the treatment of CDI in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Multiple dosing requirements, cost, relative efficacy, risk for recurrence, development of resistance, and adverse reactions limit other treatment options.

Here, we review the currently available CDI treatment agents with emphasis on their limitations and the general approach to managing recurrent CDI and severe complicated CDI.

### Clinical prediction rule for identifying older patients with toxigenic Clostridioides difficile at the time of hospital admission [^1162yXsv]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

In 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) as a dangerous pathogen that requires diligent monitoring and prevention activities. Although C. difficile infections (CDIs) have traditionally been considered to affect patients in healthcare facilities, the disease epidemiology seems to have shifted, with patients now presenting with community-onset CDI.

The clinical severity of CDIs ranges from an asymptomatic carrier state to life-threatening conditions. Asymptomatic carriers may serve as significant reservoirs for transmission to susceptible patients and the environment via direct or indirect contact. They are also six times more likely to develop subsequent symptomatic CDI than non-carriers.

Older age (≥ 65 years) is a crucial contributor to CDI development and severity because of age-related immunosenescence, an increase in the use of antibiotics, and frequent exposure to medical environments. Furthermore, previous epidemiological studies revealed that one out of three CDIs and two out of three healthcare-associated CDIs develop in patients aged 65 years or older. Advanced age is also significantly associated with CDI recurrence. However, data on the prevalence and risk factors for toxigenic C. difficile carriage on hospital admission in older populations are limited.

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the only diagnostic test for the detection of toxigenic C. difficile used in many studies and may result in CDI overdiagnosis. NAAT screening tools for CDI are, however, widely used.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade, with an emphasis on preventing reinfection. This review compares guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C. difficile infection (CDI), and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C. difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole, which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin, as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B, may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Symptomatic acute reactive arthritis after an outbreak of salmonella [^111fhnxc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

In 2005, 592 individuals in Ontario developed acute gastroenteritis predominantly after consuming bean sprouts contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis. Salmonella is a known trigger of reactive arthritis (ReA). We describe the population affected by the Salmonella outbreak in terms of clinical presentation of self-reported arthritic symptoms and HLA-B27 genotyping.

- **Methods**: Subjects were mailed a questionnaire, which assessed symptoms consistent with ReA. Subsequently, subjects were asked to submit saliva samples, which were analyzed for HLA-B27. Simple descriptive statistics were performed for analysis of survey responses, and the genetic component was analyzed by chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.

- **Results**: Most respondents were female (71.3%), with a mean age of 46.0 years. The mean duration of diarrhea symptoms was 16.5 days. 62.5% of respondents reported extraintestinal symptoms consistent with ReA. The most commonly reported features were joint pain, swelling or stiffness (46.2%), stiffness greater than 30 minutes (35.6%), ocular symptoms (24.0%), and visibly swollen joints (19.2%). Subjects with Salmonella infection had a similar incidence of HLA-B27, regardless of whether they developed symptoms consistent with ReA or not. Notably, HLA-B27 was present more frequently in those who developed Salmonella infection than in healthy controls (OR 3.0).

- **Conclusion**: The study, one of the largest for a dysenteric outbreak, revealed a high event rate of self-reported symptoms consistent with ReA in those infected with Salmonella. Our results showed that HLA-B27 may be associated with an increased propensity for developing reactive arthritis following Salmonella infection.

### Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection-associated reactive arthritis in children: An underdiagnosed, potentially morbid condition [^115gBueL]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection has increased among children, but the epidemiology of pediatric C. difficile infection-associated reactive arthritis is poorly understood. This study aims to characterize the incidence, recognition, and distinguishing clinical features of pediatric C. difficile infection-associated reactive arthritis among children with C. difficile infection.

In a cohort and nested case-control study, electronic health records from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2013, across three geographically diverse pediatric health care networks were analyzed. The study screened for reactive arthritis among 148 children aged 2 to 21 years, employing diagnostic or procedural codes indicating musculoskeletal disease associated with C. difficile diagnosis or positive testing. Twenty-six cases were identified presenting acute arthritis or tenosynovitis within 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after confirmed C. difficile infection, with no alternative explanation for arthritis and negative synovial cultures, if obtained. Network-matched C. difficile-infected controls without arthritis were randomly selected at the time of cohort member C. difficile infections.

The main outcomes measured were the incidence of C. difficile infection-associated reactive arthritis calculated based on the pediatric source population and children with C. difficile infection. Characteristics of cases and controls were compared using conditional logistic regression.

Based on the cases identified within the source population of the three hospital networks, the incidence estimate was calculated.

### Microbiota-based markers predictive of development of Clostridioides difficile infection [^113CP91A]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-induced modulation of the intestinal microbiota can lead to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally. Therefore, identification of markers predictive of CDI could substantially contribute to guiding therapy and decreasing the infection burden.

Here, we analyze the intestinal microbiota of hospitalized patients at increased CDI risk in a prospective, 90-day cohort study before and after antibiotic treatment and at diarrhea onset. We show that patients developing CDI already exhibit significantly lower diversity before antibiotic treatment and a distinct microbiota enriched in Enterococcus and depleted of Ruminococcus, Blautia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium compared to non-CDI patients. We find that antibiotic treatment-induced dysbiosis is class-specific, with beta-lactams further increasing enterococcal abundance.

Our findings, validated in an independent prospective patient cohort developing CDI, can be exploited to enrich for high-risk patients in prospective clinical trials and to develop predictive microbiota-based diagnostics for management of patients at risk for CDI.

### Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease [^117UZkNq]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a focus of increased attention as the C. difficile epidemic continues to grow. Although first documented more than 20 years ago, only in recent years has the relationship between these two entities been better clarified. Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that IBD patients are at increased susceptibility for CDI compared to the general population. Despite this increased attention, much still remains unknown and the overlapping clinical presentations of CDI and IBD pose barriers to diagnosis and standardized treatment. Moreover, given the relationship between mortality and severity of CDI in IBD patients, early recognition of those who are at increased risk for infection is of paramount importance to improve patient outcomes.

### Clostridium difficile is common in patients with postoperative diarrhea after hip and knee arthroplasty [^113SSWkN]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is an antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal infection that has detrimental consequences. We aimed to determine the incidence of C. difficile in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients with postoperative diarrhea, identify risk factors for C. difficile infection, and establish the incidence of C. difficile-related complications. Our institutional protocol involves screening all patients with diarrhea after TJA for C. difficile. Over four years, we identified 121 such patients, with twenty-eight (23%) testing positive for C. difficile. Revision arthroplasty and prolonged postoperative antibiotic use were identified as risk factors for C. difficile infection. With our protocol of screening and immediate treatment of C. difficile-positive patients, we observed no C. difficile-associated complications.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery-American Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines for management of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection in surgical patients: An executive summary [^116MiHBW]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). High credibility.

In the last three decades, the dramatic worldwide increase in incidence and severity of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) (formerly Clostridium difficile infection) has made CDI a global public health challenge. Surgery is a known risk factor for the development of CDI, yet surgery is also a treatment option in severe cases of CDI. The World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for management of CDI in surgical patients were published in 2015. In 2019, the guidelines were revised and updated according to the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation methodology. This executive summary is intended to consolidate knowledge on the management of CDI, focusing on aspects that a general and emergency surgeon should know about the prevention and management of CDI, by providing a practical and concise version of the original guidelines.

### Reactive arthritis [^111cen9S]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is classified as a spondyloarthropathy. The concept of the disease suggests an infectious trigger, followed by inflammatory arthritis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interaction between host susceptibility and microorganisms. Diagnosis relies on a compatible clinical syndrome and microbiologic confirmation of the pathogen. Antibiotic therapy appears useful in Chlamydia-triggered arthritis. However, the role of antibiotics in arthritis triggered by enteric pathogens is less clear. The role of tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors in therapy is evolving. Many patients experience a course limited to a few months, but others suffer from extraarticular disease and more prolonged courses.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Clostridioides difficile infection, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy for non-severe disease, the IDSA/SHEA 2021 guidelines recommend considering administering metronidazole 500 mg PO TID for 10 days as a second-line alternative in patients with an initial episode of non-severe CDI if fidaxomicin and vancomycin are unavailable. Avoid administering repeated or prolonged courses of metronidazole due to the risk of cumulative and potentially irreversible neurotoxicity.

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is unique as it is one of the few disease states with a known trigger. This insight into disease initiation has led to significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology. Despite this detailed knowledge, proper treatment remains elusive. In the years to come, it is possible that specific treatment will be dictated by the triggering microbe.

### Microbial factors in spondyloarthropathies: Insights from population studies [^1173EFJe]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Infections and genetics play a role in the development of reactive arthritis. The clinical manifestations and severity of the features depend on the triggering infections and the epidemiologic setting. Reports from hospital-based series show the lowest frequency of reactive arthritis. However, patients often have severe arthritis associated with a high frequency of HLA-B27. At the population level, reactive arthritis occurs in 7 to 15% of the infected subjects. The disease is usually mild, affects small joints, can be polyarticular, often rapidly disappears, and has a low association with HLA-B27. There also seems to be a change in the spectrum of triggering infections. Reports of Yersinia arthritis are less common, whereas arthritis associated with Campylobacter or Salmonella infections seems to be increasing. The role of early antimicrobial chemotherapy for the prevention of reactive arthritis needs further study.

### Development of Clostridium septicum gas gangrene as an adverse effect of clindamycin-induced Clostridium difficile infection in a pediatric patient [^115jttwa]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium myonecrosis, or gas gangrene, is a life-threatening infection characterized by either traumatic or atraumatic etiology. It has been widely described in patients with traumatic open wounds and in immunocompromised patients, including those with malignancy. A third source can result from the natural flora in the gastrointestinal tract after bowel ischemia. This is a rare occurrence and is even less commonly described in the pediatric population. We present a pediatric patient who developed Clostridium septicum myonecrosis as an iatrogenic complication from clindamycin-induced Clostridium difficile ischemic colitis.

### The transmission of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile with a one health perspective [^112EXjUm]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is a significant public health concern traditionally linked to health care settings. However, genomic evidence increasingly supports the spread of C. difficile across humans, animals, food, and the environment, with sources and reservoirs outside health care settings. Here, we review the transmission routes of C. difficile within a one health framework to uncover these complex interconnections. Understanding these pathways is essential for developing effective, integrated infection prevention and control strategies for health care and the community.

### The juncture between Clostridioides difficile infection and inflammatory bowel diseases [^113NW6Q2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The detection of Clostridioides difficile in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is a common occurrence, in part due to the standard clinical practice of testing for the presence of C. difficile during acute IBD exacerbations. Given the clinical overlap between C. difficile infections and acute IBD exacerbations (i.e. increased frequency of loose stools, abdominal pain), it is challenging to differentiate C. difficile infections from colonizations in patients with underlying IBD who test positive for C. difficile. Here, we review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of IBD patients with positive C. difficile tests.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The study CLOVER was published in 2024 in Clinical Infectious Diseases. This study focuses on Clostridioides difficile infection. The trial evaluated the role of a detoxified toxin A/B vaccine in adults at increased risk of C. difficile infection.

The design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving 17,440 patients (8,973 female, 8,467 male). Participants were adults aged ≥ 50 years at increased risk of C. difficile infection. Key exclusion criteria included having ≥ 1 confirmed prior C. difficile infection episode, prior C. difficile vaccination or monoclonal antibody therapy, known infection, any condition/treatment resulting in frequent diarrhea, or inability to respond to vaccination.

- **Interventions**:
	- 8,722 received the detoxified toxin A/B vaccine (PF-06425090, 200 mcg total toxoid in the deltoid at 0, 1, and 6 months).
	- 8,718 received a placebo (0.9% saline in the deltoid at 0, 1, and 6 months).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- No significant difference in the rate of first C. difficile infection episode ≥ 14 days after dose 3 (0.22% vs. 0.32%; VE 31, 96% CI -38.7 to 66.6).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in the rate of first C. difficile infection episode ≥ 14 days after dose 2 (0.31% vs. 0.43%; VE 28.6, 96% CI -28.4 to 61).
	- Significant decrease in median C. difficile infection duration (1 day vs. 4 days; AD -3 days, 95% CI -5.53 to -0.47).

### Clostridium difficile infection after total joint arthroplasty: who is at risk [^111FWkGK]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2008). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is a recognized postoperative complication; however, the exact risk factors for this condition after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remain unknown. This case-controlled study sought to identify the predisposing factors for this condition. There were 16 cases of C. difficile infections after 9,880 TJAs (0.16% incidence) between January 2001 and May 2006 at our institution. The cases were matched with 32 controls for month/year of surgery and surgeon. This study suggests that patients with deteriorated physical status or those who received more than one antibiotic after surgery are at a higher risk for developing C. difficile-associated diarrhea after TJA.

To explore the evidence for an association between penicillin allergy, antibiotic prescribing, and Clostridioides difficile (CDI) infection, recent findings have highlighted the differences in antibiotic prescribing for penicillin-allergic patients and its impact on the rates of C. difficile infection.

Penicillin allergy leads to higher incidences of prescriptions for antibiotics that predispose patients to CDI. Consequently, CDI is more common in patients with penicillin allergy. Additionally, penicillin allergy is often erroneously ascribed to patients and should be challenged.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^111FTKsk]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The recommended diagnostic approach has evolved over time from toxin-based assays to nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based testing, and currently to multistep testing. As the best-performing approach for diagnosis, the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines recommend using a stool toxin test as part of a two-step algorithm, unless institutions have developed other agreed-upon clinical and laboratory criteria for test submission, in which case detection of toxigenic C. difficile by NAAT alone is considered acceptable.

More recently, in 2021, the American College of Gastroenterologists developed guidelines for the preferred management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in adults. These guidelines are similar but differ slightly from the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines by recommending the use of testing algorithms that include a highly sensitive and a highly specific testing modality to distinguish colonization from active infection.

Despite societal guidance, testing practices for the diagnosis of C. difficile in children vary considerably, suggesting that further opportunities to improve diagnosis exist. Judicious testing of C. difficile ranks among one of the top 12 high-priority research topics in healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial stewardship by the CDC. Incorporation of clinical decision support around test ordering in electronic health records and preauthorization of testing are additional strategies successfully implemented by some institutions to improve appropriate test ordering.

Gaining in popularity, the use of multiplex gastrointestinal polymerase chain reaction panels that include C. difficile targets may unintentionally increase inappropriate testing.

### Reactive arthritis or chronic infectious arthritis [^116n8vwQ]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Microbes reach the synovial cavity either directly during bacteraemia or by transport within lymphoid cells or monocytes. This may stimulate the immune system excessively, triggering arthritis. Some forms of reactive arthritis correspond to slow infectious arthritis due to the persistence of microbes, and some to an infection-triggered arthritis linked to an extra-articular site of infection.

### Epidemiologic approaches to infection and immunity: The case of reactive arthritis [^112xbJBi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

There is significant evidence that infection and arthritis are linked, but the nature of this association is unclear. The goal of this review is to examine the case of reactive arthritis (ReA), an inflammatory arthritis with a clear infectious trigger. We will first examine the state of knowledge of ReA epidemiology and follow it with a discussion of the epidemiologic challenges that ReA studies face.

- **Recent findings**: Recent studies have examined outbreaks of gastroenteritis to try and elucidate the epidemiology of ReA. Some have found higher levels of self-reported arthritis than previously thought, and others have implicated organisms such as *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 that were not traditionally associated with ReA. There is also evidence that the severity of the initial infection may be associated with a higher relative risk of developing ReA. New population-based studies have further clarified the natural history of infection and subsequent ReA, demonstrating the power of community surveillance. Despite these findings, several methodological issues complicate the study of ReA. Problems include lack of standard diagnostic criteria, varying culture methods, selection bias, and difficulties in establishing a control population.

Recent studies have continued to increase our knowledge of the epidemiology of ReA. Addressing the multiple challenges that face the study of infection and arthritis will be very useful for future study.

### Reactive arthritis: An unusual presentation of acute colitis [^115XC7vQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old Caucasian man with a history of psoriasis presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of severe polyarthralgia and a 3-week history of non-bloody diarrhea. The initial workup, conducted 2 days prior in an urgent care clinic, returned negative results for all enteric pathogens, including the Clostridioides difficile nucleic acid amplification test. Further investigations revealed colitis on CT and pseudomembranous colitis on colonoscopy. The aspirate tested positive for C. difficile toxin. Tissue biopsies of the ascending, transverse, sigmoid colon, and rectum were negative for chronicity, ruling out inflammatory bowel disease with extraintestinal manifestations as the cause of polyarthralgia. Until that point, this had been the most likely differential diagnosis. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of reactive arthritis associated with C. difficile colitis. The patient improved with treatment using naproxen and was subsequently referred to rheumatology, where he was found to be HLA-B27 positive.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111uyzW1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The clinical success of fecal transplants to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile is an encouraging development for the treatment of this disease as well as other diseases associated with microbiota dysbiosis. The transplant's mechanism of action in C. difficile infection is postulated to involve the transplanted bacteria directly altering the intestinal environment to render it inhospitable for C. difficile. In this report, we find that successful engraftment of transplanted bacteria is dependent on the immune status of the recipient. Specifically, immunodeficient hosts that lack CD4 + Foxp3 + T regulatory cells fail to resolve C. difficile infection following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Persistent C. difficile infection in Rag1 −/− mice or Foxp3 + T regulatory cell-depleted mice led to exacerbated induction of inflammatory mediators in the large intestine compared to immunocompetent littermates. These FMT non-responsive mice exhibited impaired engraftment of the donor bacterial populations. Engraftment failure resulted in an inability to restore intestinal metabolite levels to pre-infection concentrations and ultimately failure to resolve C. difficile infection.

Foxp3 + T regulatory cells serve an important role in maintaining a balance in limiting host inflammation in the intestine. Unchecked, inflammatory mediators produced by the host may inhibit specific transplanted bacteria critical for the resolution of C. difficile infection. Host-derived inflammatory byproducts can be exploited by pathogens and bystander commensal species alike to promote their growth. For example, Baumler and colleagues observed that host production of reactive oxygen and related compounds is one such mechanism.

The influence of such treatment on non-genital aspects of sexually acquired reactive arthritis remains uncertain. It is acknowledged that antimicrobial treatment may reduce the risk of developing reactive arthritis in patients with a history of this condition, but it is unlikely to have an effect once arthritis has manifested.

### Microbiota-based markers predictive of development of Clostridioides difficile infection [^116Uw2St]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-induced modulation of the intestinal microbiota can lead to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally. Therefore, identification of markers predictive of CDI could substantially contribute to guiding therapy and decreasing the infection burden. Here, we analyze the intestinal microbiota of hospitalized patients at increased CDI risk in a prospective, 90-day cohort study before and after antibiotic treatment and at diarrhea onset. We show that patients developing CDI already exhibit significantly lower diversity before antibiotic treatment and a distinct microbiota enriched in Enterococcus and depleted of Ruminococcus, Blautia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium compared to non-CDI patients. We find that antibiotic treatment-induced dysbiosis is class-specific, with beta-lactams further increasing enterococcal abundance. Our findings, validated in an independent prospective patient cohort developing CDI, can be exploited to enrich for high-risk patients in prospective clinical trials and to develop predictive microbiota-based diagnostics for management of patients at risk for CDI.

### Asymptomatic and yet C. difficile-toxin positive? Prevalence and risk factors of carriers of toxigenic Clostridium difficile among geriatric in-patients [^112wPy2H]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) are the most frequent cause of diarrhea in hospitals. Geriatric patients are more often affected by the condition, by a relapse, and complications. Therefore, a crucial question is how often colonization with toxigenic Clostridium difficile strains occurs in elderly patients without diarrhea and whether there is a "risk pattern" of colonized patients that can be defined by geriatric assessment. Furthermore, the probability for those asymptomatic carriers to develop a symptomatic infection over time has not been sufficiently explored.

- **Methods**: We performed a cohort study design to assess the association of clinical variables with Clostridium difficile colonization. The first stool sample of 262 consecutive asymptomatic patients admitted to a geriatric unit was tested for toxigenic Clostridium difficile using PCR (GeneXpert, Cepheid). A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), including the Barthel Index, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and hand grip-strength, was performed. In addition, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, number and length of previous hospital stays, previous treatment with antibiotics, institutionalization, primary diagnoses, and medication were recorded and evaluated as possible risk factors of colonization by means of binary logistic regression. Secondly, we explored the association of C. difficile colonization with the subsequent development of CDI during the hospital stay.

- **Results**: At admission, 43 (16.4%) patients tested positive for toxin B by PCR. Seven (16.3%) of these colonized patients developed symptomatic infection during their hospital stay.

### Validation of an ELISA for the diagnosis of recent Campylobacter infections in Guillain-Barré and reactive arthritis patients [^115y1o5z]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Weeks or months following a Campylobacter infection, a small proportion of infected individuals develop Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or reactive arthritis (ReA). Stool culture for Campylobacter often returns negative in these patients. Therefore, serology is the preferred method for diagnosing a recent infection with Campylobacter. This study developed a capture ELISA system to detect anti-Campylobacter IgA and IgM antibodies indicative of a recent infection.

The sensitivity of the assay was:

- **82.0%** in uncomplicated Campylobacter enteritis patients
- **96.2%** in GBS patients who were culture-positive for Campylobacter
- **93.1%** in culture-positive ReA patients

The specificity was 93.0%. The assay facilitates identification of Campylobacter infection in patients with post-infectious neurological and rheumatological complications.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^1163tU14]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Given the intrinsic nature of case reports, it is unclear how generalizable these findings are. High variability in patient characteristics, diagnosis, examinations, and treatment were evident. Established diagnostic or classification criteria for reactive arthritis are missing, and a deeper understanding of the immune mechanism related to COVID-19 may offer a useful opportunity to further investigate the immunopathogenetic mechanisms capable of promoting or contrasting the development of specific rheumatic diseases.

Concluding, low-quality evidence suggests that COVID-19 can target the musculoskeletal system, causing reactive arthritis in its post-infectious stage. Caution should be used while managing post-infectious COVID-19 patients with arthralgia. It is unclear whether this condition can be prevented, whether previous vaccinations exert a preventive effect, and what the long-term sequelae of COVID-19-related reactive arthritis are.

### What is the current role of algorithmic approaches for diagnosis of clostridium difficile infection [^1173psYS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

With the recognition of several serious outbreaks of Clostridium difficile infection in the industrialized world, coupled with the development of new testing technologies for the detection of this organism, there has been renewed interest in the laboratory diagnosis of C. difficile infection. Two factors seem to have driven much of this interest.

First, the recognition that immunoassays for the detection of C. difficile toxins A and B, which for many years were the most widely used tests for C. difficile infection diagnosis, were perhaps not as sensitive as previously believed, at a time when attributed deaths to C. difficile infections were showing a remarkable rise.

Second, the availability of FDA-approved commercial and laboratory-developed PCR assays, which could detect toxigenic strains of C. difficile, provided a novel and promising testing approach for diagnosing this infection.

In this point-counterpoint on the laboratory diagnosis of C. difficile infection, we have asked two experts in C. difficile infection diagnosis: Ferric Fang, who has recently published two articles in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology advocating the use of PCR as a standalone test, and Mark Wilcox, who played a key role in developing the IDSA/SHEA guidelines on Clostridium difficile infection, along with his colleague, Tim Planche, to address the following question: what is the role of algorithmic approaches to the diagnosis of C. difficile infection?

The prevalence of Clostridium difficile colitis is reportedly increasing in surgical patients and can negatively impact their outcomes. However, there are no clear estimates of the C. difficile infection colitis rate and its consequences among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA).

- **Questions/purposes**: We asked: (1) What is the rate of C. difficile colitis in TJA patients? (2) What are the risk factors for C. difficile colitis in these patients? and (3) What is the effect of C. difficile colitis on length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and estimated total charges?

- **Methods**: Using ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes, we queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for patients undergoing TJA for the years 2002 to 2010. Demographic data, comorbidities, occurrence of C. difficile colitis, length of hospital stay, mortality, and hospital charges were extracted. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of C. difficile colitis and its impact on in-hospital mortality.

- **Results**: The incidence of C. difficile remained less than 0.6% during the study period. Revision TJAs (odds ratio = 6.9 and 4.4 for hip and knee, respectively) and number of comorbidities (odds ratio = 1.5) increased the risk of C. difficile colitis. C. difficile increased the length of hospital stay by a week, hospital charges by USD 40,000, and in-hospital mortality to 4.66% from 0.24%.

- **Conclusions**: Using lower and fewer doses of antibiotics in revision TJAs and among patients with many comorbidities may diminish the risk of C. difficile colitis and its consequent mortality.

### Quo vadis reactive arthritis [^111e8FrG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

We provide an overview of recent articles which describe new thinking regarding HLA-B27-associated reactive arthritis (ReA), including those additional infection-related arthritides triggered by microbes that often are grouped under the term ReA.

With the advent and continuation of the pandemic, an increasing number of cases and case series of post-COVID-19 arthritis have been reported and classified as ReA. Further, arthritis after COVID-19 vaccination is a new entity included within the spectrum of ReA. New causative microorganisms identified in case reports include Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Giardia lamblia, Leptospira, and babesiosis. SARS-CoV-2 is emerging as a significant etiologic agent for apparent ReA.

It is now clear that comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigations, synovial fluid analyses, and close follow-up of patients are all essential to differentiate ReA from diseases that may present with similar clinical attributes. Further, and importantly, additional research is required to define the wide diversity in causative agents, epidemiology, and rare case presentations of these arthritides. Finally, new classification and diagnostic criteria, and updated treatment recommendations, are essential to the advancement of our understanding of ReA.

### Translational aspects of the immunology of Clostridioides difficile infection: Implications for pediatric populations [^1152T5FF]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile has become the most common healthcare-associated pathogen in the United States, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to classify C. difficile as an "urgent" public health threat that requires "urgent and aggressive action". This call to action has led to new discoveries that have advanced our understanding of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) immunology and the clinical development of immunologic-based therapies for CDI prevention.

However, CDI immunology research has been limited in pediatric populations, and several unanswered questions remain regarding the function of host immune response in pediatric CDI pathogenesis and the potential role of immunologic-based therapies in children. This review summarizes the innate and adaptive immune responses previously characterized in animals and humans and provides an update on the clinical development of immunologic-based therapies for CDI prevention in both adults and children. These data inform future research needs for children.
