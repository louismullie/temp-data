## Question

What about non union?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fracture non-union — what it is, how it differs from delayed union, core pathophysiology and classification, epidemiology and risk factors, diagnostic workup including infection assessment, treatment principles by etiology, special anatomic scenarios, and emerging technologies and controversies, with attention to where the evidence is strong versus limited. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining non-union and how it differs from delayed union. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology and classification that drive treatment. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors, followed by a careful diagnostic workup including infection assessment. After that, I should outline treatment principles by etiology, consider special anatomic scenarios, and finally appraise emerging technologies and controversies, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus limited.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on a single time threshold. Non-union is generally a fracture that fails to heal after a prolonged period without progressive healing, with many clinicians using greater than 9 months without signs of progression, though some diagnose at 6 months if further healing is unlikely; importantly, delayed union and non-union are related but not necessarily on the same spectrum, and the distinction matters for management decisions [^111m22br] [^1164uzy1].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology and classification because treatment hinges on this. Non-union reflects a failure of normal endochondral and intramembranous healing due to mechanical instability, biological insufficiency, or infection; classically, hypertrophic non-unions have adequate biology but insufficient stability, atrophic non-unions have poor biology, and oligotrophic non-unions have both deficits, with infection present in roughly 40% of non-unions and sometimes occult on routine testing, which can derail fixation strategies if missed [^116emLrV] [^116cnbWq] [^1164uzy1] [^112kndoU].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors to frame prevention and counseling. Non-union occurs in about 2–5% of fractures overall, with higher risk in tibia, femur, humerus, forearm, and clavicle; major risk factors include open fractures, high-energy patterns, segmental or comminuted injury, displacement, poor vascular zones, inadequate fixation, smoking, diabetes, malnutrition, NSAIDs (notably indomethacin for heterotopic ossification prophylaxis), and infection, with tibial fractures particularly vulnerable due to soft-tissue envelope and perfusion constraints [^112WcJYK] [^114ysPtp] [^114TTY9S] [^111wtdvM].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss infection or metabolic contributors. A systematic workup includes clinical assessment for pain, motion, and deformity; radiographs and CT to define callus, gap, and implant status; targeted labs including CBC, ESR/CRP, hemoglobin A1c, TSH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and albumin; and, when infection is suspected but not obvious, advanced imaging such as FDG-PET/CT can differentiate infected from aseptic non-union with high accuracy, while MRI may be limited by hardware artifact and specificity issues; I should also consider that NaF PET/CT may detect ongoing osteoblastic activity in some labeled non-unions, suggesting potential for healing with expectant management in select cases [^111m22br] [^111yz78N] [^111R36L6] [^111R36L6] [^114uEfqZ].

> I will now examine treatment principles, starting with hypertrophic non-unions where stability is the key. Let me think about mechanical optimization: revision internal fixation with stiffer constructs, compression plating, exchange nailing, or staged external fixation can convert motion to stability and permit biology to complete healing; Judet decortication can enhance local biology when combined with stable fixation, and external fixation remains invaluable for complex deformity correction, bone transport, and staged reconstructions [^116YcAbm] [^1168Z8UT] [^1164uzy1] [^115HNNSA].

> For atrophic non-unions, I should confirm that both biology and stability must be addressed. Debridement of fibrous tissue, autologous iliac crest bone graft as the gold standard, and biologic augmentation with BMPs or cellular therapies are reasonable, with BMPs offering comparable union rates to autograft in selected indications; I need to ensure I also correct fixation if it is suboptimal, and consider adjuvant modalities such as LIPUS or electromagnetic stimulation when appropriate, acknowledging that evidence quality varies and shared decision-making is essential [^111FVv1q] [^116rPZHB] [^116nST6W] [^115nUcv7] [^113AARhx].

> But wait, what if infection is present? I should double-check that eradication comes before fixation. Infected non-unions require aggressive debridement, implant removal when biofilm is suspected, pathogen-directed antibiotics, and often staged reconstruction with an antibiotic spacer or external fixation until the biologic and mechanical milieu is safe for definitive fixation; a multidisciplinary team improves outcomes, and FDG-PET/CT can guide the extent of infection and the need for staged procedures [^112kndoU] [^114q1Mk9] [^115ySCk5].

> Let me consider special anatomic scenarios where nuances matter. In tibial non-unions, algorithmic care that matches biology and mechanics achieves high union rates, and in distal tibial oligotrophic or atrophic non-unions, augmentation plating without routine bone graft can succeed when the unified bone-healing theory is applied; in clavicle, AAOS guidelines support operative fixation for displaced midshaft fractures to improve union rates and early outcomes, though long-term function is similar, and adolescents often do as well with non-operative care; in scaphoid, vascularized grafts outperform nonvascularized when avascular necrosis is present; in rib non-unions, surgical stabilization yields high union and symptom relief in appropriately selected patients; in hip fractures, non-operative management is associated with markedly higher mortality and should be reserved for carefully selected palliative contexts [^111t2N8g] [^116H3vX1] [^113iW8Lw] [^116JaSru] [^111gJsAK] [^117URAGH] [^11466WGP] [^1146wZnM].

> Next, I should review emerging technologies and controversies with a cautious lens. LIPUS shows mixed results across trials and guidelines, so I need to ensure it is offered as an adjunct with transparent counseling; electromagnetic stimulation remains controversial with low-certainty evidence; BMPs are effective alternatives to autograft in selected cases but cost and off-label considerations apply; stem cell and cellular therapies are promising but largely investigational; and NaF PET/CT may redefine some non-unions as still biologically active, supporting selective non-operative management when aligned with patient goals and pain status [^115nUcv7] [^113AARhx] [^116rPZHB] [^113s7UtB] [^114uEfqZ].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention and early detection strategies because they change outcomes. Optimizing fixation quality, addressing modifiable risks like smoking and glycemic control, and avoiding prolonged NSAIDs with known anti-osteogenic effects in certain contexts are prudent; structured follow-up with interval imaging for high-risk fractures such as scaphoid and tibia helps catch delayed union before it becomes non-union, and standardized scoring systems like NUSS can aid decision-making and prognostication, though validation is ongoing [^114ysPtp] [^111wtdvM] [^115fKw2P] [^112EeXH5].

> In summary, I need to ensure that management is individualized: diagnose non-union accurately and distinguish it from delayed union, classify the biology and stability, rule out infection with appropriate tests, correct the dominant deficit with the least morbid effective strategy, and leverage emerging tools judiciously while communicating uncertainties; when in doubt, referral to centers with expertise in limb reconstruction and infection management is wise, as outcomes improve with experience and multidisciplinary care [^111t2N8g] [^1164uzy1] [^114q1Mk9].

Non-union is the **failure of a fracture to heal** after an adequate period (typically ≥ 6–9 months) [^111m22br] without progressive healing on serial imaging. It is a **multifactorial problem** driven by mechanical instability, impaired biology, or infection [^112QDpzd], with major risk factors including open fractures, smoking, diabetes, poor fixation, and tibial or femoral location [^114ysPtp]. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) [^111yz78N], with infection workup (CRP, ESR, FDG-PET/CT) when suspected [^115ySCk5]. Management is tailored: hypertrophic non-unions need improved stability [^116cnbWq]; atrophic non-unions need biologic augmentation (autograft, BMP) [^116cnbWq] [^111FVv1q]; infected non-unions require debridement, antibiotics, and staged reconstruction [^111m22br] [^1164uzy1]. Surgical union rates are high (80–100%) [^116nST6W], but complications and socioeconomic burden are substantial; prevention focuses on optimizing fixation, biology, and infection control [^113rLvLZ] [^114q1Mk9].

---

## Definition and classification

Non-union is defined as a fracture that fails to heal despite adequate time and treatment, typically **≥ 6–9 months** [^111m22br] without progressive healing on serial radiographs [^111m22br]. Classification is by biology and mechanics: **hypertrophic** (excess callus, instability), **atrophic** (poor callus, biologic deficit), and **infected** (ongoing infection) [^114bjjbM] [^116cnbWq].

---

## Pathophysiology

Non-union reflects a failure of normal healing due to **mechanical instability**, **biologic insufficiency**, or **infection** [^112QDpzd]. Mechanical instability from inadequate fixation or excessive motion inhibits callus maturation [^116cnbWq]. Biologic insufficiency from poor vascularity, malnutrition, smoking, diabetes, or medications (e.g. NSAIDs, bisphosphonates) impairs osteogenesis [^114ysPtp] [^116emLrV] [^112WcJYK]. Infection, particularly with biofilm-forming organisms, perpetuates inflammation and osteolysis, preventing union [^111m22br].

---

## Risk factors

Non-union risk is **multifactorial**; key factors include:

| **Category** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Smoking [^114ysPtp] <br/> - Diabetes [^notfound] <br/> - Malnutrition <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Age <br/> - Medications (NSAIDs, bisphosphonates) [^111wtdvM] [^116emLrV] |
| Injury-related | - Open fractures [^114ysPtp] <br/> - Comminution [^114ysPtp] <br/> - Displacement <br/> - High-energy trauma <br/> - Soft-tissue injury |
| Treatment-related | - Inadequate fixation [^114ysPtp] <br/> - Infection [^114ysPtp] <br/> - Delayed treatment <br/> - Poor reduction |

---

Bone-specific risks include the **tibia, femur, humerus, clavicle, and scaphoid** [^114TTY9S] [^117URAGH].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and imaging modalities

Diagnosis integrates clinical and imaging data: **clinical features** include persistent pain, motion at the fracture site, and functional impairment [^111m22br]. Imaging includes serial radiographs showing no progression, CT delineating callus and gap, and MRI assessing bone viability and infection [^111JhR7u]. Infection workup uses CRP, ESR, and FDG-PET/CT when infection is suspected [^115ySCk5].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment is **tailored** to etiology, biology, and patient factors:

- **Hypertrophic non-union**: Improve stability with revision fixation (plate, nail, external fixator) [^116cnbWq].
- **Atrophic non-union**: Add biologic stimulus with autologous bone graft, BMPs, or mesenchymal stem cells [^111FVv1q] [^111qAfwc].
- **Infected non-union**: Debridement, pathogen-specific antibiotics, and staged reconstruction (often with external fixation) [^115HNNSA] [^111m22br] [^1164uzy1].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) [^115nUcv7] and electromagnetic stimulation may aid selected cases, though evidence varies [^111nLk2K] [^113AARhx].

---

## Outcomes and complications

Surgical management achieves **union rates of 80–100%** [^116nST6W], but complications are common, including infection, implant failure, and persistent pain [^1168Z8UT]. Non-union imposes substantial socioeconomic costs due to prolonged disability, repeated surgeries, and healthcare utilization [^112sqvLR].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **optimizing fixation** — stable, biologically friendly constructs with early mobilization [^112QDpzd] — and on **optimizing biology** by managing comorbidities, smoking cessation, nutrition, and infection prophylaxis [^114TTY9S]. Early recognition and intervention for delayed union can prevent progression to non-union [^116emLrV].

---

Non-union is a complex failure of fracture healing with **multifactorial causes**; **management is etiology-specific** and yields high union rates, but prevention through optimal fixation, biology, and infection control is essential to reduce burden [^116NdXys].

### Risk factors for long bone fracture non-union: a stratification approach based on the level of the existing scientific evidence [^114ysPtp]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Non-union continues to be the most devastating complication after fracture fixation. Its treatment can be prolonged and often unpredictable. The burden to the patient, surgeon and health care system can be immense. Strategies to prevent it and or identify early its development are desirable in order to improve the clinical course of the affected patients and their outcomes. We undertook a systematic review of the literature in order to identify the most common and important risk factors based on the hierarchy of level of evidence. Accordingly, a stratification scale was formed which highlighted 10 risk factors including; an open method of fracture reduction, open fracture, presence of post-surgical fracture gap, smoking, infection, wedge or comminuted types of fracture, high degree of initial fracture displacement, lack of adequate mechanical stability provided by the implant used, fracture location in the poor zone of vascularity of the affected bone, and the presence of the fracture in the tibia. Clinicians should take in to account these findings when managing patients with long bone fractures, particularly the femur and tibia in order to minimise the risk of non-union.

### Clinical management and innovation in fracture non-union [^116e8gyR]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the introduction and continuous improvement in operative fracture fixation, even the most severe bone fractures can be treated with a high rate of successful healing. However, healing complications can occur and when healing fails over prolonged time, the outcome is termed a fracture non-union. Non-union is generally believed to develop due to inadequate fixation, underlying host-related factors, or infection. Despite the advancements in fracture fixation and infection management, there is still a clear need for earlier diagnosis, improved prediction of healing outcomes and innovation in the treatment of non-union.

Areas Covered

This review provides a detailed description of non-union from a clinical perspective, including the state of the art in diagnosis, treatment, and currently available biomaterials and orthobiologics. Subsequently, recent translational development from the biological, mechanical, and infection research fields are presented, including the latest in smart implants, osteoinductive materials, and in silico modeling.

Expert Opinion

The first challenge for future innovations is to refine and to identify new clinical factors for the proper definition, diagnosis, and treatment of non-union. However, integration of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico research will enable a comprehensive understanding of non-union causes and correlations, leading to the development of more effective treatments.

### A scoping review of operative and non-invasive management in the treatment of non-unions [^116nST6W]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-union occurs when a fracture fails to adequately heal, and requires additional intervention to achieve union. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide a high-level overview of the existing non-union management literature. This review aims to highlight the current literature on non-union management, as well as identify key areas that require future research to provide a better understanding of potential non-union management strategies.

Methods

This study utilized the scoping review framework from Arksey and O'Malley All relevant literature on non-union management was systematically searched for within the OVID Medline, OVID Embase, and Web of Science databases. As a scoping review, this study aimed to identify the high-level trends in non-union literature. This was assessed through a visual and numerical summary of the general themes in non-union literature, as well as the timeline in which these trends have occurred.

Results

The literature search identified 8081 articles, of which 2210 articles were included. There is a large body of evidence for various surgical treatment options for non-union. The literature suggests healing rates between 80 and 100 percent for commonly utilized surgical procedures, such as plating with bone graft for long bones. Despite these beneficial healing rates, the requirement of a surgery creates a large socioeconomic burden. The possibility for bone growth stimulator (BGS) options to achieve non-union healing rates in a similar realm as surgical options suggests that the use of a BGS may be a beneficial option prior to surgical intervention, as this would potentially reduce the number of patients who would otherwise require surgery.

Conclusion

A large body of evidence exists on non-union management, which is largely comprised of case series and reports. The most commonly assessed non-unions include the tibia, wrist, and femur. Bone grafting, plating, and nailing are the most investigated treatment options. BGS are a non-operative treatment options for non-union that provide similar healing rates to surgical options in certain indications within initial observational data. BGS are a potential option for non-operative management of non-unions to reduce socioeconomic burdens of surgical intervention, with a need for further high-quality investigation in this therapeutic area.

### Surgical treatment of non-unions: a case for internal fixation [^116YcAbm]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Non-unions present a particular challenge to the fracture surgeon and are frequently underestimated by the average practitioner. Although the use of ring fixation techniques is gaining in popularity, there remains a definite role for the use of bone grafting and plate fixation within certain clinical situations. The role of decortication, or petalling, as part of the surgical approach, is emphasized. This review addresses the basic considerations in choosing to use internal fixation to manage non-unions and outlines some of the principles of these techniques. Case examples are presented.

### Classification of non-union [^113rLvLZ]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

A substantial number of experimental and clinical studies have established that the cornerstones for successful bone-healing are biomechanical stability and biological vitality of the bone, as they both provide an environment in which new bone can be formed. Non-union of long bones is a significant consequence in treating fractures. Many approaches to prevent fracture non-union have been proposed. Depending on the type and location of the non-union, treatment options include various types of bone fixation, with or without supplemental bone graft or other biophysical enhancements.

### Prevalence of long-bone non-unions [^114hyhob]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the enormous progress made during recent decades in the treatment of long-bone fractures, fracture healing is still haunted by complications and above all non-unions. Non-unions represent a particular challenge, and the difficulties surrounding their management are frequently underestimated. Knowledge of the epidemiology of long-bone non-union can assist the treating surgeon in the application of the optimum fracture treatment.

### The role of electromagnetic stimulation in the management of established non-union of long bone fractures: what is the evidence? [^111nLk2K]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-union following long bone fractures is a cause of significant morbidity to the patient. The management of this condition has proved difficult for the orthopaedic surgeon. Much research has been carried out on the use of electromagnetic stimulation in the healing of non-union.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to determine what evidence exists to support electromagnetic stimulation in the management of established non-union of long bone fractures.

Methods

A systematic search was carried out of the peer-reviewed English language literature to identify all studies investigating electromagnetic stimulation in the treatment of non-union of fractures of long bones.

Results

Three of the articles reviewed were randomised clinical trials. Forty-six other studies were also included in the review.

Conclusions

There is a consensus that electromagnetic stimulation is an effective adjunct to conventional therapy when used in the management of non-union of long bone fractures.

### Critical analysis and efficacy of BMPs in long bones non-union [^116rPZHB]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Non-union of long bone fractures is considered as multifactorial. The management of this entity continues to be difficult often requiring multiple procedures with unpredictable results. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are power agents being used in the clinical setting for a variety of pathological conditions where tissue regeneration is required. This article analyses the currently existing evidence of the efficacy of BMPs for the management of non-union of long bone fractures.

### Non-union: indications for external fixation [^1164uzy1]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

External fixation is currently used as the definitive mode of fracture stabilisation in the management of ˜50% of long-bone non-unions. Distinction between non-union and delayed union is a diagnostic dilemma especially in fractures healing by primary bone repair. This distinction is important, as non-unions are not necessarily part of the same spectrum as delayed unions. The aetiology of a fracture non-union is usually multifactorial and the factors can be broadly categorized into mechanical factors, biological (local and systemic) factors, and infection. Infection is present in ˜40% of fracture non-unions, often after open fractures or impaired wound healing, but in 5% of all non-unions infection is present without any clinical or serological suspicion. General indications for external fixation include clinical scenarios where; 1) percutaneous correction of alignment, or mechanical stimulation of the non-union site is required; 2) fixation of juxta-articular or 'emmental' bone fragments is necessary; and 3) staged bone or soft tissue reconstruction is anticipated. Specific anatomical indications include infected non-unions of the tibia, humerus, and juxta-articular bone. External fixation is an essential tool in the management of fracture non-unions. However, with greater understanding of the outcomes associated with both external and internal fixation the relative indications are now being refined.

### Multidisciplinary approach and host optimization for fracture-related infection management [^114q1Mk9]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

In orthopaedic trauma, fracture-related infections (FRI) are still dreadful challenges that can cause non-union, amputation and even death. Standardization of general treatment strategies for FRI is still lacking. Due to the complexity of FRI, a multidisciplinary approach addressing host status, state of the fracture and causative microorganism has been applied in the management of FRI. Surgical treatment, antibiotic therapy and host optimization for FRI were summarized and discussed. The goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of current approaches of FRI management and to make suggestions on FRI prevention and treatment based on multidisciplinary principles.

### Non-union bone fractures [^116NdXys]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

The human skeleton has remarkable regenerative properties, being one of the few structures in the body that can heal by recreating its normal cellular composition, orientation and mechanical strength. When the healing process of a fractured bone fails owing to inadequate immobilization, failed surgical intervention, insufficient biological response or infection, the outcome after a prolonged period of no healing is defined as non-union. Non-union represents a chronic medical condition not only affecting function but also potentially impacting the individual's psychosocial and economic well-being. This Primer provides the reader with an in-depth understanding of our contemporary knowledge regarding the important features to be considered when faced with non-union. The normal mechanisms involved in bone healing and the factors that disrupt the normal signalling mechanisms are addressed. Epidemiological considerations and advances in the diagnosis and surgical therapy of non-union are highlighted and the need for greater efforts in basic, translational and clinical research are identified.

### Orthopaedic traumatology: fundamental principles and current controversies for the acute care surgeon [^111m22br]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Fracture non-unions

When there is inadequate healing, a fracture non-union may result. The strict definition of a non-union is a fracture older than 9 months without progressive healing for three consecutive months. Orthopedic surgeons, however, may diagnose a non-union in as little as 6 months if they are convinced that without intervention there is no further potential for healing. The risk of non-union is approximately 5% and is related to the degree of displacement, surrounding tissue damage, anatomic location and patient characteristics. A diagnosis of non-union should be considered if there is persistent pain, progressive deformity, failing implants or no radiographic evidence of healing if using indirect methods. If the fracture does not heal, any implant that has been placed will ultimately fail.

Non-unions are further described as either infected or aseptic. The workup for a non-union includes infectious (white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein) and endocrinology labs (hemoglobin A1c, thyroid-stimulating hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, albumin). If there is an infected non-union, the ideal scenario would be to remove the implants because there is a biofilm created by bacteria, and without removal, the organisms will with few exceptions never be fully eradicated. Once an infection is identified, empiric antibiotics may be started if the patient is demonstrating evidence of sepsis. If the patient does not have signs or symptoms of systemic illness, antibiotics should be reserved for surgical debridement and intraoperative cultures in order to tailor to culture-specific sensitivities. During surgery, local antibiotics can also be delivered in the form of antibiotic impregnated devices (cement beads, intramedullary nails or calcium sulfate).

### Management of non-union of rib fractures secondary to trauma: a scoping review [^11466WGP]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Rib fracture non-union is an uncommon complication of traumatic rib fractures. Our objective was to perform a scoping review of the literature for the management of rib fracture non-union. This included analysis of the variations in surgical technique, complications experienced, and reported outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review and searched databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase). We performed abstract and full-text screening, and abstracted data related to pre-operative assessment, surgical technique, complications, and reported outcome measures.

Results

We included 29 articles of which 19 were case reports and 10 were case series. The data quality was generally heterogeneous. The studies included 229 patients and the commonest symptoms of rib fracture non-union included chest pain, clicking, dyspnea and deformities. The patients underwent surgical management of rib fracture non-union (excluding first rib fractures) using various techniques. The majority used surgical stabilization of rib fracture with or without a graft. The reported outcomes were inconsistent between studies, but showed high rates of union (> 94%), reduction in reported VAS scores, and improved return to work when included. Implant failure occurred in 10% of the 229 total patients reported in our studies, the re-operation rate was 13%, and the overall complication rate was 27%.

Conclusion

Surgical management of rib fracture non-union often involving locking plates and screws with or without a graft has been shown in several case reports and series as an effective treatment with acceptable implant failure and complication rates. Surgical management is therefore a viable option for symptomatic patients. Further research is required to determine optimal management strategies that further reduce surgical complications for these patients.

### Treatment of non-unions with bone defects: which Option And why? [^115BNVtF]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Bone defects associated with non-unions occur as a result of the initial insult or as a consequence of bone excision following non-union development. Historically management of this clinical scenario consisted mainly of amputation, which provided a short recovery period but a significant loss of limb function. Today treatment has evolved and multiple options are available for reconstruction of the bone defect. Broadly these are: bone shortening with lengthening later or bone transport and 'docking' (distraction osteogenesis based techniques); the use of vascularised and non-vascularised bone grafts; bone substitutes; stem cells; growth factors; scaffolds and gene therapy.

### Classification of non-union: need for a new scoring system? [^1117NDWd]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Summary

A new scoring system is proposed in order to assist surgeons with the complex analysis associated with non-union surgery. Patients with non-union are rarely easily compared with one another and this has frustrated research in this field. We have therefore attributed values to clinical features based on clinical experience and research evidence, so that patients of similar complexity can be compared with one another. When greater experience with this scoring system has been gained it will be further refined and validated. We propose that surgeons with a sub specialist interest in non-union surgery use this system in reporting results, and that non- specialist surgeons use it to inform their decision to treat the fracture themselves, or refer to a sub specialist.

### The association between patient education level and economic status on outcomes following surgical management of (fracture) non-union [^114zXMEv]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Socioeconomic disparities are an inherent and currently unavoidable aspect of medicine. Knowledge of these disparities is an essential component towards medical decision making, particularly among an increasingly diverse population. While healthcare disparities have been elucidated in a wide variety of orthopaedic conditions and management options, they have not been established among patients who present for treatment of an ununited fracture. The purpose of this study is to answer the following questions: 1) Following surgical management of (fracture) non-unions, are there differences in outcomes between differing ethnic groups? 2) Following surgical management of (fracture) non-unions, are there differences in outcomes between patients with differing education levels? 3) Following surgical management of (fracture) non-unions, are there differences in outcome between patients with differing incomes?

Methods

Between September 2004 and December 2017, operatively treated patients who presented with a long bone fracture non-union were prospectively followed. These patients presented with a variety of fracture non-unions that underwent surgical intervention. Sociodemographic factors were recorded at presentation. Long-term outcomes were evaluated using the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), pain scores, post-operative complications and physical exam at latest follow up. The SMFA is a 46-item questionnaire, assessing patient functional and emotional response to musculoskeletal ailments.

Results

Three-hundred-twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with a lower education had worse long-term functional outcomes (P < 0.001) and increased pain scores (P = 0.002) at latest follow-up. Patients who made less than $50,000 annually had worse long-term functional outcomes (P = 0.002) and reported higher pain scores (P = 0.003) following surgical management of (fracture) non-unions. Multiple linear regression demonstrated education level to be an independent predictor of long-term functional outcomes following surgical management of (fracture) non-unions (B = -0.154, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = -10.96 to -1.26, P = 0.014). No differences existed in outcomes or pain scores between those of different ethnic groups. No differences existed regarding post-operative complications and time to union between patients of different ethnic groups, educational levels and income status.

Conclusion

Patients with lower education levels and individuals who make less than $50,000 annually have worse functional outcomes following surgical management of (fracture) non-unions. Orthopaedic trauma surgeons should therefore be aware of these disparities, and consider early interventions aimed at optimizing patient recovery in these subsets.

### Fracture non-union: can biomarkers predict outcome? [^112Rhk8c]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Delayed bone healing and non-union occurs in approximately 10–15% of long bone fractures. Both pathologies may result in prolonged period of pain, disability and repetitive operative interventions. Despite intense investigations and progress done in understanding the pathophysiologic processes governing bone healing, the diagnostic tools have not been altered. The clinical findings and radiographic features remain the two important landmarks of diagnosing non-union and even when the diagnosis is established there is debate on the ideal timing and mode of intervention. Emerging evidence suggest that there are certain molecules and genes that can serve as predictors of potentially unsuccessful fracture union. This article summarises the current evidence on the available 'bio-markers'to predict fracture non-union.

Follow-up care

Close outpatient follow-up after management of orthopedic injuries is vital to ensure optimal outcomes. Surgeons can ensure adequate healing and progress, review pain management strategies, review changes in mobility, adjust physical therapy and address any patient concerns. Rib fractures should be treated similarly to other orthopedic or traumatic injuries. For any surgery to be successful, there must be an integrated multidisciplinary approach that encompasses both inpatient and outpatient components. This ensures that not only optimal care is given but also allows the surgeon to capture more patients in need of delayed intervention due to non-union or malunion. As our understanding of the differential patterns of non-union throughout the thorax continues to evolve, special consideration must be given to fractures initially managed non-operatively at high risk of non-union, especially as indications for SSRF continue to expand to include stabilization of nonunionized rib fractures. Current evidence suggests most potentially modifiable, postdischarge complications after SSRF, such as hardware failure or infection, tend to occur within the first year after discharge, with a majority occurring within 3 months. Thus, it is recommended that those undergoing SSRF have planned follow-up visits for at least 3 months following discharge.

Postoperative follow-up

Imaging: imaging at follow-up visits (X-rays, CT scans) ensures hardware stability and monitors fracture healing in patients who have undergone SSRF.
Patient-reported outcomes: regular monitoring of pain, mobility, respiratory function and completion of activities of daily living (ADLs) is vital.
Monitoring for long-term complications: chronic pain and hardware failure must be vigilantly observed.
Physical therapy: physical therapy protocols specific for patients after SSRF have been shown to decrease perceived disability, improve shoulder strength, increase chest expansion and improve spirometry.

Non-operative follow-up

Non-operative management focuses on pain control, physical therapy and respiratory rehabilitation. Most complications occur soon after discharge and therefore regular follow-up at 1–2 months should be scheduled, with imaging if there is evidence of clinical deterioration. Regular assessments can determine whether delayed SSRF is necessary for either non-union/malunion or chronic pain and inability to resume daily activities.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^113sRfDt]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Lateral clavicle fracture — operative vs non-operative treatment: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that displaced lateral fractures with disruption of the coracoclavicular ligament complex may benefit from operative repair. Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. A systematic literature review yielded no studies that met inclusion criteria for this clinical practice guideline. The work group is of the opinion that given the available evidence supporting modern techniques of fixation and the established high risks of non-union, surgical management may be appropriate in selected patients with displaced lateral clavicle fractures. Surgical management of lateral clavicle fracture with coracoclavicular ligament injury may reduce the risk of non-union and improve patient outcomes, but careful consideration must be made to avoid unnecessary operative interventions in this patient population. No evidence related to cost or resource utilization is available on this topic. Little change is required to implement this recommendation; thus, it is likely to be acceptable to most. Implementation of this recommendation requires little additional surgical change however, public health resources and the associated cost of treatment may make this less feasible in some health care settings. Continued understanding of the impact of displacement, and the role of treatment on clinical outcomes is necessary.

### Management of tibial non-unions according to a novel treatment algorithm [^111t2N8g]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Tibial non-unions represent a spectrum of conditions that are challenging to treat. The optimal management remains unclear despite the frequency with which these diagnoses are encountered. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of tibial non-unions managed according to a novel tibial non-union treatment algorithm. One hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with 122 uninfected tibial non-unions were treated according to our proposed tibial non-union treatment algorithm. All patients were followed-up clinically and radiologically for a minimum of six months after external fixator removal. Four patients were excluded because they did not complete the intended treatment process. The final study population consisted of 94 men and 24 women with a mean age of 34 years. Sixty-seven non-unions were stiff hypertrophic, 32 mobile atrophic, 16 mobile oligotrophic and one true pseudoarthrosis. Six non-unions were classified as type B1 defect non-unions. Bony union was achieved after the initial surgery in 113/122 (92.6%) tibias. Nine patients had failure of treatment. Seven persistent non-unions were successfully retreated according to the tibial non-union treatment algorithm. This resulted in final bony union in 120/122 (98.3%) tibias. The proposed tibial non-union treatment algorithm appears to produce high union rates across a diverse group of tibial non-unions. Tibial non-unions however, remain difficult to treat and should be referred to specialist units where advanced reconstructive techniques are practiced on a regular basis.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^114EjXmL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Predictors of non-union following non-operatively treated clavicle fracture — adults, increasing displacement and/or comminution in mid-shaft clavicle fractures may be associated with higher rates of non-union following non-operative treatment in adults, with Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Option: Limited. Four low quality observational studies examined the impact of various factors on the rate of nonunion for non-operatively treated midshaft clavicle fractures; two studies found that comminution and displacement had a significant impact increasing the rate of nonunion, one study found that comminution predicted delays in union at 6 and 12 weeks, but not by 24 weeks, and one study found that comminution did not impact union rates; based on the available evidence it is likely that comminution and displacement increase the risk of nonunion of a non-operatively treated midshaft clavicle fracture. Understanding predictors of nonunion with non-operative treatment of clavicle fractures is critical to patient counseling and treatment decision making, and although this clinical practice guideline is not making treatment recommendations, guidelines regarding risk provide surgeons with information to help counsel patients and guide treatment but no treatment recommendations are provided here. Further research regarding outcomes is needed so that surgeons can make treatment decisions based on the risk of nonunion.

### Definition and classification of fracture non-unions [^114bjjbM]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Classifications in general provide relevant information for clinical purposes to compose a suitable treatment strategy and for research purposes to be able to define comparable study groups. Two distinct types of non-unions are described in the established literature. In the first type the ends of the fragments are hypervascutar or hypertrophic and are capable of biologic reaction. In the second type the ends of the fragments are avascular or atrophic and are inert and incapable of biologic reaction. Hypervascular as well as avascular non-unions may be complicated by the presence of infection, poor soft-tissue quality, short peri-articular fragments or significant deformity, demanding mu[ti-stage treatment strategies with concomitant worsened prognosis and subsequent increased frequency of amputation.

### Autograft versus BMPs for the treatment of non-unions: what is the evidence? [^111FVv1q]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Autograft is considered the gold standard in non-union treatment. However, it is associated with significant morbidity and limited biological activity. The introduction of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) has added a valuable tool to the surgeon's possibilities. The initial expectations of the effectiveness of BMPs were high, but over the years the union rate of BMPs was shown to be comparable with autograft. In this overview, both treatment modalities are compared. The off-label use of BMPs, the combination of BMPs and autograft, and the economic perspective of BMP use are summarized. In their current formulation, BMPs are an effective alternative for autograft in selected cases. The beneficial effect outweighs the economic costs. Widening of the indication to other long bone non-unions and new formulations are expected in the nearby future.

Indications for SSRF: the 'WHO'

Patient selection criteria

A multidisciplinary approach tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of local hospitals is required for any chest wall reconstruction program such that rib fracture management is successful. SSRF is optimal in dedicated centers with protocols for non-operative management and SSRF for rib fractures. SSRF performed at high-volume centers (≥ 13 procedures annually) is associated with significantly lower mortality rates and shorter hospital lengths of stay (LOS). The decision to provide SSRF rests on the ability to provide adequate analgesia, degree of respiratory compromise, presence of flail chest (FC) or chest wall deformity and non-union or malunion of rib fractures. Using an evidence-based approach, the World Society of Emergency Surgery and the CWIS developed the following simplified approach (figure 1).

Figure 1
CWIS guideline for SSRF — indications, contraindications and timing. Reproduced with permission from the CWIS guideline for SSRF. CWIS, Chest Wall Injury Society; SSRF, surgical stabilization of rib fracture.

Indications for SSRF

Severe FC with respiratory compromise

Patients exhibiting paradoxical chest wall movement secondary to FC leading to ventilatory insufficiency are prime candidates for SSRF. SSRF should be considered in all patients with FC. Stabilization restores chest wall integrity and enhances respiratory mechanics, resulting in fewer unplanned intubations, decreased ventilator days, shorter LOS in intensive care units and the hospital, fewer deep vein thromboses and ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as improved survival.CWIS guidelines advocate for early SSRF in such cases to improve outcomes.

### Orthopaedic traumatology: fundamental principles and current controversies for the acute care surgeon [^116cnbWq]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Aseptic non-unions are treated much differently. There are three types of aseptic non-unions: hypertrophic, atrophic and oligotrophic. Differentiation is important to choose the correct treatment protocol. Hypertrophic non-unions have too much motion at the fracture site. In hypertrophic non-unions, there is a lack of sufficient stability to promote healing in spite of biologic capacity. The increased motion causes excess bone development, resembling an 'elephant foot' or 'horse hoof' on radiograph (figure 2). Hypertrophic non-unions are treated with revision surgical intervention to increase construct stiffness. Atrophic non-unions, on the other hand, have an insufficient biologic environment to heal. This may be compounded by inadequate stabilization. A persistent gap at the fracture site on X-ray, without callus formation, will be seen on radiograph. Effective treatment of atrophic non-unions adds a biologic stimulus for healing, such as bone grafting. Oligotrophic non-unions have a combination of stability and biologic insufficiencies. These occur when the fracture has inadequate fixation and possible compromise of biologic healing capacity. Secondary healing cannot occur because of these deficiencies. On radiograph, there will be minimal callus formation and a fracture gap.

### Non-union after plate fixation [^116emLrV]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately a third of patients presenting with long-bone non-union have undergone plate fixation as their primary procedure. In the assessment of a potential fracture non-union it is critical to understand the plating technique that the surgeon was intending to achieve at the primary procedure, i.e. whether it was direct or indirect fracture repair. The distinction between delayed union and non-union is a diagnostic dilemma especially in plated fractures, healing by primary bone repair. The distinction is important as nonunions are not necessarily part of the same spectrum as delayed unions. The etiology of a fracture non-union is usually multifactorial and the factors can be broadly categorized into mechanical factors, biological (local and systemic) factors, and infection. Infection is present in ~40% of fracture non-unions, often after open fractures or impaired wound healing, but in 5% of all non-unions infection is present without any clinical or serological suspicion. Methods to improve the sensitivity of investigation in the search of infection include the use of; sonication of implants, direct inoculation of theatre specimens into broth, and histological examination of non-union site tissue. Awareness should be given to the potential anti-osteogenic effect of bisphosphonates (in primary fracture repair) and certain classes of antibiotics. Early cases of delayed/non-union with sufficient mechanical stability and biologically active bone can be managed by stimulation of fracture healing. Late presenting non-union typically requires revision of the fixation construct and stimulation of the callus to induce fracture union.

### Risk factors for the development of persistent scaphoid non-union after surgery for an established non-union [^117AQeyt]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study analyzed prospectively collected data on 134 individuals from a large randomized controlled trial to identify risk factors predictive of PSNU following operative management of an established SNU. After we determined 19 a priori risk factors, our multivariable regression analysis showed that dominant hand injury reduced odds of union by 7 times, every additional decade of life reduced odds of union by 1.72 times, and previous surgery reduced the odds of union more than 4 times.

Although there is evidence to suggest older age may reduce chances of bone healing, the current literature is conflicted on age as a specific risk factor for fracture non-union. Many studies, although not focused on the scaphoid specifically, show that increased age is not an independent risk factor for fracture non-unions, - while others have found the opposite, even in pediatric populations. There may be confounding variables associated with age, such as time from injury to surgery, as those who are older may have waited longer to undergo operative treatment since their initial scaphoid injury. We found that time from injury to surgery was not significant in our univariable analysis, which suggests this likely is not the case. This study also excluded other confounding variables often associated with fractures and aging, such as osteoporosis, thus making them unlikely explanations. This being said, fracture healing is a multifaceted process that can be complicated by numerous conditions and medications. Aging impairs a bone's regenerative potential through an associated decrease in mesenchymal stem cells and impaired osteoblast differentiation. Unlike most literature that compares 2 vastly different age groups' potential for fracture healing, our study suggests that age gaps as little as 10 years can significantly alter relative union rates in scaphoid fractures.

### A limited fixation, olecranon sparing approach, for management of geriatric intra-articular distal humerus fractures [^112fGeVT]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-operative management, consisting of brief elbow immobilization followed by early range of motion is an option in patients deemed too medically unwell to tolerate an operation. This "bag of bones" approach was first described in the literature by Eastwood in 1937, who reported on 14 patients with adequate elbow function, 12 of whom returned to work (or previous functional level), after non-operative treatment of a distal humerus fracture, although a closed reduction under general anesthesia was commonly performed. Recent studies have demonstrated mixed results with non-operative care which can result in pain, poor functional outcomes, instability, non-union, and distorted distal humerus geometry.,

There is a paucity of data comparing the results of non-operative treatment to operative treatment for intra-articular distal humerus fractures. In a retrospective review in 1986, Zagorski et al. compared the outcomes of comminuted intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus in 29 patients who were treated operatively with ORIF and 13 patients treated non-operatively. In this study 23 patients were treated with screw fixation only, 5 patients with plates and screws, 1 patient by multiple pin fixation, with 76% reported to have had an excellent or good result whereas only 8% of patients treated non-operatively achieved a similar outcome. Notably, this patient group was substantially younger, with a mean age of 45 years (range 17 to 82 years), compared to our present study. Higher non-union and delayed union rates with non-operative treatment were seen in an observational cohort by Robinson et al. in a study of 320 adult patients with distal humerus fractures. In a non-randomized study of 28 elderly patients (mean age of 85 years) with distal humerus fractures by Srinivasan et al. in 2005, OTA grading demonstrated favorable results (3 excellent, 9 good, 7 fair, and 2 poor) in patients treated with ORIF compared with the non-operatively treated group (zero excellent, 2 good, 3 fair, and 3 poor). The operatively treated group had more substantial pain relief (mild or no pain) compared to the non-operative group (52% v. 25%) along with a better mean arc of motion (75.5° v. 37.5°). Similarly, John et al. reported favorable outcomes in 49 elderly patients (mean age of 80 years) with distal humerus fractures who were treated operatively. Eighty percent of patients assessed their result as either very good or good and the authors noted the incidence of implant failure, pseudarthrosis of the olecranon osteotomy, and ulnar nerve lesions were similar to younger adult populations at the time of study. We believe our limited fixation technique captures some of the benefits of a non-operative approach, by minimizing surgery and potential post-operative issues related to olecranon fixation in elderly or medically unwell patients, while achieving similar functional and pain relief outcomes as ORIF with intra-articular reconstruction.

### Vascularised bone grafts for the management of non-union [^113hPC1T]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Non-union of the long bones may have severe consequences, particularly when combined with other post-traumatic sequelae, such as tendon adhesions, reflex sympathetic dystrophy and infection, among others. In these cases, it is important to treat the delayed union or non-union first or at the same time with the other problems in order to achieve adequate function. Once the normal bony healing process has been slowed or stopped, it is necessary to provide both stability to the fracture site, as well as a biological stimulus for the fibrocartilagenous callus to finish the healing process. Vascularised grafts, such as the free fibula, offer not only structural support, but also promote bone healing. The later is achieved by trabecular bone formation, as well as vascular sprouting from pedicle vessels.

### Validation of the non-union scoring system in 300 long bone non-unions [^112EeXH5]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-union of long bones is a significant consequence of fracture treatment. The ideal classification for non-union of long bones would give sufficient significant information to the orthopaedic surgeon to enable good management of the treatment required and to facilitate the creation of comparable study groups for research purposes. The Non-Union Scoring System (NUSS) is a new scoring system to assist surgeons in the choice of the correct treatment in non-union surgery. The aim of this study was to determine the evidence supporting the use of the NUSS classification in the treatment of non-unions of long bones and to validate the treatment algorithm suggested by this scoring system.

Materials and Methods

A total of 300 patients with non-union of the long bones were included in the clinical study.

Results

A radiographic and clinical healing was reached in 60 of 69 non-unions (86%) in group 1 (0–25 points), in 102 of 117 non-unions (87%) in group 2 (26–50 points), and in 69 of 84 (82%) in group 3 (51–75 points). The mean time to clinical healing was 7.17 ± 1.85 months in group 1, 7.30 ± 1.72 months in group 2 and 7.60 ± 1.49 months in group 3. The mean time to radiographic healing was 8.78 ± 2.04 months in group 1, 9.02 ± 1.84 months in group 2 and 9.53 ± 1.40 months in group 3.

Discussion

There are few articles in the scientific literature that examine the classification systems for non-union.

Conclusions

A statistical analysis of the first results we have obtained with the use of NUSS showed significant rates of union in all the evaluated groups. This indicates that NUSS could be an appropriate scoring system to classify and stratify non-unions and to enable the surgeon to choose the correct treatment.

### Principles of nonunion management: state of the art [^112QDpzd]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of fractures can present with nonunion, and the management of nonunion continues to present a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. A variety of biological, mechanical, patient, and injury factors can contribute to the occurrence of nonunion, and often the cause of nonunion may be multifactorial. Successful management often requires assessment and treatment of more than one of these factors. This article reviews common factors that may contribute to nonunion including infection, impaired biology, and metabolic disorders. In addition, new and evolving strategies for diagnosing the cause and effectively treating nonunion including the diagnosis of infection, metabolic workup, bone grafting, cell-based therapies, and biological adjuvants are reviewed and discussed.

### Assessment of compromised fracture healing [^111yz78N]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

No standard criteria exist for diagnosing fracture nonunion, and studies suggest that assessment of fracture healing varies among orthopaedic surgeons. This variability can be problematic in both clinical and orthopaedic trauma research settings. An understanding of risk factors for nonunion and of diagnostic tests used to assess fracture healing can facilitate a systematic approach to evaluation and management. Risk factors for nonunion include medical comorbidities, age, and the characteristics of the injury. The method of fracture management also influences healing. Comprehensive evaluation includes an assessment of the patient's symptoms, signs, and immune and endocrine status as well as the biologic capacity of the fracture, presence of infection, and quality of reduction and fixation. Diagnostic tests include plain radiography, CT, ultrasonography, fluoroscopy, bone scan, MRI, and several laboratory tests, including assays for bone turnover markers in the peripheral circulation. A systematic approach to evaluating fracture union can help surgeons determine the timing and nature of interventions.

### Pathological fracture non-union of medial clavicle after radiotherapy [^117HcM2H]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Mainstay of treatment of medial clavicular fracture after ruling out sinister pathologies should be conservative management. It is found to have a high rate of non-union up to 95%. Despite the high non-union rate, good functional outcome is reported after conservative management of the condition. Main indications for surgery, as suggested by literature include significantly displaced fracture, fracture with skin impingement, open fracture and segmental fracture. Various implants have been described in the literature for the fixation of medial clavicle fractures, yet none of them were specifically designed for medial clavicle. The lack of availability of a designated implant increases the surgical difficulties in stabilising such fractures. There was also a lack of controlled studies for conclusive comparison of operative and non-operative treatment in the case of medial clavicular fracture. For complicated osteonecrosis with infection, surgical excisional debridement of necrotic tissue combined with an extended course of systemic antibiotics remains the gold standard. We adopted the strategy of conservative management after considering various factors, including the location of the condition (ie, medial clavicle, with a relatively low load-bearing structure), tolerable symptoms and well-preserved shoulder function. Interval follow-up also showed a good response to treatment from the patient. Management of radiotherapy-induced osteonecrosis should be tailored to patients, including the patients' premorbid functional status and the area being affected. In areas where high physical load or weight bearing is anticipated, for example the femur, surgical treatment may be a more appropriate choice in physically fit patients.

We acknowledge certain limitations of this case study, including the retrospective nature of the diagnosis and challenges in attributing causation to radiotherapy in a definite manner.

Learning points

Medial clavicle fractures are the least common clavicle fractures.
Atraumatic medial clavicle fractures raise suspicion of a pathological cause.
Osteonecrosis of the clavicle after irradiation should be a diagnosis of exclusion in the case of medial clavicle pathological fracture after ruling out sinister causes.
Early investigation should be considered in patients with a history of local radiation therapy complaining of clavicular pain in order to avoid delay in diagnosis and treatment.

### Low intensity pulsed ultrasound for bone healing: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^115nUcv7]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included six content experts (five orthopedic or trauma surgeons and one physiotherapist), six methodologists (four of whom are also front line clinicians), and four patients with personal experience of fractures (one of whom had used LIPUS). All patients received personal training and support to optimize contributions throughout the guideline development process. The members of the patient panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical values and preferences of patients to be, as well as the variation between patients.

Information sources

We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 16 November 2016, using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms for fracture, orthopedic surgical procedures, and ultrasound. Additional searches included trials registries clinicaltrials.gov and isrctn.com. An experienced research librarian designed the search strategies (appendix 1). Two independent reviewers scanned the references from eligible studies, related systematic reviews, and all studies citing eligible randomized controlled trials on Google Scholar.

Study selection

We included randomized controlled trials that compared LIPUS with a sham device or no device in patients with any type of fracture regardless of location (long bone or other bone), type (fresh fracture, delayed union, non-union, or stress fracture), or clinical management (operative or non-operative). We included any type of osteotomy, including distraction osteogenesis. We excluded trials published only as protocols or abstracts if we were unable to get the final results from investigators.

Two reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened the titles and abstracts of identified articles and acquired the full text of any article that either reviewer judged to be potentially eligible. They independently applied the eligibility criteria to the full texts and, when consensus could not be reached, resolved disagreements through discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer.

Data collection

Two reviewers used standardized forms to independently abstract data; they resolved disagreements by discussion or involved a third reviewer when required. Extracted data included characteristics of patients and fractures, clinical management, risk of bias, intervention details, statements about compliance with treatment, and outcomes.

### Approach to femoral shaft nonunions: diagnosis and management [^116YYrge]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the high union rate of femoral shaft fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (90% to 100%), the annual incidence of femoral shaft nonunion ranges from 2% to 6%. Although less common than tibial nonunions, femoral shaft nonunions remain a clinical problem in orthopaedic surgery. Proper treatment begins with appropriate diagnosis, workup, and identification of risk factors followed by a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. This article provides current evidence-based guidance for providers on the diagnosis and management of femoral shaft nonunions.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^116JaSru]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Isolated displaced midshaft clavicle fracture (adult) operative vs non-operative treatment indicates that operative treatment is associated with higher union rates and better early patient-reported outcomes than non-operative treatment, but practitioners may consider either approach because both are associated with similar long-term patient-reported outcomes and patient satisfaction. Quality of Evidence is High and Strength of Recommendation is Strong. Benefits and harms note that plate fixation and intramedullary nailing lead to higher union rates in adult patients, while operative treatment carries increased risk of infection and implant failure with infection rates in all studies low; non-operative care shows increased need for surgery due to nonunion, whereas operative care shows increased need for reoperation for implant removal due to irritation and/or prominence, with no superiority in cosmesis and similar functional outcomes at long-term follow-up. For displaced and shortened fractures, operative treatment with plate fixation was found to provide the best outcomes in terms of union rate. Cost considerations state that surgical fixation costs more overall and in the post operative period due to implant removal, and delays from operative conversion after non-operative care may affect time to return to work and have economic consequences for the patient.

### Genetic predisposition to non-union: evidence today [^116knQzx]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Atrophic non-union represents a complex clinical condition and research is ongoing in an effort to elucidate its pathophysiology and to offer new and more efficient treatment modalities. Differences seen in fracture healing responses and final outcome may be attributed among other factors to biological variations between patients resulting in a "disturbed" signalling pathway and an "inert or deficient local biology with reduced potentials for bone regeneration". The genetic contribution with or without the interaction of other exogenous factors in cases of impaired fracture healing, is yet to be elucidated. However, preliminary animal and human studies demonstrate the molecular basis of fracture non-unions and correlate genetic variants of the molecules regulating fracture healing and their expression patterns with impaired bone healing and fracture non-union. Further research is needed to clarify the genetic component and its role and interaction with other risk factors that may result in increased susceptibility of a patient to develop this complication.

### Prevention and management of osteoporotic fractures by non-physician health professionals: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider [^115niNDA]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data, including research design, population characteristics, interventions and outcomes were extracted by the research fellow from all selected articles describing diagnostic procedures, therapeutic approaches and implementation strategies. Systematic reviews were evaluated using AMSTAR 2 — A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, while risk of bias (RoB) judgements about primary studies followed a domain-based assessment as recommended by the Cochrane collaboration. We characterised a 'partial Yes' response in a critical domain of AMSTAR 2 as a non-critical weakness. Risk of performance bias was considered unclear in studies in which blinding of participants and/or personnel was not feasible. Evidence was classified in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based-Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence, but upgraded or downgraded in response to methodological strengths and weaknesses.

Data synthesis

Evidence about the effect of interventions was synthesised descriptively and rated using four categories: sufficient; some; insufficient; and insufficient evidence to determine, as described by Ryan et al (see online supplementary file 1, table 1). Studies describing mixed populations (participants with and without osteoporotic fracture) were allocated based on the proportion of participants with fracture, that is, if > 50% of the population had at least one fragility fracture, the study was allocated to question 2; if ≤ 50%, the study was allocated to question 3. If more than one published article reported data from a single cohort, the most up-to-date publication was included in the analysis.

### A new approach for plate fixation of midshaft clavicular fractures [^114WADZS]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

The majority of midshaft clavicle fractures unite uneventfully. Although the indications for operative intervention are limited and reported complication rates high, there are circumstances in which surgery is required. We describe a new, infraclavicular surgical approach to the clavicle used in a series of 89 patients over 9 years. Average time to union was 13.5 weeks. There was one case of deep infection and one of non-union, both of which resolved with further treatment. These results compare very favourably with previously published series and we submit that this operative approach allows safe management of an otherwise potentially hazardous procedure.

Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

PICO 3

Should selective NSAIDs (COX-2 inhibitors) be used in analgesic regimens for adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with traumatic fracture versus routine analgesic regimens that include non-selective NSAIDs to improve analgesia and reduce OMEs, without increasing non-union rates?

Non-union

Qualitative synthesis

Jeffcoach et al report on a retrospective cohort study in patients with femur, tibia and/or humerus fractures at an academic level I trauma center. Non-union was not defined. In patients who received an NSAID (12%), most received a non-selective NSAIDs (93% ketorolac or ibuprofen, median of two doses) and seven patients (4%) experienced non-union. Only nine patients received a selective NSAID and none experienced a non-union (table 6). George et al used private health insurance claims during a 15-year period in patients with a long-bone fracture and 1-year of follow-up data. In the 2411 patients receiving a COX-2 inhibitor, 69 (2.9%) experienced non-union compared with 387 (1.7%) — 22 590 patients — receiving a non-selective NSAID. The incidence for non-union in this cohort was similar to the rate of non-union (1.5%) in patients not receiving NSAIDs.

Table 6
PICO 3 (selective vs non-selective NSAIDs)

Ortiz et al randomized patients with closed ankles fractures to receive ketorolac (non-selective), diclofenac (non-selective) or etoricoxib (selective). There was no difference in the visual analog pain scores for any of the NSAIDs.

Quantitative synthesis

Due to the lack of studies, a meta-analysis was unable to be performed.

PICO 3 recommendation

We are unable to make a recommendation on whether selective NSAIDs (COX-2 inhibitors) versus non-selective NSAIDs be used in analgesic regimens for adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with traumatic fracture, due to the small number of studies identified. Four authors voted for a strong recommendation, two for conditional recommendation and 13 for no recommendation.

### [F] NaF PET / CT to assess bone healing capacity in orthopaedic trauma surgery: a feasibility study [^114uEfqZ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study shows that patients diagnosed with non-union still exhibit increased [18 F]NaF uptake at the fracture site, suggesting ongoing osteoblastic activity. This implies that active bone healing continues for a long time, even in those classified as non-unions. These findings challenge the time-based definition of non-union and indicate that many of these fractures still have the potential for healing if managed expectantly. Specifically, this study found that 69% of non-unions healed even after 12 months since the last surgical intervention. This finding demonstrates that a significant number of fractures show ongoing bone activity beyond the traditional time frame and supports the use of [18 F]NaF PET/CT for bone healing assessment.

The clinical impact of [18 F]NaF PET/CT is significant, as it can help avoid unnecessary surgeries in fracture management, as demonstrated in this study (65% of cases). By providing detailed information on osteoblastic activity, [18 F]NaF PET/CT can guide clinicians in deciding whether revision surgery is primarily needed or an extended expectant approach might be sufficient. Importantly, patient factors such as pain, functional limitations, and overall health must also be considered, as these may affect the feasibility of an extended expectant management. As such, [18 F]NaF PET/CT should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment for individualized fracture evaluation, particularly in impaired healing scenarios. This imaging modality may guide decisions for an extended expectant approach, as high uptake in non-unions suggests the possibility of spontaneous bone healing.

### The health economics of the treatment of long-bone non-unions [^112sqvLR]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

A review of the existing evidence on economic costs of treatment of long-bone fracture non-unions has retrieved 9 papers. Mostly the tibial shaft non-unions have been utilised as models for these economic analyses. Novel treatment strategies like BMP-7 grafting, Ilizarov ring external fixation or supplementary use of therapeutic ultrasound devices have been compared with standard methods of treatment focusing on direct and indirect costs and expenses. A cost-identification query was conducted and revealed costs of pound 15,566, pound 17,200 and pound 16,330 for humeral, femoral, and tibial non-unions respectively on a "best-case scenario". The existing scientific evidence can only imply the extent of the economic burden of long-bone non-unions. Further systematic studies are needed to assess the direct medical, direct non-medical, indirect, and monetised quality of life and psychosocial costs of non-unions.

### Cellular therapies for the treatment of non-union: the past, present and future [^113s7UtB]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Non-union fracture is a pathological condition having some impairment of the cellular part of the repair: a reduction of MSC and of the osteoblastic activation. Non union is therefore a good indication for cell-based therapies using stem cells. We described the rational of this treatment and described the technique of autologous bone marrow concentrate implantation that was until now used. With the development of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, we believed that therapy based on cytotherapy has great potential. In this review, clinical applications of cytotherapy are summarized and analyzed. Current problems and future challenges are discussed.

### The "Road to union" protocol for the reconstruction of isolated complex high-energy tibial trauma [^111srU9g]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to describe a standardized staged approach, "The Road to Union", for the reconstruction of isolated complex tibial trauma, both acute and chronic in nature.

Methods

This retrospective study included all patients treated for complex tibial trauma at a specialized limb reconstruction centre, including acute open fracture as well as infected and aseptic non-unions. This standardized approach includes eight specific steps, employed in sequence. The time in external fixation (EFT), the external fixation index (EFI), and the distraction consolidation index (DCI) were the primary outcome measures. The relationship between EFI and DCI was assessed using Pearson's moment correlations.

Results

Thirty-two patients with a mean age of 34.7 ± 14.2years were included; 12 were treated for complex open tibial fractures with bone loss, 13 for infected non-unions, and 6 for aseptic non-union. The mean bone defect was 66 ± 32mm. The total EFT was 42.5 ± 14.8 weeks; the EFI measured 51.9 ± 25.3 days/cm, and the DCI measured 48.3 ± 21.4 days/cm. Union was achieved in 29 out of 32 patients (91%), and there was a strong and significant relationship between EFI and DCI (r = 0.92, p = 0.0001) measurements. Pin site infections were observed in 11 patients, and 3 patients had persistent non-union. Three patients underwent delayed amputations when reconstructive procedures were unable to achieve union.

Conclusion

The findings of this study demonstrate that a standardized staged treatment protocol of debridement, circular external fixation, soft-tissue management, distraction osteogenesis, and functional rehabilitation can result in a high rate of union in cases of complex tibial trauma, both acute and chronic in nature.

### Use of clinical assessment tools in the evaluation of fracture healing [^113Ff7a7]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Fracture healing is an optimized biological process yet the ability to determine when a fracture is healed, or to measure the healing response can present a clinical challenge. This review will focus on the evidence for the implementation of imaging modalities as tools to assist in evaluating fracture union. This is particularly important for common fractures that have a propensity to have delayed union or non-union, where a diagnosis of non-union would alter the treatment. We also present methods, such as biochemical markers and clinical scores that are in development or have the potential to aid in the diagnosis of non-union. Ultimately, clinical exam combined with the available modalities can help the clinician judge the progression of healing with some confidence. There is still a need for continued development of new modalities and tests to improve accuracy of the diagnosis of non-union, as well as predict which fractures are at risk for non-union.

For deep infection in tibial plateau fractures, double incision with plate fixation had 22 22.73% versus single incision with plate fixation 59 25.42%, RR 0.89(0.37,2.17). For non-union in tibial shaft fractures with intramedullary nail, dual incision was 24 12.50% versus single incision 36 19.44%, RR 0.64(0.18,2.24). For deep infection in tibial shaft with intramedullary nail, dual incision was 24 8.33% versus single incision 36 2.78%, RR 3.00(0.29,31.28). For amputation (early vs late) in the upper arm, early (< 8hr from injury) fasciotomy had 154 51.30% versus late (> 8hr from injury) 114 63.16%, RR 0.81(0.66,1.00).

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^114wYdyq]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. Despite a comprehensive search, we may have missed some reports; but additional data are unlikely to alter our key findings. Many of the studies reported non‐operative management as a byline of people not included in a study of postoperative outcomes, hence the lack of detailed information about the patients. There may be smaller studies that by chance had zero non‐operative management rates but did not report this explicitly, so were not captured in our searches. However, the lack of difference between data solely from administrative and registry‐based studies and results from all the cohorts would suggest the impact of this is small. We have undertaken extensive sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of outliers and there are no meaningful differences in results. Importantly, these data are not from randomised trials. We do not believe the data support a particular optimal proportion of non‐operative management. Personal and societal attitudes towards quantity and quality of life and ageing will differ. We do suggest, however, that there is unexplained and probably unwarranted variation.

Moving forward, we suggest that there are practical steps that may improve our understanding and practice in this area. The Fragility Fracture Network and individual registries could consider explicit inclusion of data fields related to characteristics and outcomes of those having non‐operative management. There is opportunity for national, regional and international consensus on the principles of decision‐making and pathways of care for those offered or receiving non‐operative management. We would suggest that these discussions must include patients and their carers, wider society and regulatory authorities. We must avoid any retreat into a nihilistic view of hip fracture management in general, which is rightly predicated on offering surgery to the vast majority of patients.

Bar the FRAIL‐Hip studies, there were few data on what non‐operative care looked like. In settings where non‐operative management is more common, we would suggest that this pathway is similar in quality to an operative pathway. There is scope for carefully considered research in this area which might include: identifying patients where non‐operative management may be the preferred option for them and their carers, either before or after fracture; understanding the reasons for inter‐individual, inter‐hospital and national variation; identifying optimal approaches to palliation in those who are dying; and rehabilitation in those where operative management is viewed as riskier than not operating.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^1146wZnM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Introduction

Surgery is the preferred treatment for hip fracture in older people. However, a proportion of patients with hip fracture do not receive surgery. There is a lack of contemporary evidence describing this patient population and what their associated outcomes are. We aimed to describe the variation in non‐operative management and its outcomes around the world.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of older people presenting to hospital with hip fracture, comparing those with and without surgery for non‐operative proportions, mortality and other outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale. We performed a random effects meta‐analysis with adjustment for clustering.

Results

Of 4437 screened studies, 185 were included from 172 separate cohorts, 44 countries, six continents and involving 10,763,994 patients. The overall proportion of non‐operative management was 8.4% (95%CI 7.2–9.7%) with wide within‐country and regional variation. There was no consistent association of non‐operative management proportions with the admission characteristics of sex, fracture type or patient ethnicity. Non‐operative management was associated with a greater relative risk of death at all time points. Risk of bias was generally low except for the expected confounding by indication.

Discussion

Non‐operative management of hip fracture is relatively common, but there is wide variation that is unexplained by differences in patient characteristics. The evidence is limited by incomplete reporting of patient characteristics and outcomes, and a lack of controlled studies even in the highest risk populations. Further work is needed to understand this decision‐making process.

### Use of bone morphogenetic proteins for treatment of non-unions and future perspectives [^116oTTNm]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Still a major problem in orthopedic and trauma surgery is the delayed healing or the non-union of long bone fractures. Demographic data reveal that due to the steadily rising age of the population, complications with the musculoskeletal system will increase during the next years. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have successfully been applied in clinic for the treatment of delayed healing and non-unions. The broad difference concerning the indication, timing of treatment, dosage and application technique of BMPs calls for the need to perform further prospective studies in order to standardize the treatment and furthermore optimize the procedures or even develop new therapeutic strategies. For example, the application technique may be improved and in some cases injectable BMP preparations could be of use. Also the coating of implants with growth factors might be valuable in order to stimulate bone healing and to prevent delayed healing or non-union. This article tries to discuss some of the open questions, however can and will not reflect the absolute standard of care. To make the BMP treatment a standard of care, more clinical data and long time experiences are necessary. The intramedullary application of BMP in combination with autologous or allogenic bone grafts or bone substitutes after debridement and stabilization with implants seems to be an adequate procedure for treatment of atrophic non-unions. However, the total number of patients is too small to draw final conclusions. Further clinical studies need to be performed in the future.

### Atypical fractures at non-classical sites associated with anti-resorptive therapy: a systematic review [^111XCv1j]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the large cohort of heterogenous fractures identified in this review, examining treatment outcomes was challenging. Instead, the most common atypical fracture site was the focus of this review. Of the conservatively managed ulnar fractures, outcomes were only available in 3 of 7 cases (two achieved union, one did not achieve union). Predominantly, ulnar fractures were managed surgically, and subsequently achieved union (25 of 32 fractures). The ideal surgical approach remains unclear. Cha et al. reported outcomes of revision surgeries to treat non-union of atypical ulnar fractures that had originally been treated using ORIF. All four patients achieved union following revision surgery involving resection of non-union area, iliac bone graft, and re-fixation. Resection of the non-union area has been speculated to improve healing due to the low bone turnover state and suppressed bone remodeling following long-term anti-resorptive administration. Further studies are required to determine whether teriparatide and/or LIPUS are effective in the management of atypical fractures.

This study represents the first systematic review of all published cases of anti-resorptive-related atypical fractures that do not strictly fulfill the ASBMR case definition. One limitation of this study is the selection of articles written only in English and including articles without associated radiographic imaging of some/all the fractures described. Further, complete capture of all outcomes and fracture characteristics was difficult as articles were mainly case reports and heterogenous in their description. Second, although doubted by the authors of the primary literature, it is possible that the fractures in patients with a concurrent malignancy may have been pathologic in nature. Third, an assessment of the risk of bias was not conducted, as the included articles were predominantly case series and case reports. Furthermore, atypical fracture cases in anti-resorptive naïve individuals were excluded from this systematic review. We acknowledge the inherent selection bias in the publication of such reports; however, these case series and reports highlight a rising concern within the medical community that atypical fractures may occur at sites other than the femur. Larger cohort studies should be undertaken to assess the incidence of atypical fractures at non-classical sites, in particular at ulna sites, and to elucidate risk factors and their relationship with anti-resorptive treatment.

### [F] FDG PET accurately differentiates infected and non-infected non-unions after fracture fixation [^111R36L6]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Infection at the site of a fraction can delay union, or can result in a non-union, which is a potentially disabling persistent failure of fracture healing. By definition, a non-union will not heal unless properly treated in accordance with the cause of the failure. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, to rule out suspected infection in cases of non-union fractures so as to facilitate timely and appropriate surgical fixation treatments. While several imaging modalities have found use in the investigation of potentially infected non-union fractures, [18 F]FDG PET has not hitherto been tested. We thus present the first systematic evaluation of [18 F]FDG PET exclusively in patients with non-union fractures and suspected infections.

We tested several approaches for evaluating the imaging results. Applying the second set of the visual analysis, [18 F]FDG PET showed high diagnostic sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 86%, which should afford a secure diagnosis of infected non-union fractures. Furthermore, the high NPV of 90% should help to avoid inappropriate attempts to treat with antibiotics or surgical debridement when infection is absent. Thus, we demonstrate that [18 F]FDG PET reliably differentiates infected and non-infected non-unions, and should then be a useful adjunct for therapeutic management.

Metallic implants are vulnerable sites of postoperative infection; in a previously published [18 F]FDG PET study, a subgroup of six of 22 patients with suspected metallic implant-associated infections had non-union fractures. These six patients were rated as having TN findings, indicating that [18 F]FDG uptake at uninfected non-union sites is significantly lower than that at the sites of actual infections. Another study evaluated [18 F]FDG PET/CT in trauma patients with suspected chronic osteomyelitis; the authors found that six of 33 patients with suspected osteomyelitis had non-union fractures, of which three were rated true positive, two as true negative, and one as false positive, due to pronounced [18 F]FDG uptake within the area of the fracture, despite absence of infection. Our investigation in a larger series confirms these preliminary published results.

### Judet osteoperiosteal decortication for treatment of non-union: the cornwall experience [^1168Z8UT]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of non union can be challenging with a variety of surgical options available to achieve bone consolidation. Robert Judet first described a method of osteo-periosteal decortication in 1963. He stated that by elevating cortical chips that remain attached to the periosteum and overlying soft tissues surrounding the site of non-union, combined with mechanical support, the bone consolidated. Despite excellent results presented in 2008 of 99% union rates with a mean delay of 8 months, the technique has not yet become popularised. We aim to show that Judet's method of decortication can achieve good results in the management of failure of union in a hospital other than Judet's.

Methods

Retrospective analysis was performed from December 2002 to December 2008 of 40 cases in 39 patients of osteoperiosteal decortication for fracture non-union. Concurrent stabilisation was with internal fixation only. All procedures were performed by one surgeon (MN) using the Judet technique after learning the technique in the originators hospital. A preoperative non union scoring system was also used to assess its use in predicting persistent non-union.

Results

Union was successfully achieved in 36 of the 39 surviving cases (92.3%) after a median delay of 8 months (range 3–47, SD 9.2) Twenty-six patients (65%) achieved union following the decortication procedure without subsequent operations. Factors such as open fracture and smoking did not have a statistically significant effect on union. The mean number of procedures following decortication was 0.68 (range 0–4). Metalwork failure occurred in 11 cases (28%), the majority in femoral decortications (n = 9, 82%). The femur was the site of all persistent non unions in the series. Three patients had superficial infections and two had deep infections. The pre-operative non union scoring system (0–100) means were noticeably worse for the persistent non union group 42.0 (20–46) compared with the union group 31.0 (range 4–52).

Conclusions

Osteoperiosteal decortication remains a highly effective surgical technique in the management of failed fracture union. The non union scoring system is a reliable predictor of persistent non union after this type of surgery.

Clinical Relevance

Relevant to general trauma orthopaedic surgeon and specialist orthopaedic surgeons with an interest in fracture non-union.

### Mortality from tibial shaft fractures in the elderly (MTFE)-a multicentre study of management outcomes [^11445gfA]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The mortality rate for tibial shaft fractures in the elderly is comparable to that of hip fractures, yet there is considerable variation in their management. Operative treatment allows for earlier weight-bearing and reduces potential complications of prolonged immobilization; however, it carries risks for this comorbid cohort. The main objective of this study was to assess the difference in 1-year mortality between operative and non-operative management.

Methods

A multicentre study was conducted across six trusts in England, including eight acute hospitals: three major trauma centres and five district general hospitals (DGHs). Data were collected retrospectively, covering a 5-year period from January 2017 to December 2021. The study included all patients aged 65 and over with diaphyseal tibial fractures (AO42). Patients with non-acute (> 3 weeks), periprosthetic, pathological, or multiple lower limb fractures were excluded.

Results

A total of 171 patients were identified, comprising 38% males and 62% females. Of these, 59.6% were managed operatively, while 40.4% were managed non-operatively. The median length of stay was similar between groups (8 days non-operative vs. 8.5 days operative, p = 0.87). Non-union (21.7% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.001) and malunion rates (27.7% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the non-operative group. One-year mortality was also higher in the non-operative group (38.3% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed an odds ratio of 4.5 and 4.7 for one-year mortality with non-operative treatment, with p-values of < 0.001 and 0.005, respectively.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that non-operatively treated tibial shaft fractures in the elderly are associated with significantly higher rates of non-union, malunion, and 1-year mortality. Therefore, we recommend an expedited multi-disciplinary approach to managing these patients, including surgical treatment and unrestricted weight bearing where possible, to optimize outcomes.

### Supracondylar femoral nail in the management of non-union of humeral shaft fractures [^112Tp3VU]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

We reviewed seven patients with established non-union of a shaft of humerus fracture, treated by locked intramedullary nailing using the Intramedullary Supracondylar Nail (IMSC Nail; Smith & Nephew Richards, Memphis TN). The mean age of the patients was 65 years (range 48–78 years). Three of the fractures involved the proximal third of the diaphysis while the remaining four involved the middle third. Six of the original fractures were closed and one was an open fracture. The time interval between the original injury and final surgery averaged 9.3 months. All the nailings were done by the ante-grade approach with static locking. Six of the patients had closed nailing and one had open nailing with bone grafting. The mean follow-up was 8 months and osseous union was achieved in all seven cases at a mean of 5.6 months. We conclude that the Supracondylar Femoral Nail is a useful alternative implant in the management of non-union of fractures of the humeral shaft with wide medullary canals.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^115RTrmG]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgery is generally the preferred treatment for fragility hip fractures in the older person. The surgical technique is well‐defined according to fracture type, and the beneficial role of early mobilisation and orthogeriatric models of care is well‐recognised. The evidence in favour of surgery does not come from randomised clinical trials but from consensus‐driven change in practice and a recognition of the poor outcomes in the past of those patients managed non‐operatively or who underwent delayed surgery. People presenting with hip fracture are at high risk of poor outcomes due to pre‐existing comorbidities, advanced age and frailty, and there is limited evidence to guide when non‐operative management should be considered and what the outcomes are following non‐operative management in contemporary practice. Recent work from our group has suggested that there is significant variation globally in attitudes and practice towards non‐operative management of hip fracture.

Our objective was to review the published literature systematically to describe: the variation in rates of non‐operative management of hip fracture across the world; the differences in admission characteristics between the non‐operative and operative populations; the outcomes associated with non‐operative compared with operative management; and the evidence gaps in known outcomes. Our focus was as much on describing the variation as on providing point estimates of particular characteristics.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^111gJsAK]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Adolescent displaced midshaft clavicle fractures — operative versus non-operative treatment — in adolescent patients (≤ 18 years old) with displaced midshaft clavicle fractures, operative treatment may offer no benefit compared to non-operative treatment and is associated with similar union rates and substantial reoperation rates for implant removal; Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Option: Limited. Two low-quality studies met inclusion criteria and both found no significant difference in patient reported outcomes between operative and non-operatively treated patients; eight of forty-three operatively treated patients required implant removal; non-operative treatment was favored for cosmetic outcomes, pain, and patient satisfaction; and displaced, midshaft clavicle fractures in adolescents heal regardless of what treatment method is chosen as no non-unions were reported. Implementation notes state that the decision for surgery in an adolescent patient should be based upon a shared decision-making model with the understanding that there is no difference in outcome measures once the fracture has healed, and that surgery should be reserved for select cases in the older adolescents; operative treatment has a higher need for implant removal, thus increasing health care costs and the risks associated with additional surgery; families and patients need to be counseled they can expect similar functional results with surgery or without surgery and the studies favor a trend toward non-operative treatment providing a more favorable cosmetic result; and no specific treatment recommendations are provided as similar outcomes are demonstrated regardless of how they are treated.

### Fracture nonunion in long bones: a literature review of risk factors and surgical management [^114TTY9S]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonunion following a long bone fracture causes considerable morbidity when it occurs. Risk factors depend on specific fractures but there is a complex interplay of injury severity, comorbidities, patient medication and infection. The majority of nonunions occur after long bone fractures with the tibia, femur, forearm, humerus and clavicle predominating. Despite interest in the biological augmentation of fracture healing, the majority of nonunions can be effectively managed with conventional surgical techniques. In this review we present a review of risk factors for nonunion and the outcome following surgical management.

### Efficacy and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of acute pain after orthopedic trauma: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the orthopedic trauma association [^111wtdvM]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Qualitative synthesis

Nine studiesinvestigated the impact of NSAIDs on non-union (table 2). In general, non-union was not objectively defined or defined as persistent fracture at variable time-points. Three studieswere randomized control trials, twoof which investigated the use of indomethacin for the prevention of HO and reported on non-union. Most studies (n = 6) found no relationship between NSAIDs and non-union, and of the three studiesdemonstrating an effect, twowere studies on the long-term (6 weeks) use of indomethacin for the prevention of HO.

Table 2
PICO 1.1 – impact of NSAIDs on non-union

McDonald et al randomized 128 patients undergoing fixation or ankle fractures to receive 30 mg intravenous ketorolac intraoperatively and 20 tablets of 10 mg ketorolac postoperatively or usual care. Additionally, both groups were prescribed 81 mg of ASA for deep vein thrombosis prevention. At 12 weeks, there was no difference in experimental or control groups in non-union (17% vs 23% respectively, p = 0.43). Buchheit et al and Zura et al used patient-level health claims data in North Carolina and evaluated 309 330 fractures and the impact of numerous medications, including NSAIDs, on fracture healing. Acute use of NSAIDs (< 30 days) was not associated with non-union in any of the fractures studied (18 bones), OR 0.98 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.07). Patients chronically using NSAIDs (prior to fracture) did have increased non-union OR 1.22 (95%CI 1.15 to 1.43). Causality was not established. Other medications investigated did have an association with non-union including acute opioid use (OR 1.47, 95% 1.40 to 1.54) and anticonvulsants (OR 1.2, 95% CI (1.16 to 1.29)).

### Neglected subtalar dislocation with unstable foot; to walk away or step our foot in? [^114fVRnL]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic neglected subtalar dislocation associated with a non-union talar neck fracture is rare and never documented before. The lack of information from the literature on the optimal management prompted us to describe our experience in the management of this condition. We reported a case of a 57-year-old women presented with this injury. A satisfactory outcome was obtained using a tibio-talo-calcaneal arthrodesis through a plantar approach.

### Augmentation plate without bone graft in the management of distal tibial diaphyseal non-union [^116H3vX1]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of augmentation plating with retaining of previous implant in situ in cases of non-united oligotrophic or atrophic aseptic distal tibial diaphyseal and metaphyseal fractures without bone grafting depending on the unified bone healing and non-union theory.

Methods

Through the period between December 2019 and December 2022, twelve patients with distal third tibial non-unions who were fixed at time of fracture either by intramedullary interlocking nails (seven cases) or by minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (five cases) were included. Non-union was diagnosed on basis of absence of any healing progression in three months period or absence of fracture healing after six months from index surgery. All patients had oligotrophic or atrophic non-union. Augmentation plating through an anterolateral approach was done on average of 7.25 months after initial surgery (6–9 months). Circumferential exposure of the fracture site and debridement of fibrous tissue were not necessary. No bone grafting was done as no cases had major bone defect.

Results

All patients achieved complete radiological union with a mean time of 21.8 weeks (range 18–30 weeks) that mean full callus formation in all cortices. All patients were walking independently after three months (13weeks) from surgery and returned to work even in cases of absent complete radiological union. No cases had been complicated with wound healing problems (infection or dehiscence). One patient had incomplete ankle dorsiflexion (10°) due to tight calf muscles and one patient had paresthesia on the dorsum of the foot that was not improved at last follow up (one year after surgery).

Conclusion

Augmentation plating is a safe and effective option for management of distal tibial diaphyseal nonunion even in cases of oligotrophic or atrophic non-union.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): the WSES and CWIS position paper [^117H7MFc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of segmental fractures and multiple fracture series

Opinions regarding which fractures, and how many fractures should be stabilized have differed in the case of FC injury. Although fixing one fracture per rib, converting the flail segment to a 'simple' rib fracture appeared to be sufficient to stabilize the chest wall, there are concerns regarding the fate of the non-fixed fractures in the flail segment. There is some evidence indicating that the fractures that are not fixed may continue to move, leading to interval displacement, and even increasing the risk of the fixated fracture failing; however clinical correlation of impact on function or QoL in this scenario has not yet been demonstrated.

Pending further data, in cases of FC or displaced segmental fractures, the stabilization of all fractures of each rib involved is recommended whenever possible. For this purpose, the use of one long plate instead of two short plates may improve fixation through reduced implant stiffness.

There are no studies comparing a strategy of fixation of sequential ribs vs. an "every other" approach. Theoretically, repairing all ribs that can be readily accessed through the index incision will provide optimal stability, pain reduction, and healing, avoiding the risk of subsequent displacement, deformity and recurrent pain in cases of non-union. Pending further data, the stabilization of all displaced ribs that are accessible through the main incision is recommended whenever possible; in this regard it may be preferable to repair all fractures within the exposed surgical field.

Selective plating can address most severe fracture patterns if there are a limited number of fractures that are not severely displaced, especially if they are difficult to access or if the condition of the patient deteriorates and the surgical procedure must be abbreviated or aborted.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^1163dqhu]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Even when sufficient data are available for non‐operative management, details of how these people compare with those offered surgery are sparse. Age, sex and fracture type are straightforward to collect, although the data we have would suggest that fracture type is irrelevant (with the caveat that we explicitly excluded studies focusing on non‐displaced intracapsular fractures). The limited data reported suggest that pre‐fracture functional status is associated with decisions for non‐operative management, as it is with postoperative rehabilitation outcomes. These are important factors that would be considered as part of shared decision‐making. Without these data it is very hard to understand the variation in non‐operative management across the world. Importantly, there was very little information about expected prognosis or life expectancy after hip fracture and what options (e.g. hospice or palliative care) were available. These are important considerations in decision‐making. Without these data, it will be difficult going forward to understand when or if non‐operative management is a reasonable approach.

Outcome data are dominated by mortality. Unsurprisingly, mortality is higher at all time points with non‐operative management. This increase in associated risk is present in both unselected and higher‐risk cohorts, and is not associated with the underlying mortality risk of the cohort. In the absence of randomised trials, it remains impossible to say to what extent this mortality risk is due to identifying patients at the end of their life vs. non‐operative management processes resulting in a greater likelihood of death. We would suggest that both are contributors. The seminal work from Loggers et al. in the Netherlands would suggest that, in their context, for the very frail, non‐operative management leads to a greater risk of death. Conversely, the global variation in survival after non‐operative management would suggest that this is not a given, and a reasonable number of people receiving non‐operative management will survive beyond a year. There are scarcely any data to draw any meaningful conclusions about what survivorship looks like in the short or longer term. Surprisingly, there was no clear association between non‐operative management and delirium or pressure sores, which are generally assumed to be more common with untreated fracture, though again the data are sparse. However, outside of prospective data collection, we would argue that any data on delirium are treated sceptically. Duration of hospital stay appears to be shorter, likely as a result of both the competing risk of death and decisions to not attempt rehabilitation.

### Management of nonunion following surgical management of scaphoid fractures: current concepts [^117URAGH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Management of scaphoid nonunion after failed surgery for acute scaphoid fracture presents a unique treatment challenge. Prior surgery complicates patient evaluation and increases the technical difficulty of future procedures. Healing of nonunion is crucial to prevent carpal collapse and progressive arthritis. A thorough workup is required to identify technical factors or treatment decisions that may have resulted in a poor outcome after initial fixation attempts. CT is particularly useful for characterizing nonunion and planning revision surgery. Several studies have described the use of bone grafts and fixation devices for scaphoid nonunion repair, including nonvascularized and vascularized bone grafts, screws, pins, and plates. Reliable rates of union have been achieved using nonvascularized bone graft supplemented with screw or wire fixation, particularly in the absence of osteonecrosis. Although vascularized grafts are more technically challenging, they improve the odds of union in the setting of osteonecrosis.

### Mechanical and biological treatment of long bone non-unions [^115HNNSA]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Non-union (NU) of bones is a multifactorial phenomenon. Infected non-unions and/or those with bone loss require "biological treatment", such as the excision of the pathological infected non-union site or the "creation" of new bone substance by the use of distraction techniques. The treatment of choice that meets both the biological and mechanical requirements is that of the external fixation, in as much as it has an extremely low septic complication rate and the mechanical environment can be varied automatically or programmed depending on the requirements. The authors report on a total of 287 cases of non-union treated with external fixation, with a 93% success rate.

### The presentation of scaphoid non-union [^115fKw2P]. Injury (2003). Low credibility.

A retrospective study of 30 patients presenting with scaphoid non-union was performed. The results showed that eight had been treated in plaster for a mean of 6 weeks and discharged from follow-up. They presented with established non-union at a mean of 60.3 months after the original fracture. Three of these cases have resulted in litigation against the surgeon. A total of 27 patients underwent bone grafting and Herbert's screw fixation achieving in union in 24. The natural history of scaphoid non-union has been examined in some detail in the literature. These studies have shown that scaphoid non-union is inevitably associated with arthritic changes that become worse with time and that freedom from symptoms is not protective from these changes. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment of scaphoid non-union is vital, whether symptomatic or not, to prevent osteoarthritis developing in the future. Inadequate follow-up of treated scaphoid fractures will result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of non-union with a potentially impaired outcome and even litigation against the surgeon. It is the authors' advice that all scaphoid fractures treated in a plaster cast are reassessed clinically and radiologically 6 months post-injury.

### [F] FDG PET accurately differentiates infected and non-infected non-unions after fracture fixation [^111JhR7u]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 5–10% of fractures fail to heal properly, qualifying as delayed union or persistent non-union fractures. Non-unions are radiologically classified as atrophic, oligotrophic, or hypertrophic, based in part on the particular pathogenesis of the non-union, which thus has an impact on further treatment options. The occurrence of infection at the site of non-union is a major issue in selecting appropriate treatment; infection is considered the worst prognostic factor in tibia fracture care. When stable fracture fixation can be confirmed, the presence of a bacterial infection is a possible reason for the persistence of a non-union. The treatment algorithm in such cases becomes more radical and aggressive debridement, with installation of an external fixator.

The presence of an acute infection may be obvious due to open draining wounds, erythema, or incomplete soft tissue coverage. However, swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia can be suggestive of an infection, while merely indicating instability and local inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, a bacterial infection at the site of non-union can be subacute or chronic, and consequently more difficult to diagnose. Besides the clinical aspects, the diagnosis of infection is supported by laboratory blood tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and peripheral leukocyte count. However, these laboratory tests are neither highly sensitive nor specific for infection as a cause of non-union. The gold standard proof of infection is from histological examination and pathogen-positive cell cultures of the infected area, which requires invasive biopsy. Non-invasive diagnostic tests include plain radiography, CT, ultrasonography, infection scintigraphy, and MRI. It is the last approach that may be the first course of imaging work-up of a suspected infection. MRI can exclude osteomyelitis with high certainty. However, it cannot distinguish with the same certainty between osteomyelitis and noninfectious causes of abnormal marrow signal intensity, such as neuropathic arthropathy and reactive marrow edema. Furthermore, MRI can be hampered by the presence of screws, plates, or other metallic devices at the site of bone injury.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^113m6Xx1]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The key findings of our systematic review were: rates of and outcomes following non‐operative management of hip fracture vary across the world; despite non‐operative management being reported for around 1 in 12 patients, there is a paucity of data on who these people are; and there are large gaps in our understanding of what outcomes are for these patients, particularly for those who survive.

To our knowledge, this is the largest collation of data pertaining to non‐operative management of hip fracture. Three previous reviews identified only a total of 22 studies. We cast a wide net deliberately, rather than narrowing our search to trials or matched cohort studies. We set out to describe variation in practice as much as deriving point estimates. Confounding by indication is universal to all the data we have reported; hence, interpreting outcomes of those with and without surgery is not straightforward. Any discussion of the point estimates we have generated must acknowledge the high degree of heterogeneity between reports and their clinical contexts. Although we have provided region‐level summary estimates, even those cover widely different healthcare systems and cultural approaches.

The variation in the use of non‐operative management of hip fracture between continents, countries and even within countries is significant (e.g. National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), Spanish Hip Fracture Registry and Australia and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry (ANZHFR)) and is unlikely to be explained by differences in the patient populations. Our previous work suggests that there are regional and cultural differences in non‐operative decision‐making and pathophysiological reasons are clearly a part of this. However, although the average age of patients managed non‐operatively was greater than those undergoing surgery, the difference was relatively small (2–2.5 years) and there was no association between the average age of the cohorts and proportions with non‐operative management. Similarly, although other surrogates of frailty such as independence in mobility and activities of daily living were suggestive of people living with greater degrees of frailty having non‐operative management, the data do not support this as a strong differentiator. The reasons why non‐operative management was chosen were frequently not reported or simply described in terms akin to 'too unwell'. However, we suggest that it is likely the clinician‐patient‐family interpretation of the patient's current state and future outcomes influences this decision more than differences in the health of the patients presenting with hip fracture.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^113B7Hd6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline — Operative stabilization for displaced and/or comminuted mid shaft clavicle fractures is characterized as acceptable, with comparative advantages over non-operative care. Operative stabilization of displaced and/or comminuted mid shaft clavicle fractures is an acceptable treatment, and in comparing operative versus non-operative treatment, regardless of the type of implant, the union rate was superior and time to union was faster compared to non-operative treatment. Feasibility notes that operative treatment with a plate or intramedullary nailing can lead to a high union rate, and that familiarity with plate fixation is the most likely reason for the greater number of studies analyzing this technique.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^112ub3J6]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The lack of data is startling. To our surprise, Europe appears relatively light on population and outcome data despite a strong tradition of hip fracture registries. Personal communications with some of the registries would suggest that more data are held than currently published and there are active projects to analyse data further. The lack of data from most of Africa is unsurprising; the number of people at risk of hip fracture is still relatively low, although demographic changes mean this will change in the next few decades.

As non‐randomised cohorts, all the studies are at considerable risk of bias by indication. In addition, aside from some of the national registries which can claim almost 100% capture of hip fracture data in their countries, there will inevitably be some degree of selection bias of the centres reporting data. The extent to which they serve populations that are different to the rest of their country or provide different approaches to non‐operative decision‐making is unanswerable. In many countries, almost all people with hip fractures will present to secondary care so reported data are likely to be representative of the local, if not national, population. In other parts of the world there is evidence that significant numbers either do not present to hospital or are not considered eligible for admission for a variety of reasons and will therefore be missing from any data presented here. For those countries, the proportions provided with operative management will be over‐estimated. The reasons why registry‐based data give lower estimates of rates of non‐operative management are unclear. This may be simply due to where the registries are based, or it may reflect under‐reporting by registries or over‐reporting by administrative data. It is certainly likely that registries miss some patients that never come to their attention. However, this does not seem likely to account for the large differences seen, notably between the UK NHFD (registry) data (with non‐operative rates of around 2%) and the administrative UK data for the same periods reported by Burrack et al. with rates of around 10%.

### Operative treatment of nonunions in the elderly: clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients at minimum 75 years of age [^112WcJYK]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Musculoskeletal problems in the elderly are seldom fatal, but quality of life and function is often severely affected after impaired fracture healing. Fortunately, bone has intrinsic capacity to heal after a fracture. This reparative (almost regenerative) potential is surprisingly well maintained throughout life. The complex but well-orchestrated events seen after a fracture closely resemble bone development during embryogenesis and, in the majority of cases, leads to complete healing and restoration of pre-fracture mobility and function. A small subset of patients will develop a nonunion. To complicate matters, there is no consensus as to what defines a nonunion. One pragmatic definition is "a fracture that will not heal without surgical intervention".

Risk factors for development of a nonunion are numerous. There are fracture-related factors (e.g. open injuries, and devitalized segments), patient-related factors (ex. nutrition, comorbidities, and smoking), and medication factors. Additionally, there are surgeon-related factors such as surgical technique (ex. biologically friendly versus extensile dissections), mechanical stability provided, and quality of reduction. Finally, infection can play a significant role, especially if the nonunion presents after attempted surgical intervention.

Whether age is an independent risk factor for nonunion remains unclear. There is evidence that bone repair is delayed in the elderly compared to younger patients. Recent studies (animal and human) elucidated small but potentially important differences between fracture healing in these two age groups. With increased aging, there are less mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) or osteoprogenitor cells. Stem cells from elderly patients produce less bone than those from younger individuals. MSCs in the elderly differentiate more into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts. Additionally, recent studies suggest an increased inflammatory state in the elderly, known as inflamm-aging, triggers skeletal stem/progenitor cell dysfunction and cell senescence. Despite progress made during recent decades in fracture treatment, the overall incidence of non-unions remains 2–5% for all fracture types. Higher incidence of failure in nonunion surgery is expected in elderly given their delayed bone repair. Furthermore, the number of elderly patients requiring nonunion treatment will grow due to rising life expectancy.

Non-surgical treatment

Four studies — comprising a total of 43 fractures — reported outcomes for non-surgical treatment. Patients were either treated with casting (33%) or a combination of non-surgical treatments such as bandaging and weight-bearing (53%). The study and patient characteristics are depicted in Table 2. The pooled bone union rate for non-surgical treatment was 56% (95% CI 41–70%) and the radiological union time was 20.9 weeks. Furthermore, the sub-analysis of the union rate per anatomical zone for non-surgical treatment showed a union rate of 65% (95% CI 43–82%) for zone 2 and 88% (95% CI 53–98%) for zone 3 fractures (Table 4). An overview of the union time and the rate of adverse bone healing events for non-surgical treatment is available in Table 2. Lastly, the pooled sports outcomes are reported in Table 3.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^1156ZNF5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline — Future research priorities emphasize standardization, longer-term outcomes, and decision-making thresholds, with a note on functional outcomes at one year. Consistency in reporting the definition of displaced clavicle fractures in randomized studies should be sought, and mid- and long-term outcome studies would provide information on value of treatment over time in the adult population. Improved understanding or prediction of which patients are most likely to fail nonoperative or operative treatment will be useful to further tailor clinical decision-making, and the determination of when non-operative treatment should be converted to operative stabilization would be useful in shared decision-making processes. It appears functional outcomes are similar at one year with either operative or non-operative treatment.

In covering the Emergency Department, the Plastic Surgeon can be faced with the mandibular fracture patient. Although the timely repair of the fracture usually leads to normal function and appearance, occasionally the surgeon is faced with the untoward sequelae of the mandible fracture. Post-traumatic mandibular deformities include non-union, malunion, malocclusion, TMJ dysfuction, and facial asymmetry. The difficulty in treatment of these deformities can be compounded by edentulous mandibles, substance abuse, and approach controversies such as the timing of the repair and surgical versus non-surgical management. Knowledge of the post-traumatic mandibular deformities by the treating physician not only assists in their management but may also allow for their prevention.

### Electromagnetic field stimulation for treating delayed union or non-union of long bone fractures in adults [^113AARhx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed union and non-union of fractures are a considerable cause of morbidity to patients. Laboratory studies have shown that electromagnetic fields can stimulate the formation of new bone, indicating a potential role for electromagnetic stimulation in the treatment of fractures that have failed to heal.

Objectives

To assess the effects of electromagnetic stimulation for treating delayed union or non-union of long bone fractures in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (May 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 20), trial registers and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating electromagnetic field stimulation for the treatment of delayed union or non-union of long bones in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Treatment effects were assessed using risk ratios and, where appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Results

Four studies, involving 125 participants, were included. Three studies evaluated the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields and one study, capacitive coupled electric fields. Participants with delayed union and non-union of the long bones were included, but most data related to non-union of the tibia. Although all studies were blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials, each study had limitations. The primary measure of the clinical effectiveness of electromagnetic field stimulation was the proportion of participants whose fractures had united at a fixed time point. The overall pooled effect size was small and not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 4.48; 4 trials). There was substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity in this pooled analysis (I² = 58%). A sensitivity analysis conducted to determine the effect of multiple follow-up time-points on the heterogeneity amongst the studies showed that the effect size remained non-significant at 24 weeks (risk ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 3.54; 3 trials), with similar heterogeneity (I² = 57%). There was no reduction in pain found in two trials. No study reported functional outcome measures. One trial reported two minor complications resulting from treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Though the available evidence suggests that electromagnetic field stimulation may offer some benefit in the treatment of delayed union and non-union of long bone fractures, it is inconclusive and insufficient to inform current practice. More definitive conclusions on treatment effect await further well-conducted randomised controlled trials.

### Clavicular fracture non-union surgical outcome and complications [^112pDKg7]. Injury (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic clavicular fracture non-union is rare. When it does occur, however, it may pose a difficult problem causing pain and functional impairment. The emphasis of this paper is on preopertive disabilities and the postoperative outcome and complications. Twenty patients with clavicular non-union treated operatively from 1989 to 1997 were reviewed, the average follow up was thirty-four months. Eleven fractures were midshaft, eight were lateral third and one medial third. A detailed proforma was completed with the patients documenting preoperative symptoms, outcome after surgery and complications. A literature search was carried out to find out the incidence of complications related to operating on post-traumatic clavicular non-union. All of the twenty fractures non-unions duly united after surgical intervention although three required early adjustment or change of metal work. The subjective and objective outcomes were good in 19 cases and poor in one. The postoperative complications included three implant failures, one stiff shoulder, two patients with numbness below the scar and one patient with an infected donor site wound. The literature search revealed that from 24 publications and 301 patients who had operations for clavicular non-union ther were 18 (6%) reported complications related to metal work, 45 (15%) reported complications related to soft tissues, seven (2%) complications related to the scar and 24 (8%) failures of union. Symptomatic clavicular non-union can cause severe disabilities. Good outcome, at low risk, can be expected from internal fixation and bone grafting of midshaft non-unions. Although there are only eight cases of lateral third clavicular non-unions, this is the largest series in the literature. Furthermore, the study clearly demonstrates both the difficulties treating this fracture surgically and a procedure to be avoided (acromio-clavicular bridging), which, again has not been previously addressed.

### The value of laboratory and imaging studies in the evaluation of long-bone non-unions [^111ywQr5]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Delayed union and non-union are common but definitive diagnosis is difficult. Few studies have evaluated imaging methods and laboratory parameters in the distinction between normal and prolonged heating specifically of long-bone fractures. The values of newer imaging methods have been analysed in some cases and should be the subject of further clinical trials. Biological markers may facilitate the earliest diagnosis of delayed union. Preliminary studies of these are limited and more trials are needed. To date it is still difficult to predict accurately a normal consolidation of bone.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^114zQFbM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale. With the exception of matched cohort studies, all studies were expected to be substantially confounded by indication. Data extraction items included study details; reasons (if stated) for non‐operative management; numbers of non‐operative and operative patients; characteristics of the non‐operative and operative cohorts (e.g. age, sex, fracture type); and outcomes of the non‐operative and operative cohorts (e.g. mortality at various time‐points; complications). Absence of reporting of characteristics and outcomes was documented for all studies. Ethnicity was reported by reference to the majority ethnic group of the relevant country. We did not seek information on funding sources as this was highly unlikely to be of relevance.

A priori cohorts were categorised by World Bank region (East Asia and Pacific; Europe and Central Asia; Latin America and the Caribbean; Middle East and North Africa; North America; South Asia; Sub‐Saharan Africa); World Bank classification of income; unselected (all people with hip fracture without stratification by risk); lower vs. higher underlying risk; and source of data (local collection; administrative data; registry). Underlying risk was assigned based on descriptions of cohort age (age < or > 85 y; approximately the median age of people with hip fracture); dementia; frailty; non‐home residence before fracture; or authors' description and agreed by two authors.

### A randomized controlled cost study of infuse BMP 2 vs iliac crest autograft for non union of long bone fractures (infuse) [^114HaqZC]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Study Overview We are inviting individuals such as yourself, who have diaphyseal fracture with a non union to participate in this research study. A non-union is a lack of bone healing after 3 months after the operation. The diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone where the fracture occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle, tibia, femur, humerus and forearm. Treatment goals for these types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union to return to the work force and to normal activities more quickly not only has a good financial impact on society, but also improves over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.

"Infuse" is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. "Infuse" may be the first commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention. Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.
- Patients requiring mechanical fixation other than Intramedullary nailing or plating
- Patients with fractures that fall outside the diaphysis defined for the specific bone in question, i.e. no metaphyseal fractures.
- Patients with segmental circumferential bone loss > 4cm.
- Patients whose fractures are the result of a tumour
- Infection per se, does not result in exclusion but it must be treated and the soft tissue envelope closed prior to randomization
- Patients with known metabolic bone disease which would negatively impact on the bone healing process.
- Patients with known sensitivity to collagen.

### A comparative study of 2 doses of BM autologous H-MSC + biomaterial vs iliac crest autoGraft for bone healing in non-union (ORTHOUNION) [^111qAfwc]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

A Comparative Study of 2 Doses of BM Autologous H-MSC+Biomaterial vs Iliac Crest AutoGraft for Bone Healing in Non-Union ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Bone injuries represent an important world medical problem producing significant healthcare and societal expenditure. While most bone injuries are not severe and are capable of healing through bone regeneration by natural callus formation with standard treatments, severe bone injuries may not heal, becoming an important unmet clinical need. Non-unions, or pseudarthrosis, may occur in 5% to 20% of long-bone fractures that fail to heal properly after more than 6 months, with morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased expenses. The most commonly accepted standard augmentation to procure fracture and non-union healing consists of autologous bone grafting, obtained from the same patient in a different surgical site and transplanted to the reconstruction site.

In this context, the ORTHOUNION initiative focuses on the opportunity to test the hypothesis of superiority of MSC, the investigational ATMP, versus the currently accepted standard therapy, iliac crest bone autograft to biologically augment surgical treatment of long-bone non-unions. Biological: Cultured Mesenchymal Stem Cells Procedure: Autologous iliac crest graft. Exclusion Criteria:

- Hypertrophic non-unions
- Segmental bone loss requiring specific therapy
- Unrecovered vascular or neural injury
- Other fractures causing interference with weight bearing
- Visceral injuries or diseases interfering with callus formation.
- Active infection of any location and aetiology
- Surgical contraindication of any cause
- Pregnancy, breast feeding women and women who are of childbearing age and not practicing adequate birth control.
- Malignant tumour
- History of bone harvesting on iliac crest contraindicating new iliac crest bone graft harvesting or bone marrow collection.
- Autoimmune inflammatory disease
- Current treatment by biphosphonates not stopped three months prior to study inclusion
- Impossibility to meet at the appointments for the follow up
- Participation in another therapeutic trial in the previous 3 months
- Second non-union in case of bilateral or multiple non-unions.
