## Question

Management of peritonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of peritonitis across its major etiologies and contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the type of peritonitis and the clinical severity. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to obtain cultures and imaging. Next, I will review source control strategies, including operative versus percutaneous options and damage control principles. After that, I need to ensure antimicrobial therapy is tailored to etiology and resistance risk, with attention to dosing and de-escalation. Then, I should confirm supportive care priorities, including fluids, vasopressors, and organ support. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring and reassessment, and prevention strategies, making sure each step aligns with guideline-grade evidence and that I double-check any assumptions that might be outdated or overly broad.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because treatment hinges on it. Peritonitis is broadly categorized as primary (spontaneous, often in cirrhosis), secondary (from loss of GI integrity or infected viscera), and tertiary (persistent or recurrent infection after adequate source control), and this taxonomy guides both microbiology and management decisions; I should also grade severity using sepsis-3 definitions and recognize that mortality escalates with severe sepsis and septic shock, which will influence the urgency of interventions and the breadth of empiric therapy [^115TAYeT] [^113r368L].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic triggers and thresholds before jumping to therapy. For suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis, diagnostic paracentesis should be performed without delay, and an ascitic PMN count greater than 250 cells/mm³ establishes the diagnosis; bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles improves culture yield, and although culture positivity is not required for diagnosis, it helps with de-escalation later; I should also remember that in culture-negative cases with high suspicion, treatment should proceed empirically while continuing evaluation for alternative causes [^115o9h96] [^11179ard] [^115h8Lzu] [^116iQsaf].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging strategy for secondary peritonitis. In unstable patients, bedside ultrasound can rapidly identify free fluid and guide urgent decisions, whereas contrast-enhanced CT is the modality of choice when the patient is stable, to localize the source, detect abscesses amenable to drainage, and triage to operative versus percutaneous management; I need to ensure I do not delay source control for imaging in unstable patients with diffuse peritonitis [^113r368L] [^113QU9Md].

> Next, I will examine source control, because this is the cornerstone of outcome. For diffuse secondary peritonitis, operative source control with resection, repair, debridement, irrigation, and drainage is indicated urgently; in physiologically deranged patients, a damage control laparotomy with temporary abdominal closure is appropriate, and I should avoid premature definitive closure when there is ongoing contamination or compartment physiology; for well-localized abscesses without diffuse peritonitis, image-guided percutaneous drainage can be definitive or temporizing until the patient is optimized for surgery [^115TAYeT] [^113r368L] [^1166spP9].

> I need to check the re-laparotomy strategy because this often confuses teams. Historically, planned re-laparotomies every 36–48 hours were used, but randomized data suggest an on-demand strategy reduces reoperations and costs without increasing adverse outcomes; however, I should not let this delay recognition of persistent infection — early reoperation for ongoing sepsis or failure to improve is critical, and delays beyond 24–48 hours worsen outcomes in postoperative peritonitis [^1166spP9] [^113ncSNQ].

> Let me think about antimicrobial therapy and make sure I align with etiology and resistance risk. For community-acquired SBP, a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is first-line; for healthcare-associated SBP or those with recent broad-spectrum exposure or septic shock, broader empiric coverage is warranted, and in settings with high ESBL prevalence, a carbapenem may be needed; importantly, each hour of delay to appropriate antibiotics in septic shock increases mortality, so I should start promptly after cultures and de-escalate at 48 hours based on clinical response and microbiology [^112z52Rh] [^111RuPDB] [^111Ah299].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought vancomycin should be routine for all severe secondary peritonitis, but I should correct that. Routine empiric MRSA coverage is not indicated unless there are specific risk factors such as prior MRSA colonization or infection, severe healthcare-associated infection in a high-MRSA-prevalence setting, or severe sepsis/septic shock where local epidemiology supports it; otherwise, I risk overtreatment and toxicity, so I will tailor glycopeptide or linezolid use to those scenarios [^112BHugS].

> I should double-check dosing principles in critical illness. Hydrophilic agents like beta-lactams often require higher loading doses and prolonged or continuous infusion to achieve pharmacokinetic targets in sepsis, and I must adjust for renal function while ensuring early adequate exposure; conversely, lipophilic agents like fluoroquinolones may maintain adequate levels despite volume expansion, but I still need to individualize based on organ function and clearance [^114vEtUE].

> Next, I should review supportive care because organ dysfunction drives mortality. Early goal-directed resuscitation with crystalloids, timely vasopressor support for refractory shock, lung-protective ventilation when indicated, and early nutrition are foundational; in cirrhosis with SBP, albumin administration at 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3 reduces renal failure and mortality, particularly in those with renal dysfunction or severe hepatic decompensation, so I should not omit this adjunct [^115TAYeT] [^111RuPDB] [^116hVg8r].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, I should start intraperitoneal antibiotics covering gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas, and add antifungal prophylaxis to prevent secondary fungal infection; catheter removal is indicated for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis, and for Aspergillus peritonitis, prompt catheter removal plus systemic voriconazole is recommended; I should also remember that culture-negative PD peritonitis warrants vigilance for atypical organisms and noninfectious mimics [^115Q4Cb8] [^111VU5vu] [^111BLMiK].

> For postoperative peritonitis, I should confirm that early re-laparotomy after maximal resuscitation is associated with improved survival, and that delays beyond 24 hours increase mortality; the microbiology often includes MDR organisms, so empiric therapy should reflect local epidemiology and prior antibiotic exposure, with a low threshold to escalate and a plan to de-escalate once cultures return [^113ncSNQ] [^113tQX4b].

> I will now examine monitoring and reassessment to avoid therapeutic inertia. In SBP, repeating paracentesis at 48 hours to assess PMN response is advised; a less than 25% decrease in PMN count should prompt broadening of antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis; for secondary peritonitis, clinical trajectory, white cell count, lactate, and source control adequacy should guide the need for reoperation or additional drainage [^1131FfV3] [^111RuPDB] [^115TAYeT].

> But wait, what about prevention, since recurrence and complications are common in cirrhosis. For primary prophylaxis, patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should receive short-course IV ceftriaxone, and selected high-risk patients with low ascitic protein and advanced liver disease may benefit from norfloxacin; for secondary prophylaxis after an episode of SBP, daily norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin is recommended, and I should avoid unnecessary PPIs given their association with SBP risk in susceptible patients [^114nncfC] [^112qsq2X] [^114itsjs] [^117E25UJ].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principles to ensure nothing is missing. Early recognition and rapid diagnostic confirmation, immediate initiation of appropriate empiric antibiotics, definitive or damage-control source control, and aggressive supportive care are the pillars; delays in antibiotics or source control measurably worsen outcomes, and a disciplined reassessment at 48 hours with de-escalation reduces resistance and toxicity while maintaining efficacy [^113r368L] [^112BHugS].

Peritonitis management centers on **early source control** [^116iC6d5] and **timely broad-spectrum antibiotics** [^116iC6d5], with rapid resuscitation and organ support [^115TAYeT]. Source control entails **urgent surgery or percutaneous drainage** to eliminate the focus of infection, restore anatomy, and prevent ongoing contamination [^113QU9Md]. Empiric antibiotics should start within 1 hour [^114vEtUE], targeting gram-negative and anaerobic organisms, then narrow to culture results; in cirrhosis, use third-generation cephalosporins for SBP and add albumin for renal protection [^112z52Rh] [^111RuPDB]. Supportive care includes fluids, vasopressors, and nutrition; monitor for complications and reassess at 48 hours to guide de-escalation and duration, typically 5–7 days if clinically resolved [^112jT4gR] [^1131FfV3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical assessment**: Identify peritoneal signs (rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity), systemic sepsis, and underlying causes (e.g. perforation, appendicitis, diverticulitis, cirrhosis, peritoneal dialysis) [^114wK6Hw].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, lactate, blood cultures, and ascitic or peritoneal fluid analysis (PMN count, culture, Gram stain) [^11179ard].

- **Imaging**: CT abdomen/pelvis is the modality of choice to localize the source, detect free air, abscesses, or perforation [^113QU9Md].

---

## Source control

Source control is the cornerstone of therapy and requires **urgent intervention** to eliminate the source of infection [^112Kdf5a].

- **Surgical intervention**: Exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy for perforated viscus, gangrenous bowel, appendicitis, diverticulitis, or anastomotic leak [^115TAYeT].

- **Percutaneous drainage**: For localized abscesses or collections not amenable to surgery [^113ncSNQ].

- **Open abdomen**: Consider in severe peritonitis with extensive contamination or hemodynamic instability [^1166spP9].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotics should start **within 1 hour** of recognition [^114vEtUE], tailored to likely pathogens and local resistance patterns [^116iC6d5].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic regimen** |
|-|-|
| Community-acquired secondary peritonitis | - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Ceftriaxone + metronidazole <br/> - Ciprofloxacin + metronidazole |
| Healthcare-associated or severe infection | - Carbapenem (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) <br/> - Piperacillin-tazobactam + vancomycin |
| Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) | Third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) [^112z52Rh] |
| Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis | - Intraperitoneal antibiotics covering gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas [^115Q4Cb8] |

---

Antibiotic therapy should be **adjusted to culture results** and **de-escalated** accordingly [^112jT4gR]. The typical duration is 5–7 days if the clinical response is satisfactory; longer courses are reserved for persistent infection or slow response [^1131FfV3].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is essential to stabilize patients and prevent complications. Provide aggressive IV crystalloids and **vasopressors (norepinephrine)** to maintain **mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg** [^notfound]. Start enteral nutrition early when feasible; use parenteral nutrition only if enteral feeding is not possible. Manage pain with opioids, and use **mechanical ventilation** for respiratory failure or severe sepsis.

---

## Special considerations

- **Cirrhosis and SBP**: Administer albumin (1.5 g/kg day 1, 1 g/kg day 3) to reduce renal impairment and mortality [^111RuPDB].

- **Peritoneal dialysis**: Prompt intraperitoneal antibiotics; remove catheter if refractory, relapsing, or fungal infection [^115Q4Cb8].

- **Pediatric patients**: Adjust antibiotics for age and weight; consider nephrotic syndrome-related peritonitis with pneumococcal coverage [^1117whsr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring and reassessment are critical to guide therapy and detect complications. Track temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and urine output, and repeat **CBC**, electrolytes, renal and liver function, and **lactate** as indicated. Assess clinical improvement at 48 hours; if there is no improvement, **broaden antibiotics** and re-evaluate for persistent infection or alternative diagnoses [^1131FfV3]. Common complications include abscess, fistula, wound infection, and recurrent peritonitis.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, patient comorbidities, and timeliness of intervention. Mortality is higher with delayed source control, severe sepsis, or multidrug-resistant organisms [^113ncSNQ] [^113r368L] [^114wK6Hw].

---

Effective peritonitis management requires **rapid diagnosis, prompt source control, appropriate antibiotics, and aggressive supportive care**, with ongoing reassessment to optimize outcomes.

### Therapeutic management of peritonitis: a comprehensive guide for intensivists [^116iC6d5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The management of peritonitis in critically ill patients is becoming increasingly complex due to their changing characteristics and the growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel summarizes the latest advances in the therapeutic management of these critically ill patients.

Results

Appendicitis, cholecystitis and bowel perforation represent the majority of all community-acquired infections, while most cases of healthcare-associated infections occur following suture leaks and/or bowel perforation. The micro-organisms involved include a spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as anaerobes and fungi. Healthcare-associated infections are associated with an increased likelihood of MDR pathogens. The key elements for success are early and optimal source control and adequate surgery and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Drainage, debridement, abdominal cleansing, irrigation, and control of the source of contamination are the major steps to ensure source control. In life-threatening situations, a "damage control" approach is the safest way to gain time and achieve stability. The initial empirical antiinfective therapy should be prescribed rapidly and must target all of the micro-organisms likely to be involved, including MDR bacteria and fungi, on the basis of the suspected risk factors. Dosage adjustment needs to be based on pharmacokinetic parameters. Supportive care includes pain management, optimization of ventilation, haemodynamic and fluid monitoring, improvement of renal function, nutrition and anticoagulation.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with peritonitis develop complications, including worsening of pre-existing organ dysfunction, surgical complications and healthcare-associated infections. The probability of postoperative complications must be taken into account in the decision-making process prior to surgery.

### Secondary peritonitis: principles of diagnosis and intervention [^113r368L]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Secondary peritonitis accounts for 1% of urgent or emergent hospital admissions and is the second leading cause of sepsis in patients in intensive care units globally. Overall mortality is 6%, but mortality rises to 35% in patients who develop severe sepsis. Despite the dramatic growth in the availability and use of imaging and laboratory tests, the rapid diagnosis and early management of peritonitis remains a challenge for physicians in emergency medicine, surgery, and critical care. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of peritonitis and its potential progression to sepsis, discuss the utility and limitations of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests, and present a paradigm for the management of secondary peritonitis.

### Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis: towards improving evidence, practices, and outcomes [^115zsxtW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Peritonitis is a common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis that results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It also significantly limits the use of this important dialysis modality. Despite its importance as a patient safety issue, peritonitis practices and outcomes vary markedly and unacceptably among different centers, regions, and countries. This article reviews peritonitis risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly focusing on potential drivers of variable practices and outcomes, controversial or unresolved areas, and promising avenues warranting further research. Potential strategies for augmenting the existing limited evidence base and reducing the gap between evidence-based best practice and actual practice also are discussed.

### Peritonitis-the Western experience [^113QU9Md]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Much of what has been learned about the management of peritonitis has come from prospective randomized clinical trials. A number of important concepts have developed from these studies. We recognize that patients with appendicular sources of peritonitis have a lower mortality and improved outcomes compared to patients with non-appendicular sources. Pancreatic necrosis incites a unique systemic inflammatory response, which is commonly associated with respiratory failure as well as other organ failures. Although pancreatic necrosis was once treated commonly with operation, non-operative management of sterile necrosis has become the norm due to the use of long-term prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and recognition than uninfected necrosis will usually resolve over time. Pancreatic necrosis is thus excluded from most reviews of peritonitis as it will be from the present review.

The successful management of intraabdominal infection is predicated on the use of appropriate operative measures to address peritoneal infection. Prospective clinical trials have also taught us the importance of the concept of "source control". Source control encompasses all of the measures that eradicate the focus of infection, prevent continuing contamination, and restore functional anatomic relationships. This generally involves: 1) drainage of abscesses or infected fluid collections; 2) débridement of necrotic or infected tissues; and 3) definitive measures to control the source of contamination and to restore anatomy and function.

The response to intraabdominal infection depends upon the complex interaction of a variety of factors. The degree of microbial contamination, the site of origin of contamination and whether contamination is localized or diffuse are important. Previous operations or diseases can result in adhesions that may help localize infections. The systemic response to infection depends upon immune status as well as innate genetically coded responses to infection.

The diagnosis of intraabdominal infection is usually based on history and physical examination. Many patients will have abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning to establish the diagnosis. CT is also useful to identify patients with localized abscesses who are candidates for percutaneous drainage rather than operation.

The treatment of intraabdominal infections is based on the restoration of normal homeostasis. Treatment principles include: 1) restoration of fluid and electrolyte imbalances; 2) administration of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy; 3) control of the source of infection; and 4) physiologic support of organ systems. Failure to address any of these important areas can lead to increased mortality, an increased incidence of organ failure, and prolonged hospital stay.

This article will review the recent advances in the treatment of intraabdominal infections in the Western world. Emphasis will be on the emergence of newer developments upon the outcome of treatment.

### Management of peritonitis in the critically ill patient [^116auFZS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Severe secondary peritonitis carries significant mortality, despite advancements in critical care support and other therapies. Surgical management requires a multidisciplinary approach to guide the timing and the number of interventions necessary to eradicate the septic foci and create optimal healing with the fewest complications. Research is needed regarding the best surgical strategy for very severe cases. The use of deferred primary anastomosis seems safe in patients presenting with hemodynamic instability and hypoperfusion. These patients have a high risk of anastomotic failure and fistula formation. Allowing for aggressive resuscitation and judicious assessment of the progression of local inflammation are safe strategies to achieve the highest success and minimize serious and protracted complications in patients who survive the initial septic insult.

### Infections in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [^116pqThF]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Considering experience acquired in the past years, it seems as though physicians have reached a plateau in the frequency of peritonitis. A peritonitis rate of 1 every 2 patient years may be acceptable. Further reduction of this peritonitis rate will require inordinately large efforts on all fronts. One will have to consider what are the acceptable costs and risks of peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis. New developments in catheter technology, improved connections, better understanding of patient selection and training programs, improved diagnostic and therapeutic methods in the management of peritonitis, and understanding of the infectious and immune processes are eagerly awaited developments.

Conclusion

The clinical outcomes associated with secondary peritonitis are highly dependent upon the site of contamination (appendicitis vs others), as well as local and systemic factors. Recent developments in care have influenced the route and choice of operation. Improvements in antimicrobial therapy and results of prospective randomized clinical trials have identified a variety of effective antibiotics for the management of these disorders. There continues to be controversy about the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for secondary peritonitis.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115RLLSS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, laparoscopy has been gaining wider acceptance in the diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal infections. The laparoscopic approach in the treatment of peritonitis is feasible for many emergency conditions. It has the advantage to allow, at the same time, an adequate diagnosis and appropriate treatment with a less invasive abdominal approach. However, laparoscopy due to the increase of intra-abdominal pressure due to pneumoperitoneum, may have a negative effect in critically ill patients leading to acid–base balance disturbances, as well as changes in cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology. Laparoscopy is still uncommon in many areas of the world for several reasons, a major one being cost. In these countries, the challenges posed by the burden of primary healthcare concerns have limited government support for development of modern tertiary healthcare facilities, and laparoscopic surgery is practiced in only a few tertiary hospitals. Innovative programs to train surgeons and develop low-cost equipment in these countries are encouraging. Some studies in the literature have focused on the feasibility of implementing laparoscopic procedures in resource-poor countries, and how to overcome the challenges involved.

Etiological factors of peritonitis show a wide geographical variation and different spectrum in the various regions of the world. Table 3 summarizes the sources of infection in the recent international WISS Study.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^113ncSNQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Post-operative peritonitis

Post-operative peritonitis (PP) is a life-threatening hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infection with high rates of mortality. The most common cause of PP is an anastomotic leakage. It is most frequent after rectal resection, but it may complicate any gastrointestinal anastomosis. Treating patients with post-operative peritonitis requires supportive therapy of organ dysfunction, source control of infection, and intensive antimicrobial therapy. The diagnosis of post-operative peritonitis may be difficult because there are no absolutely specific clinical signs and laboratory tests to reject or confirm the diagnosis. The atypical clinical presentation may be responsible for a delay in diagnosis and re-intervention or reoperation.

On the basis of the clinical conditions, the size of the abscess and the access to interventional radiology, antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage may be suggested to treat post-operative localized intra-abdominal abscesses when there are no signs of generalized peritonitis (Recommendation 2C).

Antibiotics and drainage may be the optimal means of treating post-operative localized intra-abdominal abscesses when there are no signs of generalized peritonitis. Several retrospective studies in the fields of surgery and radiology have documented the effectiveness of percutaneous drainage in the treatment of post-operative localized intra-abdominal abscesses.

Prompt surgical source control should be performed following diagnosis of post-operative peritonitis. Ineffective control of the septic source is associated with significantly elevated mortality rates (Recommendation 1C).

Complete surgical source control should be performed as soon as the patient has been maximally resuscitated. The inability to control the septic source is associated with an intolerably high patient mortality. Organ failure and/or subsequent re-laparotomies that have been delayed for more than 24 h both result in higher rates of mortality for patients affected by post-operative intra-abdominal infections. Early re-laparotomies appear to be the most effective means of treating post-operative peritonitis.

In 2009, a retrospective study by Chichom-Mefire et al. analyzed aspects of re-operative abdominal surgery in an economically disadvantaged environment with respect to indications, operative findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes. Mortality in this series was 18%, increasingly significant when the initial operative procedure was for peritonitis and re-operation was due to septic complications. Operative re-intervention based on clinical findings was considered the favored strategy.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^115TAYeT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary peritonitis is the most frequent form of peritonitis presenting to surgical units. It results from the loss of integrity of the GI tract (e.g. GI necrosis, perforated viscus). It is invariably polymicrobial, but varies widely in severity and outcomes. The treatment involves surgical intervention, whether percutaneous or via laparoscopy or open procedure. Percutaneous drainage can obviate the need for surgery, or temporize until treatment confers better surgical risk, whereas an incision provides opportunity to achieve "source control", which is the principal determinant of outcome. A short course of antibiotics is usually necessary, but adjunctive.

Tertiary peritonitis is a recurrent or persistent infection of the peritoneal cavity after more than one unsuccessful source control procedure for secondary peritonitis. Tertiary peritonitis is a distinct entity, representing an e complication of failed source control for secondary peritonitis. The terms "ongoing peritonitis" or "persistent peritonitis" have been proposed as alternatives because they may describe better the evolution of secondary peritonitis. Patients with tertiary peritonitis are usually critically ill and require substantial hospital resources for nutritional and organ functional support, as well as re-laparotomy (sometimes multiple operations). The microbiology differs from secondary peritonitis in that is associated with commensal organisms (e.g. enterococci, yeast, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa).

The term "acute peritonitis" is vague and is often used generically. cIAI nomenclature, as opposed to the term "uncomplicated intra-abdominal infections" (uIAIs) defines an infection proceeding beyond the organ of origin into the peritoneal cavity. cIAIs are complex conditions, in which numerous aspects of the disease process and management options must be assessed to provide optimal management. The cornerstones of cIAI management include adequate source control achieved by the index procedure; appropriate antimicrobial therapy considering the host, the disease, the likely pathogen(s), and the agents available; and hemodynamic support by intravenous fluid, with judicious vasopressor use for refractory septic shock not responsive to fluid alone.

### Peritonitis: laparoscopic approach [^112FiQET]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Laparoscopy has gained widespread acceptance in common surgical practice as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Abdominal emergencies often pose a diagnostic challenge to the general surgeon. A correct diagnosis is crucial because of the various diseases that may be responsible for the same symptoms, in order to plan the appropriate procedure or to avoid unnecessary Laparotomies. Non-invasive diagnostic procedures are expensive, not always conclusive and available in all settings. Laparoscopy is the only minimally invasive technique to allow at the same time for adequate diagnosis, appropriate treatment and/or the best abdominal approach.

In 1992 we decided to approach abdominal emergencies with LAPS, if a well trained LAPS surgeon were present. Ever since that time, 602 patients admitted with acute abdomen have been approached Laparoscopically. Of them 112 presented with a frank acute abdomen due to peritonitis. The overall conversion rate was 23.2%; morbidity was 12.5% and mortality 1.76%. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 85.7% of patients, and 90.6% of these latter received proper treatment. Herein we wish to analyze the advantages of Laparoscopy in the management algorithm for acute abdomen due to peritonitis as regards its indications, morbidity, mortality and its socio-economic impact.

Adapted from Weigelt JA.

Tertiary peritonitis represents an infection that is persistent or recurrent at least 48 hours after appropriate management of primary or secondary peritonitis. It is more common among critically ill or immunocompromised patients. Because of the poor host defenses, it is also often associated with less virulent organisms, such as Enterococcus, Candida, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterobacter.

Intra-abdominal sepsis is an IAI that results in severe sepsis or septic shock.

Re-laparotomy strategy

In certain instances infection can lead to an excessive immune response and sepsis may progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

In these cases, patients are severely destabilized by the septic shock and will likely experience increased complication and mortality rates.

These patients benefit from aggressive surgical treatment, prompt intervention, and successive follow-up surgeries ("re-operations") to better control MODS triggered by the ongoing intra-abdominal infection.

Deciding if and when to perform a re-laparotomy in cases of secondary peritonitis is largely subjective and based on professional experience. Factors indicative of progressive or persistent organ failure during early post-operative follow-up analysis are the best indicators of ongoing infection.

Three methods are currently employed for local mechanical management of abdominal sepsis following an initial laparotomy:

(1) Open abdomen

(2) Planned re-laparotomy

(3) On-demand re-laparotomy

Given the procedure's ability to streamline healthcare resources, reduce overall medical costs, and prevent the need for further re-laparotomies, the on-demand re-laparotomy is recommended for patients with severe peritonitis. (Recommendation 1A).

In 2007, van Ruler et al. published a randomized, clinical study comparing planned and on-demand re-laparotomy strategies for patients with severe peritonitis.

In this trial, a total of 232 patients with severe intra-abdominal infections were randomized (116 planned and 116 on-demand).

In the planned re-laparotomy group, procedures were performed every 36 to 48 hours following the index laparotomy to inspect, drain, lavage, and perform other necessary abdominal interventions to address residual peritonitis or new infectious focuses.

In the on-demand re-laparotomy group, procedures were only performed for patients who demonstrated clinical deterioration or lack of improvement that was likely attributable to persistent intra-abdominal pathology.

Patients in the on-demand re-laparotomy group did not exhibit a significantly lower rate of adverse outcomes compared to patients in the planned re-laparotomy group, but they did show a substantial reduction in subsequent re-laparotomies and overall healthcare costs.

### Peritonitis-the Western experience [^113zfdP6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis can be defined in a variety of ways. Primary peritonitis is an infection of the peritoneal cavity usually occurring in patients with preexisting ascites that is not related to diseases of the abdominal or retroperitoneal viscera. Secondary peritonitis, the most common form of peritonitis, can occur due to spontaneous perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal ischemia, or following an operation. Tertiary peritonitis is a recurrent infection of the peritoneal cavity that follows an episode of either primary or secondary peritonitis. Peritonitis can also be classified as diffuse or localized. Over time, peritoneal infection can coalesce to form an intraabdominal abscess. These two forms of peritonitis are often referred to collectively as intraabdominal infection.

There are a variety of factors influencing the reduction in mortality from peritonitis over the last century. Safer anesthetic techniques, improved understanding of perioperative fluid management, the advent of blood banking, improvements in critical care, more rapid and accurate diagnostic studies, and more effective antibiotics are some of the factors that have led to a reduction in mortality from peritonitis. On the other hand, a variety of challenges have arisen that threaten to offset these advances. Patients with intraabdominal infection are older, more commonly have comorbid diseases, often have associated immune suppression due to chronic diseases or their treatment, and more frequently have decreased physiologic reserve with either sub-clinical or evident organ failure. Although the bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract has remained relatively consistent over time, the widespread presence of antimicrobial resistance among patients with nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections has presented another challenge. This is particularly true for patients who have received previous antimicrobial treatment, inappropriate therapy, or have developed tertiary peritonitis where the pathogens are commonly resistant to front- line agents.

### Risk factors for multidrug resistant bacteria and optimization of empirical antibiotic therapy in postoperative peritonitis [^113tQX4b]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative peritonitis (PP) is a life-threatening complication of abdominal surgery with high rates of organ failure and mortality. Adequate management of patients with PP requires supportive therapy of organ dysfunction, source control of infection with surgery and/or drainage, and antimicrobial therapy. Because early and adequate antimicrobial therapy is an important goal in these high-risk patients, it is essential to take into account factors that modulate bacterial ecology and the susceptibility of causative organisms to ensure optimal management. Increased proportions of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria have been reported in this setting and the role of previous antibiotic therapy in the emergence of these bacteria has been stressed. Interestingly, few studies have addressed the therapeutic issues and difficulties related to the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy (EA) raised by these MDR microorganisms.

Based on these concerns, the aim of this study was first to identify risk factors for the presence of MDR bacteria in PP, and then to analyse the in vitro activities of some antimicrobial regimens proposed by guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) in order to propose antibiotic regimens providing adequate EA in the largest number of cases according to the identified risk factors of MDR bacteria.

### Which cause of diffuse peritonitis is the deadliest in the tropics? A retrospective analysis of 305 cases from the south-west region of Cameroon [^115wcxnv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality rates are extremely variable and do not seem to be superior in settings with a limited technical background, even in tertiary peritonitis. The mortality rate reported in our study is unacceptably high. This is probably a direct consequence of some of the local conditions of surgical practice such as the scarcity of surgeons, the lack of appropriate diagnosis and management tools and the socio-economic conditions characterized by the total absence of social security even for such critical and potentially deadly conditions. Also, they are no clear standards and guidelines for the management of surgical emergencies which are adapted our settings. However, this heavy mortality rate is not exceptional. It is comparable to what have been reported in other regions and countries with similar settings. Even in some western countries, overall complication rates as high as 41% have been reported.

In differential analysis of relative contributors to death toll, our study clearly points complications of typhoid fever as a major problem. Over the past two decades, the trend of mortality of this type of peritonitis has been on the decline. Such reduction can only be achieved by early recognition and diagnosis, timely surgical intervention, appropriate antibiotics and surgical technique and peri-operative care which all play a key role in reducing mortality in typhoid intestinal perforation. Also, policies on typhoid vaccine and public health education may help to reduce morbidity and mortality due to this endemic disease.

Some factors have been reported as related to the morbidity of diffuse peritonitis. One of these factors is the delay before intervention which is considered by many as an important key. Other factors include the source of peritonitis with a higher complication rate for bowel perforations and MPI. The ability to suppress the source of infection also seems to play an important role.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: benefit or risk? [^114x6Nhh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with risk of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Current guidelines recommend primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at risk of a first episode and to prevent recurrence, respectively. Factors associated with prophylaxis failure leading to SBP, ACLF, and increased mortality are not well established. Gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms have become more frequently associated with SBP, particularly in the setting of ACLF. Efforts to understand how long-term antibiotic therapy may affect individual risk of SBP in this population will be critical to developing optimal preventive strategies.

### Peritonitis-the Eastern experience [^114NQ2Wa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a better understanding of pathophysiology, advances in diagnosis, surgery, antimicrobial therapy and intensive care support, peritonitis remains a potentially fatal affliction. On the basis of source and nature of the microbial contamination peritonitis can be classified as primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary peritonitis is infection, often monomicrobial, of the peritoneal fluid without visceral perforation. Secondary peritonitis arises subsequent to loss of integrity of a hollow viscus and is the most common form of peritonitis encountered. Tertiary peritonitis develops following treatment of secondary peritonitis either due to failure of the host inflammatory response or due to superinfection. The contamination of peritoneal cavity thus, can lead to a cascade of infection, sepsis and multisystem organ failure (MSOF) and death if not treated in a timely manner.

This paper aims to present the experience of the East in terms of the spectrum of secondary peritonitis seen, its common causes and outcomes.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — proposed diagnostic and management algorithm begins when there is an "Acute rise in creatinine by ≥ 0.3mg/dL", followed by "Clinical assessment including urinary sediment and biomarkers" and determining if a "Specific diagnosis" is identified; urinary markers guide etiology, as "Urinary sediments and biomarkers (particularly NGAL) may indicate ATN, whereas fractional excretion of sodium < 1% may suggest HRS". If no specific diagnosis is made, the branch evaluates "Creatinine doubled from baseline?"; management emphasizes risk factor correction, and if there is "No resolution in 1–2 days" or a "further rise in serum creatinine", proceed to albumin challenge: "Risk factor management, if applicable Give albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". After albumin, assess "Meets the criteria for HRS"; if yes, determine "Vasoconstrictor therapy candidate?" and administer vasoconstrictor therapy if appropriate, while if no, use "Individualized nephrology care". Risk factor management includes "the withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, reduction or withdrawal of diuretics, detection, and treatment of infections, if present, and volume replacement (if severely volume-depleted) using 5% albumin or crystalloids, preferentially balanced, initially".

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8.

When a colectomy for diverticular disease is performed, a laparoscopic approach is appropriate in selected patients (Recommendation 1 B).

Laparoscopic colectomy may have advantages over open laparotomy, including less pain, smaller scar, and shorter recovery. There is no increase in early or late complications. Cost and outcome are comparable to open resection. Laparoscopic surgery is acceptable in the elderly and seems to be safe in selected patients with complicated disease.

Urgent operation is required for patients with diffuse peritonitis or for those who fail non-operative management of acute diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 B).

If a patient presents with severe or diffuse peritonitis, emergency colon resection is necessary. Also, if sepsis does not improve with inpatient conservative treatment of acute diverticulitis or after percutaneous drainage, surgery is indicated. Immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients are more likely to present with perforation or fail medical management, so a lower threshold for urgent or elective surgery should apply to them. The source control of diffuse peritonitis is discussed together in the next topic of large bowel perforations.

### Management guidelines for penetrating abdominal trauma [^113YdcDY]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal management of patients with penetrating abdominal injuries has been debated for decades, since mandatory laparotomy (LAP) gave way to the concept of "selective conservatism".

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed and summarized.

Results

A proposed management guideline for patients with penetrating abdominal trauma was created.

Conclusion

Indications for immediate laparotomy (LAP) include hemodynamic instability, evisceration, peritonitis, or impalement. Selective nonoperative management of stable, asymptomatic patients has been demonstrated to be safe. Adjunctive diagnostic testing-ultrasonography, computed tomography, local wound exploration, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy-is often used in an attempt to identify significant injuries requiring operative management. However, prospective studies indicate that these tests frequently lead to nontherapeutic LAP, and are not cost-effective.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112qsq2X]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis — AASLD 2021 guidance states that evidence for primary prophylaxis with antibiotics is not strong and is restricted to patients with very advanced cirrhosis, and SBP prophylaxis should be individualized based on estimated risks and benefits. SBP should receive long-term prophylaxis with daily norfloxacin; in settings in which norfloxacin is unavailable, oral ciprofloxacin is acceptable. In patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP should be instituted; IV ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours is the antibiotic of choice and should be used for a maximum of 7 days. In patients with cirrhosis and low protein (< 1.5 g/dL) ascites, primary SBP prophylaxis can be considered in selected patients with renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL).

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1166spP9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

On-demand laparotomy should be performed only when absolutely necessary and only for those patients who would clearly benefit from additional surgery. Planned re-laparotomies, on the other hand, are performed every 36–48 h for purposes of inspection, drainage, and peritoneal lavage of the abdominal cavity. The concept of a planned re-laparotomy for severe peritonitis has been debated for over 30 years. Re-operations are performed every 48 h for reassessing the peritoneal inflammatory process until the abdomen is free of ongoing peritonitis; then the abdomen is closed. The advantages of the planned re-laparotomy approach are optimization of resource utilization and reduction of the potential risk for gastrointestinal fistulas and delayed hernias. The results of a clinical trial published in 2007 by Van Ruler et al. investigating the differences between on-demand and planned re-laparotomy strategies in patients with severe peritonitis found few advantages for the planned re-laparotomy strategy; however, the study mentioned that this latter group exhibited a reduced need for additional re-laparotomies, decreased patient dependency on subsequent healthcare services, and decreased overall medical costs.

An open abdomen (OA) procedure is the best way of implementing re-laparotomies. Open abdomen (OA) procedure is defined as intentionally leaving the fascial edges of the abdomen unapproximated (laparostomy). The abdominal contents are exposed and protected with a temporary coverage. The OA technique, when used appropriately, may be useful in the management of surgical patients with severe abdominal sepsis. However, the role of the OA in the management of severe peritonitis is still being debated. The role of the OA in the management of severe peritonitis has been a controversial issue. Although guidelines suggest not to routinely utilize the open abdomen approach for patients with severe intra-peritoneal contamination undergoing emergency laparotomy for intra-abdominal sepsis, OA has now been accepted as a strategy in treating physiologically deranged patients with acute peritonitis.

### Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^115Q4Cb8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Peritonitis is a common and severe complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Detailed recommendations on the prevention and treatment of PD-associated peritonitis have been published by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD), but there is a substantial variation in clinical practice among dialysis units. Prophylactic antibiotics administered before PD catheter insertion, colonoscopy, or invasive gynecologic procedures, daily topical application of antibiotic cream or ointment to the catheter exit site, and prompt treatment of exit site or catheter infection are key measures to prevent PD-associated peritonitis. When a patient on PD presents with clinical features compatible with PD-associated peritonitis, empirical antibiotic therapy, with coverage of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas species), should be started once the appropriate microbiologic specimens have been obtained. Intraperitoneal is the preferred route of administration. Antifungal prophylaxis, preferably oral nystatin, should be added to prevent secondary fungal peritonitis. Once the PD effluent Gram stain or culture and sensitivity results are available, antibiotic therapy can be adjusted accordingly. A detailed description on the dosage of individual antibiotic can be found in the latest recommendations by the ISPD. The duration of antibiotics is usually 2–3 weeks, depending on the specific organisms identified. Catheter removal and temporary hemodialysis support is recommended for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis. In some patients, a new PD catheter could be inserted after complete resolution of the peritonitis. PD catheter removal should also be considered for refractory exit site or tunnel infections. After the improvement in clinical practice, there is a worldwide trend of reduction in PD-associated peritonitis rate, supporting the use of PD as a first-line dialysis modality.

### Clostridioides difficile associated peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients-a case series based review of an under-recognized entity with therapeutic challenges [^111KU1ME]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis is a dominant cause of PD failure among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). These individuals present largely with a gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome with or without accompanying systemic features e.g. fever; and a cloudy PD effluent secondary to elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts with predominance of neutrophils. Current management guidelines recommend early institution of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy triggered by PD fluid cytology. However, even with the current recommended protocols for microbiology, 15–20% of the PD peritonitis are culture negative. Concerns for atypical infections or non-infectious peritonitis are higher in culture negative peritonitis. Neutrophilic reaction can also occur with peri-peritoneal infection or inflammation as in pancreatitis and colitis.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) presents with GI symptoms and has significant adverse outcomes including mortality, for both hospitalized and ambulatory patient populations. Chronically ill and immunocompromised individuals, including those with end stage renal disease (ESRD), are at higher risk for developing CDI. These statistics along with the similar presenting syndromes, pose two unique challenges in the routine clinical care of ESRD patients on PD: GI presentation with cloudy PD effluent can detract from the timely diagnosis of CDI and empirical management of PD peritonitis with routinely recommended antimicrobials including cephalosporins negatively impacts CDI. Together, these could lead to inappropriate early management, prolonged disease course, and adverse patient outcomes. A strategy that allows greater vigilance for diagnosing CDI, and appropriate antimicrobial administration without potential for worsening CDI may improve patient care in this population. We present a potentially novel strategy for the empiric management of PD peritonitis through discussion of two such cases who received care in our medical center within a 12-month period.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^115CboaV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) has developed a simple scoring system for exit site signs and symptoms which is easy to use and gives guidance on when to treat immediately rather than waiting for a swab result. Purulent discharge is an absolute indicator for antibiotic treatment.

The ISPD has become less dogmatic about the initial choice of antibiotic treatment for peritonitis, provided that gram positive and negative infections are covered. It is recognised that patterns of resistance vary considerably and thus a local policy must be developed. Studies do not currently demonstrate a favoured regime. For exit site infections the presence of a tunnel infection should be recognised as it may require more aggressive management. We concur with the ISPD guidelines that suggest suitable antibiotic dosing regimens, including options for intermittent and continuous dosing of intraperitoneal antibiotics. We also note their comment that infections from Gram negative organisms are more likely to lead to refractory or recurrent peritonitis. A single study suggested that treating Gram negative peritonitis with 2 appropriate antibiotics might be associated with better outcomes. It is also important to be aware of the potential for impaired absorption of oral antibiotics in some situations, e.g. co-prescription of ciprofloxacin with some phosphate binders.

We would emphasise the ISPD guidelines that it is important that timely PD catheter removal is undertaken in refractory PD peritonitis. PD catheter removal or swap is also required in refractory exit site infections, and may be required earlier where there is a Pseudomonas infection or associated tunnel infection, which can be confirmed by ultrasound imaging.

There will be a lower threshold in paediatrics for admission for IV antibiotics (at least for first 48 h), especially in infants and small children where oral antibiotics commonly cause diarrhoea/feed intolerance.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis management — IV antibiotics should be started empirically (before obtaining culture results) in all patients with an ascites PMN count > 250/mm³; patients with a focal intraabdominal inflammatory entity (e.g., diverticulitis, cholecystitis) may have an ascites PMN count > 250/mm³ and should be treated not for SBP but for the specific condition per standard of care, including a surgical consult; traditionally, third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) were recommended in all patients with SBP, with resolution rates of approximately 90%, and currently they are recommended as the first-line antibiotics (e.g. IV cefotaxime 2 g every 12 hours) in settings where MDROs are not prevalent; inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy in patients admitted with septic shock increases the risk of death by 10 times.

### Mycobacterium abscessus-an uncommon, but important cause of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis-case report and literature review [^111i5Gd5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis is used for managing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It requires access to the peritoneal space by way of a percutaneous tunnelled dialysis catheter. Infective complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) include catheter exit-site infection (ESI), catheter tunnel infection (TI) and peritonitis. Peritonitis can be particularly severe and can lead to PD failure and discontinuation of PD. Early recognition of infections, prompt microbiological diagnosis, and establishing appropriate treatment are therefore essential. An essential factor that determines a successful outcome in such cases is anti-microbial susceptibility testing to guide appropriate therapy. PD related peritonitis is most commonly caused by gram-positive aerobes such as coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, or gram-negative aerobes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reports of PD related peritonitis caused by Mycobacterium species are relatively rare, although their incidence has been well documented. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are members of the genus Mycobacterium but are significantly different from other members of the same genus, e.g. M.tuberculosis and M.leprae. NTM related PD peritonitis is emerging as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the management of PD peritonitis, with comparatively higher rates of PD catheter loss and PD failure compared to other organisms. Consensus on the management of NTM related PD peritonitis does not currently exist, possibly because of the paucity of reported cases. We describe what is to our knowledge the first reported case in the UK of PD related peritonitis secondary to the NTM species Mycobacterium abscessus.

### Peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion surgery and management [^115J8dSy]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal access surgery is the first step to achieve successful peritoneal dialysis. It is important to perform easy, safe, and less invasive surgery of peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion. Secure peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion will lead to less infection, that is, exit site, tunnel infection, and peritonitis, which sometimes result in peritoneal dialysis discontinuation. To avoid these undesirable results, we should perform good and proper peritoneal dialysis insertion surgery. In this article, we describe peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion surgery and its management.

### Role of peritoneal mesothelial cells in peritonitis [^112ZDZjW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Peritoneal mesothelial cells have a remarkable capacity to respond to peritoneal insults. They generate an intense biological response and play an important role in the formation of adhesions. This review describes these activities and comments on their relationship to surgical drainage, peritoneal lavage and laparostomy in the management of patients with peritonitis.

Methods and Results

Material was identified from previous review articles, references cited in original papers and a Medline search of the literature. The peritoneal mesothelium adapts to peritonitis by facilitating the clearance of contaminated fluid from the peritoneal cavity and inducing the formation of fibrinous adhesions that support the localization of contaminants. In addition, the fluid within the peritoneal cavity is a battleground in which effector mechanisms generated with the involvement of peritoneal mesothelial cells meet the contaminants. The result is a complex mix of cascading processes that have evolved to protect life in the absence of surgery.

Conclusion

Future advances in the management of patients with severe peritonitis may depend upon molecular strategies that modify the activity of peritoneal mesothelial cells.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

Clinical patient's severity

This choice of the antimicrobial regimen poses serious problems for the management of critically ill patients. In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock an early correct empirical antimicrobial therapy has a significant impact on the outcome, independently by the site of infection.

This data confirm the results of Riché and coll. who demonstrated, in a prospective observational study involving 180 consecutive patients with secondary generalized peritonitis, a significantly higher mortality rate in septic shock (35 versus 8% for patients without shock).

Recent international guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock (Surviving Sepsis Campaign) recommend intravenous antibiotics within the first hour after severe sepsis and septic shock are recognized, use of broad-spectrum agents with good penetration into the presumed site of infection, and reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen daily to optimize efficacy, prevent resistance, avoid toxicity and minimize costs. Full adherence to these recommendations requires that clinicians, in order to optimize antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients, be aware that it is not sufficient to make the correct choice on the basis of the anti-biogram or of a correct epidemiological evaluation of risk factor for microorganisms and resistance patterns, but it is also mandatory to implement timely administration of the right dose on the right schedule, according to the pathophysiological and immunological status of the patient and to the pharmacokinetics properties of the chosen drugs.

This concept is correct not only from a clinical point of view; in fact sub-optimal plasma levels of antimicrobials and/or suboptimal exposure to antimicrobials in the infection site represent the best condition to favor the emergence of resistant strains, with a consequent higher probability of therapeutic failure and increased human and social costs.

For example, in critically ill patients, higher-than-standard loading doses of b-lactams, aminoglycosides or glycopeptides should be administered to ensure optimal exposure at the infection site independently of the patient's renal function.

For lipophilic antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, the 'dilution effect' in the extracellular fluids during severe sepsis may be mitigated by the rapid redistribution of the drug from the intracellular compartment to the interstitium. In contrast to what happens with hydrophilic antimicrobials, standard dosages of lipophilic antimicrobials may frequently ensure adequate loading even in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Bacterial infection recognition and initial management in cirrhosis — clinical triggers and early therapy are outlined as follows: The presence of fever or hypothermia, chills, and localizing symptoms should raise suspicion for a bacterial infection, although typical symptoms may be absent in cirrhosis; bacterial infection should be suspected when a patient with cirrhosis deteriorates, particularly with encephalopathy, acute kidney injury (AKI), and/or jaundice. Workup should be initiated promptly, including skin examination, leukocyte count with differential, blood cultures, and urinalysis, and if clinical suspicion is strong (e.g., association with systemic inflammatory response), empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as samples for cultures have been collected, particularly in the presence of hemodynamic instability. In patients with cirrhosis in septic shock, mortality increases by 7% for every hour's delay in initiating antibiotics.

Abdominal hernias in cirrhosis and ascites — Abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are common, and umbilical hernias develop in approximately 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Hernias may result from increased abdominal pressure from ascites with weakened abdominal muscles, and poor nutrition can lead to rapidly enlarging hernias, whereas optimal fluid control, appropriate nutrition, and conservative management with binders may minimize or prevent hernia development and progression. Hernias may present with incarceration, pressure necrosis, rupture, evisceration, and peritonitis, and a rapid decline in the ascitic fluid volume (e.g. LVP) can paradoxically cause incarceration. Patients who are candidates for liver transplantation (LT) in the near future should defer hernia repair until during or after transplantation, while for patients in whom transplantation is not imminent elective herniorrhaphy may be offered after careful consideration of risks and benefits, with a possible need for an emergent operation. Clinically apparent ascites should be controlled before elective herniorrhaphy, laparoscopic approaches are preferred, the use of prosthetic mesh may reduce recurrence but may increase infections and other complications, and postoperatively control of ascites and optimization of nutrition are key determinants of successful outcome.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the development of bacterial infection of ascites in the absence of any intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection. The prevalence of SBP in outpatients is 1.5–3.5% and approximately 10% in hospitalised patients. A recent European study detected a prevalence of 11.3% among inpatients. When first described, mortality associated with SBP exceeded 90%, but, in-hospital mortality has been reduced to approximately 20% with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. In an observational study, each hour of delay in diagnostic paracentesis after admission was associated with a 3.3% increase of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Long-term survival remains poor; 1-year survival after hospitalisation with SBP in a UK study was found to be 34%. Patients recovering from an episode of SBP should always be considered as potential candidates for liver transplantation if they have not already been assessed.

Children with proven or suspected SBP should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic cover against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. No recommendation can be given for the management of AKI and HRS in children with cirrhosis because of the absence of relevant definitions and lack of data on treatment and outcomes.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^1111XBta]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Perforations with ERCP — instrument-related and stent-induced — are addressed with preventive measures and management strategies. To reduce guidewire-related perforations, it is important to monitor the wire frequently and advance only under fluoroscopic guidance; these perforations tend to be small, contained, and likely to heal spontaneously, and hence are almost always managed without surgery, with biliary or pancreatic stents allowing appropriate diversion of fluid. Asymptomatic patients with retroperitoneal free gas alone detected intraoperative or afterward should be managed with observation alone. For stent-induced perforation, luminal injury has been reported from migration of plastic and metal stents with no particular stent considered higher risk; treatment is endoscopic removal and endoscopic closure of the perforation if there are no clinical features of peritonitis, whereas surgical management is appropriate for patients with peritonitis or a retroperitoneal fluid collection.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111RuPDB]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

In an infection other than SBP, IV albumin has been used in the same doses (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3); it has remained the standard recommendation. Alternatively, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) would also be appropriate.

### Peritonitis: laparoscopic approach [^1132j16b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

On the basis of our experience LAPS in the treatment of abdominal emergencies due to peritonitis is possible, simple and reproducible, effective without any specific complications in experienced hands. LAPS provides a superior diagnostic accuracy as well as wider therapeutic potentials with an improvement of postoperative comfort than OP. Sparing patients unnecessary Laparotomies reduces postoperative pain, increases prompt recovery of gastrointestinal functions, shortens hospitalization, helps contain health-care costs and increases cosmesis. This approach appears to play a crucial role in the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm in almost every abdominal emergency. On these grounds we advocate a wider adoption of Laparoscopy and are confident it will become more relevant in common surgical practice.

Treatment of grade 3 ascites — initial management states that for patients presenting with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis (LVP) combined with hyperoncotic human albumin is the initial treatment of choice, even in the presence of hyponatremia. Patients with massive peripheral edema may require a second paracentesis shortly after the first because a rapid shift of fluid may occur from interstitial to ascitic cavity. After LVP and a significant reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure, diuretics can be instituted, which may eliminate or reduce the frequency of paracentesis.

### The Chicago consensus on peritoneal surface malignancies: methodology [^111bvduk]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Chicago Consensus Working Group provides multidisciplinary recommendations for the management of peritoneal surface malignancies of various causes. These guidelines are developed with input from leading experts including surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, palliative care physicians, and pharmacists. These guidelines recognize and address the emerging need for increased awareness of the appropriate management of peritoneal surface disease. They are not intended to replace the quest for higher levels of evidence. This article explains the process and methodology of building these guidelines and pathways.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115FAhYR]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:

- **Definition**: SBP is a bacterial infection in the peritoneal fluid without any other identifiable source of infection.
- **Pathophysiology**: SBP is a severe complication of cirrhosis, primarily occurring due to bacterial translocation from the gut to the peritoneal cavity.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of SBP in the US is estimated at 4000 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations often include rapid onset of symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental status. Diagnosis is typically made by analyzing ascitic fluid, with a neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ indicating SBP. If not promptly treated, SBP can lead to serious complications such as renal failure, septic shock, and hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of SBP is generally poor, with high in-hospital mortality rates. Factors such as renal dysfunction, high bilirubin levels, and low sodium levels have been associated with increased mortality.

Classifications

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) include a lot of pathological conditions, ranging from uncomplicated appendicitis to faecal peritonitis.

From a clinical viewpoint IAIs are classified into uncomplicated and complicated.

In uncomplicated IAIs the infectious process only involves a single organ and does not proceed to the peritoneum.

In complicated IAIs, the infectious process proceeds beyond the organ, and causes either localized peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscess), or diffuse peritonitis.

Peritonitis is classified into primary, secondary or tertiary peritonitis.

Primary peritonitis is a diffused bacterial infection without loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal tract. It is rare. It mainly occurs in infancy and early childhood and in cirrhotic patients.

Secondary peritonitis, the most common form of peritonitis, is acute peritoneal infection resulting from loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal tract or from infected viscera. It is caused by perforation of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. perforated duodenal ulcer), by direct invasion from infected intra-abdominal viscera (e.g. gangrenous appendicitis). Anastomotic dehiscences are common causes of peritonitis in the postoperative period.

Tertiary peritonitis is defined as peritonitis that persists after more than one failed source control procedure.

Intra-abdominal infections are also classified into community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-IAIs) and healthcare-acquired intra-abdominal infections (HA-IAIs). CA-IAIs are acquired in community, whereas HA-IAIs develop in hospitalized patients or residents of long-term care facilities. They are characterized by increased mortality because of both underlying patient health status and increased likelihood of infection caused by multi drugs resistant organisms.

Moreover, in the classification of IAIs should be mandatory to introduce a grading of clinical severity, well represented by the sepsis definitions.

The updated sepsis definition is based on several clinical and bioumoral variables.

As is well demonstrated, there is an increased risk of death moving from the sepsis status to that of severe sepsis, and it appears reasonable to assume the latter as the breakpoint between a condition of clinical stability and a critically ill patient.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1131FfV3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) response assessment and duration are specified as follows: it is recommended that a diagnostic paracentesis (or thoracentesis for SBE) be performed 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy to assess response, and a negative response is defined by a decrease in PMN count < 25% from baseline that should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days, although a small study found therapy was shorter when discontinued once PMN decreased to < 250/mm³ (mean, 4.8 days) compared with empirically determined duration (mean, 9.6 days). Patients with ascites PMN < 250/mm³ and a positive bacteriological culture (bacterascites) without signs of infection should not receive antibiotics, and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis should be performed to investigate progression to SBP, while repeat paracentesis/thoracentesis may be unnecessary if an organism is isolated, is susceptible, and the patient is improving clinically.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^11277hDs]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) primary prophylaxis — In patients without a prior history of SBP, antibiotics should be used judiciously and sparingly and reserved only for those at the highest risk of infection. In cirrhosis with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a meta-analysis found that short-term (5–7 days) selective intestinal decontamination (mostly oral norfloxacin) reduced the rate of infections, including SBP, and improved survival, and because the emergence of quinolone-resistant organisms has decreased the prophylactic efficacy of norfloxacin, IV ceftriaxone is currently the recommended antibiotic in patients with hemorrhage; alternative drugs are discouraged and SBP and other infections should be ruled out before starting the antibiotic. In patients without gastrointestinal hemorrhage and without a prior episode of SBP, antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered in selected high-risk patients, for example those with low (< 1.5 g/dL) ascitic fluid protein; even with low ascites protein, the 1-year probability of SBP may vary between 20% and 60%. In a landmark trial, norfloxacin was associated with a significantly reduced 1-year probability of first SBP compared with placebo (60% vs. 7%) in patients with low protein ascites and advanced liver disease (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 points with serum bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL) or with impaired renal function defined by serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L.

### Updated guideline on diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal… [^112BHugS]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Interventions A source control procedure to drain infected foci, control ongoing peritoneal contamination, and restore anatomic and physiologic function is recommended in virtually all patients with intra-abdominal infection. Emergency surgery should be performed in patients with diffuse peritonitis, even if measures to restore physiologic stability must be continued during the procedure. An urgent approach also should be taken in hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of acute organ failure. However, intervention may be delayed for up to 24 hours in closely monitored patients who have started antimicrobial therapy. Select patients with minimal physiologic derangement and a well-circumscribed focus of infection can be treated with antimicrobial therapy without a source control procedure if close clinical follow-up is possible.

In patients with severe peritonitis, relaparotomy is not recommended in the absence of intestinal discontinuity, abdominal fascial loss that prevents abdominal wall closure, or intra-abdominal hypertension. Antimicrobial Therapy Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as intra-abdominal infection is diagnosed or suspected. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible in patients with septic shock. Those who do not have septic shock should begin antimicrobial therapy in the emergency department. Adequate drug levels should be maintained during the source control procedure, which may necessitate additional administration of antimicrobials.

HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED INFECTION IN ADULTS Patients with severe community-acquired intra-abdominal infection should be treated empirically with antimicrobial regimens that have broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative organisms, such as meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, doripenem, or piperacillin/tazobactam as single agents, or a combination of metronidazole with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftazidime, or cefepime, and bowel decompression. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies that may be useful in such cases include ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole; ampicillin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole; or meropenem. Vancomycin may be used instead of ampicillin when MRSA or ampicillin-resistant enterococcal infection is suspected.

### Generalized peritonitis… [^112Kdf5a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The objectives of surgery for generalized peritonitis are to eliminate the source of continual bacterial contamination and to prevent septicemia and intra-abdominal abscess formation. A prospective randomized study of three different operative approaches of treating residual peritoneal contamination was undertaken: group 1, no peritoneal irrigation; group 2, intraoperative peritoneal irrigation only; group 3, both intraoperative and postoperative peritoneal irrigation. The mortality in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 28. 5%,
26. 6%, and 33%, respectively. The overall incidence of septicemia and intra-abdominal abscesses in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 23%, 22%, and 17%, respectively. In those patients who survived, the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses, wound infection, and septicemia was 6%, 23%, and 13%, respectively. In this series, there was no detectable difference in the mortality and infectious complications between the three treatment groups.

The only clinical factors that adversely affected mortality and morbidity were peritonitis originating from the colon and age greater than 60 years. Early surgical intervention with removal of the source of peritonitis, debridement of all necrotic tissue, and drainage of abscesses remain the cornerstones of successful therapy in generalized peritonitis.

### Circulating mediators and organ function in patients undergoing planned relaparotomy vs conventional surgical therapy in severe secondary peritonitis… [^116CZuXQ]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Patients Twenty-nine patients with secondary peritonitis. Interventions Of the 29 patients with comparable initial peritonitis conditions, 11 underwent PRL and 18 obtained primary abdominal closure. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively and at 2, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 hours after the primary operation, then every 12th hour until day 5 and once daily until day 8. Nevertheless, more than 80% of all peritonitis cases can be successfully treated with the standard method. 7, 8 Indications for applicability and duration of a chosen therapy have so far been made solely based on clinical criteria and the experience of the surgical department. Controlled prospective studies on the different interventional procedures are not available. During both periods all patients who fulfilled the criteria entered the study. All 29 patients had comparable initial conditions.

Of these 29 patients, 11 underwent PRL and 18 obtained primary abdominal closure. Prewarmed Ringer lactate solution was used for lavage. In general, all patients were treated according to the hospitals' guidelines for peritonitis care. Following primary intervention with source control and subsequent lavage, patients' treatment was continued in the surgical intensive care unit, including monitoring, mechanical ventilation, and circulatory support. According to our standard procedure, all patients had abdominal drains. Sedation was achieved with fentanyl citrate and midazolam hydrochloride; ranitidine hydrochloride was given to prevent stress ulcer, and intravenous high-molecular-weight sodium heparin was administered routinely. Use of the heparin was started 6 hours postoperatively.

Antibiotic therapy was started with a combination of a second-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole. Selective intestinal decontamination was performed in all patients. Blood components, including fresh frozen plasma, individual coagulation factors, or mixtures, were given specifically in case of clotting disturbances.

### Prognosis and treatment of peritonitis… [^116ZiyrH]. JAMA Network (1996). Excellent credibility.

Objectives: To assess the clinical significance of present scoring systems for prognosis and treatment in patients with secondary bacterial peritonitis and to define risk factors for patient survival and outcome not included in the scores. A secondary objective was to review our therapeutic regimens and the need for reoperation with regard to outcome. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: University hospital, secondary referral center. Patients: From 1992 to 1995, 92 patients with secondary peritonitis were examined at the University Surgical Clinic, Vienna, Austria. The population as a whole consisted of 56 men and 36 women with an average age of 56 ± 19 years. Forty-four percent of patients had postoperative peritonitis. Leukopenia and inappropriate antibiotic therapy as determined by the antibiogram were mildly significant for higher mortality. The need for relaparotomy resulted in substantially higher mortality.

The impossibility of definitive operative resolution of the intra-abdominal pathologic findings at initial operation had no significant effect on mortality, possibly because planned reoperations were always carried out in those cases. For patients with definitive resolution at initial operation, it was possible to reduce the traditionally high mortality rate associated with relaparotomy on demand by making the decision for reexploration promptly, within the first 48 hours. Nevertheless, the 52. 4% mortality rate observed in those cases was still much higher than the 33% found in patients who were not free of disease after the initial operation. Conclusions: The prognosis in peritonitis is decisively influenced by the health status of the patient at the beginning of treatment and by any concomitant risk factors. As a result, a fairly accurate prediction of the outcome of the disease can initially be made on the basis of the APACHE II score and the MOSF score according to Goris.

However, the certainty that severely ill patients with high scores often die has little clinical relevance, since it does not provide any therapeutic alternatives to the attending physician. The decision to perform a relaparotomy must be made as soon as possible, at least before MOSF emerges. Already existing MOSF will lead to the "point of no return".
