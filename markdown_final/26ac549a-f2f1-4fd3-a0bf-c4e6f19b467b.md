## Question

How to diagnose pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose pneumonia across settings and populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical evaluation and pretest probability. Then, I should determine the care setting and patient population because the diagnostic pathway diverges substantially. Next, I will clarify the imaging strategy, followed by laboratory and microbiologic testing. After that, I should assess severity and disposition using validated tools. Finally, I need to address special populations and atypical presentations, and conclude with how to confirm the diagnosis and avoid misclassification, citing the best available guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical entry points. In adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, key symptoms and signs include cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, fever ≥ 38°C, tachypnea, and focal chest findings, but I should not overvalue any single feature because clinical gestalt outperforms isolated findings and misdiagnosis is common when relying on single signs or tests in the ED setting [^111ukg7W] [^1152giuB]. For children, I need to check for pediatric-specific features such as grunting, retractions, chest indrawing, crackles, and overall clinician impression, especially in resource-limited settings where WHO criteria prioritize sensitivity via fast breathing and chest indrawing for classification and triage [^116fz6M8] [^116dnDEq] [^112VVcKL]. I should also obtain targeted risk information — travel history within the prior 4–6 weeks, aspiration risk factors, and immunocompromised status — because these can shift the diagnostic pathway and differential diagnosis, including atypical or opportunistic pathogens [^111hsKMc] [^111pBwjF] [^112qDqRG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: these elements guide pretest probability and subsequent test selection but do not themselves confirm pneumonia [^111ukg7W] [^1152giuB].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and setting because it defines urgency, resources, and thresholds for testing. In the ED, pneumonia accounts for over 1.5 million visits annually, so rapid evaluation, risk stratification, and disposition decisions are critical; hospitalized and ICU patients warrant early severity assessment; outpatients often require selective imaging and judicious biomarker use; and immunocompromised hosts or children may need modified diagnostic strategies [^111feA8k] [^116wJXUq] [^112qDqRG] [^116dnDEq]. I need to ensure I tailor the approach to older adults as well, since diagnostic performance of standard criteria can differ in geriatric ED populations, warranting careful application and awareness of sensitivity–specificity trade-offs [^114Z96rf].

> I will now examine the diagnostic definition for adults: I should confirm that imaging demonstrates a new pulmonary infiltrate in a patient with compatible clinical features, because authoritative guidelines emphasize that radiographic evidence is required for diagnosis in most adult settings, with or without microbiologic confirmation; clinical features alone are insufficient to confirm CAP [^114PtydE] [^116N8vas] [^112hi12x]. Wait, let me verify biomarker roles before I apply them: adding CRP can strengthen diagnosis or exclusion in carefully selected adult outpatients, but CRP should not be used to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia when deciding on antibiotics in the ED, and procalcitonin offers limited early ED diagnostic utility — so I must avoid overreliance on biomarkers at presentation [^114MnkRz] [^114ME5oH] [^1152giuB].

> Now, imaging strategy. First-line imaging remains chest radiography to demonstrate an infiltrate when pneumonia is suspected; however, I should double-check expectations because CXR has limited sensitivity in acute ED contexts, and a non-diagnostic film does not exclude disease if pretest probability is high [^114PtydE] [^1152giuB]. If the chest radiograph is normal, equivocal, or nonspecific; if there are multiple or diffuse opacities; or if noninfectious diagnoses are being considered, chest CT is the appropriate next step in immunocompromised patients and can reduce overdiagnosis and clarify alternative causes in broader populations, potentially avoiding unnecessary antibiotics [^112qDqRG] [^1124GHuj]. Let me consider point-of-care lung ultrasound as well: the BLUE protocol offers high sensitivity and dynamic air bronchograms high specificity, and newer guidelines are increasingly incorporating LUS into CAP diagnostic pathways, so I should integrate it when available and operator expertise is present, cognizant of its limitations in VAP and complex ICU states [^117Czix6] [^115qR2bM].

> Next, I should review microbiologic testing and when it changes management. For routine, non-severe CAP, sputum culture has a limited yield and is often reserved for specific indications, whereas in severe CAP or when nonstandard antibiotics are contemplated, lower respiratory tract sampling for multiplex PCR can help target therapy and antimicrobial stewardship [^112hi12x] [^112hi12x]. In ventilator-associated pneumonia, I need to ensure noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures rather than invasive approaches, aligning with IDSA/ATS 2016 recommendations to balance diagnostic utility and patient safety [^115jfefU]. But wait, what if fungal etiologies are suspected? I should obtain Histoplasma antigen testing urgently in suspected disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, supplement with serologies in immunocompetent hosts, and consider urinary antigen testing for suspected blastomycosis in the right epidemiologic context to expedite diagnosis and therapy [^112F6LKy] [^113kjmTT] [^111tLN3j].

> Severity assessment now guides site-of-care and monitoring. I should confirm that ATS/IDSA recommend using a validated prediction rule — preferentially PSI over CURB-65 — together with clinical judgment for adult CAP risk stratification, while recognizing CURB-65 thresholds still inform admission decisions in some settings [^116wJXUq] [^113EgfRb]. Hold on, I should verify the IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria, because these determine ICU-level care: major criteria are septic shock requiring vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; minor criteria include tachypnea, PaO2/FiO2 < 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion, uremia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, and hypotension requiring aggressive fluids — initially I recalled hypothermia as less than 36.8°C, but I need to correct myself as the validated threshold is less than 36.0°C; three or more minor criteria suggest severe CAP and need for higher-acuity monitoring pending clinical judgment [^116wJXUq] [^115hZUp8] [^111TQhBn]. I need to ensure I revisit stability criteria during hospitalization, as early achievement of clinical stability correlates with better outcomes and can influence transitions to oral therapy and discharge planning, though I should not anchor on any single metric without considering the whole picture [^112X81vp].

> Let me consider special populations and atypical presentations. In aspiration pneumonia, I should elicit detailed history for aspiration risks, maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with impaired consciousness or laryngopharyngeal sensation where aspiration may be silent, and remember that older adults may have a blunted systemic inflammatory response complicating diagnosis and severity assessment [^112rHX39] [^116bcXs5] [^113xnMJT]. In immunocompromised patients, I should obtain chest CT early when the CXR is nondiagnostic and consider opportunists like Pneumocystis, particularly with diffuse ground-glass opacities and hypoxemia, to avoid delays in targeted therapy and prophylaxis adjustments [^112qDqRG]. In pediatrics, I should prioritize WHO clinical criteria in LMIC contexts and incorporate careful examination findings as per AAFP guidance, recognizing that radiography may be unavailable or normal early in disease; triage to antibiotics, referral, or oxygen is guided by severity classification [^116dnDEq] [^116fz6M8] [^112VVcKL].

> I will now examine stroke-associated pneumonia as a distinct entity. I should confirm that consensus recommendations endorse standardized terminology and modified CDC criteria, distinguishing probable SAP when chest radiograph changes are absent despite clinical criteria and definite SAP when typical radiographic changes are present, while acknowledging limited biomarker utility and substantial heterogeneity in research definitions that can affect incidence estimates and trial comparability [^113uvWiD]. Hmm, wait a minute — this heterogeneity means I need to be explicit about the criteria I use in documentation and research protocols to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

> Final diagnostic confirmation requires alignment of clinical features with imaging evidence of an infiltrate; without radiographic or equivalent imaging support, I should be cautious labeling pneumonia and consider alternative diagnoses or deferred confirmation with advanced imaging when appropriate, particularly to avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics that carry patient- and system-level harms [^116N8vas] [^114PtydE] [^1124GHuj]. I should double-check that trial definitions are consistent with these standards because large proportions of CAP RCTs variably define CAP and "community-acquired", undermining applicability; clearly documenting the diagnostic criteria I applied will mitigate misclassification risk in practice and research [^111uqdQZ].

Diagnose pneumonia by integrating **clinical features** (cough, fever, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, crackles, bronchial breath sounds) [^111ukg7W] with a **chest radiograph** demonstrating new infiltrates [^116N8vas]. Use **CT** [^112qDqRG] or **lung ultrasound** [^117Czix6] when the chest radiograph is inconclusive or in complex cases. Confirm with **microbiology** (sputum, blood cultures, PCR) [^112hi12x], and assess severity using **PSI** or **CURB-65** to guide site of care and management [^116wJXUq].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History and symptoms

- **Cough**: Productive or non-productive [^111ukg7W].
- **Fever**: ≥ 38°C [^114Z96rf].
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath [^111ukg7W].
- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Common [^111ukg7W].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Sweating, shivers, myalgia [^111ukg7W].

---

### Physical examination

- **Vital signs**: Tachypnea, tachycardia, fever [^111ukg7W].
- **Auscultation**: Crackles, bronchial breath sounds, egophony [^1152giuB].
- **Percussion**: Dullness over affected areas [^111ukg7W].

---

## Imaging studies

### Chest radiography (CXR)

As the **initial imaging** modality, obtain a CXR to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrates [^114PtydE]. Typical findings include **lobar consolidation**, **interstitial infiltrates**, **cavitation**, and **pleural effusion** [^113jAnfD].

---

### Computed tomography (CT)

Use when the CXR is **inconclusive** or in **complex cases** (e.g. immunocompromised patients or suspected complications) [^112qDqRG]. It offers higher sensitivity and specificity than CXR [^1124GHuj].

---

### Lung ultrasound

Use when **radiation-free, bedside imaging** is needed; it has high sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia [^117Czix6] [^115qR2bM].

---

## Laboratory tests

### Microbiological tests

- **Sputum culture**: Identify bacterial pathogens.
- **Blood cultures**: Detect bacteremia.
- **PCR**: Detect viral and atypical pathogens [^115wnzNH].

---

### Biomarkers

For biomarkers, **CRP** supports diagnosis but does not differentiate bacterial from viral pneumonia [^114MnkRz], and **procalcitonin** has limited utility for this distinction.

---

## Severity assessment tools

Use severity tools such as **PSI** — preferred for risk assessment and hospitalization decisions [^116wJXUq] — and **CURB-65**, useful for rapid assessment and ICU admission decisions.

---

## Special considerations

### Aspiration pneumonia

In aspiration pneumonia, obtain a **history** of aspiration risk factors (swallowing difficulties, neurological conditions) [^112rHX39]; the affected **population** commonly includes older adults and patients with learning disabilities or neurological or gastrointestinal conditions [^111pBwjF].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **imaging** should start with a CXR, with CT if the CXR is normal or equivocal [^112qDqRG]; **testing** should also consider fungal and atypical pathogens [^112F6LKy].

---

### Lung ultrasound findings and algorithms to detect pneumonia: A systematic review and diagnostic testing meta-analysis [^117Czix6]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Lung ultrasound is increasingly used for diagnosing pneumonia due to its accessibility, low cost, and lack of radiation exposure. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of individual lung ultrasound findings and algorithms for pneumonia across various clinical settings compared with chest radiography and CT.

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Studies assessing the sensitivity and specificity of lung ultrasound findings and algorithms for pneumonia were included. Eligible studies involved adult patients with community-acquired, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Data on sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for ultrasonographic findings and algorithms were pooled using bivariate linear mixed models and Bayesian analyses. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.

Twenty-six studies, totaling 3454 patients, were included. The Bed Lung Ultrasound in Emergency (BLUE) protocol demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.88; 95% CI, 0.84–0.92) among all criteria studies, whereas dynamic air bronchograms had the highest specificity (0.96; 95% CI, 0.91–0.99). Focal B-lines had low sensitivity (0.24; 95% CI, 0.12–0.43) and high specificity (0.96; 95% CI, 0.86–0.99). Sensitivity analyses indicated reduced specificity for lung ultrasound in patients with VAP across all evaluated criteria. Bayesian analyses yielded consistent results.

### Rethink respiratory rate for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [^116dnDEq]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

One in six childhood deaths is caused by pneumonia, making it the largest infectious cause of death for children worldwide, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), where timely pneumonia diagnosis is a much greater challenge due to limited resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines pneumonia as the presence of fast breathing and/or chest indrawing in children who present with a cough or cold and/or difficulty breathing. If diagnosed early, antibiotic therapy can be initiated to effectively treat pneumonia.

Fast breathing has long been considered a sensitive clinical sign of pneumonia in a child with cough or difficulty breathing, particularly in LMIC. The WHO has recommended that community health workers (CHWs) use the respiratory rate (RR) for diagnosis and treat pneumonia in children according to specific case-management algorithms. There are numerous technologies for measuring RR by detecting changes in selected parameters such as exhaled carbon dioxide, air temperature, humidity, and chest wall movement. Each method has strengths and limitations, and most are not suitable for LMIC.

### Pneumonia in low and middle income countries: Progress and challenges [^114yxc14]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Appropriate initial management of pneumonia relies on an accurate assessment of disease severity. To support clinical assessment, which is poorly predictive of disease outcome, several severity-scoring indices have been developed. These tools facilitate the prompt identification of individuals with severe disease, permitting the rapid institution of intensive care interventions. Equally, they help treating physicians to confidently identify individuals with low-severity disease who may be safely managed at home. Care provided in accordance with treatment guidelines, based on an assessment of disease severity using a severity-scoring index, is associated with improved outcomes. Nonetheless, many severity assessment tools may actually underestimate disease severity in young people. This is of particular relevance in low and middle-income countries (LAMICs) where a greater burden of pneumonia is seen in younger adults. Similarly, differences in population comorbidity burden and the aetiological spectrum of pneumonia may reduce the prognostic performance of most pneumonia severity assessment tools that were almost exclusively developed and validated in well-resourced settings. There is an urgent need for the development of validated severity assessment tools in LAMICs that can support clinical management decisions in these settings.

### Evaluation of children with recurrent pneumonia diagnosed by World Health Organization criteria [^114dAF4T]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

A World Health Organization (WHO) case management approach has been used to identify and treat children with pneumonia worldwide since 1987. Many children are treated repeatedly: 23% of children with pneumonia in our rural Haitian district met the WHO criteria on two or more occasions, but underlying disease in such children has not been systematically studied.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 103 children who had been diagnosed with pneumonia on three or more occasions by community health workers using WHO criteria. We compared them with 138 children similarly evaluated but never diagnosed with pneumonia, matching by health worker and age. We administered questionnaires to parents and performed complete physical examinations, tuberculin skin tests, and serologic testing for HIV on all subjects, and chest radiographs on case children.

- **Results**: Two percent of case children and 1.5% of controls had positive tuberculin skin test reactions. None of the children tested was HIV-seropositive. Ninety-four case children had normal baseline chest radiographs, and three had focal infiltrates. A history of wheezing was reported for 79% of case children and 61% of controls (P = 0.002), and wheezing with exercise was reported for 36% and 22% respectively (P = 0.02).

- **Discussion**: Most children in Haiti with pneumonia diagnosed by WHO criteria do not have evidence of tuberculosis, HIV infection, or pulmonary anomalies, but they may be more likely to have asthma, and this should be considered as an alternative diagnosis. This information should help direct evaluation of such children.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to sputum PCR, the ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend considering the collection of lower respiratory tract samples (either sputum or endotracheal aspirates) for multiplex PCR testing (virus and/or bacterial detection) if available, whenever non-standard antibiotics are prescribed or considered in patients with severe CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^112N586C]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek emergency care. It is a challenging infection, as the spectrum of illness ranges from the nontoxic patient appropriate for outpatient antibiotics to the critically ill patient requiring intensive care hospitalization. Data and diagnostic technology provide the emergency physician with the tools for an appropriately rapid evaluation and consideration of the differential diagnosis. Key critical thinking and the application of published findings allow for intelligent empirical antibiotic treatment and risk stratification for the best disposition.

Although antibiotic-resistant organisms increasingly are being identified, patients continue to benefit from the early institution of standard ED treatment. Coverage for atypical organisms improves patient response and outcome. Finally, identification and treatment of the complications of pneumonia and accompanying sepsis must be considered by the ED physician when evaluating critically ill patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: Etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^114BR9op]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia, due to its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is a focus of extensive research. This review highlights new developments in its diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention, as published since April 2002.

Recent findings indicate that the combined goals of improved patient care and conservation of healthcare resources have led to several studies examining professional society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide, or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated, have shown better outcomes, including reduced overall costs, shorter inpatient stays, and lower mortality rates compared to those receiving alternative treatments.

Efforts to identify etiological factors through traditional methods, such as blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned due to poor success rates. Even when positive, these methods are often underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, as well as tests for biologic markers recently identified as contributors or prognosticators of community-acquired pneumonia.

As antibiotic resistance remains a significant challenge in successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining traction. This is achieved through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at-risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia event.

### How is pneumonia diagnosed in clinical stroke research? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163ipLG]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of pneumonia complicating stroke is challenging, and there are currently no consensus diagnostic criteria. As a first step in developing such consensus-based diagnostic criteria, we undertook a systematic review to identify the existing diagnostic approaches to pneumonia in recent clinical stroke research to establish the variation in diagnosis and terminology.

- **Methods**: Studies of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or both, which reported the occurrence of pneumonia from January 2009 to March 2014, were considered. These studies were independently screened for inclusion by two reviewers after multiple searches using electronic databases. The primary analysis aimed to identify existing diagnostic approaches for pneumonia. Secondary analyses explored potential reasons for any heterogeneity where standard criteria for pneumonia had been applied.

- **Results**: Sixty-four studies (56% ischemic stroke, 6% intracerebral hemorrhage, 38% both) of 639,953 patients were included. Six studies (9%) reported no information on the diagnostic approach, whereas 12 (19%) used unspecified clinician-reported diagnosis or initiation of antibiotics. The majority used objective diagnostic criteria: 20 studies (31%) used respiratory or other published standard criteria, while 26 studies (41%) used previously unpublished ad hoc criteria. The overall occurrence of pneumonia was 14.3% (95% confidence interval 13.2%-15.4%; I(2) = 98.9%). Occurrence was highest in studies applying standard criteria (19.1%; 95% confidence interval 15.1%-23.4%; I(2) = 98.5%). The substantial heterogeneity observed was noted in the analysis.

### Clinical scoring tools: which is best to predict clinical response and long-term outcomes [^112Zbyo5]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

During the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), physicians need to assess the severity of the disease and predict likely clinical outcomes of the patient. This information is used to make important clinical decisions, such as the site of care, extent of laboratory work-up, and therapeutic interventions. CAP prediction scores were developed to help physicians define the severity of the disease and likely clinical outcomes for their patients. This article reviews the most relevant clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with CAP and outlines the role of these scores as tools to help physicians predict these outcomes.

### Defining pneumonia in critically ill infants and children [^114tbKrG]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To define pneumonia in critically ill children in the intensive care unit setting, research aims to aid the surveillance of infection and to assist in the design, conduct, and evaluation of clinical trials for the prevention and therapy of lower respiratory tract infections in this population.

- **Design**: Summary of the literature with review and consensus by experts in the field.

- **Results**: A variety of diagnostic criteria from the medical literature, professional societies, and governmental health agencies and regulators were identified. Very few of these diagnostic criteria have been validated for use in children. We propose definitions for definite, possible, and probable pneumonia that build on identified definitions in the literature and use combinations of symptoms, signs, and laboratory criteria. Gaps in knowledge were identified.

- **Conclusions**: Although pneumonia is one of the most common diagnoses in critically ill children, there have been few studies validating diagnostic criteria. Definitions for definite, probable, and possible community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia were achieved by consensus of experts based on guidelines from governmental agencies, professional organizations, and published literature. Future research should determine the utility of these definitions in the critically ill child and adapt them accordingly.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study [^116ejdvQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Children with chronic respiratory symptoms are likely to have a different spectrum of pathological processes. However, if their disease is sufficiently severe to warrant admission and to meet the definition of severe or very severe pneumonia, then acute pneumonia may be a component of their illness. The underlying etiology of this group may be different, and such differences will be drawn out in the analysis on the basis of length of history, but there are no exclusion criteria in PERCH based on the duration of symptoms.

### Systematic review of studies investigating ventilator associated pneumonia diagnostics in intensive care [^111fuXxG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important diagnosis in critical care. VAP research is complicated by the lack of agreed diagnostic criteria and reference standard test criteria. Our aim was to review which reference standard tests are used to evaluate novel index tests for suspected VAP.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search using electronic databases and hand reference checks. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINHAL, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from 2008 until November 2018. All terms related to VAP diagnostics in the intensive treatment unit were used to conduct the search. We adopted a checklist from the critical appraisal skills programme checklist for diagnostic studies to assess the quality of the included studies.

- **Results**: We identified 2441 records, of which 178 were selected for full-text review. Following methodological examination and quality assessment, 44 studies were included in narrative data synthesis. Thirty-two (72.7%) studies utilised a sole microbiological reference standard; the remaining 12 studies utilised a composite reference standard, nine of which included a mandatory microbiological criterion. Histopathological criteria were optional in four studies but mandatory in none.

- **Conclusions**: Nearly all reference standards for VAP used in diagnostic test research required some microbiological confirmation of infection, with BAL culture being the most common reference standard used.

### Clinical and laboratory features distinguishing pandemic H1N1 influenza-related pneumonia from interpandemic community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^113DA74a]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

A diagnostic prediction model was derived from five simple clinical criteria — age ≤ 65 years, presence of bilateral radiographic consolidation, absence of confusion as measured by orientation in time, place, or person, leucocyte count ≤ 12×10⁹/l, and temperature ≥ 38°C. Assigning one point for each clinical criterion present, a score of 4 or 5 gave a positive likelihood ratio of 9.0 for predicting H1N1 influenza-related pneumonia, while a score of 0 or 1 gave a positive likelihood ratio of 75.7 for excluding H1N1 influenza-related pneumonia. Although age is by far the single strongest predictor (OR 19.6), its predictive value is inferior to the proposed model comprising five variables. When age was removed from the proposed model, the remaining four variables — bilateral radiographic consolidation, mental orientation, leucocyte count ≤ 12×10⁹/l, and temperature ≥ 38°C — retained their significance as independent predictors of H1N1 influenza-related pneumonia, attesting to their importance within the model.

This model is applicable at the time of admission when a diagnosis of CAP is determined and would be useful in aiding the early diagnosis of patients with H1N1 influenza-related pneumonia as well as management decisions relating to infection control and the instigation of early empirical antiviral therapy. Although the efficacy of antiviral agents in the treatment of patients hospitalised with influenza-related pneumonia is not scientifically proven, evidence from observational studies in hospital settings suggests that early antiviral use does improve clinical outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations, spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to CRP, ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering obtaining CRP measurement in adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia because the addition of CRP measurement to clinical features, such as fever ≥ 38 °C, pleural pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea, and signs on physical examination (tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia.

### Clinical performance of existing diagnostic criteria for pneumonia in older emergency patients: A prospective cohort study [^114Z96rf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). High credibility.

Pneumonia accounts for over half a million older adult emergency department (ED) visits annually, but ED pneumonia diagnosis is often inaccurate. Although geriatric-specific pneumonia diagnostic criteria exist for other settings, no prospective data have been available to determine if their application in the older adult ED population is feasible. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the utility of four diagnostic criteria (Loeb, Modified McGeer, Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society, American College of Emergency Physicians) in older adult ED patients.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational cohort study conducted with older adult ED patients aged 65 years and above in two U.S. EDs. The patients had suspected pneumonia, indicated by ordered chest radiography and the treating physician's suspicion. The standard for defining the presence, absence, or inability to determine a diagnosis of pneumonia was expert physician chart adjudication. The study reports summary statistics for demographic characteristics, symptoms/exam findings, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the existing diagnostic criteria. Pre-specified cutoff values of a positive likelihood ratio (LR) > 10 and a negative LR < 0.3 were used; however, all confidence intervals and diagnostic performance measures are reported.

### An evaluation of clinical stability criteria to predict hospital course in community-acquired pneumonia [^112X81vp]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

A number of different methods exist to assess clinical stability, a key component of pneumonia management. We compared the prognostic value of different stability criteria through a secondary analysis of the Edinburgh pneumonia study database. We studied four clinical stability criteria: Halm's criteria, the ATS criteria, CURB, and a 50% or more decrease in C-reactive protein from baseline. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support (MV/VS), development of complicated pneumonia, and a combined outcome of the above.

A total of 1079 patients (49.8% male), with a median age of 68 years (IQR 53–80), were included. Ninety-three patients (8.6%) died by day 30, 91 patients (8.4%) required MV/VS, and 99 patients (9.2%) developed a complicated pneumonia. Patients with increasing severity of pneumonia on admission, assessed by both CURB-65 and PSI, took a progressively longer time to achieve clinical stability assessed by any method (p < 0.001 for all criteria).

Halm's criteria had the highest area under the curve (AUC) for prediction of 30-day mortality (AUC 0.95 (0.94–0.96)), need for MV/VS (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.97)), and combined adverse outcome (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.97)). C-reactive protein had the highest area under the curve for complicated pneumonia (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.97)). Adding C-reactive protein to Halm's criteria increased the area under the curve, but the difference was only statistically significant for complicated pneumonia.

All of the criteria performed well in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with pneumonia.

### Imaging of pneumonia: trends and algorithms [^113jAnfD]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the major infectious diseases responsible for significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Imaging plays a crucial role in the detection and management of patients with pneumonia. This review article discusses the different imaging methods used in the diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections. The imaging examination should always begin with conventional radiography. When the results of routine radiography are inconclusive, computed tomography is mandatory. A combination of pattern recognition and knowledge of the clinical setting is the best approach to understanding pulmonary infectious processes. A specific pattern of involvement can suggest a likely diagnosis in many instances.

In acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients, diffuse ground-glass and interstitial infiltrates are most commonly present in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. In contrast, in non-immunosuppressed patients, a segmental lobar infiltrate is suggestive of bacterial pneumonia. Round pneumonia is more often encountered in children than adults and is most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different combinations of parenchymal and pleural abnormalities may be suggestive of additional diagnoses. When an infectious pulmonary process is suspected, knowledge of the varied radiographic manifestations will narrow the differential diagnosis, helping to direct additional diagnostic measures and serving as an ideal tool for follow-up examinations.

### Validation and clinical implications of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116PbZrw]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

The 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines defined severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and recommended intensive care unit (ICU) admission when patients fulfilled three out of nine minor criteria. These criteria have not been validated.

- **Methods**: All patients admitted to our hospital from 2004 to 2007 for CAP were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who fulfilled any IDSA/ATS major criteria for severe CAP at the emergency department (i.e. the need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors) were excluded. The predictive characteristics of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria were compared with those of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB-65 score for hospital mortality and ICU admission.

- **Results**: 1242 patients were studied (mean age 65.7 years, hospital mortality 14.7%). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the IDSA/ATS minor criteria were 0.88 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.91) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.88) for predicting hospital mortality and ICU admission, respectively. These were greater than the corresponding areas for the PSI and the CURB-65 score (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the minor criteria were 81.4%, 82.9%, 45.2%, and 96.3%, respectively, for hospital mortality and 58.3%, 90.6%, 52.9%, and 92.3%, respectively, for ICU admission. The minor criteria were more specific than the PSI and more sensitive than the CURB-65 score for both outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: These findings support the use of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria to predict hospital mortality and ICU admission more accurately than the PSI and CURB-65 score.

### The enduring challenge of determining pneumonia etiology in children: Considerations for future research priorities [^113A6xvm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pneumonia kills more children each year worldwide than any other disease. Nonetheless, accurately determining the causes of childhood pneumonia has remained elusive. Over the past century, the focus of pneumonia etiology research has shifted from studies of lung aspirates and postmortem specimens intent on identifying pneumococcal disease to studies of multiple specimen types distant from the lung that are tested for multiple pathogens.

Some major challenges facing modern pneumonia etiology studies include the use of nonspecific and variable case definitions, poor access to pathologic lung tissue and to specimens from fatal cases, poor diagnostic accuracy of assays (especially when testing nonpulmonary specimens), and the interpretation of results when multiple pathogens are detected in a given individual. The future of childhood pneumonia etiology research will likely require integrating data from complementary approaches, including applications of advanced molecular diagnostics and vaccine probe studies, as well as a renewed emphasis on lung aspirates from radiologically confirmed pneumonia and postmortem examinations.

### Optimizing diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department [^111feA8k]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). High credibility.

Pneumonia is divided into three diagnostic categories: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), health care-associated pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. This classification scheme is determined not only by the location of infection onset but also by the predominant associated causal microorganisms. Pneumonia is diagnosed in over 1.5 million US emergency department visits annually (1.2% of all visits), and most pneumonia diagnosed by emergency physicians is CAP.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^1124GHuj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent disease mainly affecting older and multimorbid patients. Symptoms and signs lack sensitivity and specificity, and chest X-ray has poor accuracy. Hence, an initial diagnosis of pneumonia has limited predictive value for the presence of pneumonia. Overdiagnosis of pneumonia leads to inappropriate antibiotic use and may delay the appropriate management of mimicking diseases. Alternative imaging strategies, including computed tomography (CT) scans or lung ultrasonography, may improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. We review the recent evidence and perspectives regarding their contribution to the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected pneumonia.

- **Recent findings**: Two studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CT scans in emergency department or hospitalized patients suspected of pneumonia. CT scans led to a net reclassification improvement of 8% and 18% of patients. They were particularly helpful to rule out the diagnosis, allowing a reduction in the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.

- **Summary**: CT scans reduce overdiagnosis of pneumonia and allow better identification of alternative diagnoses. The impact on clinical outcomes of a strategy incorporating CT scans for patients suspected of pneumonia should be evaluated, along with its cost-effectiveness.

### A comparison of diagnostic algorithms and clinical parameters to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia: A prospective observational study [^116ZmFaR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains a considerable source of morbidity and mortality in modern ICUs. The optimal diagnostic method remains unclear. Using HELICS criteria as the reference standard, CPIS displayed substantial diagnostic agreement, whereas CDC/NHSN and Johanson criteria displayed slight and moderate agreement, respectively. Accuracy was improved with the addition of serum procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/ml, but not positive quantitative endotracheal aspirate culture. These findings suggest that combining cohorts based on HELICS and CPIS may be reasonable for meta-analysis or population studies, but the same may not be true for studies based on CDC/NHSN criteria.

### Atypical pneumonia — time to breathe new life into a useful term [^115GqbRu]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens or to a distinct clinical syndrome, the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation, epidemiology, or both.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study [^112VVcKL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

During the 1980s, pediatricians and public health physicians recognized the need to define, in terms easily memorable to primary healthcare workers (HCWs), the clinical features that justified antibiotic use in children with potential pneumonia. A series of studies was undertaken in developing countries to examine the sensitivity and specificity of clinical symptoms and signs of pneumonia. These included a history of cough or breathlessness, inability to feed, raised respiratory rate, lower chest wall indrawing, fever, and tachycardia. In 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed the available evidence and produced a guideline that has been the foundation of pneumonia detection in developing countries ever since.

- **Studies of childhood pneumonia contributing to the formulation of the World Health Organization Clinical Case Definition**: The WHO algorithm is applied to children who present with cough or difficulty breathing. These were introduced as "signs", suggesting that they are observed by HCWs, although in practice they are more commonly elicited as part of the clinical history from the parent. Fever was considered as a screening sign, but it lacked both sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia.

Once captured by the entry definition, the rest of the algorithm is based around three management decisions:

1. Children with pneumonia are treated with antibiotics.
2. Those with severe pneumonia are referred to the hospital.
3. Those with very severe pneumonia are treated with oxygen therapy.

### A prospective comparison of severity scores for identifying patients with severe community acquired pneumonia: Reconsidering what is meant by severe pneumonia [^114suToT]. Thorax (2006). High credibility.

Several severity scores have been proposed to predict patient outcomes and guide the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Most have been derived as predictors of mortality. A study was undertaken to compare the predictive value of these tools using different clinically meaningful outcomes as constructs for "severe pneumonia".

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study was performed involving all patients presenting to the emergency department with an admission diagnosis of CAP from March 2003 to March 2004. Clinical and laboratory features at presentation were used to calculate severity scores using the pneumonia severity index (PSI), the revised American Thoracic Society score (rATS), and the British Thoracic Society (BTS) severity scores CURB, modified BTS severity score, and CURB-65. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were compared for four different outcomes: death, need for ICU admission, and combined outcomes of death and/or need for ventilatory or inotropic support.

- **Results**: 392 patients were included in the analysis; 37 (9.4%) died, and 26 (6.6%) required ventilatory and/or inotropic support. The modified BTS severity score performed best for all four outcomes. The PSI (classes IV+V) and CURB had very similar performance as predictive tools for each outcome. The rATS identified the need for ICU admission well but not mortality. The CURB-65 score predicted mortality well but performed less well when the requirement for ICU was included in the outcome of interest.

### Infectious diseases society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115TUqhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "2007 IDSA/ATS criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia" serves as a tool for identifying and stratifying patients with severe manifestations of community-acquired pneumonia. It assists in making decisions regarding hospitalization and intensive care unit admission, ultimately optimizing patient management and resource allocation.

- **Criteria categories**: The criteria are divided into two categories: minor and major.
	- **Minor criteria**: These include a respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, an arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion or disorientation, uremia (blood urea nitrogen greater than 20 mg/dL), leukopenia (white blood cell count less than 4,000/mL due to infection alone), thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mL), hypothermia (core temperature less than 36.8 degrees C), and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.
	- **Major criteria**: These involve septic shock requiring vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The severity of community-acquired pneumonia is determined by the cumulative score of these criteria. A patient is considered to have severe community-acquired pneumonia if the score is 3 or more. If the score is less than 3, the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia are not met. This scoring system facilitates standardized assessments.

### Diagnosis of stroke-associated pneumonia: Recommendations from the Pneumonia in Stroke Consensus Group [^113uvWiD]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infections frequently complicate stroke and adversely affect the outcome. There is currently no agreed terminology or gold-standard diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of lower respiratory tract infections complicating stroke, which has implications for clinical practice and research. The aim of this consensus was to propose standardized terminology and operational diagnostic criteria for lower respiratory tract infections complicating acute stroke.

- **Methods**: Systematic literature searches of multiple electronic databases were undertaken. An evidence review and two rounds of consensus consultation were completed before a final consensus meeting in September 2014, held in Manchester, United Kingdom. Consensus was defined a priori as ≥ 75% agreement between the consensus group members.

- **Results**: Consensus was reached for the following:
	1. Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is the recommended terminology for the spectrum of lower respiratory tract infections within the first seven days after stroke onset.
	2. Modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria are proposed for SAP:
		- **Probable SAP**: CDC criteria met, but typical chest x-ray changes are absent even after repeat or serial chest x-rays.
		- **Definite SAP**: CDC criteria met, including typical chest x-ray changes.
	3. There is limited evidence for a diagnostic role of white blood cell count or C-reactive protein in SAP.
	4. There is insufficient evidence for the use of other biomarkers (e.g. procalcitonin).

### Predicting the microbial cause of community-acquired pneumonia: Can physicians or a data-driven method differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia at patient presentation [^114sMGrf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires urgent and specific antimicrobial therapy; however, the causal pathogen is typically unknown at the point when anti-infective therapeutics must be initiated. Physicians synthesize information from diverse data streams to make appropriate decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at finding complex relationships in large volumes of data. We aimed to evaluate the abilities of experienced physicians and AI to answer this question at patient admission: Is it viral or bacterial pneumonia?

- **Methods**: We included patients hospitalized for CAP and recorded all data available in the first 3-hour period of care, incorporating clinical, biological, and radiological information. For this proof-of-concept investigation, we studied only CAP caused by a singular and identified pathogen. We built a machine learning model prediction using all collected data. Finally, an independent validation set of samples was used to test the pathogen prediction performance of: (i) a panel of three experts and (ii) the AI algorithm. Both were blinded regarding the final microbial diagnosis. Positive likelihood ratio (LR) values > 10 and negative LR values < 0.1 were considered clinically relevant.

- **Results**: We included 153 patients with CAP (70.6% men; median age 62 [51–73] years; mean SAPSII, 37 [27–47]). Among them, 37% had viral pneumonia, 24% had bacterial pneumonia, 20% had a co-infection, and 19% had no identified respiratory pathogen. We performed the analysis on 93 patients, as co-pathogen and no-pathogen cases were excluded. The discriminant abilities of the AI ap

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the guideline recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors, including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

- **Summary**: The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations, as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines, both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Validating hospital admission criteria for decision support in pneumonia [^1169epR2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Severity assessment tools and recommended hospital admission criteria for patients with pneumonia accurately identify patients at low risk for 30-day mortality. Notably, SCAP criteria are more accurate for identifying patients requiring ICU admission. However, their ability to predict other outcomes relevant to the admission decision, such as failure of outpatient therapy and subsequent hospitalization, has not been tested. Except for eCURB, the criteria were developed using only populations of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Despite recommendations and availability, utilization of severity assessment tools has lagged behind the use of other guideline elements due to the difficulty in calculating scores at the bedside, as well as environmental features that influence the admission decision. The ideal hospital admission criteria for electronic decision support would have the ability to extract information from the electronic health record to identify patients not only with low mortality risk but also those at risk of failure of outpatient therapy, measured by subsequent hospitalization or death.

We previously derived hospital admission criteria for an electronic decision support tool using a database of CAP patients from a single hospital. It recommends admission for patients with any of the following:

1. eCURB 30-day mortality risk estimate of ≥ 5%
2. ≥ 3 minor IDSA/ATS SCAP criteria
3. A PaO2:FiO2 ratio < 280 mmHg

To validate these criteria and estimate their effects on hospitalization and outpatient failure, further evaluation is necessary.

### Analysis of diagnostic criteria for ECMO-associated pneumonia [^112G9SmN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality. VAP research and National Health Safety Network (NHSN) definitions exclude patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). As the use of ECMO grows, we must recognize and prevent pneumonia in this population. A meta-analysis reported ECMO-associated pneumonia occurred in 24.4 cases per 1000 ECMO days, and smaller studies report an incidence of 55–74% in ECMO patients. Without an agreed-upon definition, many studies used diagnostic criteria for VAP to approximate pneumonia in ECMO.

Traditional diagnostic criteria for VAP may be unreliable in ECMO patients. They ignore important ECMO parameters: flow and sweep. During ECMO, blood is removed from the body, oxygenated, and ventilated, then returned to the patient. To improve oxygenation, ECMO flow is increased. To improve ventilation, ECMO sweep is increased. Changes in these are important indicators of oxygenation and ventilation. Additionally, there is movement towards early weaning from mechanical ventilation for patients on ECMO, making diagnostic criteria for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP), such as FiO2 and PEEP values, obsolete. Traditional signs of infection may be unreliable, as the extracorporeal circulation can mask fever and confound systemic inflammatory markers. Finally, chest radiography, incorporated in some definitions, may be subjective and limited in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chest trauma requiring VV ECMO.

We must consider new diagnostic criteria for ECMO-associated pneumonia to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

### Emergency medicine evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia: History, examination, imaging and laboratory assessment, and risk scores [^1152giuB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is a common infection, accounting for approximately one million hospitalizations in the United States annually. This potentially life-threatening disease is commonly diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and chest radiograph.

- **Objective**: To investigate emergency medicine evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia including history, physical examination, imaging, and the use of risk scores in patient assessment.

- **Discussion**: Pneumonia is the number one cause of death from infectious disease. The condition is broken into several categories, the most common being community-acquired pneumonia. Diagnosis centers on history, physical examination, and chest radiograph; however, all are unreliable when used alone, and misdiagnosis occurs in up to one-third of patients. Chest radiograph has a sensitivity of 46–77%, and biomarkers including white blood cell count, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein provide little benefit in diagnosis. Biomarkers may assist admitting teams but require further study for use in the emergency department. Ultrasound has shown utility in correctly identifying pneumonia. Clinical gestalt demonstrates greater ability to diagnose pneumonia. Clinical scores, including Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI); Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, age 65 score (CURB-65); and several others may be helpful for disposition but should supplement, not replace, clinical judgment. Patient socioeconomic status must be considered in disposition decisions.

- **Conclusion**: The diagnosis of pneumonia requires clinical judgment and a comprehensive evaluation approach.

### Decoding community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review and analysis of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical trials [^111uqdQZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening condition. Although the disease is common, evidence on CAP management is often of variable quality, which may be reinforced by the lack of a systematic and homogeneous way of defining the disease in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Objectives**: This study aims to assess the diagnostic criteria and definitions of the term 'community-acquired' used in RCTs on CAP management.

- **Data sources**: Based on the protocol (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), we conducted a systematic search of Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs published or registered between 2010 and 2024.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Study eligibility criteria included completed and ongoing RCTs.

- **Participants**: Participants included adults hospitalized with CAP.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: Data were collected using a tested extraction sheet, as endorsed by the Cochrane Collaboration. After cross-checking, data were synthesized in a narrative and tabular form.

- **Results**: In total, 7173 records were identified through our searches. After removing records that did not fulfill the eligibility criteria, 170 studies were included. Diagnostic criteria were provided in 69.4% of studies, and the term 'community-acquired' was defined in 55.3% of studies. The most frequently included diagnostic criteria were pulmonary infiltrates (94.1%), cough (78.8%), fever (77.1%), dyspnea (62.7%), sputum (57.6%), auscultation/percussion abnormalities (55.9%), and chest pain/discomfort (52.5%).

### Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1147mckn]. Microbes and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia remains a controversial area. The use of standard clinical criteria has been found to be inadequate. Implementing a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) has improved the diagnostic utility of clinical criteria. For the intubated patient, there is ready access to the lower respiratory tract. Samples, including endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and protected brush specimens, can be obtained. The latter two can be collected blindly or via a bronchoscope. The culture results are more meaningful if reported in a semi-quantitative model. There is increasing evidence that culture results predict mortality and can be used to direct the duration and type of therapy.

### The occurrence of pneumonia diagnosis among neurosurgical patients: The definition matters [^1121XXRM]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of pneumonia in the hospital setting is a challenge due to the absence of a generally accepted pneumonia definition.

- **Methods**: We prospectively evaluated six different clinical criteria for diagnosing pneumonia. The physician's diagnosis (A) was compared to common methods, i.e. the general surveillance method (B), consensus clinical criteria (C), and three other criteria (D, E, and F) among 390 neurosurgical patients treated in either the intensive care unit or the neurosurgical ward in a university hospital.

- **Results**: The frequencies of pneumonia cases were: group A, 66 (16.9%); group B, 41 (10.1%); and group C, 55 (14.1%). Only 28 pneumonia cases were identified by all three criteria. The kappa values were: between A and B, 0.42 (95% confidence interval, CI; 0.27–0.57); between A and C, 0.49 (95% CI; 0.35–0.63); and between B and C, 0.68 (95% CI; 0.55–0.80). In group A, there were 34 false positive cases according to criterion B and 25 according to criterion C. Pneumonia cases were identified according to criterion D in 13 (3.3%), E in 35 (9.0%), and F in 51 (13.1%) cases, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: There was great variability in the presence of pneumonia among neurosurgical patients, depending on the criteria used. Our results support the idea that a more exact method for pneumonia diagnosis should be implemented to obtain more results that are reliable in this important infection of hospitalized patients, which is also used for benchmarking purposes. Furthermore, it seems important to treat all clinically suspected pneumonia cases whether or not the surveillance criteria confirm the diagnosis.

- **Methods**: Data were collected from clinical information and physical examinations of 1,057 patients visiting the emergency department of a hospital. This data was used to derive a clinical prediction rule, which was subsequently validated in two different populations: 719 patients from the same center and 1,121 patients from four other hospitals.

- **Measurements and main results**: In the multivariate analyses, eight independent predictive factors were correlated with severe community-acquired pneumonia: arterial pH < 7.35, respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, altered mental status, blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dl, oxygen arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg, age ≥ 80 years, and multilobar/bilateral lung affectation. From the beta parameter obtained in the multivariate model, a score was assigned to each predictive variable. The model shows an area under the curve of 0.92. This rule proved better at identifying patients evolving toward severe community-acquired pneumonia than either the modified American Thoracic Society rule, the British Thoracic Society's CURB-65, or the Pneumonia Severity Index.

- **Conclusions**: A simple score using clinical data available at the time of the emergency department visit effectively identifies patients at risk for severe community-acquired pneumonia.

### Validation of the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society criteria to predict severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [^115hZUp8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is usually defined as pneumonia that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission; the primary pathogen responsible for ICU admission is Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this study, the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) consensus criteria for ICU admission were compared with other severity scores in predicting ICU admission and mortality.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively studied 158 patients with pneumococcal CAP (1999–2003). Clinical and laboratory features at the emergency department were recorded and used to calculate the 2007 IDSA/ATS rule, the 2001 ATS rule, 2 modified 2007 IDSA/ATS rules, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), and the CURB (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure) score. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed for the various indices. We also determined the criteria that were independently predictive of ICU admission and of mortality in our population.

- **Results**: The 2007 IDSA/ATS criteria performed as well as the 2001 ATS rule in predicting ICU admission; both demonstrated high sensitivity (90%) and NPV (97%). For the prediction of mortality, the best tool proved to be the PSI score (sensitivity, 95%; NPV, 99%). The variables associated with ICU admission in this patient population included tachypnea, confusion, Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio of 250 or lower, and hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation. Mechanical ventilation and PSI class V were independently associated with mortality.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: A systematic review [^1136cufe]. Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Pneumonia was defined variably across the individual trials included in the review. Some trials required radiologic criteria such as chest radiograph findings for diagnosis, while others relied on clinical criteria. Nonhospital trials typically used the WHO clinical criteria of fast breathing pneumonia, characterized by isolated tachypnea (over 60 breaths per minute) without other clinical signs in infants aged 7 to 59 days.

- **Interventions**: The review included publications that evaluated any antibiotic regimen for treating pneumonia in young infants and those that assessed antibiotic regimens as part of a package of interventions. Studies were excluded if they only enrolled infants treated prophylactically or based on risk factors without clinical evidence of pneumonia. Exclusions also applied to studies evaluating antiviral, antifungal, or antimalarial interventions. WHO-recommended antibiotic regimens are defined in Table 1.

- **Comparator**: Included studies featured a comparator group, which could have been the standard of care, an alternate antibiotic regimen, a placebo, or an alternate management strategy such as referral or observation.

- **Outcomes**: Critical outcomes were: (1) mortality (all-cause or infection-specific), (2) clinical improvement or deterioration, (3) neurodevelopmental outcomes, and (4) adverse antibiotic effects. Secondary outcomes included (a) hospital utilization (e.g. length of stay or readmission), (b) relapse, and (c) cost-effectiveness. The review preferentially reported the latest available time points for these outcomes.

### A comparison of diagnostic algorithms and clinical parameters to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia: A prospective observational study [^113GfQUy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Suspicion and clinical criteria continue to serve as the foundation for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) diagnosis; however, the criteria used to diagnose VAP vary widely. Data from head-to-head comparisons of clinical diagnostic algorithms is lacking. Thus, a prospective observational study was performed to determine the performance characteristics of the Johanson criteria, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC/NHSN) criteria compared to the Hospital in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS) reference standard.

- **Methods**: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in three mixed medical-surgical ICUs at one academic medical center from October 1, 2016, to April 30, 2018. VAP diagnostic criteria were applied to each patient, including CDC/NHSN, CPIS, HELICS, and Johanson criteria. Tracheal aspirate cultures (TAC) and serum procalcitonin values were obtained for each patient.

- **Results**: Eighty-five patients were enrolled (VAP 45, controls 40). Using HELICS as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity for each of the assessed diagnostic algorithms were as follows: CDC/NHSN (sensitivity 54.2%, specificity 100%), CPIS (sensitivity 68.75%, specificity 95.23%), and Johanson (sensitivity 67.69%, specificity 95%). The positive TAC rate was 81.2%. The sensitivity for positive TAC with the serum procalcitonin level > 0.5 ng/ml was 51.8%.

- **Conclusion**: VAP remains a considerable source of morbidity and mortality in modern intensive care units.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: Validation of the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines to predict an intensive care unit admission [^115JBYPp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The recent Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults defined a predictive rule to identify patients with severe CAP to determine the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We clinically validated this rule.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 2102 episodes of CAP in consecutively hospitalized patients over a 7-year period. The predictive rule consists of at least 1 of 2 major severity criteria (septic shock and invasive mechanical ventilation) or at least 3 of 9 minor severity criteria. We assessed the association of the predictive rule with ICU admission and mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 235 episodes of CAP (11%) occurred in patients who were admitted to the ICU, whereas the predictive rule identified 397 (19%) of 2102 episodes as severe CAP. The predictive rule and the decision for ICU admission agreed in 1804 (86%) of the episodes (kappa coefficient, 0.45), with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 88%, similar to the 2001 American Thoracic Society guidelines (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 90%) in predicting ICU admission. Severe CAP criteria had higher sensitivity (58% vs. 46%) and similar specificity (88% vs. 90%), compared with the 2001 American Thoracic Society guidelines in predicting hospital mortality. Invasive mechanical ventilation was the main determinant for ICU admission, followed by septic shock. In the absence of major criteria, ICU admission was not related to survival of patients with minor severity criteria.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children: The challenges of microbiological diagnosis [^114tD4C9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years of age globally. To improve the management of CAP, it is essential to distinguish CAP from other common pediatric conditions and develop better diagnostic methods to detect the causative organism. This will enable the best allocation of appropriate resources in both industrialized and developing countries.

Here, we review the diagnostic modalities available for identifying viruses and bacteria in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of children, with a discussion of their utility and limitations in diagnosing CAP in children.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^116uZDSe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent disease mainly affecting older and multimorbid patients. Symptoms and signs lack sensitivity and specificity, while chest X-rays have poor accuracy. Hence, an initial diagnosis of pneumonia has limited predictive value for the presence of pneumonia. Overdiagnosis of pneumonia leads to inappropriate antibiotic use and may delay the appropriate management of mimicking diseases. Alternative imaging strategies, including computed tomography (CT) scans or lung ultrasonography, may improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. We review the recent evidence and perspectives regarding their contribution to the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected pneumonia.

Recent findings indicate that two studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CT scans in emergency department or hospitalized patients suspected of having pneumonia. CT scans led to a net reclassification improvement of 8% and 18% of patients and were particularly helpful in ruling out the diagnosis, allowing a reduction in the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.

CT scans reduce overdiagnosis of pneumonia and enable better identification of alternative diagnoses. The impact on clinical outcomes of a strategy incorporating CT scans for patients suspected of pneumonia should be evaluated, along with its cost-effectiveness.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study [^116y1Fjb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that pneumonia is the most common cause of serious illness and death in young children worldwide, our ability as clinicians to infer an infectious pathological process in the lung from specific features of the history and examination is poor. Many common conditions of childhood, including malaria, bacterial sepsis, and severe anemia, produce a spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs that overlaps significantly with pneumonia, and differentiating between these conditions is challenging.

In adults, the definition of pneumonia relies heavily on characteristic changes on the chest radiograph. However, many children who have suggestive clinical signs of pneumonia and who respond to appropriate antibiotics do not have any abnormalities on the chest radiograph taken at the onset of the illness; furthermore, radiological facilities are not always available in developing countries. In short, there is no single definition of pneumonia in childhood that is sensitive, specific, and can be widely implemented.

This article describes the clinical features and classifications available to define pneumonia in children and reports the rationale for the definition adopted by the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study and the process by which that definition was developed and standardized across the seven PERCH sites.

### Inappropriate diagnosis of pneumonia among hospitalized adults [^116MhPJ3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This cohort study has important clinical and policy implications. Because hospitalizations for CAP are common, inappropriate diagnoses of CAP are also common. The risks of inappropriate diagnosis are not uniform across populations — already highly vulnerable groups are at the highest risk of inappropriate diagnosis. These same vulnerable populations are also most likely to be affected by antibiotic-associated adverse events and resulting morbidity. Thus, balancing the harms of underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of CAP remains essential.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience. They applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

- **Results**: The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Severity assessment criteria recommended by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and older patients. Should SOAR (systolic blood pressure, oxygenation, age and respiratory rate) criteria be used in older people? A compilation study of two prospective cohorts [^115sWz5d]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of the British Thoracic Society guidelines for severity assessment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in predicting mortality and to explore alternative criteria which could be more useful in older patients. This was done through a compilation study of two prospective observational cohorts.

The study was set in a university hospital in Norfolk, UK, with a catchment population of 568,000. The participants consisted of 195 patients, with a median age of 77 years, who were included in two prospective studies of CAP. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality occurring within the 6-week follow-up.

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the study outcomes using CURB and CURB-65 were assessed in 189 patients, while CRB-65 was assessed in 192 patients out of a total of 195 patients. The results were comparable with the original study by Lim et al. Although CURB-65 and CRB-65 included age criteria, they did not materially improve the specificity in predicting high-risk patients in both studies. It was found that oxygenation measured by ventilation-perfusion mismatch (PaO2:FiO2) was the best predictor of outcome in this slightly older cohort (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99 [0.98–0.99], P = 0.0001).

A new set of criteria, SOAR (systolic blood pressure, oxygenation, age, and respiratory rate), was derived based on the findings. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 81.0% (58.1–94.6), 59.3% (49.6–68.4), 27.0% (16.6–39.7), and 94.4% (86.2–98.4), respectively, confirming their comparability with existing criteria.

### The enduring challenge of determining pneumonia etiology in children: Considerations for future research priorities [^116pCHV7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

**Challenges in pneumonia etiology studies**: Unlike case definitions for acute gastroenteritis and febrile illness that are based on the presence of a specific symptom (e.g. diarrhea) or sign (e.g. fever), case definitions for pneumonia define a syndrome that is irreducible to a single, or even a constellation of, signs and/or symptoms. As already mentioned, WHO created a standardized clinical case management definition for children with suspected pneumonia in the 1980s, placing a priority on sensitivity rather than the specificity achieved in earlier radiologically based definitions. Throughout this article, we refer to the sensitivity of a case definition (or test) as the percentage of all children with pneumonia who are identified. On the other hand, specificity refers to the percentage of all children without pneumonia who do not meet a case definition (or did not have a positive test result). High sensitivity usually comes at the expense of misdiagnosing some children without pneumonia as having pneumonia (false positives); high specificity usually comes at the expense of missing some children who have pneumonia (false negatives). Although the WHO's sensitive case definition was developed to maximize the likelihood that children with pneumonia would be treated with antibiotics in peripheral health facilities that lack radiologic capacity, it has been co-opted for use in many pneumonia etiology and disease burden studies. Using the WHO case management definitions results in misclassification, an acceptable consequence in the…
